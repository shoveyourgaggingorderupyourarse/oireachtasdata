The board&rsquo;s original primary functions were to arrange with potential service providers for the provision of hospital in-patient treatment to patients who were a long time on public hospital waiting lists, and to collect, collate and validate information on persons waiting for inpatient treatment in public hospitals.<\/p><p>The board's functions were extended in 2009, when it was given responsibility for negotiating and agreeing pricing arrangements with private and voluntary nursing homes under the nursing homes support scheme, and extended again in 2012, when it was tasked with the collation and publication of information about outpatient waiting lists. <\/p><p> As is evident from the diagram, which can now be brought on screen, expenditure by the board has fluctuated significantly in recent years, mainly reflecting the level of resources made available to the board to purchase treatment for waiting list patients.  The funding is provided in the form of a grant from the health Vote. <\/p><p> The board's overall expenditure in 2018 was &euro;53.4 million.  This comprised: payments to private hospitals totalling &euro;31.4 million; payments to public hospitals of &euro;17.4 million; and administration expenses of &euro;4.6 million, covering all other functions.  The board reported a surplus of &euro;1.6 million in 2018, bringing the accumulated surplus to &euro;7.6 million.  At the end of the year, the board had cash balances of &euro;23.3 million.  Much of this was required to meet accrued expenses of &euro;15.5 million in respect of treatments delivered to patients before the end of 2018 but not yet invoiced for collection by the treating hospitals. <\/p><p> The legislation provides for the Minister for Health to direct the format of the board's financial statements.  As with a number of other health sector bodies, the Minister has directed that the statements should comply with generally accepted accounting practice, except in relation to pension liabilities.  As a result of the direction, the board accounts for staff pensions as the payments arise instead of recognising the liabilities when they are incurred.  In the circumstances, I am obliged by international auditing standards to give a qualified audit opinion.  However, it is important to note that this qualification is only in relation to pensions accounting.  In all other respects, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the board's transactions. <\/p><p> Turning now to Special Report No. 110.  As mentioned previously, the board's role under the nursing homes support scheme is to manage the process for negotiation of weekly charge rates for care, and to enter into pricing agreements with the private and voluntary nursing homes.  It is worth noting that the board is not itself involved in financial transactions with the nursing homes. <\/p><p> Each agreement is with an individual nursing home and is applicable for a specified period, which varies from home to home.  For example, the average agreed duration of agreements put in place in 2017 was around two and a half years.  Although the negotiation is for a maximum weekly charge rate, the reality is that the agreed rate is standard for all residents supported by the scheme. <\/p><p> In 2018, the agreed weekly charge rate for private and voluntary nursing homes ranged from &euro;765 to &euro;1,325.  The average weekly charge rate was &euro;968, which is equivalent to over &euro;50,000 a year.  The HSE paid an average of around two thirds of the weekly cost, with the residents paying around one third.  In addition, residents incurred charges for supplementary goods and services provided by, or facilitated by, the nursing homes. <\/p><p> When the nursing homes support scheme commenced in 2009, the board offered each nursing home the average weekly price it had been charging on the open market.  This was a short-term measure to prevent delays in commencement or capacity shortfalls but, in many cases, the initial prices have influenced subsequent negotiations.  Prior to commencing negotiations, the board's negotiators review certain financial information provided by a nursing home.  This typically includes the home's occupancy rate, weekly unit cost, annual turnover, profit and any finance costs. <\/p><p> The board has stated that it also considers criteria such as: the costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money; the price previously charged by the nursing home; and the local market price.  It also takes account of any budgetary constraints on the scheme, along with the obligation of the State to use resources responsibly.  While the average dependency levels of a nursing home's residents is not formally a criterion in the negotiation, the board informed us that the general dependency level does form part of the discussions during the price negotiation.  However, we found that the board does not have a model that explains how these various criteria are weighed and combined, making it unclear as to how a final charge rate is arrived at for an individual home.<\/p><p> The examination found that the board did not have internal written procedures or a guidance manual for its negotiators, relying instead on on-the-job training.  Examination of a sample of files found an absence of documentary evidence of the items discussed in some negotiations.  It is important that the board maintains adequate records to enable evaluation of the key decisions made during a negotiation. <\/p><p> The negotiation process does not always result in an agreement.  In this event, the board advises the nursing home of the proposed final offer in writing and that a review process is available.  Where required, the CEO of the NTPF carries out these reviews.  We found that since 2014, the CEO had completed an average of just two such reviews per year. <\/p><p> Pending the outcome of a review, the NTPF may offer the nursing home an extension to the deed of agreement at the current price for a period of up to three months, which may be repeated where the negotiation becomes protracted.  The examination found that the board does not generate management information on the factors giving rise to protracted negotiations, or the number or frequency of contract extensions granted in these circumstances. <\/p><p> Finally, following a recommendation of a Department of Health review of the scheme in 2015, the board commissioned an independent review of the charge rate negotiation system.  The review report was presented to the Minister in May 2019 but has not yet been published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020101500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602757800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Sloyan, on behalf of the NTPF, to make his opening statement.

We welcome the opportunity to discuss the report by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the nursing homes support scheme and the NTPF's annual financial statements for 2018.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the nursing homes support scheme, I would begin by noting that the NTPF has been given a very specific function in respect of the scheme as set out in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.  Under the Act, the NTPF has been designated, by the Minister for Health, as the body authorised to negotiate with proprietors of registered nursing homes to reach agreement on the maximum price that will be charged for the provision of long-term residential care services to fair deal residents. <\/p> <p>  It is important to note that the NTPF's function is to negotiate and reach agreement rather than procure or determine a price.  The nature of negotiation, therefore, has to be considered.  For example, negotiation cannot be bound by pre-determined or descriptive models as to do so would be to ignore the statutory mandate to negotiate.  Negotiation also requires that the NTPF recognises the importance of confidentiality and commercial sensitivity in getting value for money for the State, on the one hand, and respecting the right to privacy of each individual nursing home, on the other hand. <\/p> <p>  As members will have read in our more detailed submission, the NTPF negotiates in accordance with four published criteria, as referred to by Mr. McCarthy.  In order to do that we consider submissions from nursing homes in respect of these criteria and the views of the nursing home in respect of the focus that should be applied to each criterion in negotiations. <\/p> <p>  The NTPF has conducted these negotiations each year since the introduction of the scheme in 2009.  Looking particularly at the past five years, the average rate agreed with nursing homes has increased by around 2.5% per annum.  At the same time the number of nursing home beds has increased annually by around 600 beds as nursing homes expand or as new nursing home providers continue to enter the sector.  Currently, there are 437 nursing homes, with 25,452 beds, that have agreements with the NTPF. <\/p> <p>  As an organisation, we thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his report and note the professionalism of his team in carrying out the review.  As always, the comptroller's work has provided a useful input and advice, which we are more than happy to action.  Specifically, the report contains two recommendations for the NTPF.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General initially references many of the documents used by the NTPF in its work.<\/p><p>We acknowledge that further work can be done in terms of combining those documents into an internal guidelines and procedures manual, keeping it under regular review and adding to it or amending it as required.  The documents are used by the NTPF in its work.  Work on this issue is well advanced.  I note that the manual will be a living system and there will be a need to continue to keep it under review and up to date whenever circumstances change.<\/p><p> The second recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General is that the NTPF should consider capturing management information on those cases that fail to reach agreement at the end of the negotiation process.  As he pointed out and is worth noting, that is a very infrequent occurrence.  Nevertheless, we thank him for the recommendation.  I advise him and the committee that the matter has been addressed.<\/p><p> On our annual financial statements for 2018, the NTPF has seen increases in its budget and activity in recent years, as shown by Mr. McCarthy.  It grew from &euro;5.1 million in 2016 to &euro;55 million in 2018 and, as we learned on Tuesday, has gone up to &euro;130 million in budget 2021.  The increased funding, particularly in 2017 and 2018, required rapid increases in staffing levels and changes in work processes and systems.  The work carried out then has had a sustained and positive impact in terms of reducing the number of people waiting for surgery or procedures up to the onset of the pandemic earlier this year.  Prior to the NTPF recommencing the arrangement of treatments in mid-2017, the number of people waiting for an appointment for surgery was increasing at a rate of 1,000 per month, peaking at 86,111 in July 2017.  Through the combined work of the NTPF and colleagues throughout the health system, the number of people on this list began to reduce as the NTPF&rsquo;s work began to impact.  By the end of 2018, the year under review today, the work of the NTPF had contributed to a reduction of 15,900, or 18%, in the number of patients on the active waiting list for surgery and procedures and a reduction of 17,700, or 31%, in the number of patients waiting more than three months.<\/p><p> In addition to our ongoing work at the time, several new initiatives were undertaken by the NTPF, including the development of the first IT system capable of tracking patients across all public and private hospitals in the State and the establishment of a central unit to manage the administrative validation of waiting lists across all hospitals.<\/p><p> In conclusion, we are satisfied that the funding provided to the NTPF in 2018 was effectively and efficiently used for the intended purposes and that it has been fully accounted for in the financial statements.  We are particularly pleased that through this work, thousands of patients have been enabled to receive their treatments earlier than would otherwise have been the case.  We thank the committee for inviting us to appear and we look forward to the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020101500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Horan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602757800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Horan for his opening statement.

I have a question about the NTPF and the treatment abroad fund.  I know the NTPF has nothing to do with the treatment abroad fund, but has anybody done a comparison between them regarding the cost of providing care in similar areas?  Does the witness not think it might be appropriate at this stage to do that comparison to see if we are getting value for money in that area?<\/p> <p>  The second matter I wish to refer to is nursing homes.  I live in an area in which there are two nursing homes within a five-mile radius.  One is run by the HSE and it costs &euro;1,550 per week per patient.  The other one is privately run - they are the same size with 100 beds in each - and under the fair deal scheme the cost is &euro;950 per week.  There is a gap of 66%.  As regards when the NTPF is negotiating with nursing homes, let us take the example of a nursing home with 50 patients.  They are all at the standard level of care but as time passes between 15% and 20% of them may need a higher level of care.  There appears to be no adjustment allowed in the price.  Will Mr. Sloyan comment on that?<\/p> <p>  There is a third matter.  With regard to public nursing homes, we received the report in 2018 showing that 40% of the funding from the fair deal was going towards the public nursing homes, which are looking after 20% of those in care, whereas 60% of the fair deal was going to the private nursing homes, which are looking after 80% of those in care.  I had a detailed meeting this morning with a nursing home for about an hour on various issues, including access to services for private nursing homes.  Even though public nursing homes are costing more money per patient per week, the residents have access to more public services, whereas private nursing homes do not have the same level of access to healthcare services.  That is not factored in when dealing with this issue.  The witnesses might comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020101500002#F01900","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602757800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>The first question is about value for money in the procurement of hospital treatments.

I thank the witnesses for attending.  I appreciate it.  I am aware they appeared before this committee in June 2018 to deal with the financial statements from 2016 regarding the nursing homes support scheme.  I will mention some of the recommendations as a result of that meeting.  Recommendation 1 states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt is not clear that the cost of care in public nursing homes is providing value for money to the taxpayer.  Of a budget in the region of &euro;1 billion for the Nursing Home Support Scheme, approximately two thirds is expended on public nursing homes that provide one fifth of capacity. <\/blockquote> <p>The Department of Health commenced a value for money review, which I note has been referred to earlier.  That was concluded in May 2019.  How soon do the witnesses think that is going to be published?  Do they have any more information for the members of the committee?  It appears to be dragging its heels.  Indeed, that issue is still live and relevant since the witnesses' last appearance before the committee.<\/p><p>Recommendation 2 states: &quot;The National Treatment Purchase Fund&rsquo;s review of its pricing mechanism for long-term residential care in private and voluntary nursing homes is ongoing.&quot;  It also refers to increasing the transparency of the current price mechanism and continuing to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.  Again, something similar is referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report today, regarding the lack of review of charges.  If I understood the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening remarks, just two reviews were conducted by the chief executive.  I am open to correction on that, but he might clarify why that is the case.<\/p><p>In terms of the internal appeals process, what changes have been made to those since the witnesses' last appearance before the committee?<\/p><p>Transparency about negotiations with nursing homes and how fair deal agreements are arrived at with individual homes is in question.  We need to ensure that funding is based on the need of those who are in care and not necessarily whether they are in a public or private home.  What changes can the NTPF assure us it has made in the intervening period and what changes does it intend to make now that, in light of Tuesday's budget, the funding has changed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020101500002#F03300","speaker":"1481","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602757800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>The value-for-money review is being conducted by the Department of Health so any updates on that are best obtained from it.  The review of the pricing mechanism has been submitted to the Department and Minister.  The issue of transparency in negotiations is a challenge because these are commercial negotiations being conducted in the interests of the State.  The committee will appreciate that in a negotiation one sometimes has to keep one's cards close to one's chest.  There can be a tension between providing transparency about negotiations while also achieving value for money for the State.  It is worth noting that the function for the NTPF is unusual.  We are not being asked to procure and follow the guidelines as we do with hospitals and such.  Here, we have a function to negotiate and we have to interpret how to do that as well as we can in the interests of the State and of residents.  We try to hit the sweet spot of providing transparency where we set out our criteria.  At the end of the review process, I give the nursing home reasons about the offer that it was made.

This meeting is being held much later than normal.  It is usually held in the spring but there was an election and the committees were not reconvened.  The secretariat told me the meeting had to be held before the end of the month. I thank the members for facilitating me in having it today.  I remind members to ensure that, for the duration of the meeting, their mobile phones are turned off completely or put in airplane, safe or flight mode, depending on the device.  It is not sufficient for members to put their phones in silent mode as this will interfere with the broadcasting system.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  This meeting has been convened to consider the Revised Estimate for Vote 30, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which was referred by the D&aacute;il to the committee on 30 September.  I welcome the Minister and his officials.  As members are well aware, the agriculture, food and the marine sectors are experiencing very challenging times, not least because of the impact of Covid-19 and the anticipated impacts of Brexit and climate action.  Today, the committee has the opportunity to scrutinise the level of funding allocated for 2020.  While it is acknowledged that more than nine months of 2020 have elapsed, this is a valuable opportunity to engage with the Minister.<\/p> <p>  The proposed format of today's meeting is that we deal with Vote 30 on a programme-by-programme basis.  At the outset, the Minister will make an opening statement.  There are four programmes and we will consider each separately, taking questions from members.  Members will be called upon on a first-come, first-served basis.  Briefing material on the Revised Estimates has been circulated by the committee secretariat.<\/p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2020101500002#A00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I am glad to have this valuable opportunity to outline to members today, on behalf of the Department, the current challenges and opportunities across the various sectors in agriculture, food development, the marine and forestry.  This year, 2020, has been a particularly testing one for the entire sector as it has been dealing with the ongoing challenges associated with Brexit in addition to the new challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p>  My immediate priority is to continue preparing for Brexit and ensuring we have contingency plans in place to support the sector to prepare for whatever may come.  It is critical that we put measures in place to protect vulnerable farm incomes, support sustainable farming and jobs in rural and coastal communities and assist the sector to meet the challenges of Brexit.  Since March, we have had to deal with the massive disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The 2020 Revised Estimate contain additional measures for the agrifood sector to help to address many of the problems.  It is also my priority to maintain a strong focus on climate action and environmental sustainability to enable the sector to thrive in the future.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman recognised, this year is unusual in that I am here today presenting the 2020 Revised Estimates two days after the announcement of the budget for 2021.  This time last year, the 2020 budget was framed to preserve the strong financial supports that assist our agrifood sector.  It will also prepare for the possible shock to the sector resulting from a potential no-deal Brexit.<\/p> <p>  For 2020, the total Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department amounts to &euro;1.76 billion.  That is comprised of &euro;1.424 billion in current expenditure and &euro;336 million in capital expenditure, including a carry-over of &euro;19.8 million in capital from 2019.  This figure represents a gross increase of approximately 5%, or &euro;83 million, on the 2019 allocation.  When appropriations-in-aid are considered, the 2020 net Vote is estimated at &euro;1.4 billion.  Regarding our 2019 performance, total expenditure was &euro;1.635 billion.  Current expenditure was 99% of the allocation, reflecting a very strong delivery of crucial supports to the agrifood sector.<\/p> <p>  The Vote is subdivided into four expenditure programmes, corresponding to the four key strategic objectives set out in the current statement of strategy.  I will now speak about each of these four programmes, that is, A to D, and the key themes.<\/p> <p>  Programme A deals with food safety, animal and plant health, and animal welfare.  The total allocation for programme A in 2020 is &euro;278 million.  I have provided increases in this programme to reflect the funding that is required in preparation for Brexit, including the associated development of supporting IT systems and equipment.<\/p> <p>  The world-class food produced by thousands of Irish farmers, fishermen and agrifood companies throughout the country is to the highest international standards of food safety and quality.  Our food safety and traceability systems continue to be recognised as among the very best in the world.  Regarding programme expenditure, I am continuing to fund vital services to ensure those standards are maintained.  In this regard, I include the meat inspection service and the various supports provided by the Department testing laboratories.<\/p> <p>  On animal welfare, I have provided &euro;2.5 million for the calf investment scheme.  This scheme is a new initiative from my Department providing funding for a range of on-farm investments that will add significant capacity on Irish farms for the rearing of calves and will further enhance the health and welfare credentials of Irish agriculture.<\/p> <p>  Programme B deals with farm sector supports and controls.  A total of just over &euro;924 million is available under the programme for 2020, to be paid almost exclusively to farmers.  That is in addition to the &euro;1.22 billion in funding from the European Union in respect of the various direct payment schemes.  This support is vital to farmers who deliver public goods and environmental benefits.  As well as the inherent environmental benefits involved, this investment enhances our sustainability credentials, which are invaluable as we serve increasingly demanding and knowledgeable customers at home and around the world.<\/p> <p>  The provision for my Department, notwithstanding Brexit, will focus on the difficulties in the beef sector.  Approximately &euro;135 million will be provided in targeted schemes to support sustainable beef farming, representing an increase of 58% on the 2019 allocation.  This includes approximately &euro;44.5 million for the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, and a further &euro;40.8 million for targeted supports.  The beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP, scheme that was introduced in 2019 has been extended for a further year and will provide practical guidance for the future viability of our suckler herd.  It complements the BDGP very well.<\/p> <p>  Other supports available to the beef sector include the beef finisher payment scheme, provided as part of the Covid stimulus measures.  The European Commission recently formally approved the &euro;50 million scheme to support those working in the Irish beef sector who have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.  The beef finisher payment scheme is a one-off, Exchequer-funded grant aid scheme under the Covid-19 state aid temporary framework.<\/p><p>The scheme will address liquidity shortages for farmers adversely impacted by the Covid crisis between February and mid-June 2020 and is aimed at farmers with finished animals who suffered from both reduced prices and other restrictions in getting the animals to market.<br\/><br\/>Moving to the sheep sector, &euro;18 million is included for the continuation of the sheep welfare scheme.  In addition to the beef and sheep supports, I propose to increase the budget for Bord Bia by more than &euro;1.6 million, with much of the funding to be used to promote the Irish beef and sheep sectors through promotion campaigns on the home market and in some European countries. <br\/><br\/>The work of my Department is very much in sync with the objectives of the report of the Oireachtas committee on climate action and the whole-of-government approach to ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon economy.  In that regard the provision for agri-environment schemes is increased by &euro;7 million.  This includes an increase in funding for locally-led schemes in 2020.  These local environmental schemes are a highlight of our rural development programme.  The Government is supporting farmers and local communities to deliver real environmental gains through schemes such as the hen harrier project, the pearl mussel project and many smaller local schemes.  My Department is currently supporting 23 such locally-led programmes around the country.  At a time of climate and biodiversity crisis, these schemes are showing real innovation and are focusing on measurable results in terms of climate, biodiversity and water as well as enhancing the viability of farmers involved.<br\/><br\/>An additional locally-led pilot scheme on the reduced management of farmed peatland was announced recently.  This scheme is designed to increase carbon sequestration and contribute to meeting our commitments as part of the Government climate action plan.  It will also enhance the protection of biodiversity and water quality and provide a template for action in advance of Ireland's next Common Agricultural Policy.<br\/><br\/>I am providing almost &euro;93 million<font color=\"#FF0000\"><\/font>in support of the forestry sector in recognition of the vital contribution it can make in mitigating climate change and supplementing farm incomes.  The forestry review in 2018 has given rise to adjustments to the programme which has resulted in a much more diverse species mix than previously.  In line with our ambitions under the climate change plan, and together with the planting by Coillte in partnership with Bord na M&oacute;na, this provision can support over 6,000 ha of new plantings.<br\/><br\/>In terms of capital expenditure, I have increased the allocation for the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, to a total of &euro;104 million, including the capital carryover of &euro;19.8 million.  This will fund investment in a range of environmental and competitiveness measures, including low emissions slurry spreading, solar panels and slurry storage, as well as support for the horticulture and organics sector.  Claims are being submitted on an ongoing basis with more than &euro;55 million paid out already this year.  Many farmers recognise the value of upgrading their equipment and improving their facilities and we will continue to match them in their ambition and pragmatism.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On programme C, policy and strategy, many of the programme allocations reflect the comprehensive approach to Brexit responsiveness and how that links with the continuing implementation of the FoodWise 2025 strategy.  The total allocation for programme C in 2020 is &euro;379 million.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the food sector, programme C includes a provision of more than &euro;11.5 million to Teagasc's capital allocation which will permit it to proceed with the development of the food hub in Moorepark.  A sum of &euro;8 million is also retained to support innovation in the food sector.  While these initiatives foster innovation and product development and are consistent with the direction of FoodWise 2025, they have also been given a greater focus by Brexit.  The agrifood sector has been well served over the last 20 years by having a series of ten-year strategies such as FoodWise 2025 to guide its development and we have committed in the programme for Government that this should continue with the preparation of a new strategy to 2030.  While the sector faces significant challenges, it also has many opportunities to develop further and prosper.  We have a strong international reputation as a supplier of safe, nutritious and sustainably produced food.  International consumers seek out our food and beverage products in a very competitive international market.  We should be proud of this and work to build and enhance that reputation for the benefit of our farmers, fishers and all other stakeholders within the sector.  A committee of sector stakeholders has been working since late last year on this new strategy.  Their terms of reference are to outline the vision and key objectives, with associated actions required to ensure the economic, environmental and social sustainability of the agrifood sector in the decade ahead.<br\/><br\/>The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agrifood exports is an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agrifood sector as set out in the FoodWise 2025 strategy.  In recent times, it has gained particular relevance given the need to diversify our markets in the context of Brexit and in response to the circumstances created by the current pandemic.  Over the last number of budgets, increased funding has been provided to Bord Bia to strengthen its understanding of consumer priorities and preferences in Ireland and in distant markets, and to communicate those insights to Irish food companies for use in product promotion, development, branding and marketing.<br\/><br\/>Trade missions play a key role in market and trade advancement.  In 2019 and 2020, successful visits have taken place to Turkey, China, Japan, South Korea, Algeria and Egypt among others.  Market access for Irish sheep meat to Japan was agreed during the trade mission, as well as confirmation of enhanced beef access to Japan with removal of the 30-month age restriction.  Increased market access was advanced and achieved through these visits, some examples being the additional 14 beef plants being approved for export to China and the agreement with Algeria for the export of cattle for slaughter.  Last year also saw visits to more traditional markets, including to the Netherlands in November where the former Minister, Deputy Creed, met representatives of the Dutch veal industry, visiting their facilities and receiving reassurances both on animal welfare and capacity issues.  The former Minister concluded his 2019 schedule in December in the Netherlands and the UK,<b><\/b>meeting key multinational supermarket groups.  My Department, supported by Bord Bia, intends to hold virtual trade missions later this year, with Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia being considered.  In addition to outward ministerial trade missions, the Department hosted high-level visiting delegations from a wide range of countries in 2019.  The Government's focus on, and commitment to, new market development has been illustrated by its appointment of my colleague, Deputy Heydon, as Minister of State with specific responsibility for this task.  In addition, my Department's international trade activities are being reorganised and further developed as we deal with the twin challenges of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.  More generally, my Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets, and I am of course ready to respond as appropriate to any opportunities that may arise.<br\/><br\/>The horse and greyhound racing fund will be retained at &euro;84 million in 2020.  An additional &euro;1 million will bring the 2020 allocation for Horse Sport Ireland to &euro;4 million to assist with the strategic development of the sector.  The Greyhound Racing Act 2019 was signed into law in 2019.  This Act modernises the legislative basis for the industry and provides the board with significantly enhanced powers which aim to enhance animal welfare standards in particular.  Although the sector faces many ongoing challenges, it is hoped that the Act will provide a strong foundation from which the industry can develop.  Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, continues to promote the thoroughbred equine sector, and the opening of the redeveloped Curragh racecourse in 2019 was a particular highlight.  The sector continues to be an important source of employment and economic activity in 2020, in rural areas in particular.  I am confident that HRI is preparing the industry for the inevitable challenges that Brexit will bring, and my Department will continue to work with HRI to that end.<br\/><br\/>Further to the announcement of the expansion of the future growth loan scheme and following the strong uptake by the agrifood sector in 2019, I have made provision for almost &euro;20.4 million in the 2020 Estimate.  I am aware that despite the strong uptake there has been some unfulfilled demand.  This expansion will meet that demand and together with the evolution of the scheme will also assist in meeting the ongoing challenges faced by the sector in dealing with Brexit, in addition to the new challenges being posed by Covid-19.<font color=\"#0082BF\"><\/font>The unsecured nature of the funding is a crucial support to all parts of the production chain - farmers, fishers, forestry and food and beverage production - but particularly helps young and new entrant farmers, as well as smaller farmers.  This scheme will help to facilitate innovation and ensure our enterprise base is sustainable into the future.<br\/><br\/>Following an appeal from the executive director of the world food programme, WFP, most of Ireland's commitment for 2020, &euro;23 million, was paid by way of an advance in 2019.  Ireland also facilitated an early disbursement of the &euro;700,000 balance of its 2020 commitment in May this year following an additional appeal by the WFP in the context of its response to the Covid-19 pandemic.As part of the Government&rsquo;s response to Covid-19, my Department was allocated an additional &euro;20 million, which was provided to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to access finance support schemes.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On programme D, the seafood sector, the provision for the Department&rsquo;s seafood programme has been increased by over &euro;15 million to a total of &euro;159 million.  The provision will help fund vital investment in our fishery harbours, most particularly in Killybegs, Howth and Castletownbere.<\/p><p>As part of the July Covid-19 stimulus package, an additional &euro;5 million was allocated to support the Howth Fishery Harbour Centre middle pier redevelopment project.  The budget provision will allow the Marine Institute to progress the construction of a new &euro;25 million modern research vessel.  This will provide critical national infrastructure to enable Ireland to address the considerable challenges of Brexit and the Common Fisheries Policy as well as climate-induced impacts on our oceans.<\/p><p> The multi-annual financial framework negotiations were concluded in July 2020.  I am pleased to say that Ireland has retained a CAP EU funding package in excess of &euro;10 billion for the 2021-27 period.  These funds are an essential support to the farming sector through challenging times.  While this funding is not reflected in the Vote for 2020, significant preparations are ongoing in my Department to meet the challenges of a new delivery model for CAP funds.<\/p><p> That is a brief overview of the range of measures that apply in the agrifood and marine sectors for 2020.  I believe these funding allocations will assist us in focusing on competitiveness, innovation, new market development and environmental sustainability, while responding to the uncertainty and challenges posed by Brexit and Covid.  I look forward to the discussion and questions from committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2020101500002#A00400","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":413,"content":"<p>As I said at the outset - maybe one or two members were not here - we are going to go through it.

Have we jumped the gun by running those ads in England now with, I understand, the same name as we are looking to use with the PGI status?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2020101500002#H00500","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Teagasc has done, and continues to do, considerable work on emissions and sequestration on farms.  Obviously, the work it did in producing the marginal abatement cost curve for identifying particular measures that could be adopted to help agriculture meet its emission targets under the existing climate action plan was particularly important.  It was out early with that research and in identifying the measures that could be taken in agriculture to make a contribution.  Teagasc has a very important role to play in the time ahead.  We have a very good story to tell on our grass-based production system for livestock and dairy.  We need to continue to improve and we need to be a market leader.  The sector needs to be cognisant and play its part in meeting our climate change objectives.  The existing climate action plan involves a 10% to 15% reduction in emissions by 2030.  Consumers are looking for high-quality food that is produced in a way that is consistent with their values.  Increasingly sustainability, the environment and emissions are key to that.  Even from a consumer point of view, we need to keep up with that by ensuring that agriculture is making its contribution in respect of climate change.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the PGI application that is under discussion.  At the previous beef task force that I convened and addressed, I asked for further meetings afterwards involving the farming organisations, my Department and Bord Bia to discuss the proposal for a grass-fed PGI application.  Engagement remains ongoing on that and there is considerable potential.  The farming sector, my Department, marketing agencies and processors need to work together.  Everybody needs to step forward in partnership to ensure it is a success.  At the moment we have the Origin Green umbrella, which defines the standards to which we produce our food.  A key part of marketing our livestock and beef in particular is that it is grass-fed.  It is also a big part of what distinguishes it internationally from what competing nations produce.  It has been a key platform in how we market our beef over the years.  The assessment is that the PGI would enhance our capacity in that regard.  Up to now advertising the grass-fed aspect of our beef has been an important part of the Irish meat brand and is an important reason we have a good reputation and a good customer base.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2020101500002#H00600","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>We all agree that we need to try to promote it as much as possible.<\/p><p>We hear that there are applications for PGI status in the Department and some applicants have not been contacted for the last four to five weeks.

I have no problem with promoting something.  However, if grass-fed Irish beef is the name of the new protected geographical indicator, and one has already advertised grass-fed Irish cattle, one cannot obtain a premium price when one lands with the new thing, and that is a problem.  It is about being sharp with what one does.  I worry that we will spend money on that, although we all agree with promoting our product and we all agree on what we are producing.

Over the years, as well as now, the advantage for Irish beef on the market is the fact that it is grass-fed, and that adds to its quality.  Where that is advertised, the objective is to obtain a premium as much as is possible at the moment.  The idea behind developing from the Origin Green brand towards PGI status is that it would add additional value and capacity to further market that beef to try to increase its value and price.  There is recognition of PGI among many consumers as being something of value.  One would therefore hope that a successful application would be helpful in assisting us in our work to develop markets and get value for them.<\/p> <p>  I will ensure that any applications that come forward to my Department are engaged with.  Advice has been given in that regard.  I know there have been some already.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the beef task force, there has been ongoing engagement between my Department and the Commission about our intention to submit a PGI application.  The detail of ensuring that an application goes forward that meets the tactical specifications required for PGI, and properly reflects the natural advantages of the product we have, is the subject of detailed negotiations with the farming organisations.  We require a little more in that because we need to ensure that there is a full understanding of what is possible, that there is a successful application and that farmers feel it will deliver for the beef sector.  It is something that I will want to keep a foot down on in the coming time to ensure that that engagement happens.  Hopefully we can reach a place where it is a good application which will deliver on its objective and, importantly, allow us as a country to increase our potential to market abroad and to develop new markets.  The idea that we would have something that is Irish grass-fed gives a clear identity which will be much stronger, given the capacity we have at the moment.  It will be useful from a marketing point of view and reflective of the product we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2020101500002#J00200","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":508,"content":"<p>Deputy Fitzmaurice's question is relevant to the future of the industry.

Is a value for money assessment carried out on that allocation?  I ask because I fear a lot of money is being wasted in dealing with the PGI status.  I question whether status will be granted and even if it is, whether it will bring any addionality.  This is very much about whether the money we are spending and have allocated is being utilised in the best regard.  Bord Bia told us the reason it has not done what is needed, namely, to have an Irish suckler beef brand PGI, is nobody outside the sector knows what suckler beef is.  That is a failure on its part.  Its job is to promote Irish food yet it has not done anything to promote the best aspect of Irish food.  Will a value for money assessment be carried out to ensure Bord Bia is spending money effectively and whether it could be spent more effectively, particularly where suckler beef is concerned?<\/p> <p>  My second question is on trade missions and trade overall.  I noted with interest the Minister's line on Brexit.  When he talked of the significant challenges we face, he said, \"the sector has also many opportunities to develop further and prosper\".  I have been listening to this since 2016 and there has been a lot of rhetoric but no specific detail as to what those opportunities are.  I cannot see how we replace, for example, the British market over a short period.  The referendum was in 2016 and we are now in 2020.  We are now at the cliff edge of a no-deal Brexit and we are still hearing the same language of potential and opportunities but nobody has spelt out what exactly they are.  There has been talk in that regard and the Minister mentioned Japan with regard to sheep and China with regard to beef.  A lot of money is being spent on the trade missions and opening up these markets and we all welcome the opening up of those markets.  However, is any analysis carried out in the Department to ensure the financial and economic benefits of the Department's work and all the trade work that is ongoing reaches farmers?

It is also crucial that we ensure the tremendous product we have in suckler beef is fully supported and that is something I have engaged with Bord Bia on as well.  I am determined that support will be available to develop that brand.  The feedback at the moment from Bord Bia relates to consumer understanding of the suckler brand in particular and it is confined to certain areas.  It is something we have to invest in and support.  Working with the board and farming organisations, I am determined we will have a good outcome on this and a financial allocation to it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about trade missions and the need to diversify our markets, particularly where beef is concerned.  The ongoing work in existing markets is important in terms of consumer and customer engagement because these are competitive markets.  That is something Bord Bia is consistently focused on.  It also focuses on identifying consumer trends and desires as these can change.  That is something we do well.  On beef, the potential in recent times has particularly related to developing the Chinese and Japanese markets and that is something we are continuing to work on.  We are trying to address that in particular with regard to China and reopening that market for beef in particular.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt, however, that our main market continues to be the British one.  One does not diversify away very easily from such an important market.  It has also traditionally been our highest-paying market.  For British customers, Irish beef is regarded as almost as good as British beef.  Naturally, as with any nation, there is a preference for home-grown beef but the evidence and research shows that Irish beef is perceived by British consumers in the same category and regard as their own beef is, where quality is concerned.  Like the Deputy, I know there has been much discussion about diversification.  I have been watching the figures over the past three to four years and the British market has maintained, proportionately, that significant place in terms of where our beef exports go.  That is not a surprise given that there is a demand for it, that it is a well-paying market and that it is our near neighbour.  That speaks to the absolute importance of the Brexit issue and of a good trade deal outcome to ensure this trade can continue.<\/p> <p>  Demand for beef at European level has been flatlining somewhat, if not a little depressed.  Given where consumers are at and the slightly reducing consumption of meat in developed markets as well, it is important we look internationally.  Having said that, while the UK is our highest-paying market, the EU has been our second highest-paying market and taken together they import 95% of our meat.  Looking to eastern Asia, China and developing countries where consumption of beef is increasing, it is very important that we up our footprint there.  That has happened in the Department by means of us increasing our footprint with agricultural attach&eacute;s in embassies and also with the work Bord Bia is doing.  Given the size of those markets, if we can secure a small proportion of them and get in there as they develop, they will offer significant potential in the years ahead.  There is no doubt that Britain is, and will hopefully remain, our biggest customer and if impediments are put in as a result of Brexit, the beef sector will be in real trouble.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2020101500002#K01000","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I have more questions.<\/p><p>I would appreciate it if the Minister would come back to the point I was making.  We are spending a great deal of money, and rightly so, on promoting Irish food.  We are promoting that on the back of the image of our farmers.  We are using the picture of the farmer in the field with his cow and her calf but we need to make sure that that is the guy who is getting a financial benefit from the work we are doing and the investment we are making.  Is there more we can do to ensure that it does not just go to the factories and the exporters and that by the time it comes down to the factory gates or the mart the people we are using to promote it are not seeing any benefit?<\/p><p> The Chairman will be glad to hear I have a question directly related to the figures before us.  With regard to food aid donations and the World Food Programme, there has been a substantial decrease in the programme from &euro;23 million to &euro;700,000 in terms of value between 2019 and 2020.  Is there a particular reason for that?  Was there a particular reason for the upsurge in 2019 and the subsequent significant reduction in 2020?  Is there a blip in either year with regard to that?<\/p><p> There has been talk about the funding going into the horse breeding and horse racing sector.  This goes back to the earlier questions and the issues I have raised with the Minister.  Is any analysis carried out in terms of the beneficiaries of that funding?  I accept that this is an important industry but in terms of where allocations go, in large part they are the household names.  I am not saying they should not get any funding but, for example, smaller horse breeders and horse trainers in my constituency and in many other parts of the country tell me that they get very little.  They do not see the financial benefit of the State's investment in this sector.  Has any analysis been carried out and, if not, can such analysis be carried out to ensure that everybody benefits when we are investing approximately &euro;80 million into a sector?

I am an associate professor in the school of law and government in DCU, specialising in climate change governance.  Along with Dr. &Aacute;ine Ryall and others, I was a member of the expert advisory group to the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly 2016 to 2018 during its deliberations on the topic of climate change.  The origins of the legislation the committee is scrutinising can be traced back to the assembly&rsquo;s first recommendation on the topic of climate change.  It is to be welcomed that the assembly&rsquo;s recommendation is being acted upon.<\/p> <p>  The draft Bill published last week by the Government represents an important milestone in Ireland&rsquo;s approach to climate change.  However, it was regrettable that a consolidated version of the legislation, showing the 2015 Act along with the proposed amendments included, was not published alongside the draft amending legislation.<\/p><p>Even for someone such as myself with expertise in this area, it was challenging to piece together its implications by reading it alongside the 2015 Act.<\/p><p> It is important to acknowledge that already in its current form the Bill represents a significant strengthening of the 2015 legislation it seeks to amend.  It enshrines in law a quantitative target for decarbonisation for the first time, and a process of setting intermediate quantitative targets through a system of carbon budgets.  The Bill elaborates a more robust planning process involving a national long-term climate action strategy and an annually updated climate action plan.  There is also a strengthened role for the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC.  All of these developments are to be welcomed.  Nonetheless, in my judgment there are a number of weaknesses in the current draft that ought to be addressed before the Bill is passed into law.<\/p><p> In my opening remarks, I will focus on a number of specific areas.  Although under the Bill the State is required to \"pursue the transition to a climate resilient and climate neutral economy by the end of the year 2050\" it is not required to achieve it.  Both the 2015 Act and the general scheme of the climate action (amendment) Bill published by the outgoing Government in January included an obligation on the State to \"pursue and achieve\" the national transition objective.  The words \"and achieve\" disappeared from the draft published last week.<\/p><p> A related point is that although the Bill sets out a detailed and robust procedure for setting five-year carbon budgets, there is no clearly stated obligation on the Government to comply with these carbon budgets.  By contrast, the UK Climate Change Act, considered by many to be a leading example of framework climate change legislation, states unambiguously that \"It is the duty of the Secretary of State...to ensure that the net UK carbon account for a budgetary period does not exceed the carbon budget\".<\/p><p> The provisions regarding the setting of carbon budgets are lacking in precision.  There appears to be no obligation on either the CCAC to recommend, or the Government to approve, carbon budgets that are consistent with the national 2050 climate objective.  There is nothing in the Bill to stop the Government from setting carbon budgets that are explicitly inconsistent with the 2050 objective.  There is also nothing in the Bill to stop the Government from setting carbon budgets that are explicitly inconsistent with the State's obligations under EU and international law.<\/p><p> The language used to set out which greenhouse gases are covered by the carbon budgets is imprecise.  In his opening statement to the committee yesterday, Mr. Brian Carroll, assistant secretary in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, indicated the carbon budgets will cover all greenhouse gases and all sectors of the economy.  This may indeed be the Government's intention, but the definitions section of the Bill states that \"carbon budget\" means \"in relation to one or more greenhouse gases, the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that are permitted during the budget period\".<\/p><p> I emphasise that the climate Bill, no matter how strong, will not by itself deliver the transformational change required.  Rather, it should be seen as one part of a much bigger jigsaw.  It is an important start, but it needs to be accompanied by a wide range of other actions, including strong measures to ensure citizen participation and a just transition.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute to its discussions today.  I am happy to answer questions on these points or other aspects of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Diarmuid Torney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602716400,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  I will begin by making some overarching points of principle that are vital to frame the discussion and our analysis of the Bill.  The Bill is hugely welcome but it is essential that the draft text is examined closely and improved where appropriate.  In this context, I hope there will be wide engagement and a robust exchange of views during the pre-legislative scrutiny stage and that members of the public will be encouraged to follow the discussion and make their views known through their elected representatives.  The Bill is urgent, and we must make progress in a timely fashion, but it is also essential that the legislation that emerges at the end of the process is fit for purpose and enables Ireland to meet its climate obligations.<\/p> <p>  As a lawyer, I would like to say a few words about vague and ambiguous language in legislation.  I understand from following the proceedings yesterday that this issue has already surfaced.  Speaking as a lawyer, vague and ambiguous language is problematic, especially when it comes to effective implementation and enforcement of legal rights and obligations.  This is surely something that must concern the committee.  It is certainly something that concerns the public.  Vague language can lead to very complex disputes over the precise meaning and implications of particular legal provisions and, of course, it fuels litigation, which is something that everybody wants to avoid at all costs.  I stress that during the pre-legislative scrutiny stage, the committee must keep in mind the importance of precision and clear obligations.  I make this general point to highlight the importance of using this stage of the process to scrutinise forensically the language used and how particular obligations set out in the Bill have been designed and drafted to ensure they are fit for purpose.  Otherwise, there will be problems with the impact of these provisions and in ensuring they are enforceable.<\/p> <p>  My particular area of experience is environmental law, including climate law and human rights.  I teach and research these areas in the School of Law at University College Cork.  As did my good colleague, Dr. Torney, I served as a member of the expert advisory group to the Citizens' Assembly during the climate change module of the assembly's work programme.  This experience, and the engagement with the citizen members of the assembly, has given us unique insights into a range of areas that are of vital relevance to the Bill.  I hope they will be of benefit to the committee in its deliberations.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of points to make on the recent Supreme Court judgment in the case that has come to be known as Climate Case Ireland.  Many points arising from this decision are very relevant to our debate on the Bill.  I will highlight two points and I do not suggest for a moment they are the only relevant issues.  The Supreme Court judgment is very strong on the principles of public participation and transparency in the formation and publication of climate policy.  This is absolutely fundamental and it must inform how this pre-legislative scrutiny process proceeds and how the Bill ultimately evolves.  The public must be involved and their views must be taken into account.  This aspect of the Supreme Court's judgment is very welcome and it underpins the core values of participation, transparency and accountability that should inform all environmental decision-making.  We need to watch closely for these in the Bill and we must ensure these elements are robust enough.  The Bill must provide effective opportunities for public participation.  I have some concerns about the weaker elements of some aspects of the Bill as it stands, with regard to discretionary aspects of public participation.  I hope we will get to these shortly.<\/p> <p>  On a related point concerning public participation, which Dr. Torney also made, I find it very disappointing that no effort seems to have been made when the Bill was first published to provide an unofficial consolidated text that would incorporate, even by means of simple tracked changes in a word document, what the Bill proposes to change within the existing text of the 2015 Act.<\/p><p>That would have made it so much easier for members of the public, people interested in the way this Bill will impact on our legislation and for anybody who does not have the legal training to engage effectively in this process.  I believe that is a missed opportunity and I hope there might still be time for such an unofficial document to be produced and published online to allow people to follow the debate properly.<br\/><br\/>The second point I would make about the Supreme Court judgment is to highlight the &quot;significant weight&quot;, which was the actual wording used by the court, that it placed on the views of the Climate Change Advisory Council.  It seems clear from reading the Supreme Court judgment in the Climate Case Ireland case that the court was very influenced by the views of the council.  I make that point because it confirms in a very clear way how vital the role of the council is and, in the context of the Bill, how essential it is that we work to ensure that its independence is strengthened, its oversight role is developed further and that it has the wide range of expertise it needs to deliver its mandate.  Of course, it must have the resources to do that properly and in a timely fashion.<br\/><br\/>My final point brings me back to one of the recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly.  Again, it concerns the assembly's report on the topic of how the State can make Ireland a leader in tacking climate change<i>.  <\/i>Many of the members will be aware that the first recommendation the assembly made was to ensure climate change is at the centre of policymaking in Ireland.  The recommendation was that a new or existing independent body should be resourced appropriately, operate in a transparent manner, and be given a broad range of functions and powers in legislation to urgently address climate change.  A majority, 97%, of the assembly members who were present voted in favour of that recommendation so it was a very strong endorsement of that powerful recommendation.<br\/><br\/>It is very important to recall, if we read the assembly's report, that the recommendation also included in the text that was put to the assembly on the ballot paper a number of examples of possible powers and functions that this new or independent body could have and one of those potential functions was &quot;To pursue the State in legal proceedings to ensure that the State lives up to its legal obligations relating to climate change.&quot;  The theme of my opening remarks is about enforcement.  That is where everything comes to the fore.<br\/><br\/>It is interesting that the point about giving an independent body the power to pursue the State, in litigation if necessary, does not appear to have gained any traction following the publication of the Citizens' Assembly report.  It did not feature among the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Climate Action and there was no mention of it in the non-statutory climate action plan published in 2019.  That is unfortunate.  I am pressing the point here in some detail because I believe it is an issue that must be considered if we are to have confidence in an effective enforcement mechanism.  There is no point in imposing obligations and setting targets unless there is a legal mechanism to ensure that those targets are met and that there are consequences and sanctions if they are not.<br\/><br\/>The Bill raises a host of significant issues that I cannot go into the detail of now but I am happy to go through them with the members during this session.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude by giving everybody, including members of the public who I imagine are tuning in to this session, a brief reminder of what is at stake here.  We must achieve the correct outcome at the conclusion of this legislative process.  We must deliver robust, workable climate legislation that supports a just transition and protects human rights.  We must ensure that the new legislation has the necessary impact across society and the economy to deliver the transformative changes required within the necessary timeframes.

I would be interested to hear the comments of either speaker or both on the other jurisdictions that have used consequences and sanctions.  Mr. Brian Carroll made the point yesterday that, ultimately, the Oireachtas is the key body, Ministers have to be accountable to the D&aacute;il and that that was the primary form of sanction and accountability before the public forum and so on.  I am interested to know what would be the exemplars of alternative consequences and sanctions that were imposed.  Yesterday, Mr. Carroll spoke of the financial consequences of missing targets being allocated to individual sectors being a potential issue.  Is that widely used in other jurisdictions?  Are there models as to how this could be done?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of which gases are included, the debate we had yesterday concerned biogenic methane.  As I understand it, biogenic methane has a much more damaging effect but its life is shorter.  Regarding some of the examples cited, New Zealand has set a target of a 10% reduction in biogenic methane by 2030 and a 24% to 47% reduction in a later period, taking into account the difficulty in reducing biogenic methane to nil.  Dr. Torney made points about the treatment of different gases.  He might comment on that issue because I believe it is one on which there has been considerable debate, including whether the New Zealand model is appropriate for an agrarian society such as ours.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I am interested in is policy tools.  Both speakers made heavy play of creating a legal obligation but did not seem to be quite so helpful in suggesting policy tools that can deliver that.  I acknowledge technology is uncertain but if we create a legal obligation on the State, and to take one example, there are members of this committee who would have divergent views on carbon taxation, is it the intention that legislation of this sort would create such an obligation?  The Oireachtas is also obliged to make decisions about carbon taxes and to take their impact into account.  If we take a solely legalistic approach to this and focus on enforcing the State to do this, that and the other without specifying what those are at the time we make the decisions to enforce them, we are to some degree signing a blank cheque in that we do not know what will be the consequences for our communities.  How do we balance that concern?  Ultimately, tackling climate change is about motivating sectors, communities, homeowners, farmers and the whole nine yards to make changes in their behaviour and lifestyles.  It is not just about the State saying we have it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101500002#C00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":574,"content":"<p>If I may interrupt, the Deputy's time has concluded.

It should, however, be defined in law whether it is one budget or more.  At a minimum, who makes that decision should be defined.  The Deputy will be aware that the process of setting the carbon budgets involves a recommendation from the Climate Change Advisory Council being submitted to the Government.  The Government then takes into account the advisory council's recommendation and proposes a carbon budget to the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.  In that sequence of decision making, it is not clear to me who makes the call on whether there should be one budget for all greenhouse gases, as suggested yesterday by Mr. Carroll, or separate budgets.  At a minimum, it should be specified in law.  If the law does not provide clarity about whether there is to be one budget or more than one budget, it should at least be defined in law who makes that decision.<\/p> <p>  On the question of consequences, sanctions and legal obligations, and policy tools, those issues are all related.  The principle goes back to the UK Climate Change Act of 2008 which, as I noted in my opening remarks, is landmark legislation that many observers around the world point to as a model of best practice.  That principle is that the legislation should specify the overall carbon constraint but should not be prescriptive on policy.  It is the job of the executive and the legislator to figure out the precise policy tools, whether that be a carbon tax, some other instrument or some combination thereof.  It is generally accepted that it should not be prescribed in detail in legislation such as this.  If the law is not prescriptive on the precise policy details, it should at least be prescriptive about the overall constraint.  That is where the carbon budgets and the 2050 target come in.<\/p> <p>  The question of whether that should be binding is important because binding obligations are more forceful in driving policymaking than are non-binding obligations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Diarmuid Torney"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":576,"content":"<p>What are the sanctions used in other jurisdictions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101500002#D00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602716400,"counter":577,"content":"<p>There are some models-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Diarmuid Torney"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I will step in as we have five minutes for questions.

I was keen to respond to Deputy Bruton's question.  With the Chairman's agreement, I will deal with both questions together.<\/p> <p>  I fully agree with Deputy Bruton that oversight by the Oireachtas is absolutely fundamental.  This is a policy-heavy area where significant political decisions must be made and serious consequences will arise from those decisions in terms of carbon taxation and everything else.  However, I was certainly not making the argument that this was solely a legalistic approach or a legal issue but, rather, that the law is a key component of this overall framework.<\/p> <p>  This fits in with the second question that was posed concerning potentially strengthening the Climate Change Advisory Council and the role of the public in all of this.  This brings me back to the point of consequences and sanctions mentioned by Deputy Bruton, and the idea of exemplars and models elsewhere in response to his point about making, as I suppose any lawyer would, great play of the consequences.  We do not even have to look to other jurisdictions for appropriate models.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the State's fundamental duties to uphold human rights.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has a statutory power to initiate litigation where it believes it is necessary to protect and enforce human rights.  There are already models, therefore, within our legal system.  Climate litigation is expanding exponentially, including here in Ireland with Climate Case Ireland.   The law will be part and parcel of this, irrespective of how the Bill ultimately deals with it.<\/p><p> I refer the committee, because it could be helpful, to the state of Vermont, which recently passed the nicely titled Vermont Global Warming Solutions Act 2020.  Interestingly, there is the Vermont Climate Council, which speaks to Deputy O'Rourke's question.  It is an advisory body much like ours and the legislative model there involves climate action plans.  The membership of the Vermont advisory body is very interesting and would be worth examining, along with the ideas of a just transition sub-committee, a youth member and different constituencies.  To return to the Deputy's point about public participation, there are other models we could look at.<\/p><p> The other interesting aspect of the Vermont model is that it sets binding targets and timelines for greenhouse reductions in every sector and, to return to Deputy Bruton's point, gives citizens the right to go to court to enforce those binding targets.  It is probably the committee's intention in any event but it would be helpful to hear directly from individuals and lawyers from other jurisdictions - perhaps Scotland and elsewhere - who have direct knowledge of these other models in practice.  I can safely say good models are out there.  I do not suggest we should just cut and paste them into our legislative framework but rather choose the best ones that will work in an Irish context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101500002#D01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. &Aacute;ine Ryall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ryall.

We heard discussion about the question of accountability to the Oireachtas.  One of my concerns, as an Oireachtas Member who is unlikely ever to be in government, is that there seems to be a great deal of ministerial discretion and not simply in the context of the phrase \"have regard to\".  When the speaker from the Government spoke yesterday, the only basis on which he guaranteed there would be targets of 7% was that that was stated in the Government's policy.  That is different, however, from having it in legislation or in a system.  Dr. Torney might elaborate on that question of ministerial discretion and the long-term implications of that for accountability.  I was very interested when he mentioned being consistent with our obligations.  The phrase \"have regard to\" is applied to 26 factors.  Could different verbs be attached appropriately to different aspects, so there would be no suggestion of an equivalence of weighting between having regard to one small issue and to our UN targets?<\/p> <p>  I am also concerned about the independence of the advisory council, which was a key concern for the citizens' assembly.  It suggested there should be a sectoral role for the advisory council rather than having just an overall budget.  It would be interesting to hear comments on that.<\/p> <p>  The Bill suggests that \"in the performance of  its functions\", the Climate Change Advisory Council should have regard not only to paragraphs (a) to (d) of section 3 (3), which cover the climate action plan and so forth, but also to Government policy on climate change.  Is there a concern in respect of independence if, in performing its functions and making its recommendations, the council is asked to take on board the policy of the Government?  Is it normal to embed Government policy as a weighted factor in that balance between the Legislature and the public?<\/p><p>I thank the Senator.

In my judgment, there is a case to be made for attaching a greater weight to the solemn commitments the State has made to its EU partners and the international community, such that those points would be put in a different category and the Government's obligations under sections 4 to 6 would be consistent with those legal obligations.<\/p> <p>  On the point about the Climate Change Advisory Council having to have regard to Government policy, this comes back to the discussion we have been having about the looseness of the legal language.

I am not suggesting that the members are not independent as they stand and this is a general point but it would be important to consider some form of public appointment process where the roles would be advertised publicly, there would be specific criteria and there would be interviews or a similar process.  I am thinking of how the Government sets up the system for appointments to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which is a very open, transparent and competitive process.

On the Deputy's excellent question regarding what the consequences would be if the Bill were to be passed as is tomorrow morning, these things are always hard to predict but it seems to me that much legislation, not just this Bill, creates many obligations.  There are many reasons why Government fails to deliver on legal obligations and, if people can afford it and have access to the courts, there will then inevitably be litigation to work out and deliver those obligations.  There will be enforcement and a follow-up in litigation no matter what we do.<\/p> <p>  The point I am trying to get across is that if we make this Bill as robust as possible, make the obligations clear and put in place provisions to enable people, including the public, to follow through if they see a breach of obligations, that could save a lot of back and forth trying to tease out things and wasting time and court resources.  The way to do it is to get it right now and, hopefully, avoid litigation.  I am concerned that, if it goes through as it is, it is storing up trouble.  There is no doubt about that.

On the Aarhus Convention I must declare that as vice-chair of the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee, I speak here in a purely personal capacity.  The Aarhus Convention creates important human rights for the public including, as the Senator mentioned, the right to information, the right to participate in decision-making and also the right of access to the courts to enforce environmental rights.  As the Senator said, information is absolutely key and it comes back to the original point that both Dr. Torney and I made about how practically impossible it is for a member of the public to try to piece together the Bill as it stands with what currently exists in the 2015 Act.  It is incumbent on Government to make the effort to make the information as accessible as possible to the public and to publish information online in a timely fashion.  There are some very good models of this such as the Citizens Information Board.  The Environmental Protection Agency has also been a very significant advocate and educator, for want of a better expression, with the series of free, public, live-streamed lectures it has run over the years to inform the public about some of the key issues around climate change.  These were not necessarily focused on law but, as Dr. Torney said, the wider societal issues and making the science more accessible to the public.<\/p> <p>  On the participation point, a concern I have more generally is that there are so many public consultations often going on at the same time, whether to do with planning or the marine environment or some draft Government strategy.  It is very difficult for the public who are busy working or have other commitments to find the time and get access to the expertise to make the high-quality submissions that will actually have an impact and change the direction a particular draft document or proposal might take.  It really does come down to the Government putting the resources into developing websites or portals to ensure the public knows where to go to get the basic information and then of course to give the public sufficient time.  Timeframes for public participation, whether on a climate action plan or one of the local authority plans or whatever, can be an issue.  Is two months enough if the public needs to take expert advice?  This committee is now taking expert advice and we see how complicated it is so how is a member of the public expected to get the necessary advice to see what is important?  That point came across very clearly in the Supreme Court judgment in Climate Case Ireland.  A reasonable, interested member of the public reading the national mitigation plan must be able to see what the Government has in mind in terms of policy measures and be able to make his or her own judgment as to whether these policy measures are good enough to get us to the 2050 target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. &Aacute;ine Ryall"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":602,"content":"<p>We are very short on time for obvious reasons.

Again, the explanatory memorandum to the Bill is quite helpful as a resource but it should be ensured the public is aware there is such a memorandum.  A big issue is members of the public who might not have any Internet access or any reliable Internet access as that is a fundamental requirement to even get the documents now.  It is also a concern in the context of the green schools and green campus programmes and starting at an early stage to build up the information so we have active and engaged citizens from a very early stage of an individual's career.  We must also ensure that is adequately resourced.  I share the Deputy's concerns about poverty-proofing and, as a member of the expert advisory group to the Citizens' Assembly, this was something that surfaced on a very regular basis in the course of the debate there, as did the concerns of rural communities about transport and electric vehicles.  Again, many of the recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly do attempt to address those concerns insofar as they can, in particular ring-fencing a certain element of the revenue from a carbon tax, for example.  There are mechanisms for doing it but it needs to be very carefully calibrated.  Poverty-proofing is a critical issue and something that the policymakers will have to make the tough calls on, ultimately in the budgetary context as well with competing demands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101500002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. &Aacute;ine Ryall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602716400,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I concur with everything Dr. Ryall has said.

Could an alternative phrase to \"having regard to\" be used to strengthen what is intended?  In the witnesses' experience of international law, do they find it odd that a reference to the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere is missing from that litany of 25 to 26 points the Bill obliges Ministers to have regard to?  Surely whether those levels are dangerous or safe, as determined by international science, should be the guiding principle of whatever we do.  Mauna Loa Observatory says the level should be at 350 parts per million.  These levels do not seem to be mentioned here.  Do the witnesses find that odd?

I am looking at the relevant section of the draft Bill.  The proposed new section 3(3)(a) of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 refers to \"the ultimate objective specified in Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\".  I am unable to repeat the exact language used in that article but it refers to stabilising greenhouse gases at a certain level.  I am unable to state the exact level specified but the article specifies a safe level.  There is therefore, in effect, a reference to the principle that underpins the Deputy's question.<\/p> <p>  On the broader point about the term \"having regard to\", an alternative phrasing might be \"must be consistent with\".  There has been some discussion around this already this morning.  The challenge is that any government acting in good faith would struggle to develop policy consistent with 25 very diverse items.  There may be tensions between different elements of the list.  It would be challenging for a Bill to specify that in setting policy, the Government must ensure that policy is consistent with everything in that Bill.  Alternative language exists but it would not be a matter of simply taking out \"having regard to\" and replacing it with \"must be consistent with\" across the board.  <\/p> <p>  I made the point earlier, in response to a different question, that I see this section 3(3)(a) regarding the State's international obligations as being of a different character to everything else in the list.

I propose to deal firstly with the point she made concerning the report of the Citizens' Assembly.  I have included references to the pages that deal with that particular recommendation in my opening statement so that people can see the assembly's reasoning and how the draft was formulated, revised and ultimately finalised.  The recommendation was that a new or existing independent body would take on particular functions including potentially pursuing the State by way of litigation if that was seen to be necessary.  The Citizens' Assembly's recommendation did not specify that this body should be the CCAC or any other particular body.  It left open the prospect that it might be a newly established State body.  My own personal view, however, is that the resources and effort required to establish such a body could be very significant.<\/p><p>It would not necessarily be the case that the Climate Change Advisory Council might end up litigating.  For the very reasons the Senator suggests, it would be inappropriate if the council itself has a very involved role in presenting and pursuing the various carbon budgets, so there definitely is an issue about who or what body would have that enforcement role, and that needs to be teased out further.<\/p><p> I will jump to the Senator&rsquo;s third point because I can come back in writing about the question of the term &ldquo;shall pursue&rdquo;, which I think is too weak and needs to be improved. <\/p><p> On the social justice and just transition point, it is also important to mention the wider climate justice agenda, which came up on one of the earlier questions about poverty proofing the Bill and poverty proofing our climate policy.  Climate change, air quality and air pollution are closely interlinked.  We have an incredibly serious air quality problem in this jurisdiction, on which the EPA, to be fair, has been very strong in advocating.  In terms of climate justice and, for example, more poorly resourced communities being forced to suffer poorer air quality, these are all issues that need to be part of the wider framework of the just transition and the social justice concerns that have been mentioned.  It is important that these be kept in mind as the Bill evolves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101500002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. &Aacute;ine Ryall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":618,"content":"<p>Dr. Ryall might come back to me on her proposals for how we can strengthen the Bill in those areas she has just mentioned such as poverty proofing, just transition and social justice and whether she thinks the Bill is the appropriate place for this or whether it should be in policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101500002#J00200","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":619,"content":"<p>This is my first experience of pre-legislative scrutiny in committee and I find it fascinating, particularly the debate and the language around language, for want of a better description.

Is there any place for vague language within legislation?  What I mean by that is we have had a lot of reference to the advisory council &ldquo;having regard to&rdquo; Government policy.

To deal with the Climate Change Advisory Council, while it is hard to envisage an ideal composition, at the moment, the balance of expertise on the current committee is not correct.  Again, that is no reflection whatsoever on any of the individual members but simply the way the appointments were made.  We certainly need a lawyer or somebody with some legal background on the council, given the importance of our international and EU law obligations and how central they are in all of this.  My personal view is that it would be a good idea to have a member representing younger people.  The next generations, certainly in my experience of dealing with them as a university lecturer, bring very fresh perspectives and have very sharp insights into policy and on how to motivate and engage the public.  That is certainly something that could be considered.  The just transition also needs to be reflected in the make-up of that grouping.  Like many others, I feel very strongly about the gender balance issue and the importance of diversity in this day and age, and that should be a no-brainer.<br\/><br\/>It is important, of course, that we do not have an unwieldy council that is so big it becomes unworkable, so, again, important choices will have to be made about what composition is considered appropriate, and the particular areas of expertise that are needed to ensure it can do the job properly.  The resource issue should go without saying.<br\/><br\/>I will come back to the point I made earlier about the independence and transparency of the process.

It is a very robust and rigorous process which confirms the importance of the role they play.  Ultimately, once they are selected after a very intensive, competitive process, they are then appointed formally by the President, which again adds, in my view, a certain prestige to their role.

Taking the first question concerning causes of action, if the Bill is enacted and provides for a cause of action, it would certainly then be possible to sue for any alleged failure to meet specified targets, but again it would depend on the precise wording of the legislation.<\/p><p>It was also mentioned that someone could potentially make a challenge if an adequate target was not set to begin with.  That is certainly a possibility.  I say that based on some observations the Chief Justice made in the Climate Case Ireland judgment in which he explored the possibility of further litigation in this area based, perhaps, on constitutional rights.  If the court were to be convinced that the Government had not acted adequately to protect people's constitutional right to life and constitutional right to bodily integrity, for example, there may well be a case where the court might have to step in and order the State to take a particular course of action.  That is a possibility.  It is untried and untested so far.  Based on reading the Climate Case Ireland judgment, we should be on the lookout for it.  It should concentrate minds when drafting this legislation because everybody wants to avoid litigation.  If the job of work to be done on this Bill is done well, it should result in less scope and capacity for litigation.<\/p><p> I also agree with the comment made that a 2050 target is so far away, it is impossible for the ordinary punter to get their head around it.  The need for clear interim targets is fundamental and vital for ongoing accountability to track how we are doing.  The public sector duty, which was also mentioned, applies across the board to public authorities.  There may be no need to replicate it here because it is covered in other legislation.  However, that should be considered carefully while working through the Bill.<\/p><p> There was the suggestion for a permanent climate action citizens' assembly.  Another way to do that might be to consider the kinds of committees that might serve the CCAC.  There might be a just transition committee or other variations.  We should not create a structure that is so elaborate that it becomes very costly and by definition very slow-moving.<\/p><p> Those are some initial thoughts.  I will reflect further on how broad the just transition should be.  That is a difficult one, but there is good material on that in the report of the Citizens' Assembly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101500002#K01900","nonspeaker":"Dr. &Aacute;ine Ryall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":645,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins is asking Dr. Ryall to comment on the SDGs and the biodiversity aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020101500002#L00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602716400,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I was just conscious of time.

The point about the 2050 target being far away is very well made.  I would make a broader point about <i>ex post<\/i>accountability, or accountability once targets have been missed.  That is a suboptimal form of accountability because we know that once greenhouse gases are emitted, they stay in the atmosphere for decades to centuries.  We need robust accountability mechanisms as we go along.  We need strong requirements on the Government to plan in a way that is consistent with the carbon budgets and the 2050 goal.  I emphasise the need for strong requirements on the Government to plan in a measured way to develop the climate action plan and long-term strategy in a manner that is consistent with the carbon budgets and the 2050 goal.  That is the kind of accountability that was demonstrated in the Supreme Court decision.  It was not that the Government had failed to achieve a decarbonisation objective; it was that it had failed to plan in a way that was consistent with delivery of the objective.<br\/><br\/>On the points about SDGs and biodiversity and perhaps also just transition, these are all very important elements and principles.  Like Dr. Ryall I think I will need to reflect more on how the different points raised could best be incorporated into the Bill.  As I said in earlier contributions, the Bill provides an overarching framework.  It does not develop all the policies we will need to deliver strong climate action.  There is a trade-off between including everything we think is important and not overloading what is essentially meant to be the framework for action rather than action itself.<br\/><br\/>On having a citizens' assembly on climate change on a permanent basis, I concur with Dr. Ryall that we need robust mechanisms for public engagement and public involvement in decision-making, but we need to do so in a way that does not become excessively cumbersome and costly.  I think there is a balance to be struck there.  It certainly is important to include mechanisms for public involvement and to build societal consensus.  Not every detail of that should necessarily be in this legislation.<br\/><br\/>Just because something is not in this Bill, it does not mean that we think it is not vitally important.

I congratulate all members on their new positions on the committee.  It is extremely positive that the committee has decided to address this issue so early in its deliberations and I hope this proactive approach can be mirrored in other committees.<br\/><br\/>I am speaking to the committee on behalf of Coalition 2030, which is an alliance of 75 leading international and local civil society organisations.  The coalition is made up of both international and domestic NGOs, including D&oacute;chas and World Vision, which are also presenting today.  Members also include youth organisations, environmental groups, academics, and trade unions.  Our members work in a variety of areas, from humanitarian relief to labour rights and environmental sustainability, in Ireland and over 50 countries around the world.<br\/><br\/>I will begin by providing a brief overview of the goals and Ireland&rsquo;s response.  I will then outline how the committee has a key role to play in ensuring effective monitoring and accountability.  I will briefly address the policy context and finish by putting forward recommendations on how the committee can respond to these issues.<br\/><br\/>I appreciate that this is far from the first time many members will have come across the UN SDGs, particularly the Chairman in light of his previous ministerial roles, but I would like to briefly provide some background.  The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted by Ireland and 192 other countries in 2015.  This agenda is made up of 17 SDGs which provide an overarching framework &quot;to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all&quot;.  They are not merely directed at the global south.  All states, including Ireland, are obliged to adhere to them and ensure they are reflected in domestic policies.  The goals are designed to ensure progress is made globally by 2030 to end extreme poverty, eliminate inequality, respond to the climate emergency and stop environmental degradation.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade played an admirable role in their agreement, having co-chaired the negotiations.<br\/><br\/>It is essential that this committee understands that the SDGs cannot be treated at any level of Government or in any state as a type of branding or promotional exercise.  Equally, it is not an <i>&agrave;<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b><i>la carte<\/i>menu from which we can pick and choose which goals to prioritise.  Rather, the agenda sets out an interconnected policy framework for states to follow.  Beneath the 17 goals there are 169 individual sub-targets and 231 indicators across a range of policy areas which means progress, or inaction, can be systematically monitored.  The point here is that this is not some vague or lofty exercise.  On the contrary, the SDG framework is clear, specific and comprehensive, and must be integrated into Ireland&rsquo;s policy-making and planning.<br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s progress to date has been monitored against these targets and indicators by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, as well as EU and UN agencies.  The State submitted its first progress report to the UN in 2018.  In-depth analyses of Ireland&rsquo;s performance have also been carried out by national and international authorities.  I do not intend to go through the State&rsquo;s performance across the 17 goals, but it has been repeatedly highlighted that Ireland does not compare well with its neighbours in the context of targets relating to the environment, climate, participation in lifelong learning and access to employment for women and disadvantaged groups.  Challenges also remain in relation to targets on overseas development assistance and policy coherence, about which the committee will hear today.<br\/><br\/>How has the State responded to this?  Three years after signing the 2030 agenda, a national SDG implementation plan was produced, led by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The emphasis in this document on Ireland&rsquo;s SDG leadership at home and abroad was welcomed, as was the recognition of the key role of the Government in delivering progress, including through departmental reporting and State progress reports every two years.<\/p><p>The first of these progress reports was produced in 2018 and the second, due in 2020, was recently deferred until next year.  The national implementation plan, however, suffered from many of the same weaknesses of approach that we have seen in respect of climate policy.  Although the plan provided a mapping of relevant policies and departmental stakeholders, it did not include tangible, time-bound actions across the Departments and public bodies on how targets would be achieved.  Certain goals were linked to policies of only one Department despite being cross-cutting.  In short, it was more of an SDG promise than an SDG plan.  It is also important to note that neither the national planning framework nor the national development plan included a focus on the goals or sub-targets.<\/p><p> Of equal concern has been the seeming absence of leadership to ensure full mainstreaming of the SDGs across all levels of government.  It has never been clear how one SDG unit in one section of one Department is supposed to co-ordinate a whole-of-government approach to the SDGs.  From the outset, Coalition 2030 has advocated for the Department of the Taoiseach to take the lead.  Concerns have also been raised that while an interdepartmental working group and a senior officials group on the SDGs were put in place, these may be aimed more at periodic monitoring and reporting on the goals than ensuring a systematic and coherent approach to meeting the SDGs.<\/p><p> Until recently, the Department had been engaging positively with Coalition 2030 on steps towards the development of a new plan and on necessary consultation through a dedicated SDG stakeholder forum.  We were informed a few weeks ago, however, that progress on a new plan was on hold due to a restructuring decision to remove the relevant SDG unit in the Department.  We understand that co-ordination is to be assigned to new staff in the Department's climate division.  While this situation is far from clear and far from encouraging, this is an obvious moment to review how the Government is implementing the SDGs, and we again call for responsibility for co-ordination and coherence to be transferred to the Taoiseach's Department.<\/p><p> Where does the rubber meet the road for this committee?  The SDGs must be the key guiding benchmark for assessing departmental performance.  In Coalition 2030's letter to the committee in September, we addressed how the committee should take forward the recently approved D&aacute;il motion to address the SDGs as part of its work programme.  We emphasise that the committee must, first, examine the impact of domestic policies on developing countries by inviting relevant domestic policyholders such as the Minister with responsibility for climate action to address the committee; second, ensure that SDG targets and indicators are used to assess policy planning and implementation as part of the committee's ongoing deliberations; third, ensure that vulnerable groups are invited to provide their views on Ireland's response, something made perhaps more possible now that stakeholder inputs are being made online; and, fourth, address SDG implementation as a means of increasing State, regional and local resilience when examining responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p> In the policy context, the Covid crisis has seriously jeopardised progress on the SDGs both in Ireland and globally.  The committee will hear about how the effects of the pandemic are compounded by pre-existing drivers of humanitarian need and injustice such as conflict, climate change, environmental degradation and unsustainable food systems.  However, the pandemic also makes the achievement of the SDGs all the more relevant.  UN authorities have emphasised that the SDGs constitute a ready-made framework to increase long-term resilience and ensure a just recovery for the most vulnerable.<\/p><p> The experience of Coalition 2030, however, has been a gap in meaningful systems for accountability for implementation of the SDGs.  The programme for Government does include a commitment \"to implement the SDGs and to promote their implementation around the world\".  From a foreign affairs perspective, it is important to monitor Ireland's delivery of the SDGs both in terms of Ireland's support to the delivery of the SDGs globally, in particular through Goal 17 on international partnerships, particularly in meeting commitments on overseas aid, and regarding how progress on key goals at home can impact people living in developing countries.  The committee will find in Coalition 2030's written statement examples from Tr&oacute;caire, representatives of which, unfortunately, could not be here today, of how inaction on climate change, business and human rights impacts those in the developing world.  Ireland needs to make urgent progress on Goal 13 on climate action.  This is key to tackling the devastating effects of the climate emergency in developing countries at the front line of the crisis.  Furthermore, making progress on Goals 8 and 10 is crucial to strengthening Ireland's approach to business and human rights.<\/p><p> Finally, we emphasise that the committee should have as part of its agenda Ireland's international support to the delivery of the SDGs as well as oversight of key domestic policies.  Coalition 2030 supports D&oacute;chas's recommendation on the need for a mechanism for policy coherence for sustainable development to ensure coherence across domestic and foreign policies.<\/p><p> Coalition 2030 asks that the committee write to the Taoiseach to request that the Department of the Taoiseach take responsibility for leading and co-ordinating Ireland's SDG response and ensure that an SDG action plan is produced in 2021 based on early consultation.  We also ask that the committee write to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, first, to support the delivery of the goals internationally, particularly in Ireland's leadership position on the UN Security Council, the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly; second, to ensure that relevant SDG targets and indicators are integrated into the Department's statements on strategy and reporting; and, third, to develop a transparent and well-resourced mechanism for policy coherence for sustainable development, as previously mentioned.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its time.

We did a mapping that found our members are covering at least 15 of the 17 goals, critically providing assistance on the ground but also, as Mr. Mac Evilly said, connecting that work back here in Ireland and making sure that our domestic policies are coherent against what we are trying to help and support local communities to do on the ground.<\/p> <p>  I also thank Mr. Mac Evilly for giving that strong overview of the interconnectedness of the goals.  It is important to say they are so relevant today in response to Covid-19.  What we are hearing from members is that it has been a particularly difficult year, as I am sure the committee will appreciate, but Covid is very much exacerbating those trends we already knew about, those structural issues of inequality, climate change and migration.  Covid-19 is also magnifying the hidden abuses surrounding human rights defenders, environmentalists and journalists.  All of these abuses restrict essential freedoms for civil society.  It is important, however, that the committee hear that the 2030 agenda, the sustainable development goals, is a framework of hope and optimism, and I cannot help but feel we desperately need that right now.<\/p> <p>  In preparing for this meeting I had a quick chat with David Donoghue, Ireland's former ambassador to the UN, who was critical in the writing of the SDGs.  I checked in on the feeling at the UN and in multilateral circles.  Mr. Donoghue said that while they were concerned that the SDGs would have been forgotten in the Covid crisis, they are realising that they are more important than ever.  They are a positive response.  We can build from this, not just to help us meet the challenges.<\/p> <p>  I see that the Chairman is physically in the room.  I did not have the privilege of being there in 2015 when he signed up to this commitment for Ireland but I was there at the UN General Assembly in September of last year.  The SDGs are about bringing diversity and about multilateralism in action.  It was incredible to me to see the sense of energy behind them from so many different areas of the system.  That is something I really want to convey to the committee today.  There is real energy and optimism behind these goals.  It is no mean feat in today's relatively fractured world that this is one of the few international statements that every country has signed up to.<\/p><p> Nevertheless, we are, as Mr. Mac Evilly stated, at a crossroads.  According to a report I read in September, the social progress index of 2020 found that if we carry on at the same rate, we will not achieve the goals until 2092.  Perhaps more importantly, the committee will hear from Dr. Omollo later in the meeting about what this looks like on the ground where it matters most.  We have heard recent reports from the likes of the World Food Programme of the devastation that Covid is bringing, particularly in matters on which we thought we were making progress, such as hunger and poverty eradication.  As a Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation report stated, in terms of universal vaccine coverage we have gone back 25 years in just 25 months.  That is how important this agenda is.<\/p><p> Three policy areas are especially relevant for the committee, the first of which is the role of overseas development assistance, ODA, in achieving the SDGs.  The second is the importance of implementing the Government's international development policy that was signed two years ago, known as A Better World, and in particular its key focus on reaching the furthest behind first.  The third area is the importance of policy coherence for sustainable development, which the committee has heard reference to.<\/p><p> In 2018, this committee, in developing its review of Irish Aid, had identified the significance of the SDGs.  I draw members' attention to the importance of having robust structures of oversight to monitor progress, learn and ensure we deliver on the targets.  On overseas development assistance, it will not have missed members' attention that this week was a budget week, so it is important to recognise and thank the Government for its commitment to ODA.  D&oacute;chas was delighted and strongly welcomed the fact the Government was willing to maintain ODA at current spending levels, or about &euro;867 million.  This was critical to the work our members do.  The committee will hear from Dr. Omollo about what that means on the ground.  NGOs, where the money is funded, are the front-line workers.  They are making a difference and that is what ODA means for us.<\/p><p> ODA continues to have high public support.  We carried out a survey in August this year just to test that.  Two thirds of people surveyed said it was important even in these difficult times and even taking account of the pressure on the domestic environment.  That survey was strongly validated by a Eurobarometer report in 2019 that found that 93% of respondents supported Ireland's commitment to development and tackling poverty.  I do not underestimate, however, the pressure the Government is under in regard to budgets and that it will doubtless continue to be under in years to come.  We ask that the committee use its cross-party support to maintain that commitment, which will be critical in the years ahead.  Let us not lose sight of the target of 0.7% by 2030 that the Government has committed to and that Ireland has committed to since the 1970s, yet which figure in the past five years has been closer to 0.3%.  Every year that we do not make progress towards the target, the sum increases.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, stated he expects it to be about &euro;2.3 billion by 2030.  We are at only the &euro;900 million mark, and every year it gets tougher.<\/p><p> Second, it is not just about the money.  As members of this committee have often reminded NGOs, it is also about the quality of delivery.  That is why A Better World, the international development policy, is so important.  It is important to reiterate in these Covid times that we have been checking in on that and there is a sense that this policy is more important than ever.  It is fit for purpose.  We are hearing from our members that the structural challenges still need to be met.  Our development and humanitarian programmes need to continue in an even more active way than they have.  A central relevance for the committee in regard to A Better World is the phrase \"reaching the furthest behind first\".  That is the one we need to keep an eye on.  It is the main objective and it is where we will make the most impact.  We are asking that the committee pay particular attention to monitoring that and to understanding what success will look like, and by each year asking Irish Aid how progress is being made.<\/p><p> On the third issue, policy coherence for development, I will not go into the details because Mr. Mac Evilly has outlined some of the significant issues relating to why this is so important as a policy.  We need to be more determined to monitor policy coherence and to have honest conversations.  In the Coalition 2030 report of 2018, we specifically called for a formal policy coherence mechanism that was structured and well resourced.  It may also be worth considering what the European Parliament is likely to adopt, namely, to have a standing rapporteur on policy coherence for sustainable development.  We ask the committee to champion this need, to monitor progress honestly and to identify the issues of incoherence so that by 2030, we can stand together and say that, both domestically and internationally, Ireland has delivered on the goals.<\/p><p> I will conclude with a few key recommendations for the committee.  We ask that the committee, and each party represented therein, keep on the pressure to maintain ODA levels and, in particular, to ensure we reach the target of 0.7% of GNI by 2030.  We ask it to scrutinise how Irish Aid's A Better World policy will be met and specifically in regard to reaching the furthest behind first.  It might consider that when the progress report on the SDGs in respect of Ireland is written, that objective will be at its core.  That is what will make the difference and it should be spotlighted.<\/p><p> Members will be aware that Ireland will take its seat on the Security Council from next year.  We ask the committee to work with civil society to highlight forgotten crises and conflicts where Ireland can make a positive difference.  The SDGs are not explicit in the agenda of the Security Council, but given that it has to address the drivers of conflict, it also stresses the importance of partnership.  The SDGs have to remain a guiding framework for Ireland's engagement.  Last but not least, we support the call by the OECD's development assistance committee and Coalition 2030 for a strong policy coherence mechanism.<\/p><p> Before I hand over to Dr. Omollo to explain what this looks like on the ground, most of all we ask that the committee be a champion of the SDGs.  They are really important.  We need urgency, consultation about them, and each to believe we have a role in delivering this in partnership.  If we do that, we will make a very significant difference for the people who are most vulnerable at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020101500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Keatinge","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602716400,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Keatinge and Mr. Mac Evilly for the excellent overviews.  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the committee.  The work it does in boardrooms and the decisions it makes are truly significant in transforming lives not only in Ireland but beyond, and especially in east Africa, where I work.<\/p><p>I begin by thanking the committee on behalf of the millions of children in east Africa whose lives have been transformed as a result of the generosity of the Irish people and the Irish Government through Irish Aid.  <\/p><p> Our task is immense but many of the pathways to change are in plain sight.  A transformation of our societies and economies is required to pursue them.  We need global action, local action and popular action.  That is why we are here today.  Children in Ireland are not aware of this meeting.  Neither are the children of South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, Somalia and the larger Horn of Africa, where I work and where the work of Irish Aid is transforming millions of lives.  However, this committee meeting is preparing a battleground for the future of children in Ireland and abroad, where Irish Aid is saving lives and transforming livelihoods.  If there is anyone who doubts the significance of this committee and the meeting it is having, the answer lies in the story I am about to tell. <\/p><p> As we discuss the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the accompanying sustainable development goals, SDGs, we are preparing the present for the future and leaving no-one behind.  We are grateful that while Ireland rightly continues to strive to attain SDGs at home, it has never lost its humanitarian zeal for sharing resources with the countries in greatest need.  For this, I thank the committee again.  Simply put, Irish Aid has brought smiles back to the faces of millions of children across Africa.  Irish people should be proud of that.  I want to echo something Ms Keatinge said.  As Ireland takes its non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council, it has a truly unique opportunity to implement change and to advocate strongly for resolutions to the various conflicts and crises of this region. <\/p><p> In working with children across east Africa, we often go beyond the call of duty to give students some hope, inspiration and belief in a bright future.  When I ask children what they think about the world today, I get various responses.  Most of the responses touch on rights, education, health, sustainable peace, better nutrition and other issues.  However, a response from a 13-year-old girl living in a displaced persons' settlement camp in South Sudan is etched indelibly in my mind.  When I asked this girl what she thought about the world today, she said she feared for the future.  She did not want to go home because the soldiers would take her.  They would rape her or kill her.  She said that if they raped her, she could get pregnant.  She was truly afraid.  She did not want to go back home.  She said she would die.<\/p><p> If one asks children in Ireland what they think about the world today, I am certain the response will not be as dramatic as that.  However, there is a common denominator.  That common denominator is fear.  Children are afraid of the future.  This pandemic has only exacerbated an already fragile situation.  This committee must remember that its deliberations and decisions go a long way towards bringing hope to millions of children in east Africa and beyond.  This 13-year-old girl from South Sudan may live to tell a different story thanks to Ireland's aid, support and generosity.  <\/p><p> I say this because development is faltering in many parts of the world.  The gaps leave so many people behind.  A lot of the communities I work with in this part of the world struggle to make enough income to survive or get a decent meal each day.  They struggle to secure healthy lifestyles and to access education.  They have no means to protect themselves against crises.  Life becomes even more precarious as forests and lands are degraded by drought and land no longer yields enough food.  In east Africa, locusts have truly exacerbated an already nasty situation.  In many respects, economies and institutions have failed to deliver.  Not only do they make life worse for many people, they have put all of us on a course that will destroy our planet.  Our only hope is to change dramatically.   That is why the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to which this committee has committed calls for prosperity, sustainable peace and a clean and safe planet for all of us.  In other words, it addresses the cry of this 13-year-old from South Sudan and millions of other children who are asking to be part and parcel of this prosperity, to have a clean and safe environment and to enjoy sustainable peace.<\/p><p> Ireland is leading the way.  While other Governments have cut overseas development aid, Ireland is protecting it.  It is also calling for additional supports.  I thank the Irish people, the Irish Government and this committee, which have been steadfast in pushing for this agenda.  If there is one thing I will take back to the children in east Africa, it is that the Government and the people of Ireland will continue to accompany them and will not leave them behind.<\/p><p> Governments in this region are doing their part.  Most governments have clearly demonstrated that with good governance, fiscal and monetary discipline, enhanced accountability and partnerships with the private sector it is possible to achieve some of the SDGs.  Countries like Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and even South Sudan, a country that has experienced protracted conflict, have recently shown tremendous progress.  This applies even in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic.  We have seen progress in education and health, but we are not there yet.  There is a long way to go.  We are making this call in appreciation of the work Ireland does in accompanying us on this journey. <\/p><p> As the committee deliberates on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, I ask it to keep three things in mind.  First, members should never be in any doubt that overseas development aid and Irish Aid are transforming lives.  I say this in my field of practice, I say it to the children I work with and I say it to the communities and stakeholders I engage with.  I thank the committee for protecting it.  I thank the Government and the people of Ireland for always punching above their weight. <\/p><p> Second, we are calling for heightened advocacy and transformative change.  Ireland already had a powerful voice, but it has a more powerful voice today because of the seat it has secured on the UN Security Council.  This should be used to galvanise the global public, civil society, business, unions, the media, academia, youth and communities to champion and practice sustainable development.  <\/p><p> Third, I will soon go back to the children of east Africa and once again meet that 13 year old girl in the settlement camp in South Sudan.<\/p><p>We must reaffirm them and give them hope and inspiration.<\/p><p> I have just presented a small contribution to this committee and the committee is alive to the issues and challenges we experience in the field.  This committee, the Irish people and the Irish Government will not leave us behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020101500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Omollo","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Omollo for that fine address and for taking time to join us in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020101500002#E00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":666,"content":"<p>Dr. Omollo spoke of hope and optimism but I am afraid I do not see much of either.

I made the point at the time that many of them were economic migrants and I have no difficulty with that.  We have been economic migrants in this country for hundreds of years.  To me, this signals a failure of overseas development.  I am in my sixties and for as long as I can remember we have been donating money to various organisations in the Third World and to Africa, in particular.  For some reason or other, nothing seems to have improved and I find that deeply distressing and depressing.  I wonder what is happening to the funding that is going there.  With limited funding in this country and in countries of similar size, we have managed to use education to turn the fortunes of the country around.

There was a strong message about our responsibilities and duties.  That is something I hear and it comes across very powerfully.<\/p> <p>  I want to deal with the issue of the sustainable development goals, Ireland's ranking and how we are performing in terms of our commitments across the 17 different areas.  I am looking at the 2019 index and comparing it with those of some of our EU neighbours.  The witnesses did not go into this in their contributions but our performance has been less than satisfactory.  Of 15 comparable EU countries, Ireland ranks 11th.  When one looks through the SDGs, Ireland is ranked tenth in SDG 2 out of 15 comparable countries.  We are also tenth for gender equality and 11th for reduced inequality.  That trend continues right the way down.  We rank very well on SDGs 4, 6 and 16 but the rest are disappointing.  I would like the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  One of the asks is that there would be a new national SDG action plan for 2021 and that it would be based on early consultation with civil society.  I know there are only a couple of months left to go on the existing national action plan for 2018 to 2020.  Contained in that plan, there was a series of 17 goals and targets across a range of different areas and there were 19 committed actions.  How have we performed on the existing action plan?  With only a couple of months before a new action plan should be coming into place in 2021, I take it from the ask earlier that early consultation with civil society would start.  I take it that with two months left to run on this plan, this has not happened.  We might get a comment from the witnesses on that.<\/p> <p>  On ODA, I hear everything that is being said by the witnesses and I also welcome the announcement in the budget to ensure there is funding for current spending to continue.  It is disappointing, however, that we are not making strides towards meeting our commitment to spending 0.7% of GNI on ODA and I firmly believe we need a roadmap for that.  We will be discussing our draft work programme in this committee later on as to how we will go about achieving that.  As part of that conversation, maybe some of the witnesses will be back before us to deal with that specific issue.<\/p> <p>  Those are my comments, questions and points about the goals and actions Ireland has committed to in the national action plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020101500002#E00500","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":669,"content":"<p>I will be brief because I have to attend a meeting of the Committee on Climate Action.

I would not say that we have had a failure of overseas development aid.  In fact, very progressive work has been taking place, including work funded by the Irish Government that we have been supporting in east Africa and other areas.  We have done a lot of work on maternal and child health.  We are seeing huge increases in the number of lives saved among children who are reaching their second birthday because of the interventions during pregnancy and the first 1,000 days of lives, nutrition messaging and healthcare provision.  I was thinking yesterday that not only is ODA working but Ireland and Europe can learn some facts because Africa has been dealing with many pandemics for much longer than we have been dealing with Covid.  We are just finishing a project where we are supporting Ebola vaccinations in east and southern Africa.  We have much to learn from what countries in those regions have been doing.  Not only has overseas development aid had many successes but there is much we can learn as we face into these contexts on the globe.<\/p> <p>  Like Dr. Omollo, I was also in South Sudan early last year.  I met many of the schoolchildren who are able to access school and can read and write because of the interventions and support of Irish Aid.  I asked the parents if education was the right thing and if it was what they need now.  They told me that if they did not have education, they would find themselves in the same situation in 100 years.  People see education and the various interventions supported by Irish Aid as a pathway.  It is slow and gradual and we know there is no magic bullet to development.  Ireland needed a lot of external support for our development and we know that this is a complex situation.  However, strong improvements are being made. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020101500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Sadlier"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602716400,"counter":673,"content":"<p>Sometimes when I hear the question of whether aid is making a significant impact in the field of practice, I understand it as asking whether government institutions are working.  To be bold and brutal in response, one challenge we may face is that government institutions are not well equipped to take over the co-ordination and control mechanisms in terms of leading from the front line.  In actions in the humanitarian and development field where most of civil society and non-governmental organisations and other participants are engaged, we see a remarkable improvement and advancement of the sustainable development goals, as Mr. Sadlier said, particularly in health.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned the areas in Rwanda, some cases in Tanzania and Irish Aid in South Sudan which just recently accessed affordable healthcare.  The reduction in morbidity and mortality rates is evident.  That is especially the case in education, where school drop-out figures are staggering.  Today's drop-out rate is almost 40%.  Children having access to education is key.  Some of us are beneficiaries of Irish Aid.  We are here today.  I said earlier that one of the big things Irish Aid does is it transforms lives so that people like me can sit here today and speak to the committee because I am a beneficiary of Irish Aid.  My life has been transformed.  I have lived in Ireland for 26 years; it is my home.  There examples from many areas where Irish Aid's work in the area of overseas development aid has transformed lives.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt in my mind.  I speak to communities and children and also to Governments.  When I project my voice and advocate on behalf of students for change, I say clearly that overseas development aid and the work that is being done within the aid fraternity works.  As I said earlier, our challenge is to enhance our efforts in making certain that there is capacity enhancement and technical skills to support government institutions because ultimately local ownership is key to sustainable development.  That is where we need to divert our efforts.  We must ask how we can build stronger institutions and infrastructure to ensure that local capacity is embedded in the community and that community ownership is respected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020101500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Omollo"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms Finan from D&oacute;chas to contribute briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020101500002#F00400","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602716400,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak to the committee.  On migration, more people than ever live in a country other than the one in which they were born.  That applies more to Irish people than people from anywhere else.  Ireland has a strong history of emigration.  The key point to recognise with regard to where we are now with migration is that it is a failure, not of overseas development, but of multilateralism and co-operation between states and agreements that we are seeing people stuck on islands or drowning as they try to reach safety.  Ireland has done fantastic work in recent years to try to bring about international co-operation and agreement through the sustainable development goals, the global compact on migration and on refugees.  What we need to see now is implementation of those agreements and states coming together and agreeing that they will action what has been agreed.  It is still a huge issue that we have not been able to home people and bring them to where they need to be but I think Ireland is playing its part where it can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020101500002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Finan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602716400,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Mac Evilly to give some facts and figures in response to Deputy Brady's second question on progress on the sustainable development goals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020101500002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Keatinge"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602716400,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brady for his questions and Deputy Leddin for the points he made on taking forward some of our recommendations, particularly writing a letter to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as noted in our written statement.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Brady's comments, the Department has been clear on areas where Ireland has not been progressing as strongly as we would like in its progress reports and submissions to the UN voluntary national review.  The national implementation plan has positive elements on Ireland's vision, mission and commitment to the sustainable development goals, both in Ireland and abroad, and has been providing a mapping exercise within it.  Where we are falling down is that we are not seeing the types of clear procedures, accountability and governance to ensure the Government has a clear path to meeting these goals and targets by 2030.  There is a commitment in the existing plan that the Government would produce a new strategy within its lifetime.  That has not happened and there are only two months left of 2020.  We need a new strategy with clear direction towards the targets rather than merely an updated plan.  <\/p> <p>  We have engaged quite positively with the Department as part of a sustainable development goals stakeholder forum on which Coalition 2030 members sit.  There is also a commitment to consult on the development of a new strategy.  That needs to take place immediately.  As part of that consultation, it is very important that the stakeholder forum is not used as merely a means of updating civil society.

It does not go far enough towards meeting our goals but, at this time and with the circumstances associated with Covid, it is a welcome move.<\/p> <p>  Anecdotally, we have learned of many charitable organisations - in Lesbos, for example - that are finding it very difficult to fundraise.

That is just a suggestion.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that the coronavirus has affected all of us, particularly those in areas of conflict and crisis around the world.

I believe Ms Keatinge said the vaccination programmes in the developing countries have been set back by 25 years.  Maybe I did not pick her up correctly.  If it is the case, it is very disturbing.  With God's help and the help of our scientific people, we will have a vaccination for Covid shortly.  If so, there will be a major challenge in ensuring it has global reach and gets to the developing countries and impoverished regions.  I am interested in Ms Keatinge's comments on whether there is any way in which we can support such an exercise.  Has she been thinking this through?  How do we get the vaccination to the very deprived and difficult areas and have it accepted in them?<\/p> <p>  It is alleged that there have been efforts in some European countries - there are one or two notable cases - to thwart human rights under the guise of Covid.  Is there much evidence in the developing world that Covid is being used as a cover for a denial of human rights, or that there is a risk that measures introduced will be used in that way and continued?<\/p> <p>  On migration, we all have to take our share of migrants and play our part.  We could have done better as a country recently in the last take-up.  After a particular incident, we could have taken more families.  We should certainly be proactive in that area.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses will obviously respond affirmatively to my next point but I am interested in knowing the extent of progress.  The clear necessity is to prevent migration in the first place.  I do not know whether we are making much progress, through development aid and other methods, on thwarting migration.  Achieving peace in troubled places around the world is obviously a major factor in this regard.  Significant emphasis needs to be placed on giving people no reason to migrate in the first instance.<\/p> <p>  I am happy that we have maintained the development aid in the present context but we need to increase it to reach our goals for 2030.  I hope this process will begin next year.  I was impressed by the list of achievements on development aid.  It is important that people realise what they are.<\/p> <p>  One of the popular barroom accusations on development aid and donations to good causes is that they do not go to the source and that there are too many people in the middle.  I am reassured that the witnesses are being vigilant in this area.  I would like to hear about this matter again.  Taxpayers do not want us not to give the aid; they want it to be given but they also want to know that it is hitting the spot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020101500002#G00300","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":681,"content":"<p>I want to return to Ms Keatinge, not only to have her answer the questions but perhaps to make some brief closing remarks.

I am aware that time is short.  With regard to the difficulty of fundraising, Senator Ardagh raised a really important point.  It is really important in the first instance, however, to acknowledge that Irish Aid, which gives a lot of assistance to NGOs, has been very flexible in this time of Covid such that we have been able to adapt and deliver on the ground.  We need to see that continue.  The flexibility has really helped us to continue our work and to have an impact in these difficult times.<\/p> <p>  As the Senator said, public fundraising is a genuine concern.  For us and many of our members, it will get harder.  In this initial stage, there is genuine empathy around the experience of Covid in developing countries.  Therefore, our members are not seeing a dramatic drop-off in public fundraising.  It is obviously harder, and members are working much harder online to get funding but it does speak to people's empathy.  We need that to continue, however, and to continue looking for ways to sustain funding.  As has also been said, we need to go further than we have done.<\/p> <p>  To answer Deputy O'Reilly's question on universal vaccination, the matter is referred to in the Gates Foundation report.  Again, however, it is important to state in terms of Covid that much of the conversation is about the fact that we cannot afford just to have the vaccination in the West alone.  Dr. Mike Ryan always says that if we are to overcome Covid, there will have to be a response for everyone and everywhere.  No one is safe until there is a global response.  That message has really got through, especially in the development of vaccines.  When a vaccine is available, it will be a matter of access and distribution on the ground.  The framework and systems are in place to be used so it is important that there be a sense of hope if and when a vaccine is available.<\/p> <p>  On human rights, an important point to be made is that some freedoms have been rowed back on under the cover of this crisis.<\/p><p>That is something we need to track carefully.  One of our Irish NGOs, Front Line Defenders, is doing important work on this and it may be appropriate for it to come and share with the committee what that human rights situation looks like.<\/p><p> I will end it there and leave a few moments for my colleagues to conclude.  I again thank the committee.  I hope that in the short intervention today we have convinced it that the sustainable development goals agenda is a positive framework.  It is ambitious but it is exactly what we need at this time.  We look forward to the committee's support and to ongoing dialogue to make sure Ireland does as much as it can to deliver on these promises. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020101500002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Keatinge","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Keatinge.

A question was posed on whether aid is hitting the ground.  Over the years, and some of us have been watching this build for a very long period of time, we have seen tremendous progress even in areas and countries that are riddled with corruption and fraud.  Due to the stringent accountability measures that have been put in place, I can now say that the bulk of the aid that is provided reaches the targeted communities.  We are not there yet and there are certain countries where we still struggle but, by and large, aid is reaching the ground and making a huge difference.<\/p> <p>  There was another question about specific examples of aid making a difference to the lives of communities here.  I now work with children in this part of the world in eastern Africa.  I have visited many countries that Mr. Sadlier has visited, such as South Sudan, and we went to Rwanda together.  The testimony of the difference is clear when one talks to the children and sees the benefits and impacts on their lives.  There is a transformation.  There are two areas where this aid has made a major difference in the last decade.  The first is health and access to affordable healthcare, where people were really struggling.  One of the reasons Covid-19 has had less of an impact in this part of the word, though there are many reasons for it such as mobility and other things, is that health infrastructure was greatly enhanced over the past ten years thanks to the official development assistance, ODA.  Health infrastructure has really improved.  The second area is education which has also improved.  We have seen free access to and passion for education growing in many areas in this part of the world.  Those two issues, namely, health and education, are a key example of where aid has made a major impact.<\/p> <p>  I again thank the committee.  I am truly humbled that I have been given this opportunity to speak with it for the very first time.  I am taking a very powerful message back to the children, which is that Ireland, the Irish community and the Irish Government will not leave them behind.  It has shown that by protecting the ODA. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020101500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Omollo"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Omollo for the work he does on a daily basis.

World Vision Ireland has had considerable experience working on Ebola vaccinations over the last six years.  We worked with one of the leading pharmaceutical companies, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, in delivering a vaccine at community level and addressed some of the issues Senator Joe O'Reilly raised about how we reach the most marginalised people in far-flung places and ensure the vaccine is accepted.  We are holding a conference next Tuesday and Wednesday to reflect on the learning from our Ebola vaccine project, looking at the technologies we need to engage with people, the assessments we need to do and how to ensure community acceptance of vaccines.  I will send an invite to that conference through the clerk.  As we have seen here, already not everyone is accepting of a vaccine, so we know there is a lot of work to do and we have already done much of that thinking and planning in the African context.  We can certainly learn this way, as Senator Ardagh mentioned.<\/p> <p>  As Dr. Omollo said, there are not huge impacts from Covid in these areas but we foresee quite substantial aftershocks.  While the Covid figures may not be as high as feared, there are major issues of schools being closed, economies being shut down and child protection issues.  We are seeing many more knock-on effects.  In Ireland, very good protection systems have been put in place that have helped us somewhat but we do not have those protection systems in many parts of Africa so we are seeing these secondary aftershocks and the secondary epidemic will actually be much worse than the Covid epidemic.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to talk at length about our vaccine experience but this is perhaps not the time.

It has been some time since I last attended a meeting of the committee.  The timing of this engagement is very appropriate, given what is happening with Brexit.  I will deliver my introductory remarks and am happy to then take questions or get into detail on the areas members wish to address.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to outline a number of issues relating to the Good Friday Agreement in the context of Brexit and I look forward to discussion with members.  It is good to have so many MPs for Northern Ireland joining us today.  This forum is an important and practical way to facilitate the all-island engagement that is so crucial on these issues.  It is great to have Mr. Farry with us in particular.<\/p> <p>  Protection of the Good Friday Agreement has been a fundamental priority for the Government from the very beginning of the Brexit process and at every phase of the negotiations since then.  That is reflected in the prominent place the protection of the Good Friday Agreement has in the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  This emphasis is in line with the central importance that the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland have not only for Ireland, but also for our EU partners.  It is vital that the protocol is now implemented in full and in good faith.  For our part, together with our EU partners, the Government has consistently urged the UK to move forward on operationalising the protocol.  Some of those present will be familiar with the issues that are still under discussion.  We have delivered this message through bilateral channels but also, very importantly, through our participation as part of the EU delegation on the joint committee on implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the specialised committee on implementation of the protocol.  The committees have met in recent weeks and months and are expected to meet again soon.  I understand the next meeting of the joint committee will take place next Monday and I expect that will trigger a meeting of the specialised committee shortly thereafter.<\/p> <p>  I wish to address the UK Government&rsquo;s internal market Bill.  Both Ireland and the EU have made clear our profound concern at the Bill, including in respect of the Bill as now amended.  The UK must move away from the path it has chosen in the Bill and work to rebuild trust on implementing the withdrawal agreement in full and in good faith.  The absence of that makes other agreements very difficult.  We have been particularly concerned by suggestions from the UK Government that its unilateral approach is designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement.  The protocol itself is specifically designed to protect the Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border.  It also protects the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland's place in it.  We spent years trying to design it in order to do that.<\/p> <p>  The protocol is designed to operate in all circumstances, including in the event that there is no EU-UK future relationship agreement or trade deal.  Our view is that these developments could seriously erode and damage political trust in Northern Ireland and between the EU and the UK.  The protocol was the result of long and difficult negotiations and represents a fair and balanced outcome for all parties.  There are many elements of the protocol that various people do not like, but it is the effect of the protocol as a whole that achieves important aims that we now need to protect.  There have been compromises on all sides.  We have been clear that implementation of the protocol should work for the economy and people of Northern Ireland, and indeed for the all-island economy and the people of this island as a whole, in as smooth a manner as possible.  Clarity and stability are vital for businesses and people in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The protocol provides for no diminution of the rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity provided for the people of Northern Ireland, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  We will continue to engage with UK counterparts on implementation of this important commitment.  The EU rights of Irish, and therefore EU, citizens from Northern Ireland are specifically addressed in the protocol.  It confirms that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy, exercise and have access to rights, opportunities and benefits that come with EU citizenship.  The Government is working proactively to ensure that people in Northern Ireland can continue to enjoy access to EU rights, opportunities and benefits into the future as they do today, including in regard to the benefits of the European health insurance card, EHIC, and the Erasmus+ programme.  Some of this is still to be addressed during transition.  I am happy to provide further detail on this to members during our discussion if they so wish.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, the common travel area, CTA, arrangements underpin the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, as well as the cross-Border freedoms central to the lives and livelihoods of the people of Northern Ireland and the Border region more generally.  The CTA will be maintained in all circumstances.  Irish officials across the government continue to work with UK counterparts to ensure the interests and reciprocal rights of our respective citizens are maintained and safeguarded by the CTA.  We have done significant work on that and legislation will come before the Oireachtas in the coming weeks to ensure we legally underpin some of the elements of the CTA memorandum of understanding with the British Government.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the resumption of meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council since I last attended a meeting of the committee.<\/p><p>A plenary session was held on 31 July and ministerial meetings on sectoral issues continue, bringing our Government and the Northern Ireland Executive together to oversee and further develop North-South co-operation as provided for in the agreement.  North-South co-operation is recognised and protected in the protocol and will remain a priority for successive Irish Governments.  To build normal relations on our island, we must continue to co-operate formally and informally in the areas which are important to our people, <\/p><p>our businesses and our environment.  <\/p><p> A planned &euro;500 million will be made available in budget 2021 out to 2025 to deliver on our commitment to build a shared island underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.  This complements the Government's existing all-island commitments.  <\/p><p> As I am sure members will appreciate, the next few weeks are crucial with regard to ongoing work to secure an agreement between the EU and UK on a future partnership.  I attended the General Affairs Council earlier this week, where I and my colleagues from across the EU 27 member states considered the outstanding issues, not only on the future relationship but also regarding implementation of the protocol which I am sure we will go into in some detail later. <\/p><p> Significant challenges remain, but the EU is doing its utmost to work towards a successful conclusion of these talks in the coming weeks.  The EU-UK relationship will change regardless on 1 January.  It is vital that businesses, no matter how small, take immediate steps to understand the impacts the new rules or processes that will apply from 1 January 2021 will have on their operations.  Time is short and action is required now.   The Government's Brexit Readiness Action Plan provides information on these changes and the supports in place to assist businesses.  Many of those support were supplemented further in the budget that was passed this week.<\/p><p> In all circumstances, our relationship with the UK will remain crucially important but it will be different.  As co-guarantors, however, the two Governments will continue to have our <\/p><p>obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and we will continue to work together to deliver on our shared goals.  The Irish Government will continue to place the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process at the top of our agenda, working with the UK Government in partnership.

I thank the committee very much for the opportunity to join the meeting.  It is a great honour for the Alliance Party.  I want to put into context that we are a cross-community party and we do not take a formal position on the constitutional status, although we have a range of opinions inside the party.  We are, essentially, about making Northern Ireland work, but also respecting the whole range of relationships across these islands, including the North-South relationship.  We recognise that we are in a very fluid situation in terms of a range of debates that are happening across these islands and we are happy to take part in constructive, rational debates such as the debates of this committee.  We look forward to this discussion today and beyond.<\/p> <p>  I also express my thanks to successive Irish Governments for what they have done both in looking out for the interests of Northern Ireland within the Brexit process and also for standing up for the Good Friday Agreement more generally.  That is greatly appreciated and cuts across the traditional divide in Northern Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement is paramount.  The difficulty we have is that any form of Brexit involves some degree of a border or boundary.  That does not work in a society based on sharing and interdependence.  That is the difficulty that people have been wrestling with over the past number of years.  The backstop and then the protocol, while not perfect, are the response to decisions that have been taken by others.  It is important that we recognise this in that particular context and both respect what has been done and try to soften the impact as far as we can.  In that respect, both the UK Government and the EU can have a role to play. <\/p> <p>  It is also important for people to respect what the Good Friday Agreement actually stands for.  I am sure Ms Hanna will echo this in due course.  We are very concerned by what has happened in Westminster, with the UK Government twisting and distorting the meaning of the Good Friday Agreement for very narrow political ends.  The Agreement is more than just the principle of consent.  It is about the entirety of those relationships, including, obviously, the North-South one, and that wider context and understanding has been lost by some, is understood by others but is being abused as part of a wider process.  <\/p> <p>  The notion that the UK Government is seeking to breach international law on behalf of Northern Ireland businesses and the good of the Good Friday Agreement is something we regard as risible.  It is an utterly spurious argument that we reject.<\/p> <p>  Much of the focus has been on the movement of goods as the critical issue that is being debated at present.  I want to focus a little more on some of the issues relating to North-South co-operation such as services and free movement of people, particularly what is going to happen with EU nationals who are outside the common travel area arrangements.  In the services sector, we have a large degree of co-operation in dealing with an all-island economy.  The terms of the protocol do not cover that.  There are risks in the area of existing co-operation, never mind the future, from issues such as data adequacy agreements not being in place and mutual recognition of qualifications.  In turn, we need to get some degree of assurance on those issues, whether on a bilateral or a wider EU basis over the coming months.  That also leads to issues around the future of the European health insurance card and Erasmus+ and I am certainly encouraged by what the Minister said in that respect.  I certainly look forward to any elaboration in that particular respect.  <\/p> <p>  We are keen to see the common travel area dealt with beyond simply domestic legislation in both the UK and Ireland and to see it formalised as part of a bilateral treaty.  Once joint EU membership is stripped away, many loose ends may come to the fore over the coming years and it would be useful to try to address that.<\/p> <p>  My final point is that in the context of Brexit, we regard the North-South aspect of the Good Friday Agreement as still being relatively underdeveloped.  There is much more scope for practical co-operation on an all-island basis.  In that respect, we welcome the shared island initiative from the Taoiseach and the Irish Government and we are happy to pay a constructive role in that as we develop our economic, social, and environmental research and co-operation across a wide range of issues.  I thank the committee very much for the opportunity to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":706,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Farry.

The Good Friday Agreement tries to achieve the facilitation of more North-South co-operation.  This is the whole point of what we are trying to do.  It is encouraging to get his support in developing further cross-Border co-operation.  That is what we are trying to do in the shared island unit.  Not only do we want to do that politically, but we want to put serious money behind some of the projects that can spearhead that approach.  We have to have a partner to do that too.  We cannot spend money in Northern Ireland unless it is a joint partnership that allows us to do so with Ministers in the Executive in different areas, whether that is education, transport or many of the others we are looking at.<\/p> <p>  People will be familiar with the road projects that we are looking to co-fund and with the ambition for high-speed rail connectivity between Belfast, Dublin and Cork, with the possibility of spurs to Limerick and Galway.  I am also aware that a case has been made for Derry to link into that project.<\/p><p>We want to see cross-Border greenways and cycleways developed and we are willing to pay for that.  This is about connectivity, normality and relationships which, in a practical sense, is what North-South co-operation is about.<\/p><p> In terms of ensuring that people in Northern Ireland can continue to enjoy the benefits of being EU citizens even though they will be living outside of the EU, we are trying to ensure that anyone from Northern Ireland who travels into the EU will be an EU citizen.  An Irish citizen is an EU citizen, but for people living in Northern Ireland while outside of the EU, we want to ensure that they are protected and get the benefits of many of the programmes that are provided for EU citizens within the EU.  This is where the European health insurance card, EHIC, comes in, and ERASMUS.  I am on record that the Irish Government has committed to pay for this if needs be, but I suspect and hope we will be able to work out an arrangement with the British Government and with the Executive in Northern Ireland to ensure that EHIC and ERASMUS can continue to benefit people living in Northern Ireland.  They are two valuable schemes that can allow people to travel, including travel to study, across a Single Market, which is a real privilege.<\/p><p> On Dr. Farry's remarks regarding the common travel area and whether we can extend the benefits of it to EU citizens as well as Irish and British citizens, the common travel area is confined to British and Irish citizens in each others' country, providing, effectively, privileged access in terms of services.  Basically, the home country treats citizens of the other country as citizens of the home country.  For example, for an Irish citizen visiting or moving to the UK, access rights in terms of care provision, opportunities in terms of study, the ability to retain social welfare benefits to carry pension entitlements from one jurisdiction to the other, cross-Border healthcare provision, and the freedom to move and work as well as study in a post-Brexit environment are in many ways privileges that Irish people will have in the UK that no other EU national will have because of the common travel area.<\/p><p> Where this gets complicated and does not solve all of the free movement issues between Britain and Ireland is in regard to the many EU nationals living and working in Ireland who are a part of the Irish economy and of Irish society, in that the privileges and provisions of the common travel area when they travel into the UK do not necessarily apply in the same way as if they were Irish citizens.  People will be able to travel because free travel is guaranteed, but accessing employment and all of the other rights that come with Irish citizenship in the UK recognised under the common travel area do not apply if a person is not an Irish national.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#C00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":709,"content":"<p>My apologies to the Minister but I must move on to the Sinn F&eacute;in questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#D00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":710,"content":"<p>This is an important issue that does not get a lot of coverage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#D00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":711,"content":"<p>I agree it is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#D00400","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":712,"content":"<p>Dr. Farry also spoke about the twisting of what the Good Friday Agreement is.

We would love to see all of our Westminster colleagues tying into this committee.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister and his officials.  As I said to Dr. Farry, this is a critically important committee which is becoming more important in light of the global pandemic, Brexit and the Good Friday Agreement, the latter being key to its work.  The Minister, as a former Minister Agriculture, Food and the Marine, will appreciate the epidemiological status of the island of Ireland and how we use that to protect our livestock.  This should be the approach to protecting our people.  They are the most important and valuable commodity we have.  To that end, the Cabinet decision last night to increase the restrictions in Border counties was critical in terms of helping to stop the current spread of Covid-19 at this time.  However, as the Minister will know, many of my constituents are cross-Border workers who pay taxes and work in the South, but they live in the North and they were excluded from the pandemic unemployment payment.  Will this change?  This may not be the final lockdown before Covid-19 is dealt with.  It would be important to ensure that people are included in that scheme and any further schemes on the island, in particular in these very challenging times.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Gildernew"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602716400,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  Before I touch on Brexit, I would like to put on record my thanks from a constituency perspective.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has stepped in to the breach during Covid to increase the support to the Saint Patrick Centre in Downpatrick without being asked to do so.  The engagement has been very positive.  I want to put on record my thanks to the Minister and his Department officials for engaging in such a positive way.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to Brexit, I would like to make a couple of points on which the Minister touched earlier.  With regard to the Internal Market Bill, there are clauses in it that represent a direct attack on the withdrawal agreement and the protocol.  Fundamentally, they are also an attack on devolution, which has attracted less publicity in Ireland than it has in Scotland or Wales.  The Internal Market Bill deviates significantly from all strands of the Good Friday Agreement.  It removes powers from the devolved assembly, disapplies the European Convention on Human Rights and overrides the budgetary role of the Stormont Assembly and the Executive.  In that regard, the Bill establishes an undemocratic environment where the British Government can unilaterally and arbitrarily impose rules and regulations regardless of the decision of the Stormont Minister or the Executive.  One example is clause 46 of that Bill, which gives a British Government Minister the ability to impose spending programmes in devolved areas.  The Minister spoke earlier about having a partner in the North to work with.  This Bill gives the British Government the power to set aside partners and to do whatever it wants against the democratic mandate of the people in the North.<\/p> <p>  I know that the Irish Government and Europe have been very strong with regard to the protocol and the withdrawal agreement.  This Bill is an attack on the Good Friday Agreement.  Surely, there is no way an Irish Government can allow this type of violation to proceed.  Has the Irish Government discussed this in Cabinet and what is the direction of travel in terms of engagement with the British Government on these clauses?<\/p><p>Will this issue be raised with the British Government?  I ask that because it surely cannot be allowed to stand.  I also welcome the commitment regarding the European Health Insurance Card, EHIC, and access for students in universities to such programmes as Horizon 2020 and Erasmus.  People have welcomed those times in recent months when the Government has gone on the record in this regard.  I would, however, like some more operational detail.  Will legislation be brought forward shortly to confirm these aspects, or what is happening?  When can we expect to see details of what is being provided for?  Is there any idea of cost?  I saw one figure of approximately &euro;4 million to cover things such as EHIC.  I would just like to get to the bottom of when are we going to see the detail.  I ask this because people see that 31 December is only around the corner, they know what kind of territory we are in now, and they are anxious and frustrated.<\/p><p> I would also like to inquire about the progress on protecting the democratic rights of citizens in the North.  There was much discussion and talk about providing oversight or involvement regarding Northern citizens in the democratic process in Europe and there was some talk of observer status for MEPs, or whatever the designation might be.  Is this something that has come on to the Minister's radar and can we look forward to seeing some action on this issue in the months to come?  It is good to see the Minister again and I hope that it will not be too long before he is back in with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Hazzard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I call the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#E00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I think there was one more person from Sinn F&eacute;in, Mr. John Finucane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#E00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602716400,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Commitments in that regard from the British Government have already passed the time limit in respect of when it was stated that legislation would be introduced.

I will respond to Mr. Finucane first on the Emma De Souza case.  The Government provided consistent political support for the De Souza case and engaged at the highest level with the British Government on the issue.  I remember many of the conversations I had on that issue, and the related concerns for the citizenship and identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government has always been clear that the case taken by Ms De Souza in the UK courts was a private matter in respect of her immigration application, and decisions on the litigation have always been a matter for the De Souzas, in consultation with their solicitor.<\/p> <p>  We have, however, always supported Ms De Souza and I have met her and her husband several times.  We managed to mention the Emma De Souza campaign as a positive and effective one in the New Decade, New Approach agreement.  The British Government committed to changing \"the rules...[on] how people in Northern Ireland bring their family members to the UK\", \"taking into account the letter and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement\".  We will follow up on that issue, but it was a conversation I had many times with the previous Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I will follow up with the current Secretary of State.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to the question from Mr. Hazzard, we are very supportive of the St. Patrick Visitor Centre, and we will continue to provide funding for it.  It is worth saying, by the way, that we made the case for increased funding for the reconciliation fund for next year, given that we will be operating in the aftermath of Brexit, the continuation of Covid-19 and all the other pressures and strains being put on the system and on Border communities.  I would like to spend, and I am committed to spending, more money on the reconciliation fund next year, which I hope will be welcomed by everybody. <\/p> <p>  On the UK Government's Internal Market Bill, I do not think anybody can argue that I have not been vocal on that issue.  I have been on virtually every media outlet in Ireland and Britain, and indeed in the US, talking about why the Internal Market Bill is a serious mistake by the British Government.  It has backfired as a negotiating strategy.  It does not happen often that the five former Prime Ministers of the UK come out strongly in the way that they have in rejecting this approach and stating that it is not good for Britain or Britain's reputation internationally.  I agree with them.  It is, of course, not a good way to attempt to close out a negotiation that has been ongoing for nearly four and a half years.<\/p> <p>  I refer to creating the basis for a future relationship with a partner that is as important to the UK as the EU is, in a context where the UK Government is effectively saying, \"Give us what we want in the implementation of elements of this negotiation, or we will legislate for it domestically anyway\".  I suggest that is an approach that undermines trust and creates a whole series of questions that are unhelpful to this process.  It has also triggered a necessary legal response from the EU, which has issued notice that if things do not change within a month, then it will move to taking legal action to respond to a breach of international law, in the shape of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol, which is an international treaty and international law.  I have, therefore, been very vocal on this issue.  <\/p> <p>  I accept that our focus has been on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol, and perhaps less on the impact on devolved government.  I know, however, that there has been a strong reaction in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland regarding some of the other elements of the Internal Market Bill concerning the devolved governments of those countries.<\/p> <p>  Regarding EHIC and Erasmus, next week I will be bringing to Government the heads of the new omnibus Brexit Bill, if we want to call it that, which involves 11 different Ministers and I think has about 23 different Parts.  It is a big piece of legislation, which is very complicated.  Actually, the individual elements are not that complicated, but it looks that way because so many different Departments are involved.  We will be trying to do what is necessary, from a legislative point of view, to provide many of the protections which people have spoken about today.  That may well be an opportunity to deal with the issues of EHIC and Erasmus, although, hopefully, we can deal with them outside of the need to pass primary legislation.  I also hope that we can deal with them in partnership with the British Government.<\/p> <p>  Moving to the question posed by Ms Gildernew regarding co-operation on Covid-19, it is important to state that we have had several good conversations on the need for more consistency on both sides of the Border.  The Executive in Northern Ireland gets its advice from a different chief medical officer.  There is, however, much more consistency now and decisions being made on both sides of the Border are certainly cognisant of decisions and the numbers and spread of Covid-19 in the two jurisdictions.  I think we will continue to see much more co-operation in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On Ms Gildernew's other question on cross-Border workers, the rules are clear on this issue.  Where people live determines where they access welfare benefits.  People who live in Northern Ireland but who work south of the Border can be supported by the wage subsidy scheme through their employer.  That is determined by where people are working.  In cases where people lose their jobs, however, what social welfare payment, or PUP in our case south of the Border, is received is determined by where people live.<\/p><p>The Executive in Northern Ireland has responsibility for people who live in Northern Ireland in terms of the supports that are needed for people who are unemployed and our responsibility, of course, is for people who live south of the Border.  This is the legal position and I have outlined it many times.  There can be a cross-Border element of support in terms of wage subsidy and supports for employment and business.  It does not matter where people come from, it is where they are employed.  Effectively their social welfare payment or jobseeker's benefit, or PUP as it is in the case of the pandemic, is determined by where they are resident.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#E00800","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602716400,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I am very pleased to be able to participate.  I see engagement in the committee as a core part of our role as MPs.  I apologise on behalf of my colleague and party leader, Mr. Colum Eastwood, who is in the chamber at present expressing our concerns about the covert human intelligence sources Bill.  I appreciate the Chairman's very kind words about the importance of Northern voices in Westminster to correct some erroneous policy and perceptions.  I only wish there were not quite so many bad Bills that we have to try to address.  Mr. Eastwood is hoping to join the latter part of the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister for his effort and engagement over the past four years, for his fidelity to the Good Friday Agreement at all times and, in particular, for his robust response to the internal market Bill and, in general, the UK's recent stances.  We have been speaking about the immediate impact in terms of the movement of goods and people but the Minister understands very well that the Good Friday Agreement also has at its heart the primacy of the rule of law and agreed respectful democratic processes.  He knows the damage the internal market Bill and recent UK Government approaches are doing to this and he is right to highlight how important the devolution settlement is to the Agreement.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is also aware of our concerns about the implications of Brexit and the operation of the protocol.  Businesses are trying their best and I understand it is about getting businesses to engage.  He mentioned that businesses are trying their best to engage and prepare for what is coming to them but they are unable to do so in the absence of key information.  They are very much flying blind.  I certainly want to convey that deep anxiety of businesses and consumers, particularly in the context of the pandemic and the economic tightening we all know is happening and is coming.  People are anxious about the months ahead and the impact of Brexit.  I certainly echo Dr. Farry's comments that it is important to reiterate that these are the impacts of Brexit, and the issues with the protocol are merely a symptom of Brexit.  We appreciate the consistent efforts of the Minister and the Irish Government to try to get the information that people need and the clarity and the ability to operate that protocol.<\/p> <p>  I want to take this opportunity, because it bears repeating, to state how profoundly the SDLP regrets we are dealing with any east-west barrier.  The last thing we wanted was a barrier anywhere on these islands.  We absolutely acknowledge the worry and anxiety it gives to people of a unionist aspiration in particular.  We are certainly not blind to this.  In this vein, beyond all the practical issues regarding people and goods that are taking a lot of the airtime, working time and headspace, I know the Minister is very much attuned to the tension and disequilibrium caused by recent years and the polarisation and, in many cases, the regression of good relationships in Northern Ireland as well as North-South and east-west.  I share his welcoming that at least that Good Friday Agreement institutions are back up and running and we again have some of the opportunities and the possibilities of the Agreement to try to improve our situation, not least the North-South Ministerial Council and all that it offers.<\/p> <p>  The creation of the shared Ireland unit, and its approach and tone, is also very much welcome.  It will look at the politics and practicalities of closer North-South operation and I look forward to engaging with the unit and its work, particularly through the committee, as well as addressing issues regarding the past and legacy issues and, in future, better taking advantage of all the possibilities the Good Friday Agreement offered us 20 years ago, in terms of relationships in Northern Ireland as well as North-South and east-west.  These opportunities have not always been taken and they have certainly been disrupted and corrupted by Brexit.  There is still plenty we can do to try to make the best of the situation.

These are the questions that will determine the level of disruption linked to Brexit and the end of the transition period at the end of this year for business people, politicians and society as a whole.<\/p><p>On the protocol, the British Government has highlighted a number of key issues with which it has a problem.  It is legislating for one of these through the internal market Bill, which is the application of the state aid elements of the Northern Ireland protocol.  The British Government is stating it will not support a requirement for businesses in Ireland to have export summary declarations on the goods they export from Northern Ireland into Great Britain.  It regards this as a UK market and that, therefore, there should not be a formal export declaration process.  This issue can be resolved to the satisfaction of both sides.  There is still work to do on it.  The British Government is looking at technical alternatives to an export declaration that may be able to do the same job that would not be onerous or costly for businesses.  I am hopeful we are making progress on resolving this outstanding issue.<\/p><p>The British Government accepts fully that Northern Ireland effectively has to mirror EU state aid rules because what is happening effectively with the protocol in simple terms is that Northern Ireland is becoming a <i>de facto<\/i>extension of the EU Single Market for goods but not services.  We have to have commonalities in respect of state aid supports, otherwise there will be unfair competition in one jurisdiction or the other.  Where it becomes complicated is that many companies in Northern Ireland have a parent company in Great Britain.<\/p><p>If a future British Government were to give a large amount of state aid to a company in Great Britain that had a footprint or linked company in Northern Ireland, it would be a matter of whether the company in Northern Ireland had a competitive advantage that would undermine the fair competition on the island of Ireland guaranteed under the protocol.  The issue is whether the protocol impacts the British Government's decision-making on state aid in Great Britain.  The British Government is effectively threatening to legislate in domestic law to give a British minister the power to determine when it does and does not have an impact, which, of course, is completely inconsistent with the spirit and letter of the protocol.<\/p><p> The third issue concerns the application of tariffs and whether they should apply to certain goods that come from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.  The issue concerns goods at risk of finding their way into the EU Single Market through Northern Ireland from Great Britain.  If we do not have a trade deal, tariffs and the WTO rules will apply.  We have to find a way of differentiating between the goods we know are staying in Northern Ireland, and therefore in the United Kingdom, and goods that are at risk of leaking into the EU Single Market without a tariff having been paid, which would be required if goods moved between Britain and the European Union.  Coming up with a mechanism to determine that list is very difficult to get agreement on.<\/p><p> The truth on the three issues is that I believe we can find a solution to the first.  It is not easy but I believe we are making progress on it.  The two remaining issues will be solved if we have a trade deal that avoids tariffs and quotas.  On the state aid issue insofar as it relates to Great Britain, there will have to be a level playing field agreement for fair competition in any event and an associated governance and dispute resolution mechanism, whereby the state aid issue in Northern Ireland would be a non-issue as it relates to Great Britain.  On the third issue, if there is a trade deal, there will be no tariffs anyway so the goods-at-risk list would become a non-issue.  <\/p><p> What I suggest regarding the three issues is very doable if we can secure a trade deal that avoids tariffs and quotas and does a series of other things as well.  If, at a bare minimum, it avoids tariffs and quotas, two of the three key issues will be resolved in respect of the implementation of protocol.  In truth, there are also other practical issues, but they just have not been highlighted in the same way.  They relate to supermarket supply chains between Great Britain and Northern Ireland; rules of origin and whether businesses in Northern Ireland can benefit from EU trade agreements in the future; state aid applications pertaining to agriculture to ensure really fair competition on the island in terms of the agri-food sectors; and an EU presence in Northern Ireland providing reassurance that the protocol is being implemented in full.  These are the kinds of issues that are now being discussed by the specialised committee but, to be fair to both teams of negotiators, we are making progress on many of them now.  We are not making progress on all of them yet, but on many.  The timeframe is really short, however.  Even putting basic infrastructure into ports and airports in Northern Ireland on time is a big challenge now.  We realise how long it has taken to put infrastructure in place in Dublin and Rosslare ports.  It has taken 18 months but we only have weeks left.  Therefore, there are genuine time pressures if the protocol is to be implemented in full by 1 January 2021.<\/p><p> On the future relationship, I will be quick because I am aware that we are tight for time-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#F00300","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":728,"content":"<p>It is an important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#G00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":729,"content":"<p>-----but I hope people find this informative.  The future relationship arrangement is really difficult to conclude.  I spent quite some time with Mr. Michel Barnier this week talking about the outstanding issues.  There are many that relate to a future relationship, including data, data protection, aviation, haulage, energy co-operation, judicial co-operation, services, financial services, citizens' rights and movement, but the two core issues that will prevent an agreement on a basic free trade agreement concern what the European Union describes as a level playing field agreement.  It will not be called that in Westminster because that term is now not politically acceptable to many people.  Regardless of what one wants to call it, there has got to be fair competition between the two markets if they are to be able to trade with each other tariff free and quota free.  There must also be an agreement on a series of principles of fair competition in order for the foundations to be laid for the free trade agreement.  There has to be a governance mechanism that can deal with disputes if and when they arise because there is no way the European Union will sign up to the to an agreement if it believes the current or a future British Government can decide to provide in a targeted way financial supports through state aid that go way beyond what the European Union can provide to create competitive advantage for its own companies to be able to sell into the EU Single Market tariff free.  Why would that ever be facilitated?  This is not about threatening British sovereignty or forcing Britain to abide by EU rules, or anything like that; it is about having clarity and understanding around fair competition between the two markets so as to be able to have a free trade agreement that allows for trade that is as frictionless as we can make it in the current circumstances.  If we do not have the agreement on fair competition and a governance model that can deal quickly and independently with disputes, we will not have a trade deal.  That is the first issue.  We got an official briefing from Mr. Michel Barnier this week recognising that there has been some progress in this area.  It is important to recognise that.  The matter is far from agreed and concluded but there has been some progress.<\/p> <p>  The second area, fishing, is really difficult.  The two sides are miles support.  The European Union has essentially stated &mdash; correctly, I believe &mdash;  that, in the broadest sense, the United Kingdom is essentially asking for access to the European Union's energy market and the European Union is essentially asking the United Kingdom for access to UK fishing grounds.  This is about managing resources in a way that works for both sides.  Fishing is even more complicated because, of course, fish are migratory.  Mackerel comprise a major stock under dispute.  Many of the mackerel caught off the coast of Scotland are born off the coast of Galway.  They mature and grow into juveniles off the coast of Mayo, Sligo and Donegal.  They are primed for catching when they move into Scottish waters in many cases.  No one owns that stock.  It is a shared stock that is swimming between jurisdictions.  I hope we are realistic and mature enough to recognise that we have to get a fisheries deal that is fair to all sides in terms of managing these resources in a sustainable way.  There is a reason fishing was always linked to trade and other issues; it was so we could have an agreement that is balanced overall rather than a deal on fisheries that has been agreed in isolation and that has been considered in an emotive way in terms of the reclaiming of sovereignty, taking back control and all the other factors people have attached to the issue.  Realism in required in our approach.  From my perspective &mdash; I have been very blunt on it this week &mdash; the European Union will not sell out its fishing industry to get a trade deal on Brexit.  Both sides need to understand that.  Of course there is an agreement to be negotiated that both sides can accept but fishing will not be sacrificed to get a deal.  I am pretty confident about that.<\/p> <p>  The issues of fisheries and the level playing field are two difficult ones to resolve.  If we could reach an agreement on both, it would open the door not only to a trade deal but also to an opportunity to sign off on potential agreements in multiple other areas that would be very valuable for everybody, including data, aviation, haulage, energy and security co-operation.  Likewise, if there is no trade deal, the atmosphere associated with trying to reach agreements in all the other areas, even if they are temporary contingency plans, will be much more difficult.  The aftermath of a failed negotiation and the blame game that follows politically will create enormous uncertainty as we move into the new reality from 1 January.  It will be difficult enough to manage even if we get all this done and get an agreement in place, not to mind if we do not, on top of trying to deal with Covid at the same time.<\/p><p>My assessment is that a deal can be done and that a deal will be done, but there is much difficult work to do.  It will take weeks rather than days to finalise this.  I hope that by the start of November we will be in the space of a deal in sight.  Once we move into November we are really running out of time with regard to capacity.  That is where we are.  In summary, this is difficult but doable if both sides want to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#G00300","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":731,"content":"<p>That is a very good and fair analysis.

There is much at stake here.  The two negotiations are linked with each other, and if we can get a trade deal it really makes the implementation of the protocol much more straightforward.

I take some comfort in what the Minister said today on the possibility of getting a deal.  Obviously, I realise that difficulties are still there, which the Minister will continue to work on.  I also take much comfort from the Minister's comments on the EU not selling out on fishing rights.  This is a very important point, especially for County Donegal.<\/p> <p>  I commend the Minister on how he has protected the Good Friday Agreement over the past years in his portfolio.  There have been many times, from a non-party perspective, the Minister has had a strong pair of hands in dealing with protecting the rights in the Good Friday Agreement.  The Minister's relationship with the EU, which he has developed over the past couple of years, is really starting to bear fruit now.<\/p> <p>  I made an important point on the last day we met here, which I again want to make to the Minister, about what this committee can do going forward and particularly around its membership.  I was the co-chairman of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly at a time when there was no unionist membership.  I worked for over 21 months to ensure that we got unionist participation, while keeping everybody on board.  It was an important piece of work for that organisation.  Now, likewise, it is really important that we bring those members of the unionist community in Northern Ireland and the MLAs in Stormont to the table here.  I believe that the Minister plays a very important role in trying to do that, along with our Chairman.  I have not spoken to the Taoiseach yet, but he also needs to play an important role in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Given that we now have the shared island unit that is backed up financially for the next number of years, it is imperative that all voices are at the table.  It is only in that vein we can really move forward as a shared island.  The Minister referred to the spending of those moneys over the next years and high-speed rail was also mentioned.  I come from a county which is north of the North, so to speak.  There once was a rail service but that is no more.  Many people there still have memories of travelling on the rail that existed many years ago.  There is much talk now about greenways and moneys being provided for greenways.  I believe there is a great opportunity to open up the old rail line that existed.  There is an effort in Donegal to open up a greenway from west Donegal to Letterkenny, but the old rail line that went from there through Tyrone and Monaghan and on to Dublin is a fantastic opportunity to start putting investment into those areas.  There is a double cross-Border element to that.  It is a great opportunity for one of those group projects to help those counties that were most cut off by the Border over the past 30 or 40 years.  It is something I will push more with colleagues.  I have not mentioned it to colleagues before today.  I thank the Minister very much for his briefing today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#H00500","speaker":"1633"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":734,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's repeated statement today on the absolute need to implement in full and in good faith the withdrawal agreement in the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol.  The Minister has been very clear on that.  The British Internal Market Bill has been damaging.  It has caused concern among Border communities, among business and enterprise, and especially among those sectors very heavily dependent on the export market to Britain.  We do not hear enough commentary about the absolute need to protect the integrity of the EU Single Market.  It has been so beneficial to Ireland and it helped to grow the all-Ireland economy.  Similarly, we need agreement on state aid rules, the protection of employment rights, and the protection and enhancement of environment standards.  The State has invested heavily in these areas over the years, which has been for the benefit of our citizens.<\/p> <p>  The Minister stated there would be changed circumstances come 1 January 2021, and spoke of the absolute need to ensure a level playing field for business.  The implementation of the joint political declaration is critical for business, for the economy and for employment, both North and South.  There cannot be any diminution in any aspects of the withdrawal agreement.  It would be very damaging for our economy and for all the country.<\/p> <p>  The Minister will have heard me speak repeatedly at this committee and in the D&aacute;il on the less developed areas of the State.  Consider the central Border area of Cavan, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Monaghan.  Economically, they have been the least developed areas and historical reasons have played a bid factor in that.  By definition our local economy is very heavily dependent on small and medium enterprises.  By definition, when those enterprises grow they depend on Northern Ireland as their first export market.  When they grow again they depend on the British market.  Three sectors in particular are critical to that economy in the central Border area: agrifood; construction products; and engineering.  These are the sectors that are most heavily dependent on Britain as an export market.  I am just emphasising the absolute need to have no tariffs on the export of products for those sectors, which are such a sizeable part of the economy in the central Border area and elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has been upbeat on the possibility of reaching agreement, and we wish him well in the negotiations and on getting an agreement.  Going back to the Minister's introductory remarks, implementing in full and in good faith the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol and the withdrawal agreement is absolutely critical for the future development and good of our society on all of this island.<\/p> <p>  Since April I have advocated an all-Ireland approach to dealing with the Covid pandemic.  We need more comparable restrictions North and South.  Importantly, we also need a similar implementation of those measures and restrictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#H00600","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":735,"content":"<p>I will conclude for my party.  I thank the Minister for his very informative overview and for his command of his brief since he took it up, which was a couple of years ago at this stage.  He has been a good ambassador for the country and for the EU in the talks.  He has done well and I wish him continued success in the difficult period ahead.  His account of mackerel movements was very interesting and enlightening and highlighted some of the geographical and geopolitical challenges posed by Brexit to our island and to the other islands involved.<\/p><p>I am not sure whether it was apocryphal or accurate, but I read somewhere that Michael Gove's commitment to Brexit was first challenged when he was appointed to an agricultural brief and assumed responsibility for fisheries.  He began to realise that, as the Minister has outlined to the committee, fish do not respect borders.  They are blissfully unaware of them as they move along.  Complications such as this arise.  Things like national catches, quotas and stocks are extremely difficult to quantify and manage.<\/p><p>There was a <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement whereby it was understood that fishing vessels from the North could travel in the waters of the South.  An Act was passed last year to regularise this arrangement following some incidents of vessels crossing into different territorial waters.  I am not sure of the extent to which this has been reciprocated in law or in practice by the UK authorities to date.  I am not sure the issue has been put to bed.  If it has, has it been put to bed temporarily?  Is it on the verge of reopening if no deal is secured and if there is a vacuum?  How would it translate?  It is a very pressing issue for our national fishery stocks and, therefore, for our catch.<\/p><p>Another risk that has been highlighted is that of bypass movements whereby people might register vessels in the North and then use the cover of <i>voisinage<\/i>to bypass whatever agreement is reached in respect of fisheries.  That is a very pressing issue for all involved in the coastal economy, particularly fishermen.  It is quite an emotive issue not only for Brexiteers but for the Irish as well.  I would appreciate any insight the Minister can offer on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#J00100","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their comments.  I take Senator Blaney and Deputy Lawless's comments on fish.  Getting an agreement in this regard is particularly difficult for both political reasons and technical reasons.  Anyone who has been a Minister with responsibility for fisheries will know that we deal with approximately 70 stocks, some of which are really strategically important to the UK and to the EU or individual member states.  Different EU member states will catch differing percentages of their fish in British waters.  For Ireland, it is approximately 35% although it is approximately 60% for mackerel and 40% for prawns, our two most valuable stocks.  It is a really serious issue from the Irish perspective.  Likewise, however, the UK has interests in EU waters.  The negotiations on fish are, therefore, complex.  I hope the negotiating teams will have the capacity to come to an agreement, although I believe it will be one of the last things agreed.<\/p><p>I take Senator Blaney's point with regard to the railway line.  I do not want to start making commitments on behalf of the Department of Transport.  The Senator might share his views with the Minister.  On the commitments under the New Decade, New Approach agreement, there are some very strategic transport projects that will link the north west with Dublin.  These will go through Northern Ireland, which will also benefit.  People will know what project I am referring to.  It has been waiting far too long.  We have had money available to spend but we have not been able to spend it because the project has not proceeded at the pace many of us would have liked.  There are many other projects involved, including potential partnership and co-operation with regard to investment in third level education in Derry, which would benefit the north west as a whole rather than just the city of Derry and its population.  That is something about which we need to speak to the Minister of Education in the Executive.<\/p><p>I am interested in what the Senator had to say about the role of this committee.  Let us be honest; we have really only heard one perspective on the constitutional question in most of the meetings of this committee, albeit in a number of varieties.  The same can be said of the perspective on the Good Friday Agreement and how it should be implemented.  This would be a much more powerful and impactful committee if we could persuade unionist voices to be part of the discussion.  I will certainly play my part in encouraging such involvement.  It is really helpful that Mr. Farry<b><\/b>is with us today.  It is a step in the right direction.  This committee could play a really important role in dealing with some of the perceptions that may exist and which need to be addressed in a reassuring way to allow for a mature exchange of views between people who come from very different backgrounds and who have very different interpretations of history on this island.  Otherwise, we are simply talking to each other and reinforcing each other's points while not having a real discussion of the future of this island and relationships on it.  That is a challenge for this committee and its Chair and members.  I would be very happy to help it progress in this regard.  Senator Blaney's experience of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly might be really useful in this area.<\/p><p>Deputy Smith asked about protecting the integrity of the Single Market.  We talk about the protocol and its protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the all-island economy.  That is important from an EU perspective but it is also a matter of protecting and maintaining Ireland's place in the Single Market.  If we did not find a way of solving the Border question during Brexit, Ireland would have faced a really difficult choice.  We would have either had to consider some form of border infrastructure or accept that we could no longer guarantee the integrity of the Single Market, on the back of which our economy thrives.  We would have had to look at some form of checks between the island of Ireland and the rest of the EU Single Market.  This would have been a really difficult and unpleasant choice to make.  I, for one, would not have chosen border infrastructure on this island so we would have had to look at an act of great self-harm which would have damaged our place within the European Union and its Single Market.<\/p><p>We managed to negotiate a solution that avoided that consequence, which would have been so damaging, by effectively creating a de facto extension of the EU Single Market into Northern Ireland.  The price of this is some limited checks on goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, although not on goods travelling the other way.  We have achieved something very significant in the Northern Ireland protocol.  That this is now enshrined in international law is not in dispute.  This is not still being negotiated.  It was concluded a year ago.  It is now a matter of implementation.  That point needs to be made very strongly.<\/p><p>I take the Deputy's point about Border counties.  Agrifood, construction and engineering products really drive the economy in these counties.  If tariffs are applied to products, and to agrifood products in particular, when traded across the Irish Sea, the prices for them may well become uncompetitive very quickly.  This would be very damaging to economic activity in the Border counties.  I will give an example from the agrifood side.  We export &euro;5.5 billion worth of food and drink across the Irish Sea from Ireland into the UK each year.  We import &euro;4.5 billion worth.  The trade in this area is very significant.  Under World Trade Organization rules, we estimate that tariffs of between &euro;1.35 billion and &euro;1.5 billion would be applied to our &euro;5.5 billion worth of exports every year.<\/p><p>It does not take a genius to realise that is not sustainable.  In the short term, I think we will still be selling those products to the UK in order to fill shelves but they will be significantly more expensive.  In the medium term, Irish and EU products in the UK may well not be competitive with cheaper sources of food from other parts of the world, if the UK decides to put trade deals in place that move away from its reliance on the EU.  These are serious issues for the Irish economy, and indeed the British economy, and that is why a deal is so important.<\/p><p> I totally agree about the full implementation of the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol and, where possible, an all-island approach on Covid-19, although we need to respect that there are two different systems here.  At different times during the pandemic, the public health advice was different in its emphasis, North and South.  If politicians in Northern Ireland are getting clear advice that is somewhat different from the advice we are getting in certain areas, it is hard to have an all-island approach in the purest sense.  I reassure people that there is ongoing consultation between the chief medical officers, senior decision makers and the Ministers for Health.  There was a conference call the other day between the First Minister, deputy First Minister, the Northern Irish Minister for Health, Robin Swann, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and me.  A lot of discussion is ongoing all the time to try to create as much consistency as we can between the two jurisdictions in our management of this pandemic, particularly now, given the numbers in Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Northern Ireland.  The numbers are frightening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#J00200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":738,"content":"<p>I have a problem, if I might explain it.

One of my concerns is about environmental regulation after 31 December.  This cuts into many matters, particularly if there is any regulatory divergence in food standards, sanitary and phytosanitary regulations.  It fundamentally undermines the level playing field and fair competition.  Ultimately, it creates a situation where farmers on either side are not competing fairly and a downward pressure occurs on environmental regulations and protections.  This is concerning.<\/p> <p>  Part of the issue is that we need to look at further all-island environmental governance mechanisms.  Some of the environmental NGOs have complained that the various organs under the Good Friday Agreement have not had that necessary focus to date in terms of environmental governance.  We need to do more of that.  What is being done in those areas will be important and good to hear.<\/p> <p>  Up to 70% of the UK's environmental legislation has come through the EU.  While some of those will continue in terms of the protocol, as the Minister said, it is now about implementation of the protocol.  It is important we find a way to implement those various environmental protection directives after 31 December.<\/p> <p>  The Minister flagged data transfer as an important issue for the continuing future relationship.  I would not share the Minister's optimism in getting those issues resolved.  We have seen reports from the Irish Council of Civil Liberties on the impossibility of Britain meeting adequacy standards under GDPR for a variety of reasons.  This has significant knock-on consequences even for processes as simple as reciprocal welfare payments which would be part of the common travel area.  How can we manage them if we are not in a position to transfer data?  We can obviously scramble a fudge together or bring in new legislation.  The reality is that those data transfer issues are significant, however.  The UK, for several different reasons, will not meet our adequacy standards.  That impacts on everything we do in terms of the Good Friday Agreement and cross-Border arrangements.  I do not share the Minister's optimism that they can be resolved. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#L00400","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":762,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being here.

We should not lose sight of that.<\/p> <p>  There is real unease, concern and fear about the Internal Market Bill.  The Assembly and the Seanad recently passed motions condemning the Bill and asked for it to be withdrawn.  A part of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is an exercise in democratic expression around our future constitutional status.  The Minister will note increased mobilisation around that issue and will have heard that from a broad range of political and civic life.  When the Minister was with the committee before in the past Oireachtas term, he made reference to the fact that even he, within his political lifetime, would like to see a united Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the Good Friday Agreement, the shared island unit and the real and live danger posed by Brexit, I am sure it will give the Minister deep cause for concern when people in senior positions of responsibility in political life refer to aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, which is endorsed democratically North and South, as being divisive or dangerous or not to be spoken about.  That runs absolutely contrary to the political spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  Given all of this, what preparations are under way with the Minister and his Department in terms of prudent and responsible future planning for any change in the constitutional status in line with the Good Friday Agreement in order that we do not have another example of a Brexit where the preparatory groundwork has not been done?

Obviously, there will be an opportunity in the near future in terms of the Seanad by-elections to put that right.  It is important that we are all inclusive.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned around the intentions and the indications of the British to reduce the influence and the authority of the Human Rights Act which came into British law in 1998 and underpins the human rights component of the Good Friday Agreement.

I am as Irish and European while sitting at home with my children as I am sitting here as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  How far on are we with the conversations regarding future arrangements and the protection of EU and Irish citizens who live in the North and take full citizenship?  I also take issue with the Minister's comment on the pandemic unemployment payment.  He is correct that the law currently is that cross-Border workers are assessed on the basis of where they receive their benefits but in July this year, when the legislation was being introduced, the Government could have made provision for payments to cross-Border workers who pay their taxes in this State.  That decision could have been taken at that time but unfortunately there was not the political will to do so.  I have sent information to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, on how it could be done but she has chosen not to do it.

We are supporting many cross-Border workers to keep them in a job by supporting their employers through the employee wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  This ensures that employers can keep people in employment.  The problem is that when people lose employment, the state in which they live has responsibility for their supports.  It is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive to support people living in Northern Ireland who are, unfortunately, unemployed.  Our focus has been on putting money into making sure they retain employment here on this side of the Border, where we can make payments.<\/p> <p>  I have come to know Congressman Richard Neal very well.  He has been an extraordinary support to Ireland and sees himself in many ways as a political guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement from afar.  I could not say enough about how supportive he has been through the Brexit process in terms of trying to ensure that those in Washington who are following this process understand the complexity of what is going on and why it was and is so important that the protocol that was designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and prevent border infrastructure re-emerging on this island is fully implemented.  Even in the last number of weeks I have met Congressman Neal in Washington and discussed this further.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to human rights and in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, is very important in safeguarding rights and equality.  That is why real concern was expressed when there were some suggestions in the British media that the British Government was going to move away from commitments relating to the ECHR.  That has not happened, however, and we have not seen any move away from that in terms of legislative change or anything like that.  I certainly hope that remains the case.  <\/p> <p>  In response to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, I am happy to come before this committee whenever I am asked to do so.  If the Chairman asks me to come more often, I will certainly try to make myself available.  On the question of constitutional change, we have one of the biggest challenges that our generation of politicians is ever going to face in terms of trying to get a satisfactory outcome to what is remaining of the Brexit negotiations.  We must try to get an outcome that protects relationships on the island regardless of what the future holds constitutionally in the medium to long term and my focus is solely on that right now.  I am focused on protecting the Good Friday Agreement, its institutions, its spirit and what it is trying to do to create normal relationships between people on this island and to increase levels of North-South co-operation to try to reinforce that normalisation.  Brexit is an extraordinary disrupter to that because the whole point of Brexit is separation from the EU for the UK while the whole point of the Good Friday Agreement is togetherness and partnership while recognising difference.  Finding a solution in the way that we did in the design of the protocol was a significant achievement for the negotiators who managed to get that across the line, on the British side as well as the EU and Irish sides.  That is why we now want to see it implemented in full.  However, we have not finished the job here because the imposition of tariffs and quotas would be extraordinarily disruptive in terms of pressure on Northern Ireland, the implementation of the protocol and, of course, east-west trade across the Irish Sea, politically as well as from a trade perspective.  That is why we are fighting so hard to try to avoid that.  That must be our focus for now.<\/p> <p>  I accept the absolutely legitimate aspirations that people have, whether they are nationalists or unionists, for the future for themselves and their children.  That is what the Good Friday Agreement is all about.  It is about respecting both of those perspectives and putting in place structures for how those issues can be decided democratically in the future.  For now, let us concentrate on trying to close out these Brexit negotiations in a way that limits damage as best we can.  We cannot afford to get it wrong and to fail to get an agreement, as is absolutely possible.  I think there will be an agreement but I will not be surprised if there is not one because of the issues that are still unresolved and all of the emotion and politics that surround that.  This is a big enough challenge in itself without trying to progress, at the same time, preparations around the constitutional question and so on.  This is an issue that we need to address in the future but we must do it in a way that is responsible, reassuring, open and transparent in trying to accommodate different perspectives.  For now, we are not short of challenges in the short term and that is where my focus and that of my Department lie.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Costello asked about data.  There is nothing easy about data.  It is one of many areas where we have to find a solution that both sides can live with because if there is no agreement on data, many services from the UK into the EU become impossible.  This includes financial services and many other types of services.  If the UK cannot hold and manage the data of EU citizens in the UK under some new arrangement, that will pose a big problem for a lot of sectors.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#M00400","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":769,"content":"<p>I asked a question on quarantine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#M00500","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":770,"content":"<p>I am coming to that now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#M00600","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":771,"content":"<p>We have one minute left under the Covid compliance regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020101500002#M00700","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1602716400,"counter":772,"content":"<p>I do not believe that we can effectively lock people up when they come into Irish airports.
