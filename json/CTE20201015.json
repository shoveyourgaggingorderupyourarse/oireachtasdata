The board&rsquo;s original primary functions were to arrange with potential service providers for the provision of hospital in-patient treatment to patients who were a long time on public hospital waiting lists, and to collect, collate and validate information on persons waiting for inpatient treatment in public hospitals.<\/p><p>The board's functions were extended in 2009, when it was given responsibility for negotiating and agreeing pricing arrangements with private and voluntary nursing homes under the nursing homes support scheme, and extended again in 2012, when it was tasked with the collation and publication of information about outpatient waiting lists. <\/p><p> As is evident from the diagram, which can now be brought on screen, expenditure by the board has fluctuated significantly in recent years, mainly reflecting the level of resources made available to the board to purchase treatment for waiting list patients.  The funding is provided in the form of a grant from the health Vote. <\/p><p> The board's overall expenditure in 2018 was &euro;53.4 million.  This comprised: payments to private hospitals totalling &euro;31.4 million; payments to public hospitals of &euro;17.4 million; and administration expenses of &euro;4.6 million, covering all other functions.  The board reported a surplus of &euro;1.6 million in 2018, bringing the accumulated surplus to &euro;7.6 million.  At the end of the year, the board had cash balances of &euro;23.3 million.  Much of this was required to meet accrued expenses of &euro;15.5 million in respect of treatments delivered to patients before the end of 2018 but not yet invoiced for collection by the treating hospitals. <\/p><p> The legislation provides for the Minister for Health to direct the format of the board's financial statements.  As with a number of other health sector bodies, the Minister has directed that the statements should comply with generally accepted accounting practice, except in relation to pension liabilities.  As a result of the direction, the board accounts for staff pensions as the payments arise instead of recognising the liabilities when they are incurred.  In the circumstances, I am obliged by international auditing standards to give a qualified audit opinion.  However, it is important to note that this qualification is only in relation to pensions accounting.  In all other respects, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the board's transactions. <\/p><p> Turning now to Special Report No. 110.  As mentioned previously, the board's role under the nursing homes support scheme is to manage the process for negotiation of weekly charge rates for care, and to enter into pricing agreements with the private and voluntary nursing homes.  It is worth noting that the board is not itself involved in financial transactions with the nursing homes. <\/p><p> Each agreement is with an individual nursing home and is applicable for a specified period, which varies from home to home.  For example, the average agreed duration of agreements put in place in 2017 was around two and a half years.  Although the negotiation is for a maximum weekly charge rate, the reality is that the agreed rate is standard for all residents supported by the scheme. <\/p><p> In 2018, the agreed weekly charge rate for private and voluntary nursing homes ranged from &euro;765 to &euro;1,325.  The average weekly charge rate was &euro;968, which is equivalent to over &euro;50,000 a year.  The HSE paid an average of around two thirds of the weekly cost, with the residents paying around one third.  In addition, residents incurred charges for supplementary goods and services provided by, or facilitated by, the nursing homes. <\/p><p> When the nursing homes support scheme commenced in 2009, the board offered each nursing home the average weekly price it had been charging on the open market.  This was a short-term measure to prevent delays in commencement or capacity shortfalls but, in many cases, the initial prices have influenced subsequent negotiations.  Prior to commencing negotiations, the board's negotiators review certain financial information provided by a nursing home.  This typically includes the home's occupancy rate, weekly unit cost, annual turnover, profit and any finance costs. <\/p><p> The board has stated that it also considers criteria such as: the costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money; the price previously charged by the nursing home; and the local market price.  It also takes account of any budgetary constraints on the scheme, along with the obligation of the State to use resources responsibly.  While the average dependency levels of a nursing home's residents is not formally a criterion in the negotiation, the board informed us that the general dependency level does form part of the discussions during the price negotiation.  However, we found that the board does not have a model that explains how these various criteria are weighed and combined, making it unclear as to how a final charge rate is arrived at for an individual home.<\/p><p> The examination found that the board did not have internal written procedures or a guidance manual for its negotiators, relying instead on on-the-job training.  Examination of a sample of files found an absence of documentary evidence of the items discussed in some negotiations.  It is important that the board maintains adequate records to enable evaluation of the key decisions made during a negotiation. <\/p><p> The negotiation process does not always result in an agreement.  In this event, the board advises the nursing home of the proposed final offer in writing and that a review process is available.  Where required, the CEO of the NTPF carries out these reviews.  We found that since 2014, the CEO had completed an average of just two such reviews per year. <\/p><p> Pending the outcome of a review, the NTPF may offer the nursing home an extension to the deed of agreement at the current price for a period of up to three months, which may be repeated where the negotiation becomes protracted.  The examination found that the board does not generate management information on the factors giving rise to protracted negotiations, or the number or frequency of contract extensions granted in these circumstances. <\/p><p> Finally, following a recommendation of a Department of Health review of the scheme in 2015, the board commissioned an independent review of the charge rate negotiation system.  The review report was presented to the Minister in May 2019 but has not yet been published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020101500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602757800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Sloyan, on behalf of the NTPF, to make his opening statement.

We welcome the opportunity to discuss the report by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the nursing homes support scheme and the NTPF's annual financial statements for 2018.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the nursing homes support scheme, I would begin by noting that the NTPF has been given a very specific function in respect of the scheme as set out in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.  Under the Act, the NTPF has been designated, by the Minister for Health, as the body authorised to negotiate with proprietors of registered nursing homes to reach agreement on the maximum price that will be charged for the provision of long-term residential care services to fair deal residents. <\/p> <p>  It is important to note that the NTPF's function is to negotiate and reach agreement rather than procure or determine a price.  The nature of negotiation, therefore, has to be considered.  For example, negotiation cannot be bound by pre-determined or descriptive models as to do so would be to ignore the statutory mandate to negotiate.  Negotiation also requires that the NTPF recognises the importance of confidentiality and commercial sensitivity in getting value for money for the State, on the one hand, and respecting the right to privacy of each individual nursing home, on the other hand. <\/p> <p>  As members will have read in our more detailed submission, the NTPF negotiates in accordance with four published criteria, as referred to by Mr. McCarthy.  In order to do that we consider submissions from nursing homes in respect of these criteria and the views of the nursing home in respect of the focus that should be applied to each criterion in negotiations. <\/p> <p>  The NTPF has conducted these negotiations each year since the introduction of the scheme in 2009.  Looking particularly at the past five years, the average rate agreed with nursing homes has increased by around 2.5% per annum.  At the same time the number of nursing home beds has increased annually by around 600 beds as nursing homes expand or as new nursing home providers continue to enter the sector.  Currently, there are 437 nursing homes, with 25,452 beds, that have agreements with the NTPF. <\/p> <p>  As an organisation, we thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his report and note the professionalism of his team in carrying out the review.  As always, the comptroller's work has provided a useful input and advice, which we are more than happy to action.  Specifically, the report contains two recommendations for the NTPF.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General initially references many of the documents used by the NTPF in its work.<\/p><p>We acknowledge that further work can be done in terms of combining those documents into an internal guidelines and procedures manual, keeping it under regular review and adding to it or amending it as required.  The documents are used by the NTPF in its work.  Work on this issue is well advanced.  I note that the manual will be a living system and there will be a need to continue to keep it under review and up to date whenever circumstances change.<\/p><p> The second recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General is that the NTPF should consider capturing management information on those cases that fail to reach agreement at the end of the negotiation process.  As he pointed out and is worth noting, that is a very infrequent occurrence.  Nevertheless, we thank him for the recommendation.  I advise him and the committee that the matter has been addressed.<\/p><p> On our annual financial statements for 2018, the NTPF has seen increases in its budget and activity in recent years, as shown by Mr. McCarthy.  It grew from &euro;5.1 million in 2016 to &euro;55 million in 2018 and, as we learned on Tuesday, has gone up to &euro;130 million in budget 2021.  The increased funding, particularly in 2017 and 2018, required rapid increases in staffing levels and changes in work processes and systems.  The work carried out then has had a sustained and positive impact in terms of reducing the number of people waiting for surgery or procedures up to the onset of the pandemic earlier this year.  Prior to the NTPF recommencing the arrangement of treatments in mid-2017, the number of people waiting for an appointment for surgery was increasing at a rate of 1,000 per month, peaking at 86,111 in July 2017.  Through the combined work of the NTPF and colleagues throughout the health system, the number of people on this list began to reduce as the NTPF&rsquo;s work began to impact.  By the end of 2018, the year under review today, the work of the NTPF had contributed to a reduction of 15,900, or 18%, in the number of patients on the active waiting list for surgery and procedures and a reduction of 17,700, or 31%, in the number of patients waiting more than three months.<\/p><p> In addition to our ongoing work at the time, several new initiatives were undertaken by the NTPF, including the development of the first IT system capable of tracking patients across all public and private hospitals in the State and the establishment of a central unit to manage the administrative validation of waiting lists across all hospitals.<\/p><p> In conclusion, we are satisfied that the funding provided to the NTPF in 2018 was effectively and efficiently used for the intended purposes and that it has been fully accounted for in the financial statements.  We are particularly pleased that through this work, thousands of patients have been enabled to receive their treatments earlier than would otherwise have been the case.  We thank the committee for inviting us to appear and we look forward to the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020101500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Horan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602757800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Horan for his opening statement.

I have a question about the NTPF and the treatment abroad fund.  I know the NTPF has nothing to do with the treatment abroad fund, but has anybody done a comparison between them regarding the cost of providing care in similar areas?  Does the witness not think it might be appropriate at this stage to do that comparison to see if we are getting value for money in that area?<\/p> <p>  The second matter I wish to refer to is nursing homes.  I live in an area in which there are two nursing homes within a five-mile radius.  One is run by the HSE and it costs &euro;1,550 per week per patient.  The other one is privately run - they are the same size with 100 beds in each - and under the fair deal scheme the cost is &euro;950 per week.  There is a gap of 66%.  As regards when the NTPF is negotiating with nursing homes, let us take the example of a nursing home with 50 patients.  They are all at the standard level of care but as time passes between 15% and 20% of them may need a higher level of care.  There appears to be no adjustment allowed in the price.  Will Mr. Sloyan comment on that?<\/p> <p>  There is a third matter.  With regard to public nursing homes, we received the report in 2018 showing that 40% of the funding from the fair deal was going towards the public nursing homes, which are looking after 20% of those in care, whereas 60% of the fair deal was going to the private nursing homes, which are looking after 80% of those in care.  I had a detailed meeting this morning with a nursing home for about an hour on various issues, including access to services for private nursing homes.  Even though public nursing homes are costing more money per patient per week, the residents have access to more public services, whereas private nursing homes do not have the same level of access to healthcare services.  That is not factored in when dealing with this issue.  The witnesses might comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020101500002#F01900","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602757800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>The first question is about value for money in the procurement of hospital treatments.

I thank the witnesses for attending.  I appreciate it.  I am aware they appeared before this committee in June 2018 to deal with the financial statements from 2016 regarding the nursing homes support scheme.  I will mention some of the recommendations as a result of that meeting.  Recommendation 1 states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt is not clear that the cost of care in public nursing homes is providing value for money to the taxpayer.  Of a budget in the region of &euro;1 billion for the Nursing Home Support Scheme, approximately two thirds is expended on public nursing homes that provide one fifth of capacity. <\/blockquote> <p>The Department of Health commenced a value for money review, which I note has been referred to earlier.  That was concluded in May 2019.  How soon do the witnesses think that is going to be published?  Do they have any more information for the members of the committee?  It appears to be dragging its heels.  Indeed, that issue is still live and relevant since the witnesses' last appearance before the committee.<\/p><p>Recommendation 2 states: &quot;The National Treatment Purchase Fund&rsquo;s review of its pricing mechanism for long-term residential care in private and voluntary nursing homes is ongoing.&quot;  It also refers to increasing the transparency of the current price mechanism and continuing to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.  Again, something similar is referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report today, regarding the lack of review of charges.  If I understood the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening remarks, just two reviews were conducted by the chief executive.  I am open to correction on that, but he might clarify why that is the case.<\/p><p>In terms of the internal appeals process, what changes have been made to those since the witnesses' last appearance before the committee?<\/p><p>Transparency about negotiations with nursing homes and how fair deal agreements are arrived at with individual homes is in question.  We need to ensure that funding is based on the need of those who are in care and not necessarily whether they are in a public or private home.  What changes can the NTPF assure us it has made in the intervening period and what changes does it intend to make now that, in light of Tuesday's budget, the funding has changed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020101500002#F03300","speaker":"1481","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1602757800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>The value-for-money review is being conducted by the Department of Health so any updates on that are best obtained from it.  The review of the pricing mechanism has been submitted to the Department and Minister.  The issue of transparency in negotiations is a challenge because these are commercial negotiations being conducted in the interests of the State.  The committee will appreciate that in a negotiation one sometimes has to keep one's cards close to one's chest.  There can be a tension between providing transparency about negotiations while also achieving value for money for the State.  It is worth noting that the function for the NTPF is unusual.  We are not being asked to procure and follow the guidelines as we do with hospitals and such.  Here, we have a function to negotiate and we have to interpret how to do that as well as we can in the interests of the State and of residents.  We try to hit the sweet spot of providing transparency where we set out our criteria.  At the end of the review process, I give the nursing home reasons about the offer that it was made.

Mr. Sloyan referred to keeping one's cards close to one's chest in the context of negotiation.  If we were to come up with guidelines and were able to state that for a particular factor we would add 10% while for another we would add 20% and so on and, thereby, come up with a model through which one would determine the price, that would become predetermined and prescriptive.  It would not be a negotiation but, rather, having the model, ticking all the boxes, pressing a button on the computer and getting a price.  That is the sort of modelling that could be used, but that is not our statutory function.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020101500002#L03600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Horan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602757800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>That is not how I see it from a public accounts perspective.

I do not understand the disparity from county to county.  I am concerned that we will eventually run out of private nursing home beds because of the lack of transparency within the sector.  In light of the cost of public nursing home beds, we need to keep the private sector.  There is no doubt about that.  I am not advocating for the private sector.  The job of the committee is to look after the public purse.  It needs a level of transparency in which everybody can have faith.  I was glad Mr. Sloyan stated that the guidelines will be available in a matter of weeks, but I am determined that, for the sake of transparency, they should be provided to the committee.
