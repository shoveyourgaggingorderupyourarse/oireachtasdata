This measure should have the benefit of tax expertise to ensure that it is consistent with existing reporting requirements and, importantly, with the international cooperation and exchange of information arrangements, which are based on confidentiality. Tax experts are best placed to ensure that international efforts to collect income tax from multinational corporations will not be undermined by new measures. <\/p><p>As I stated in my reply of 10 February last, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann adopted a Reasoned Opinion in June 2016 which also shares this view that the proposed Directive is a tax matter and does not meet the principle of subsidiarity.

Ireland has long been a supporter of, and a beneficiary of, tax transparency.  Ireland has consistently implemented the necessary measures to ensure we are up to date with international best practices on tax transparency and exchange of information<b><\/b>negotiated at the OECD. We have also supported the parallel EU efforts through agreement of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC) in the field of Taxation, and in December 2020 agreed new provisions for automatic exchange of information in respect of digital platforms.  This covers administrative cooperation between EU Member States on tax matters, and automatic exchange of tax rulings, financial account data, and mandatory disclosure of cross-border tax arrangements.<\/p><p>Of the 78 jurisdictions reviewed to date by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (OECD), Ireland is one of only a small number of jurisdictions to have been found to be fully compliant with new international best practice.<\/p><p>The current regime for country by country (CbC) reporting gives tax administrations a global picture of the operations of MNE Groups.  Tax authorities may use this information to perform high-level transfer pricing risk assessments and to evaluate other Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) related risks.<\/p><p>The exchange of CbC Reports requires that jurisdictions must have the necessary laws in place to require Reporting Entities to file a CbC Report; infrastructure to ensure the appropriate confidentiality and data safeguards standards as specified in the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters are met; and a qualifying competent authority agreement must be in effect.<\/p><p>A qualifying competent authority agreement is defined in the BEPS Action 13 Final Report as an agreement that is between authorised representatives of those jurisdictions that are party to an International Agreement (i.e., a Double Tax Agreement, Tax Information Exchange Agreement or the Multilateral Convention for Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters) and that requires the automatic exchange of CbC Reports between the party jurisdictions.<\/p><p>In most cases, jurisdictions have signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (&ldquo;MCAA&rdquo;) for the exchange of CbC Reports. As at December 2020, 89 jurisdictions (including Ireland) had signed the MCAA and it is open to all jurisdictions to do so.  A list of the jurisdictions that have signed up to the MCAA can be found on the OECD website: Activated exchange relationships for Country-by-Country reporting - OECD.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400060#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":53,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400060#WRB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[9659\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400060#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the number of staff employed in his Department by gender and by Civil Service salary scale in tabular form.","asker":"1466","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":55,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to gender and civil service salary scale for staff employed in my Department is provided in tabular form below.

The regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and\/or labour shortages in the State, required to develop and support enterprise for the benefit of our economy.  However, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one. The system is, by design, vacancy led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market, expanding and contracting in tandem with its inherent fluctuations. <\/p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and the ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit. These lists undergo twice yearly evidence based reviews which is guided by available research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS and includes a public consultation process . Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID 19 and their impact on the labour market. Consideration is also taken of the views of the relevant policy Department and the Economic Migration Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department. The Departments of Education and now the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Innovation, Research and Science are active members of the Interdepartmental Group.  <\/p>  <p>  Changes to the occupation lists are considered where there are no suitable Irish\/EEA nationals available, development opportunities are not undermined, genuine skills shortages exist rather than a recruitment or retention problem and Government education, training and economic development policies are supported. In 2015 was the last time that two occupations were removed from the Critical Skills Occupations List. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware that it is essential that Irish enterprise has access to high-quality, adaptable and flexible talent. In order to meet this demand, the Government is committed to building and retaining a highly skilled workforce to serve the needs of the economy.  This goal is set out under the framework of an overarching skills development strategy, Ireland&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy 2025, which sets out a vision of how Ireland can continue to develop relevant skills and ensure that the supply of skills is activated and effectively used.<\/p>  <p>  This is particularly important in the context of the pandemic, which has accelerated some deep structural shifts that were already in train across the economy, particularly when it comes to the twin transitions- digital and green. We know that many of the jobs that exist today may not exist by the end of this decade, but we also know there will be new jobs and new occupations and new businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The sophisticated skills architecture established in Ireland is key in identifying and responding to skills gaps as identified by enterprise and education and training providers. It constitutes the following elements:<\/p>  <p>  National Skills Council (NSC): The NSC was established in 2017. It provides a mechanism for mediating demands on resources in a manner that facilitates prioritisation of identified skills needs, while at the same time enhancing education and training provider responses to and delivery of these identified needs. The Council draws on the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in SOLAS, and the Regional Skills Fora.<\/p>  <p>  Regional Skills Fora: A network of 9 Regional Skills Fora fosters close co-operation at regional level between education and training providers and regional enterprise. The Fora provide a cohesive education-led structure for employers and the further education and higher education system to work together in building the skills needs of their regions.<\/p>  <p>  Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN): The EGFSN is an independent, non-statutory body, which includes representatives from the business community, trade unions, and a number of Government Departments and agencies. It identifies the skills required by enterprise across occupations and sectors, as well as providing information to education and training providers to allow them to support the alignment of programmes with employers&rsquo; needs. My Department provides the EGFSN with research and secretariat support.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is supporting participation in upskilling and reskilling through a range of education and training programmes informed by this labour market and skills intelligence, which are funded through the National Training Fund. These include Skillnet Ireland, the Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s Springboard+ programme, apprenticeships and digital upskilling programmes such as SOLAS&rsquo;s Skills to Advance and Skills to Compete. The National Training Fund is also supporting an annual &euro;60 million investment in the Higher Education system, through the Human Capital Initiative.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the July 2020 Jobs Stimulus, the Government also introduced a series of initiatives focussed on workforce upskilling and the skilling or reskilling of new workforce entrants and those made redundant by the pandemic. These include:<\/p>  <p>  - 35,000 additional places in further and higher education<\/p>  <p>  - A Retrofit Skills Training Initiative, to support future expansion of the National Retrofitting Programme; and<\/p>  <p>  - An Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme, to support employers to take on new apprentices in 2020. This has been extended into 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Through the agencies and initiatives mentioned above my Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will continue to ensure that an adequate and appropriately skilled workforce remains readily available to meet modern market requirements.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Workplace Relations Commission","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC00900"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[10096\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the number of cases heard by the Workplace Relations Commission in each of the years 2018 to 2020, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>Since establishment, the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) has held over 20000 hearings in relation to complaints submitted to its Adjudication Service and, between 2018 and 2020, held some 12220 hearings.

The Agreement delivers on the EU&rsquo;s and Ireland&rsquo;s objectives with businesses having access to zero rate preferential tariffs and quotas on goods traded between the EU and UK once the usual rules of origin for the EU-UK Free Trade Area are met.  This is vitally important for the agri-food sector, for example, which would otherwise have faced very significant additional costs and barriers when trading with the UK.  <\/p>  <p>  The Agreement should also preserve the flow of trade and services with the inclusion of critical elements on energy, public procurement and services.  It also contains welcome arrangements on road haulage, cross border bus services, rail, sea and air transport &ndash; all of which are vital for the easy movement of people, and delivery of goods and services.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, my Department, in conjunction with Copenhagen Economics, undertook a comprehensive study to consider the impact of Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s trade and economy. The focus of the study was on the long term impact of four Brexit scenarios, including a &ldquo;Free Trade Agreement (FTA) scenario&rdquo; for GDP, national income, exports and imports. All results were to be compared to a 2030 baseline had Brexit not occurred. <\/p>  <p>  The FTA scenario used in the model reflected the average of all existing EU FTAs, rather than any single specific existing Agreement.  Furthermore, following agreement in October 2019 on the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration for the Future Relationship between the EU and the UK, my Department commissioned further economic modelling to reflect the benefits of the terms of the Agreement and Political Declaration\/Protocol on Northern Ireland.  This Analysis calculated that growth levels would be 3.2 to 3.9 per cent below where it would otherwise be, depending on whether a \"best-case\" or \"worst-case\" scenario was modelled. This effectively reduced by half the adverse impacts on the Irish economy that had been forecast for a trading relationship with the UK based on WTO terms, and the study identified a lessening of the negative impacts envisaged for the more generic FTA modelled in the previous Copenhagen Economics analysis. <\/p>  <p>  As regards undertaking a further impact assessment of the concluded EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), I believe it is too early to commence a meaningful economic and environmental impact assessment at this point as certain parts of the TCA and the Northern Ireland Protocol have grace periods or temporary derogations attached to them before they take full long-term effect.  For example, by 31 March 2021 the 3-month derogation from the requirement to provide export health certificates on food supplies from Great Britain to Northern Ireland ends.  On the other hand, a framework for regulatory cooperation in financial services between the EU and the UK is to be agreed by March 2021 and the EU is assessing the UK&rsquo;s data privacy regime before deciding whether to grant a data adequacy decision in favour of the UK.  Therefore, we will not have sufficient statistical data available to assess the totality of the impact of the TCA until such temporary derogations and all elements of the Agreement are fully in force, including any further easements or derogations that may be agreed under the TCA Joint Committee structures.  However, I am fully committed to such post-implementation evaluation at an appropriate point.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, I should note that my Department and the Enterprise Agencies are in constant contact with industry bodies including through the Enterprise Forum and the Retail Forum to identify where sectoral and regional impacts of the TCA are emerging at an operational level.  We have a large number of Brexit supports including planning vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, the Enterprise Ireland Ready for Customs Grant of up to &euro;9,000, as well as financial supports for adapting and restructuring business models and grants for research into new markets to assist companies respond to the new TCA dispensation. In addition, Budget 2021 provided contingency funding for COVID-19 and for all Brexit outcomes and the Government is committed to assisting firms on a dynamic basis in responding to Brexit, especially those firms that are in the most severely impacted sectors. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC03300"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[10469\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC03400","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the expenditure by his Department to date on awareness raising campaigns of Covid-19 in national newspapers, regional newspapers, national radio, regional and local radio stations and across social media platforms; and the amount committed to expend under any current contracts or agreements with same in tabular form.","asker":"1495","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>As part of the broader Government&rsquo;s COVID-19 Communications campaign, my Department promoted COVID-19 supports for business, as well as raised awareness around the Return to Work Safely Protocol and safe reopening of the retail sector through a Shop Safely campaign.<\/p><p>The following tables set out both the funding spent to date by my Department on Covid-19 awareness raising communications campaigns and on further monies my Department will spend under current contracts and agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Policy","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC03600"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[10522\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC03700","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"his views on a potential mechanism that would encourage businesses that operate online under an Irish domain name to indicate the provenance of items for sale, which could assist customers in making informed choices regarding the environmental impact of their purchase due to air miles and to support Irish producers.","asker":"1626","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":126,"content":"<p>The Deputy has raised an interesting question. Certainly, the more information that consumers have the better in terms of them being able to make buying decisions informed by the values that they consider important. We all know that price, quality, design and other considerations are factors in buying decisions but there is a growing and welcome focus on other factors such as the sustainability of the product and the impact that well informed consumer behaviour can have on the environment.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister with responsibility for consumer protection, my focus of course is on protecting consumers and ensuring that products are safe to use and that they have rights to refunds, replacements, etc., in certain situations. In this regard, the issue of displaying information about the origin of a product for consumer protection purposes is not simple as it involves an interplay between the Directive (EU) on Unfair Commercial Practice Directive (UCPD) and the EU Consumer Rights Directive (CRD). Traders who sell their goods online are required to provide particular information at the pre-contractual stage to consumers who may be considering whether or not to purchase a product from that trader. The information requirements are contained in Schedule 2 to S.I. No. 484\/2013 - European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013. Schedule 2, paragraph (a) of the Regulation provides that prior to the conclusion of a distance contract, the trader will provide information in relation to the main characteristics of the goods or services, to the extent appropriate to the transaction medium and to the goods or services being purchased. What constitutes the main characteristics is set out in the European Commission&rsquo;s guidance note on the operation of the CRD. It makes the point that certain pre-contractual information requirements in the CRD are also found in the UCPD. <\/p>  <p>  The UCPD provides that the geographical origin of a product can be considered a main characteristic of the product and whilst the UCPD does not provide any formal requirement to indicate the geographical origin of a product, traders are prohibited from providing false or misleading information to consumers about this characteristic. However as the guidance refers, such information could be considered material as under Article 7 of the UCPD. If consumers consider the geographic origin of a product to be a material characteristic to their purchasing decision and if it is not obvious from the trader&rsquo;s website, they can enquire from the trader as to its origin. The trader is prohibited from providing false or misleading information in relation to that question. There is no relevant EU legislation requiring goods originating outside the single market to display a country of origin label other than foodstuffs which are listed in relevant EU legislation and are required to display information about their place of origin. <\/p>  <p>  The position with regard to .ie domain names is that where a website has a .ie domain name, this does not necessarily mean that the entity which owns and operates the website is based in Ireland.  ComReg appointed We Are Ireland Online.ie as the relevant authority to register domain names in accordance with Section 32. (4)(a) of the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007. In order to register a .ie domain name, traders must apply to We Are Ireland Online.ie through their online application process. As part of their registration requirements, applicants must have a connection to Ireland and be able to provide documentation to prove that connection.  Therefore, websites with a .ie registration may not necessarily prove that the trader is based in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  A new initiative by the European Commission will impact on the area of sustainable consumption in the future. In November 2020 the European Commission launched their New Consumer Agenda which presents a vision for EU consumer policy from 2020 to 2025.  The agenda complements other Commission initiatives such as the Green Deal and the Circular Economy Action Plan.  The Agenda puts forward priorities and key action points to be taken in the next 5 years together with Member States at European and national levels. This will, among other things, include a new legal proposal aimed at providing better information on sustainability to consumers and envisages that businesses, including SMEs, could play an important role in this transformation.  The Commission plans to put forward a legislative initiative in 2021 on sustainable corporate governance to foster long-term sustainable and responsible corporate behaviour. Ireland supports this agenda and will play an active part in its development including the provision of better information to consumers and supporting cross EU standards in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  I think a powerful motivator for progress in this space is increasing consumer awareness and changing consumer behaviour. It makes good business sense for retailers to respond to changing preferences in customer demand and to offer goods and services which meet such demands. It is therefore important that everyone involved, be they Government, non-governmental organisations, educators and advocates continue to raise awareness of the issue so that everyone takes into account environmental considerations when purchasing including ethical sourcing. Businesses may need assistance in meeting consumers expectations.<\/p>  <p>  I am acutely aware that COVID-19 has brought considerable challenges for retailers - large and small, across the country.  Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to grow and improve their business offerings in the current crisis and it will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term. My Department proposed the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in their online capability. The Scheme is administered by Enterprise Ireland. Applicant companies must be indigenous retailers, employing 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g., website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. Successful applicants will be awarded funding to support a maximum of 80% of the project costs.

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). CRU was assigned this responsibility following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. It has a wide range of customer protection functions under the above framework which are implemented via the various Codes of Practice set out in CRU&rsquo;s Supplier Handbook.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its statutory role, the CRU monitors energy retail markets to ensure that competition continues to develop. It also oversees non-price aspects of competition, and continues to take steps to increase transparency and consumer engagement in retail markets. Measures introduced by the CRU include a stipulation that electricity suppliers provide customers with an Estimated Annual Bill, highlighting the yearly average electricity bill for a particular electricity supplier rather than just the discounted offers. Additionally, suppliers must issue a written notification on an annual basis to prompt consumers who have been on the same tariff or on a non-discounted tariff for more than 3 years to consider switching. <\/p>  <p>  CRU has a statutory role to ensure that suppliers provide customer charters to customers prior to making any contractual commitment. These customer charters set out the minimum stipulations regarding a customer&rsquo;s right to a contract with a supplier, including the duration of the contract and conditions for renewable and termination.  <\/p>  <p>  The ERA states that the CRU shall account for the performance of its functions to a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas and not to me as Minister. Given this CRU statutory accountability to an Oireachtas Committee, the Deputy may wish to note that CRU provide a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions directly to CRU, including on its customer protection functions, at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Advisers","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC05400"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[9595\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC05500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the names and contact details for each special adviser requested for appointment by him in tabular form.","asker":"1514","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":144,"content":"<p>The following Special Advisers are appointed to my Department:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Name <\/th>       <th>Title <\/th>       <th>Contact Details<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Paul Kenny <\/td>       <td>Policy Adviser<\/td>       <td>Paul.Kenny@decc.gov.ie<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>John McDonald<\/td>       <td>Policy Adviser<\/td>       <td>John.McDonald@decc.gov.ie<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Margaret Ward<\/td>       <td>Press Adviser<\/td>       <td>Margaret.Ward@decc.gov.ie<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>All appointments have been made in line with Public Service Management Act, 1997 and have been approved by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC05700"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[9660\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC05800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of staff employed in his Department by gender and by Civil Service salary scale in tabular form.","asker":"1466","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the table below:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Grade<\/th>       <th>Female<\/th>       <th>Male<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Secretary General<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Secretary<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Principal Officer<\/td>       <td>14<\/td>       <td>24<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Principal<\/td>       <td>53<\/td>       <td>78<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Higher Executive Officer<\/td>       <td>34<\/td>       <td>23<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Administrative Officer<\/td>       <td>22<\/td>       <td>31<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Executive Officer<\/td>       <td>33<\/td>       <td>28<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clerical Officer<\/td>       <td>32<\/td>       <td>16<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Services Officer<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The current Salary Scales are available in Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 12\/2020, a copy of which is attached for convenience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400061#WRC05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reviews","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400062#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[9682\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400062#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the current number of live studies, reviews and research undertaken or commissioned by him;

The scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. To qualify for the scheme recipients must be in receipt of a qualifying welfare payments from the Department of Social Protection. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, there are over 7,800 homes on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are: currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting the initial survey of their home.<\/p>  <p>  SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months, which would have included an impact of COVID-19 restrictions.  For the same time period, the average time for a surveyor to be allocated was approximately 8 months.<\/p>  <p>  SEAI have advised my Department that the average waiting times quoted above should only ever be used as a general guide and waiting times may vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application.  For instance, once the survey is completed and works are allocated to a contractor the time to complete works is dependent on a number of factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials, weather and more recently COVID-19 public health restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for the SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021.

This funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades, making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the increased budget, capacity by the industry to deliver more activity has also increased due to a new, broader contractor panel to provide works which commenced at the end of 2020. I also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to allow it drive the various grant programmes that it operates, including the Warmer Homes Scheme, and to ensure that level of activity envisaged under the Programme for Government is delivered.

Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.<\/p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 15 February, 274 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for schools. BCP sites installed in Kerry are Gneeveguilla (Tureencahill), Railway Station Heritage Centre and Community Space, Killenagh, Kielduff Community Centre, Cill&iacute;n Liath. Cable Station, and Chapeltown (2.64 Kilometres from Valentia Coast Radio Station, Doohilla, Valentia Island) are connected. Further details can be found at .<\/p><p>Boheeshil National School, Dunloe Upper and Coars National School are connected as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.

I understand the cash flow pressure that they are under, the unique implications of the refund requirements placed by the Package Travel Directive and the difficulties they have had with the airlines in securing refunds.<\/p>  <p>  As a largely SME sector,  travels agents and tour operators have access to the various business supports made available in last year's July stimulus package and in Budget 2021, which contains historic levels of State support in the form of wage supplements, financial grants and waived commercial rates.  <\/p>  <p>  The State is also providing a special financial guarantee under a Refund Credit Note scheme for the sector, which makes the credit notes that licensed travel agent and tour operators issue to their customers a very secure proposition.  Credits notes to the value of &euro;19 million have already been issued to consumers under the scheme &ndash; under which their value is guaranteed by the State - and this is money that the industry would otherwise have had to pay back in cash refunds.  I know this does not come close to replacing lost business, but it is significant nonetheless.<\/p>  <p>  It has been brought to my attention that some travel agents and tour operators have been experiencing difficulties accessing the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), whereby some in the sector have qualified for CRSS because they have physical shop fronts, whilst others have not, typically because they operate wholly through online channels.  The Government has responded with the announcement of the new Covid-19 Business Aid Scheme, which will narrow the number of businesses that are not receiving some form of fixed cost support payment, but sadly cannot help everyone.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been particularly focused on dealing with the public health challenges arising from the behaviour of the virus since late December, but our attention is also on the impact on businesses and on people&rsquo;s lives too.   Given the depth of the impact of COVID, the Government approach to date is to focus on supports that cover as many sectors and businesses as possible.  Over the coming months or so, I expect that more focus will be brought to how we continue to support jobs and businesses in the event that restrictions &ndash; including on international travel &ndash; will remain in place longer than any of us want them to.  In that context, Minister Ryan and I recently met with the Irish Travel Agents Association, where the sector made the case for continued financial support.  The proposals made by the ITAA are being examined.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to doing everything possible to support all those affected by this terrible virus, including continuing to help businesses survive until such times as they can being to trade again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400063#WRE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400063#WRE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[10379\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400063#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the projects applied for by each of the four Dublin local authorities under the regional and local roads allocations for 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads (RLR) is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.

Following a review of the pilot phase, I understand the RSA expect the initiative to be extended for car and motorcycles.  <\/p>  <p>  The RSA are keen to progress and extend the service to all categories of Driver Theory Test, however scaling up operations to facilitate higher numbers will take time to achieve.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400063#WRE04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[9409\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400063#WRE04500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will address matters raised by driving instructors (details supplied).","asker":"1514","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p>I would like to make the Deputy aware that the operation of the tests is handled by the RSA.  As many of the suggestions raised are operational matters, I have also referred the question to the Authority for direct reply.  If a reply has not been received within 10 working days, the Deputy should contact my office. <\/p>  <p>  The Department has been in discussions with the RSA on how to return to the normal target for the maximum waiting time for the Driver Testing Service. It is clear that it will not be possible to arrive at this quickly, given restraints which must be in place due to the pandemic.  It is important to recognise that there are no quick fixes and that the continuing build-up of applications as the pandemic goes on means that it will take time to reach a normal waiting time.  <\/p>  <p>  I am happy to comment on the matters raised, where it is appropriate to do so.  <\/p>  <p>  1. Stop all &ldquo;check tests  <\/p>  <p>  Under provisions set out in S.I. No. 203\/2009 - Road Traffic (Driving Instructor Licensing) (No. 2) Regulations 2009 the Road Safety Authority (RSA) is legally required to carry out a check test of an Approved Driving Instructor every two years at the very minimum. This test takes the form of an observation by an RSA examiner of a lesson given by the instructor to a learner driver and is considered an essential element in the regulation and continuous professional development of driving instructors. <\/p>  <p>  Driving is a complex and multi-faceted skill and instructors shoulder a considerable responsibility in teaching their students to behave safely and responsibly on the roads at all times. It is for this reason that it is imperative that the RSA have a means of ensuring that all instructors maintain the highest of teaching standards in the years after they have completed their initial qualification.   It is important that we do not allow the current pandemic to unnecessarily undermine the very significant progress we have made in reducing the impact of road collisions on public health and health services. <\/p>  <p>  I further understand that the RSA, since resuming check tests in September, has drawn upon a provision in the 2009 regulation permitting the conducting of a test with the examiner playing the role of the learner driver rather than the learner driver themselves. This provision will serve to limit the number of people present in the vehicle for the duration of the check test from three to two and thus reduce the public health risk accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  4. ADIs to use the facilities at test centres. <\/p>  <p>  Operational arrangements at test centres, including the availability of waiting and washing facilities, are a matter for the Road Safety Authority. I understand that the Authority decided to temporarily close public toilet and waiting facilities in the interests of public safety and as part of its overall Covid-19 resumption of service protocols and in line with health and safety risk assessment procedures which had to be adopted as part of the RSA's resumption plans. It took account of guidance issued by the Health and Safety Authority and the return to work safely protocol agreed by the Labour and Employer Economic Forum, LEEF. <\/p>  <p>  In response to a formal request from Minister of State Hildegarde Naughton to review these arrangements, the Authority wrote to the Department in November outlining the absolute necessity of retaining these safety measures. While the Authority recognises that this may be inconvenient for partners, family members and indeed driving instructors who accompany learner drivers to their tests, the fact remains that the more people who enter a building, the greater the risk of Covid spreading. The safety of staff and the public in general must remain the Road Safety Authority's number one priority at this time.<\/p>  <p>  6. Increase the number of testers<\/p>  <p>  Following from discussions with the RSA, my Department has approved the hiring of a further 40 temporary testers for 22 months, and the process of recruitment is now underway. However it will take some time for people to be selected and trained. These new hires will be in addition to the 36 temporary testers who were re-hired over the course of 2020, whose contracts expired during last year.<\/p>  <p>  These measures will help to increase testing capacity. However, I would like to stress, that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.<\/p>  <p>Items 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are operational matters for the RSA and have been referred to the RSA for direct reply.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400063#WRE04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400063#WRE04700"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[9424\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400063#WRE04800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of persons that have submitted a UK driver licence to be transferred to an Irish licence; the number still waiting to be issued an Irish licence; if these persons are permitted to drive in the interim period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":254,"content":"<p>As of the 3rd February 2021, 66,090 UK driving licence exchange applications have been processed over 2019, 2020 and 2021 by the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS). 3,393 applications were on hand to process, while 1,687 applications were awaiting further customer response.<\/p>  <p>A resident of Ireland must have an Irish or EU driving licence to drive here.

Please contact my Office if no reply is received within 10 working days. <\/p><p>While several private operators such as Tesla, Ionity &amp;amp; EasyGO are involved in providing charging infrastructure, my Department does not hold information on the location of charging infrastructure which has been installed without government support.  I am aware, however, that ESB has partnered with Tesco Ireland to install 22kW Standard AC Chargers at 33 Tesco locations around the country in the last number of months. More than 50 of these are planned in total. My Department is also making &euro;2 million available next year through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels and shopping centres. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.<\/p><p>In addition to the ESB project, my Department also provides support through the SEAI Public Charge Point Scheme which has been in place since September 2019 to provide funding to local authorities for the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate those EV owners who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles on public streets, by enabling them to charge their EVs near their homes.  A total of 75% of the capital costs is provided through a grant, up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per charge point.  My Department will continue to support this scheme through the grants provided by SEAI and in parallel is also developing a charging infrastructure strategy, in line with the Programme for Government, which will ensure capacity keeps ahead of demand. <\/p><p>Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will help sustain and service the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads. Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cheapest form of charging. To support home charging, the SEAI, on behalf of my Department, administers an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400064#WRF04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":311,"content":"<p>Question No. 105 answered with Question No. 90.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":312,"content":"<p>Question No. 106 answered with Question No. 104.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400065#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[9768\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400065#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of staff, by job title, in the railway accident investigation unit of his Department.

","asker":"1525","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":338,"content":"<p>Providing a sustainable, low-carbon transport system is a key priority of my Department. The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector.<\/p>  <p>  Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the\u00a02019 Climate Action Plan,\u00a0and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. To this end, my Department has convened the\u00a0Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group\u00a0to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The\u00a0EVPP Working Group\u00a0has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales. Furthermore, the Government, supported by the work of the\u00a0Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, has worked to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy\u00a0will be\u00a0aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have\u00a0collectively contributed\u00a0to increased take up\u00a0of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base.\u00a0There are currently around 28,000 EVs under taxation in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with Programme for Government commitments, my Department is expanding the scope of vehicle types to include personal electrified modes of transport. For example, legislation is being drafted to enable the legal use of electric scooters. Subject to resolution of outstanding issues relating to road safety and the movement of traffic,\u00a0I\u00a0intend to bring forward amendments to the relevant primary legislation when the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill comes before the Oireachtas in the next few months. Accordingly, I am confident that we\u00a0are making real progress towards the delivery of our ambition for\u00a0the transition to an electrified and low-carbon transport system.<\/p>  <p>  With regards to public transport, moves are already afoot to electrify the bus and rail networks. To date, a total of 280 diesel-electric hybrid buses have been ordered, of which 100 should be operational by mid-2021, with the remainder to be delivered before year end. The National Transport Authority (NTA) are also tendering for both single- and double-deck full electric town buses, with the first vehicles expected to arrive towards the end of next year. My Department is also funding electric vehicle pilot projects in rural areas under the Local Link programme.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of heavy rail, this year we are looking to expand electrification through the DART+ programme which will ultimately mean around 70% of journeys in any given year on the rail network will be on electrified services. In addition, we are expanding capacity on the Luas Green Line and will look at route options for Luas Cork, Luas Lucan and the preliminary design for Luas Finglas in the coming months. Also, work is underway to progress MetroLink which will provide a fully electrified metro service in Dublin. Finally, building on the eSPSV grant scheme that was in place for the last 2 years, I have introduced an EV scrappage scheme to support taxi and hackney drivers switching from older vehicles to EVs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400065#WRG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; D&aacute;theangacha","counter":339,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400065#WRG02700"},{"type":"question","counter":340,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[9989\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400065#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach f&eacute;idir coinne athnuachana cead&uacute;nais tiom&aacute;na leis an tSeirbh&iacute;s N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta um Chead&uacute;nais Tiom&aacute;na a eagr&uacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge ar l&iacute;ne; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1577","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":341,"content":"<p>Os rud &eacute; go mbaineann an cheist\u00a0 &aacute;irithe seo leis an &Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Sh&aacute;ibh&aacute;ilteacht ar Bh&oacute;ithre, t&aacute; s&iacute; curtha ar aghaidh chuig an &Uacute;dar&aacute;s agam.\u00a0Iarraim ar an Teachta teagmh&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh le m&rsquo;oifig mura bhfaigheannn s&iacute; freagrea d&iacute;reach &oacute;n &Uacute;dar&aacute;s laistigh de 10 l&aacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400065#WRG02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aviation Industry","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400065#WRG03000"},{"type":"question","counter":343,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[10014\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400065#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will consider the proposal by a union (details supplied) for an aviation income support scheme similar to the scheme in place in Germany that enables employers to reduce hours rather than lay off staff; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This provision will serve to\u00a0limit the number of people present in the vehicle for the duration of the check test from three to two and thus\u00a0reduce the\u00a0 risk of transmission\u00a0accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400065#WRG04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":361,"content":"<p>Question No. 123 answered with Question No. 90.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[10113\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400065#WRG05200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if further clarification will be provided regarding plans to conduct driver theory tests online; and the timelines being placed on the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to ensure this system can be accessible for all applicants, without further delay.

DART+ will provide frequent, modern, electrified services to Drogheda on the Northern Commuter Line, the Kildare Line (between Hazelhatch and Celbridge), Maynooth and M3 Parkway on the Maynooth \/ Sligo Line, while improving DART services on the South-East Line as far south as Greystones.  The DART+ Programme includes both the upgrade of the railway infrastructure and the purchase of new fleet and will effectively double the capacity of the existing network and DART level services.<\/p>  <p>  DART+ West, Maynooth\/M3 Line, is the first element of the DART+ Programme to be progressed.  It will significantly increase the number of trains operating on the Maynooth\/M3 Parkway rail corridor and upon completion will allow for a potential doubling of the services per hour, tripling passenger capacity. A first round of non-statutory public consultations for DART+ West concluded last October. Consideration of submissions made is underway and further design development and assessment of options is being undertaken.  The next round of consultation is expected to take place this Quarter. <\/p>  <p>  DART+ South West - the current Kildare Line - is the next element. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are currently progressing the options selection process and it is anticipated that a public consultation on the emerging preferred route will be undertaken also in Q1 2021.  This will provide an opportunity for all members of the public to comment on the emerging preferred route.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the Deputy will also be aware of Government's approval last year of the proposed purchase of 41 additional carriages to the inter-city railcar (ICR) fleet. The carriages are expected to be delivered through 2022 and, when introduced, will increase capacity across both the Maynooth and Kildare Lines, thus benefitting commuters of North Kildare in advance of the delivery of DART+.  <\/p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in the area, I have also forwarded the Deputies questions to the Authority for further information on the issues raised.

In this context the Department held a public consultation process between November 2019 and February 2020, and included a stakeholder event in the course of that consultation.  Over 250 submissions were received as part of this public consultation process and I published a report of the public consultation. <\/p>  <p>  I intend to develop a new policy framework for the next 10 years that can provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government across the sustainable mobility programme.  The new policy statement will be informed by the review of the previous policy framework (known as Smarter Travel), submissions received during my Department's consultation process and the views and recommendations of other relevant stakeholders.  It will provide a platform to advance the ambitions of the Programme for Government in the area of sustainable mobility, including active travel, and will replace the previous Smarter Travel policy, dating from 2009.  <\/p>  <p>  Our Programme for Government commitments in relation to public transport in rural areas will be progressed in the context of that new policy statement. Among the measures we will prioritise is a Sustainable Rural Mobility Plan to ensure settlements over a certain size can connect to the national public transport system, expanding the Local Link rural transport service and prioritising public transport projects that enhance regional and rural connectivity. <\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally.  The NTA also has responsibility for local and rural transport, including the management of Local Link services.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA has undertaken a nationwide study to inform its approach to rolling out improved public transport across the country (excluding the GDA, Regional Cities and Large Towns) by providing better connections between villages and towns by linking them with an enhanced regional network connecting cities and regional centres nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from this study, I am advised that the NTA is undertaking a two-phase consultation on its proposals, titled 'Connecting Ireland'; which began with local authority officials and other key stakeholders on the main concepts of Connecting Ireland, and will be followed by a wider public consultation in Q2 2021 on the proposals.<\/p>  <p>  I have referred the Deputy's specific question in relation to improvements to rural transport in County Kildare to the NTA for direct reply.

By restricting the scheme solely to new dwellings and new self-builds, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new build homes will encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. In accordance with a commitment in the Programme for Government, HTB was enhanced in July 2020.  It is too soon to draw conclusions as to the impact of the enhancements on supply. <\/p><p>HTB has been the subject of two independent reviews: an impact assessment (2017), and a full Cost Benefit Analysis (2018), both carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. <\/p><p>The report of the impact assessment was published as part of Budget 2018 documents and is available at the following link:<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The report of the Cost Benefit Analysis was published on the day of Budget 2019, in the Department of Finance Report on Tax Expenditures, and is available at the following link: <\/p><p>www.budget.gov.ie\/Budgets\/2019\/Documents\/Tax%20Expenditures%20Report%20Budget%202019.pdf .<\/p><p>In brief, the 2018 CBA, confirmed the findings of the independent review as follows:<\/p><p><b>- Prices: <\/b>While there might have been a very small increase in prices attributable to the introduction of the incentive, the primary driver of house prices remained the continued misalignment between demand and supply.<\/p><p><b>- Supply: <\/b>The evidence suggested that following the introduction of the incentive there was a marked increase in supply which can be attributed in part to HTB.<\/p><p><b>- Affordability: <\/b>The analysis also found that availability of HTB had reduced the time to save for all claimants and improved the overall affordability of housing for these individuals.<\/p><p><b>- Benefit\/Cost Ratio:<\/b>The analysis found a benefit-cost ratio of 1.28 indicating a moderate positive effect for the incentive.<\/p><p>Finally, in relation to impacts on house prices, to the extent that data are available at this point, Revenue advise me that for 2020 the average purchase price relating to HTB claims to December 31 2020 was &euro;329,000 which was the same as the figure for 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":442,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":443,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[1837\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the analysis his Department has carried out into the cost of including boat tour businesses which are tied to one particular location and as such are not mobile businesses in the Covid restriction support scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":444,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[9473\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address a matter raised in correspondence (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":445,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[10220\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason the chartered boat industry is excluded from the Covid restrictions support scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1621","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":446,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155, 164 and 210 together.<\/p><p>The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. <\/p><p>Details of CRSS are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at: <\/p><p>To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to acquire goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. For the purposes of CRSS, a qualifying &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; is a building or other similar fixed physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on. A self-employed travel agent providing services from a home office, which is not customer-facing, will not meet the eligibility criteria.  Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria for CRSS. <\/p><p>Deputies will be aware of the Tourism Business Continuity scheme, a &euro;55m strategic funding scheme announced as part of Budget 2021 to support tourism businesses which was launched recently.

Further details are available at .<\/p><p>It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises. <\/p><p>I have no plans to change the eligibility criteria for the CRSS or to introduce sectoral supports. The CRSS is just one of the Government&rsquo;s supports to assist businesses impacted by COVID-19. Businesses who are not eligible for CRSS may be entitled to alternative supports put in place by the Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme mentioned above. Businesses may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities, excess payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), outstanding balances of self-assessed Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020.  <\/p><p>I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Offices","counter":447,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ01900"},{"type":"question","counter":448,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[9371\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the facilities available in his Department to facilitate breastfeeding breaks in accordance with World Health Organization, WHO, guidelines of two years for women in the workplace and as part of the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020;

I'm precluded from intervening on behalf of any individual customer in any particular bank. Decisions in relation to commercial matters are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. <\/p>  <p>  The application of interest rate charges is solely a commercial matter for the board and management of each bank. <\/p>  <p>  Deposit balances and liquidity in general has risen significantly across the banking system in Europe in recent years as the ECB has continued to provide additional funds through their asset purchase schemes and long term refinancing operations. This has been further exacerbated by the Covid19 pandemic as households continue to stay at home and save and businesses defer investment decisions. This excess liquidity which has grown significantly in the European system has to go somewhere and in large part it gets placed back on deposit with the ECB who charge the banks -0.50%. The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts. The Irish banks are impacted in a similar way to their European counterparts. The banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances. The Irish banks are no different in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In passing on some of these costs it is important to note that banks cannot differentiate between customers in different sectors and for that reason the approach taken is to apply charges based on the size of the deposit balance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":466,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[9404\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons who availed of the tuition tax credit when submitting their form 12 tax returns through Revenue MyAccount and ROS account for self-employment in 2019 and 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":467,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[9744\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons that availed of the tuition tax credit when submitting their form 12 tax returns through the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s MyAccount and ROS account for self-employment in 2019 and 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":468,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 184 together.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that self-employed taxpayers file their tax returns (Form 11) at a later date than PAYE individuals (Form 12).

It is also important to note that PUP recipients will only pay tax when they return to work.<\/p>  <p>  When a recipient returns to work, he or she should immediately cease the PUP claim with the Department of Social Protection (DSP). DSP will then notify Revenue that the payment has ceased, and Revenue will adjust the employee&rsquo;s tax credits accordingly. For a person who is on the PUP at the start of the year, the weekly amount is annualised on the Tax Credit Certificate (TCC), with automatic knock on impacts on the tax credits and standard rate cut off point. This &lsquo;annualisation&rsquo; operates as if the person is to remain on the PUP for the full year. When the person comes off PUP the TCC is amended to reflect the fact that the payment has ceased.<\/p>  <p>  A revised instruction (Revenue Payroll Notification) then issues to the relevant employer to reflect the updated position and the revised TCC issues to the employee via the online myAccount service.  Any delay in issuing the revised instruction to the employer will delay the employee receiving his or her full tax credit entitlements so prompt notification by the employee to the DSP is very important.<\/p>  <p>  The employee should also confirm with his or her employer that deductions of tax are being made based on the most up to date Revenue Payroll Notification issued to the employer by Revenue. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, where a self-employed individual incurs a loss for a year of assessment, a provision is available that allows the individual to elect to have that loss offset sideways against other income of the individual, or in cases of joint assessment, against income of the individual&rsquo;s spouse\/civil partner. Therefore, where an individual has incurred a loss in 2020, they may utilise this loss to shelter a tax liability arising from receipt of the PUP. <\/p>  <p>Finally, Revenue has confirmed to me that there is no delay between receipt of DSP notifications of PUP cessations and the subsequent adjustment of the relevant employees&rsquo; tax credits, which operates through an electronic data transfer. However, if any persons are concerned that they are overpaying tax on PUP payments they should contact Revenue&rsquo;s National PAYE Helpline at 01-7383636.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":473,"content":"<p>Question No. 161 answered with Question No. 157.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Insurance","counter":474,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ04700"},{"type":"question","counter":475,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[9460\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that mortgage applicants are being refused mortgage protection insurance if they have had Covid-19 within the past six months even in cases in which they have fully recovered from the virus; if he will intervene with the industry to prevent this practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":476,"content":"<p>While I have an appreciation of the difficulties individuals may find themselves in as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. Consequently, I am not in a position to direct companies as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions apply.<\/p>  <p>  It is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer life insurance and what terms to apply. These can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle. In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration. In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the mortgage repayment schedule. In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors. Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.<\/p>  <p>  My officials contacted Insurance Ireland, the representative body for such providers on this issue recently. It stated that it is aware of a cases where a final decision on applications is being deferred in instances where applicants have displayed symptoms of COVID-19, been referred for, or undergoing COVID-19 testing, or had a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. It also stated that it is normal practice to defer a decision on any condition in these cases. However, it also stated that is unlikely that once the applicant has fully recovered from an illness that it would have any impact on the policy they are seeking to take out, although this does depend on the individual case and the severity of the impact of the infection. Insurance Ireland further noted that it understands that mortgage protection is not a universal requirement by banks, and that there are waiver conditions set out in the Consumer Credit Act where the lender may be able to proceed without the protection cover in place for mortgages in certain situations and this is at the lender&rsquo;s discretion.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Deputy will be aware that both I and Minister of State Fleming have consistently and publicly stated that in the context of COVID-19 we expect insurance firms to treat their customers fairly, honestly, and in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. The Government will continue to work to protect customers during and after the COVID-19 crisis, and engage with the insurance industry in relation to how it responds to the needs of its customers. This commitment is included in the Programme for Government.

PUP payments are classified in legislation as income supports and are subject to income tax. The taxation arrangements for the PUP were legislated for in Finance Act 2020 which reflects the standard approach to taxation of social welfare type payments, which means they are liable to income tax but exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI). <\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioners are independent in the exercise of their functions. However, they advise me as follows: <\/p><p>The mechanism to tax the PUP, in common with other Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments, including Jobseekers Benefit and Illness Benefit, is by reducing the recipient&rsquo;s tax credits and rate bands. However, in 2020 the PUP was not taxed in &lsquo;real-time'in the normal manner due to the urgent requirement to get payments to people as quickly as possible, meaning the collection of any tax due was deferred until year end. This approach was based on an expectation at the time that the emergency supports would be short-term in nature, which turned out not to be the case due to the continued prevalence of COVID-19. Any tax liabilities on PUP payments received in 2020 will be collected, interest free, by reducing the employees&rsquo; tax credits over 4 years, starting in January 2022.  There is no change in that position which was confirmed by Revenue last September.<\/p><p>The continuation of the PUP into 2021 has re-established the practice of operating PAYE in the normal (real-time) manner for such payments. However, people receiving PUP payments in 2021 will only pay tax when they return to work. Revenue has published information on the taxation of the PUP at link<b><\/b>www.revenue.ie\/en\/life-events-and-personal-circumstances\/pup-tax-liability\/index.aspx, which may be of interest to the Deputy. <\/p><p>When a PUP recipient returns to work, he or she should immediately cease the PUP claim with DSP. In turn, DSP will notify Revenue that the payment has ceased, and Revenue will then adjust the employee&rsquo;s tax credits accordingly. For a person who is on PUP at the start of the year, the weekly amount is annualised on the Tax Credit Certificate (TCC), with knock on impacts on the tax credits and standard rate cut off point, i.e. as if the person will be on the PUP for the full year. When the person comes off PUP, the TCC is then amended to reflect the actual number of weeks that the person received the (PUP) payments.<\/p><p>A revised instruction (Revenue Payroll Notification) will issue to the relevant employer to reflect the updated position and the revised TCC will issue to the employee via the online myAccount service.  Any delay in issuing the revised instruction to the employer will delay the employee receiving his or her full tax credit entitlements so prompt notification by the employee to the DSP is very important.<\/p><p>Specifically, regarding the taxation of PUP, the following important points are also relevant:<\/p><p>- A single person currently in receipt of the PUP will continue to receive the payment gross and tax is not collected from these payments until s\/he returns to work.  This is also the case where both married spouses\/civil partners are receiving PUP;<\/p><p>- 50% of all PUP recipients are not on the highest rate of &euro;350 per week. A single person&rsquo;s weekly tax credits will fully cover any tax due on weekly PUP payments at the &euro;203, &euro;250 and &euro;300 payment rates. For these rates, the employee will in fact have excess weekly tax credits of between &euro;3.46 and &euro;22.86 which will build up for the period s\/he is out of work. This means that the employee will have additional tax credits to offset against income when s\/he returns to work;<\/p><p>For a single person in receipt of PUP of &euro;350 per week, his\/her weekly tax credits cover 90% of the tax payable, leaving tax due of approximately &euro;6.50 per week. <\/p><p>For example, if a single person is in receipt of the PUP for the months of January and February 2021 before then returning to work (i.e. 8 payments of PUP at &euro;350 per week, totalling &euro;2,800) the outstanding tax due on the payments received at that point is approximately &euro;52.  However, this amount will be offset fully or partly by the reduction in the total USC liability for the year because PUP payments are not liable to USC. <\/p><p>The position for married couples\/civil partners is slightly different. Where a couple is taxed under joint assessment and one spouse or civil partner is in receipt of the PUP but does not have sufficient tax credits to cover the tax due, the tax credits of the working spouse or civil partner are reduced to ensure that the balance of the appropriate tax is collected. However, a jointly assessed couple can earn gross income (incl. PUP) of &euro;635 per week before they have a tax liability. <\/p><p>In taxing PUP payments in accordance with the legislation, Revenue is seeking to ensure, as far as possible, that people do not end up with a tax liability at the end of 2021 that will have to be paid in future years, particularly where there is already an underpayment in respect of 2020.  The alternative &lsquo;year-end&rsquo; approach would result in employees having further underpayments in the years ahead in addition to their 2020 liabilities, which could cause financial difficulties for them down the road. <\/p><p>The normal (real-time) deduction arrangements now applying to the PUP for 2021 insures against this, as tax credits are set aside for offset against any tax due (on the PUP), rather than having employees face a higher additional liability at year end.  It also ensures an equity of tax treatment between those receiving the PUP and employees who are working and receiving similar levels of wages (although the person on PUP will have a lower USC liability). <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ05800"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[9491\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ05900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason a 10% tariff now applies to the importation of used cars from the UK if the cars were built in Europe as the country of origin but no tariff applies if the car was built in UK; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":487,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[9492\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason 21% VAT is applied to the new 10% tariff now applied to used cars imported from the UK; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":488,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[9494\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ06100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the new 10% tariff on the importation of used cars from the UK only applies to newly registered cars from 2021 onwards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":489,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[9495\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ06200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason margin cars imported from the UK are subject to 21% VAT, given that VAT has already been paid on the car in UK that cannot be reclaimed by the importer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":490,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 to 169, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Following the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union, an import of a vehicle from Great Britain is treated as an import from a third country, i.e. a non-EU country.  If a vehicle is imported from Great Britain into Ireland, the importer is required to complete a customs declaration and pay customs duty, if applicable, and VAT at 21% prior to presenting the vehicle for registration.  Under customs law, VAT at import is chargeable on the customs value of the goods.  The fact that VAT has been charged in Great Britain on used vehicles subsequently imported into the State has no bearing on their liability to VAT at import when imported into the EU.  <\/p><p>Under the Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland will continue to apply and adhere to EU rules in relation to trade in goods with the result that there are no customs formalities, including customs declarations or payment of tariffs, on trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  On 14 January, the UK introduced significant changes to the UK VAT margin scheme for used cars imported from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. These changes are not in compliance with provisions of EU law on VAT that apply in Northern Ireland as per Article 8 of the Protocol. Accordingly, used cars that are imported into NI from GB after 31 December 2020, under the rules currently in force in the UK are not single market goods and cannot be brought into the State as if they were.  Therefore, when they are brought into the State, they are liable for VAT and duty on the same basis as used cars brought into the State from Britain. <\/p><p>Vehicles registered and used in Northern Ireland before the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January 2021 can be registered here in the same way as before without any check on the customs status.  <\/p><p>I am also advised by Revenue that from 1 January 2021, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) has eliminated tariff duties for trade between the EU and Great Britain where the relevant rules of origin are met. If the goods are of UK origin, then a 0% tariff rate applies. Under the terms of the TCA, goods of EU origin that were in use in the UK and that were subsequently imported into Ireland from Great Britain will not be eligible for the 0% tariff rate as they will not qualify as UK origin under the rules of origin.<\/p><p>To import a car of EU origin from Great Britain into Ireland, a customs declaration must be completed. Customs duty of 10% applies on the customs value of the car. The customs value is the invoice price plus the cost of transport and insurance. VAT at 21% is calculated on the customs value plus customs duty. <\/p><p>I am further advised that there is a Returned Goods Relief available for vehicles subject to strict EU conditions. Vehicles can be exported from the EU to a 3<sup>rd<\/sup>country and re-imported into the EU without the payment of Customs Duty provided all the required conditions for Returned Goods Relief<b><\/b>are met. In very specific circumstances, relief from Value-Added Tax may also apply where the vehicle is re-imported into the EU by the same person that originally exported the goods out of the EU. The conditions are <\/p><p>- The vehicle must have been originally exported from the EU<\/p><p>- Must not have been altered and <\/p><p>- Must be re-imported within three years of export from the EU. <\/p><p>Details of how to claim returned goods relief for cars is on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie\/en\/customs-traders-and-agents\/customs-electronic-systems\/aep\/ecustoms-notifications\/2021\/ecustoms-notification-24-2021.pdf. If the car is of UK origin, it is important to note that the preferential tariff treatment must be claimed on import on the Customs declaration. Details on how to do this are also available on the Revenue website. <\/p><p>Cars imported into Ireland prior to 1 January 2021 can be registered as normal. The owner must provide documentation to prove that the car was imported into Ireland prior to 1 January 2021. An example of the documentation would be a sales invoice or a ferry ticket.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":491,"content":"<p>Question No. 170 answered with Question No. 157.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration Tax","counter":492,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ06800"},{"type":"question","counter":493,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[9534\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ06900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the VRT calculator will be up and running; his views on the website of the Revenue Commissioners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":494,"content":"<p>I am informed by Revenue that some customers experienced difficulties with the VRT calculator between 9 February and 15 February.

Over 66,500 employers were supported through the TWSS in respect of more than 664,000 employees at a cost of &euro;2.9bn.  The scheme operated until 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020.<\/p><p>The stated objective of both schemes is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible, including through periods of the strictest public health restrictions that may have closed particular businesses, such as the childcare sector.  It has also applied when and as the public health restrictions have been eased to help businesses to recover from the impact of a closure or reduced trade for a period.  To that end, both supports have been available, regardless of whether or not the individual has actually been at work or not, as they are based on weekly pay to employees rather than hours worked.  For employees, the &quot;return to work&quot; therefore does not impact on the application of treatment of the subsidy. <\/p><p>Payments made under the TWSS are regarded as income supports and share the characteristics of income.  Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.  In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the TWSS which were made to the category of individuals mentioned in the Deputy's question are subject to income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC) in the same way as is the case in relation to other categories or worker.  While income tax and the USC on most income is deducted in real-time as and when the person is paid, the TWSS payments were not taxed in real-time and were instead liable to income tax and USC at the end of 2020. <\/p><p>The taxation treatment of TWSS payments was legislated for in section 28(5)(e) of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, and provides that  &ldquo;notwithstanding any other provision of the Act, the additional amount paid by the employer to a specified employee in accordance with paragraph (d) shall not be regarded as emoluments of the specified employee for the purposes of Chapter 4 of Part 42 of the Act and the Regulations, but shall be treated as income chargeable to tax on the specified employee under Schedule E within the meaning of section 19 of the Act&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, which was legislated for under the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020.  The specific nature and terms of the EWSS arrangement are separate and distinct from the TWSS.  EWSS re-establishes the normal requirement to operate PAYE and normal PRSI on all payments made to the employee by the employer. Employers operate payroll as normal and report employer and employee PRSI deductions based on the employee&rsquo;s appropriate existing PRSI classes.  This ensures employee social insurance contributions accumulate as normal and furthermore, that no additional tax liability on the salary payments made should accrue to employees.<\/p><p>As regards the TWSS, the Government have been consistent as regards the TWSS&rsquo;s liability to tax from the outset of the payment.  Indeed, I have been advised by Revenue that it clarified the tax treatment of the TWSS at employee level in the guidance material on the TWSS that it has published on its website since the commencement of the Scheme.  Furthermore, Revenue actively engaged in facilitating webinars with the Employer Bodies, Accountancy Firms and Tax Practitioners to explain and clarify any issues for employers as regards the TWSS. For the information of the Deputy, the link directs to Revenue&rsquo;s material on Frequently Asked Questions on the TWSS:<\/p><p>Revenue made a Preliminary End of Year Statement available to all employees from 15 January 2021, including those who were in receipt of the TWSS.  The Preliminary End of Year Statement includes information relating to an employee&rsquo;s income received, including pensions and income from the Department of Social Protection, as well as their tax credit entitlements.  For the tax year 2020, the Statement also includes information on the amounts of TWSS payments, if any, received by each employee.  In addition, the Statement provides employees with a preliminary calculation of the income tax and USC position for 2020 and indicates whether their tax position is balanced, underpaid or overpaid for the year.<\/p><p>Upon viewing the Preliminary End of Year Statement through myAccount, which is Revenue&rsquo;s secure online facility for individual taxpayer services, employees have an opportunity to complete their income tax return for 2020, declaring any additional income and claiming any additional tax credits due, for example qualifying health expenses, to arrive at their final liability for 2020.<\/p><p>When a liability is finalised, individuals may opt to fully or partially pay any income tax and USC liability through the Payments\/Repayments facility in myAccount.  Where individuals do not opt to fully or partially pay, Revenue will collect the liability by reducing their tax credits over 4 years, interest free.  The reduction of tax credits will start in January 2022.<\/p><p>Finally, the Preliminary End of Year Statement sets out a provisional tax position for 2020, based on information available on Revenue records, including any Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) payments reported by the individual&rsquo;s employer.  Revenue published provisional statistics in relation to the preliminary end of year tax position for all PAYE taxpayers for the year 2020, on 14 January 2021 which is available to view on Revenue&rsquo;s website  PAYE Preliminary End of Year Statements.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400067#WRJ07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":500,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[9566\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400068#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when a Covid restrictions support scheme application by a person (details supplied) will be paid.

In this regard it is the clear expectation of both the Government and the Central Bank that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers &ndash; in line with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Consumer Protection Code and regulations for lenders lending to SMEs &ndash; to deliver appropriate and sustainable solutions and facilitate as many borrowers as possible to return to repaying their debt.<\/p>  <p>  The Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) stated last month that its members are continuing to commit significant resources to support customers impacted by COVID-19, and in particular those who are affected by the latest restrictions. Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress.<\/p>  <p>  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience loan difficulty because of COVID-19. Rather than continuing with a general 'one size fits all' forbearance approach, it is considered that it is in the best long term interests of both the borrower and lender that engagement takes place in relation to a particular loan difficulty and that the most appropriate solution to the individual case is adopted as soon as possible. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated to lenders that they should ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements and Central Bank expectations. The Central Bank has also confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers at this time, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400068#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":509,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[9573\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400068#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that banks and lending institutions may be penalising mortgage holders and other borrowers who avail of a moratorium in repayments specifically and that some are subsequently being refused access to certain services, are unable to change lender and are otherwise facing withdrawal of possible services as a result of the moratorium; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":510,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[9574\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400068#WRK01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will arrange to meet urgently with banks and lenders that have operated a moratorium for mortgage holders and other borrowers who have been impacted by the Covid-19 crisis and urge them to ensure there is no subsequent discrimination against those who avail of the moratorium; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":511,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 177 together.<\/p>  <p>  It is the clear expectation of both the Government and the Central Bank that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers to deliver appropriate and sustainable solutions and treat borrowers at all times, including in response to COVID-19, in line with Central Bank&rsquo;s robust consumer protection framework.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the refusal of certain services, it is unclear to which particular services the Deputy is referring. However, insofar as it applies to the provision of mortgage credit to consumers, it should be noted that there are a number of consumer protection regulatory requirements on regulated entities. The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness. The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement. The CMCAR provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement. The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability' requirements on lenders. Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.<\/p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for credit is then a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. In the same way, the regulated entity will solely determine its own credit policies in line with its own risk appetite. Nevertheless, in considering applications for credit from consumers, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects lenders to assess credit applications in a sympathetic but prudent manner, ensuring at all times that the credit applicant has the means and ability to repay the proposed credit in line with the terms of the proposed credit contract. In this regard, whether an applicant for credit has had a payment break in the past should not in itself be decisive or determinative. Lenders should look at an applicant&rsquo;s overall financial position, and satisfy themselves that the applicant has the means and ability to repay the proposed credit in line with the terms of the proposed credit contract.<\/p>  <p>  However, If a bank customer is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to the provision of credit or any other financial service, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If they are not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, they can refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>  <p>  Overall I expect regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will also continue to work with the Central Bank, and indeed also maintain contact with the main lenders, to ensure that appropriate arrangements and supports will be available for borrowers and other financial customers who continue to be impacted by COVID-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400068#WRK01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Advisers","counter":512,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400068#WRK01600"},{"type":"question","counter":513,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[9596\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400068#WRK01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the names and contact details for each special adviser requested for appointment by him, in tabular form.

I can however provide the following overview of the tax regime applicable to different types of collective investment in Irish property.<\/p>  <p>  The normal tax treatment afforded to collective investment funds is that the monies invested are allowed to grow on a tax-free basis within the fund.  The income is taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice.<\/p>  <p>  Investors in funds are generally subject to tax in their jurisdiction of residence. However investment in Irish property is an exception to this general tax treatment. Finance Act 2016 introduced the Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) regime to address concerns regarding the use of collective investment vehicles by non-residents to minimise exposure to Irish tax on Irish property transactions.<\/p>  <p>  An IREF is an investment undertaking where 25% or more of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets. Generally IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on distributions to non-resident investors. Certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings are generally exempt from the withholding tax provided the appropriate declarations are in place. Non-resident investors from treaty resident countries may be able to reclaim some part of IREF withholding tax if the relevant tax treaty allows for this. Irish resident investors may be subject to the investment undertakings exit tax, at a rate of 41%.<\/p>  <p>  Investors can also invest in Irish property through a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). A REIT is a quoted company, used as a collective investment vehicle to hold rental property. The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle. REITs are publicly listed companies - therefore distributions are dividends within the scope of Dividend Withholding Tax, which applies at a rate of 25%. REITs are obliged to distribute at least 85% of profits annually.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the wider residential housing market, institutional investors occupy a relatively small share of the market. Data provided by the Residential Tenancies Board in November 2020 reports that the majority (over 70%) of landlords registered a single rental tenancy, with over 96% of landlords registering 5 tenancies or less. Landlords with 5 tenancies or less account for almost 72% of all registered tenancies. Therefore, their impact on overall housing affordability, for tenants or owner-occupiers, may be limited.<\/p>  <p>  However, institutional investment is an important factor in increasing the overall supply of property, particularly of urban apartments, through forward-funding of development. Increasing the supply of urban apartments is essential to reach the National Planning Framework targets and commitment to a more sustainable living generally.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to affordability, the Programme for Government seeks to put affordability at the heart of the housing system with a commitment to prioritise the increased supply affordable homes and to ensure that local authorities are central to delivering housing, and progress a State-backed affordable home purchase scheme to promote home ownership. To this end the Cabinet recently published the Affordable Housing Bill 2020 which provides for a number of affordable purchase and cost rental schemes. In addition, progress is continuing for the establishment of the Land Development Agency on a statutory basis who will be tasked to work with Government Departments, local authorities, State agencies and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400068#WRK03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":528,"content":"<p>Question No. 184 answered with Question No. 158.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":529,"content":"<p>Question No. 185 answered with Question No. 157.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":530,"content":"<p>Question No. 186 answered with Question No. 165.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":531,"content":"<p>Question No. 187 answered with Question No. 157.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400068#WRK03700"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[9775\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400068#WRK03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the yield from the life assurance exit tax in 2019 and 2020; and the forecasted yield in 2021.","asker":"1613","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":534,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the yield from Life Assurance Exit Tax was &euro;128 million in 2019 and the provisional yield for 2020 is &euro;124 million.<\/p><p>The forecasts published by my Department as part of Budget 2021 forecast a yield of &euro;125 million for Life Assurance Exit Tax in 2021.

This provides that any person servicing these loans or who holds the legal title to such loans will, unless it already falls within the regulatory remit of the Central Bank, have to be authorised as a 'credit servicing firm', by the Central Bank.  Accordingly, such firms must comply with the financial services law that applies to Central Bank &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo; and this ensures that consumers whose loans are sold or transferred to another firm maintain the same regulatory protections, including under the various Central Bank statutory Codes of Conduct, such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012 and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA), which applied prior to the loan sale.  Also the contract terms and conditions of the loan will also remain unchanged following a &lsquo;loan sale&rsquo;, including those terms which govern the adjustment of the interest rate, and the new 'loan owner' will not be able to acquire any additional contractual benefits or rights solely arising from the 'loan sale'.  Therefore, any future adjustment of the interest rate on a mortgage following a &lsquo;loan sale&rsquo; will be subject to the relevant terms of the mortgage contract and, within that contractual constraint, the setting of the interest rate following a &lsquo;loan sale&rsquo; will be a commercial matter for the new &lsquo;loan owner&rsquo; or servicer.<\/p>  <p>  However, it should also be noted that in August 2019 the Central Bank wrote to the industry to set out its expectations of all firms in respect of sales, securitisations, purchases and transfers of residential mortgage loans. This letter including expectations in respect of the transfer of alternative repayment arrangements (ARAs) and it indicated that, where a co-operating borrower is complying with the terms of an ARA put in place, and the loan is subsequently sold to another regulated entity, the new regulated entity cannot unilaterally change the loan contract as agreed between the borrower and the original lender. The new regulated entity should continue to honour an ARA in place until review and\/or expiry, as appropriate.  This includes honouring timelines and terms and conditions for reviews of the ARA.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Consumer Protection Code requires that a regulated entity must notify affected personal consumers on paper or on another durable medium of any change in the interest rate on a loan. This notification must include specific information, including details of the date from which the new rate applies, the old and new rate, the revised repayment amount, as well as an invitation for the personal consumer to contact the lender if he or she anticipates difficulties meeting the higher repayments.  In relation to variable interest rates, the Code also requires that regulated entities identify the factors which may result in changes to the variable interest rate and clearly outline the criteria and procedures applicable to the setting of the variable interest rate. <\/p>  <p>  Where a borrower experiences difficulties with paying a mortgage on a primary residence, the regulated firm must comply with the requirements of the CCMA. The arrears handling provisions of the Code apply when the loan is not a mortgage loan to which the CCMA applies.  Furthermore, if a person is not satisfied with the with the actions of a regulated entity s\/he can make a complaint to that entity and if the matter is not resolved at that level s\/he can make a complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (www.fspo.ie).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400069#WRL03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":584,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400069#WRL03600"},{"type":"question","counter":585,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[10177\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400069#WRL03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department will carry out a review of policy regarding the temporary wage subsidy scheme with regard to childminders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":586,"content":"<p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), which is provided for in section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020, operated from 26 March 2020 to 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme was introduced as an emergency measure to provide financial support to businesses that were severely impacted by the pandemic and enabled employees whose employers could no longer afford to pay wages receive subsidy payments.

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who are on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.  Also a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400069#WRL05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":605,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400070#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":606,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[10396\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400070#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding late returns filed by businesses with the Revenue Commissioners for corporation tax; if the Revenue Commissioners are applying surcharges once again; his views on whether as businesses continue to trade during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic that they should be afforded more time to make their returns without the imposition of a surcharge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1515","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":607,"content":"<p>I am aware that Revenue has implemented a range of administrative concessions to assist taxpayers, and their tax agents, in meeting tax return filing and payment deadlines since the beginning of the pandemic, including the suspension of late filing surcharges.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Corporation Tax (CT1) returns, I am advised by Revenue that late filing surcharges in respect of the 2019 tax year have been suspended since 23 March 2020.

At the end of the 12-month interest free period, the warehoused debt may be paid in full without incurring an interest charge or paid through a phased payment arrangement at a significantly reduced interest rate of 3% per annum.  This compares to the standard rate of 8% or 10% per annum that would otherwise apply to such debts.<\/p>  <p>  Businesses that previously availed of the Debt Warehousing Scheme and subsequently resumed trading (for example, between September and December 2020 as mentioned in the case in question), can recommence availing of the support if their trade has again been impacted by the latest restrictions.

The importance of (1) maintaining and building adequate levels of reserves, including adequate operational risk reserves, which is key to ensuring credit union financial stability and resilience and (2) the protection which capital reserves provide against the potential macroeconomic impacts of disruptive events, including capacity of credit unions to absorb credit or other losses that may arise, were also highlighted.<\/p>  <p>  More specifically on distributions for the 2020 year-end, given the current level of risk and uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, the Central Bank expects all credit unions to take a prudent approach.

In order to claim the Stay and Spend Tax Credit, taxpayers are required to upload a copy of their receipt(s) for qualifying expenditure to the Revenue Receipts Tracker and then make a formal claim for the tax credit when submitting their annual Income Tax Return. <\/p>  <p>  Under the scheme a claim may be made in relation to qualifying expenditure incurred between the period 1 October 2020 and 30 April 2021.  Broadly, qualifying expenditure includes expenditure on either holiday accommodation or &ldquo;eat in&rdquo; food and drink, with a minimum expenditure amount of &euro;25 per transaction being required. <\/p>  <p>  Claims relating to qualifying expenditure incurred in the period from 1 October 2020 to 31 December 2020 can be made when an individual is submitting his\/her 2020 Income Tax Return, which is now available for submission. <\/p>  <p>  As at 14 February 2021 a total of 7,799 claims have been included in 2020 Income Tax Returns.

However, as the filing deadline for the 2020 Income Tax Return is not until 31 October 2021, information on the total number of claims and cost for the 2020 year of assessment will not be available until after the filing date and the returns have been processed.  <\/p>  <p>  Subsequent to claims being made in respect of this new scheme and any other relief or deduction, verification of such reliefs and deductions forms part of Revenue&rsquo;s comprehensive risk assessment programme.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme itself was developed at a time when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted.   Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions have had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged.  A formal review has not been necessary to conclude that this has been the position. <\/p>  <p>  Decisions on next steps relating to the scheme have yet to be taken and I will continue to assess matters as circumstances evolve. <\/p>  <p>  It is important also to recall that Stay and Spend should not be viewed in isolation from the other measures put in place to support businesses generally and the hospitality sector in particular. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, the VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9 % from 1 November 2020.  This is a temporary measure to provide support to the sector, where many businesses remain closed for now and those that are open are operating at significantly reduced capacity, and will apply from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the hospitality and tourism sector and beyond.

The scheme was available to all employers, irrespective of how that employer operates (i.e. limited company, sole trade, partnership etc.).  However, self-employed individuals may have been eligible for the Department of Social Protection administered COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment scheme.  Revenue advise me that the numbers of self-employed people in receipt of PUP are not readily available.<\/p>  <p>  Payments made under the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) are income supports and share the characteristics of income.  The PUP follows the general taxation rule for social welfare type payments and, thus, is chargeable to income tax, but exempt from the USC and PRSI charges.  This will be the case whether, prior to receipt of the PUP, the recipient was a PAYE worker or a self-employed individual.  <\/p>  <p>  The taxation arrangements for the PUP were legislated for in Finance Act 2020 and the legislation reflects the standard approach to taxation of social welfare benefits, including jobseekers benefit for the self-employed, which is to tax the benefits on an actual basis under Schedule E.  Being taxed on an actual basis means that for each tax year, recipients of the PUP are taxed on the payments that are received in the corresponding calendar year.  This is the case regardless of the period for which a self-employed individual carrying on a trade or profession prepares his or her accounts for that trade or profession.  <\/p>  <p>  Outstanding liabilities for self-employed tax-payers are not treated in the same manner as outstanding liabilities for PAYE only tax-payers arising from receipt of the wage supports.<\/p>  <p>  Self-assessed individuals, i.e. chargeable persons, who have income from non-PAYE sources are obliged to file a tax return and account for all their income including the PUP in their tax return.  This is the case whether or not such individuals were in receipt of the PUP.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2020 tax return would be due to be filed by 31st October 2021, and any balance of tax owing would normally be due to be paid at the same time.  However, there is provision in Finance Act 2020 which expands the debt warehousing scheme to include taxpayers who self-assess for income tax.  The scheme is available to any self-assessed taxpayer (including a proprietary director) who expects that her\/his income for 2020 will be more than 25% lower than her\/his income for 2019 and as a result s\/he is unable to pay the balance of income tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax 2020.  ROS filers had until 10 December to pay and file their 2019 Form 11 and to pay preliminary tax for 2020.  This deadline also applied to ROS filers who wished to avail of the debt warehousing scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Where a taxpayer is eligible for warehousing, collection of these liabilities may be suspended for a period of 12 months from 31 October \/ 10 December, as appropriate.

In all of these engagements, I strongly emphasised the importance of timely communication with customers, staff and other stakeholders in relation to strategic decisions regarding Ulster Bank.  I also met with the FSU on Friday morning after the announcement and I have committed to further engagement with the FSU in relation to this issue. <\/p>  <p>  At this point in time I cannot reveal any detail of discussions with AIB and Permanent TSB (PTSB) for confidentiality and stock market abuse reasons.

Whilst the management of staff matters, including staffing levels, is entirely a matter for Ulster Bank and any counterparty who acquires its business, I would expect all stakeholders to be very sensitive in relation to the needs and rights of staff. This includes full compliance with European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 (TUPE Regulations), and honouring all agreements in place between the bank and staff representative bodies.  In addition, I would expect these entities to engage with staff representative bodies as appropriate.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that Ulster Bank&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Irish market must be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of Irish financial services legislation, including the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes of conduct. <\/p>  <p>  Provision 3.11 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 requires that a regulated entity that intends to cease operating, merge with another, or to transfer all or part of its regulated activities to another regulated entity must:<\/p>  <p>  - notify the Central Bank immediately;<\/p>  <p>  - provide affected consumers with at least two months&rsquo; notice to enable them to make alternative arrangements if they so wish;<\/p>  <p>  - ensure all outstanding business is properly completed prior to any transfer, merger or cessation of operations; or, in the case of a transfer or merger, inform customers as to how continuity of service will be provided following a transfer or merger; and<\/p>  <p>  - in the case of a merger or transfer of regulated activities, inform customers that their details are being transferred to the other regulated entity, if that is the case.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to loans, where they are sold or transferred to another regulated entity, the consumer protections in place for borrowers will not change and the relevant Irish and EU consumer protections continue to apply.  All mortgages or loans which are sold or assigned to a new creditor will continue to be subject to the terms of the contract as entered into by the borrower.  As a matter of contractual law, the new creditor will not be able to unilaterally change the terms and conditions of the contract.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018, which came into effect on 21 January 2019, if a loan is transferred, the holder of the legal title to the credit must be authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm, if it is not already regulated as a credit institution or a retail credit firm.  Such credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank, such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (Code) and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400070#WRM04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":645,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400070#WRM04400"},{"type":"question","counter":646,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[10567\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400070#WRM04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address a series of issues raised in correspondence (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":647,"content":"<p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was introduced on 26 March 2020 to provide income support to eligible employees where the employer&rsquo;s business activities were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  This scheme ended on 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employer Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The transitional phase of TWSS operated until 3 May 2020 and provided a subsidy of 70% of the average net weekly pay up to a maximum of &euro;410 in respect of eligible employees.  The operational phase of the scheme was introduced from 4 May 2020 and included increased subsidy rates up to 85%, to a maximum subsidy payment of &euro;410.  The operational phase also included a tapering mechanism that ensured the subsidy payment plus any additional payment by the employer did not exceed the employee&rsquo;s &lsquo;normal&rsquo; average weekly wage (ARNWP).  This ARNWP, was calculated using the pay and tax details as reported to Revenue in the employer&rsquo;s payroll submission for each pay date in January and February 2020.   <\/p>  <p>  Under the TWSS the employer was expected to make best efforts to maintain employees&rsquo; net income for the duration of the scheme. However, there was no legal requirement for an employer to pay an additional gross (top up) payment that fully or partially made up the difference between the amount provided by the subsidy scheme and the employee&rsquo;s normal wage (ARNWP).  The TWSS legislation also required employers to separately identify subsidy payments on employee payslips from any top-up payments made.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding an employee&rsquo;s ultimate tax liability, the TWSS payments were subject to income tax and the Universal Social Charge (USC) but were taxed at the end of the year rather than the normal (real-time) manner that operates through the PAYE system.  Any top-up payments made by the employer continued to be taxed in real-time.  The EWSS has re-established the practice of operating PAYE in the normal (real-time) manner and will not result in employees having tax\/USC undercharges at year-end for 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue provided a 2020 Preliminary End of Year Statement to all employees in January 2021, including those who were in receipt of the TWSS.  The preliminary statement sets out the detail of the employee&rsquo;s income for the year according to the payroll submissions received from the employer and includes any TWSS payments received.  The statement also provides a preliminary calculation of the income tax and USC position for 2020 and indicates whether their tax position is balanced, underpaid or overpaid for the year.  The employee can then claim any additional benefits, for example, health expenses, to arrive at the final liability for 2020. Where a tax liability still exists, after all tax credits have been allocated, the amount owed can be paid as single payment or can be paid over four years from 1 January 2022 (interest free) by reducing the employee&rsquo;s tax credits.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that the employer in question operated the TWSS on behalf of its employees from 3 April 2020 to 31 August 2020.  Following a review of the matter, Revenue is satisfied that the business operated the scheme correctly and took account of any top-up payments made to the employees in calculating the amount of subsidy due, having regard to each employee&rsquo;s ARNWP.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400070#WRM04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry Regulation","counter":648,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400070#WRM04700"},{"type":"question","counter":649,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[10591\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400070#WRM04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider measures to stop insurance companies increasing premiums on long-term, incident-free customers given that it is crippling businesses and community service providers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":650,"content":"<p>At the outset, while I have an appreciation of the specific issue the Deputy raises, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter. In addition, we cannot compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to specific individuals or groups, such as businesses or community service providers. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.<\/p>  <p>  On a general level, my understanding is that firms will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  For example, factors may include the policyholder&rsquo;s type of business\/service; their size; their claims record; and so on.  Different factors will apply to different insurance products, and the weighting of each factor could possibly vary from year to year. Insurers also price in accordance with their specific claims experience and do not use the same combination of rating factors.  Accordingly, premium prices vary across the market, demonstrating why it is important for consumers to shop around on their insurance policies.<\/p>  <p>  While the Government cannot direct the pricing of insurance products, it can introduce reforms to assist in bringing the cost of insurance down.  The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Insurance Reform contains a range of deliverables, including legislation where required, in a number of Government Department policy areas.  Work is already under way in relation to certain areas, including:<\/p>  <p>  - increasing market transparency through the National Claims Information Database (NCID), including for employer and public liability insurance; <\/p>  <p>  - reviewing the duty of care legislation;<\/p>  <p>  - providing for the Judicial Council&rsquo;s accelerated adoption by 31 July 2021 of new personal injuries guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum;<\/p>  <p>  - consideration by the Department of Justice of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recent Report on Capping Damages in Personal Injuries Actions; and,<\/p>  <p>  - looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising that many businesses and self-employed persons need to see the impact of these reforms as soon as possible, the Action Plan contains 66 actions, 95% of which are due to be completed by the end of 2021.  The focus is clearly on completing these actions in the short to medium term.  I am hopeful that key reforms around personal injury awards may start to have an impact during this year on the pricing and availability of insurance. <\/p>  <p>  As mentioned previously, it is important that policyholders shop around for insurance at renewal.  In that regard, I would also highlight to the Deputy that an Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market has now been established in my Department.  This will provide for more joined-up policy response on promoting competition in this sector, as well as provide for greater information to assist consumers and businesses to assist with shopping around.  Minister of State Fleming will report to the Cabinet Sub-Group on Insurance Reform on the work of the Office.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, where a policyholder feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider.  The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400070#WRM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":652,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400070#WRM05100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":651,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400070#WRM05000"},{"type":"question","counter":652,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[9449\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400070#WRM05100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he has investigated the need for tidal defences in the River Liffey including the possibility of a retractable barrier.","asker":"1554","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p>In relation to assessment of options for tidal defences in the River Liffey, including the possibility of a retractable barrier, I am advised that the Eastern CFRAM for the Liffey River Basin (referred to as Unit of Management &lsquo;9&rsquo;) assessed a range of flood risk management options for the Liffey Catchment and Dublin City.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the assessment of options for managing the overall flood risk in the Liffey sub-catchment, the option of a tidal barrier in Dublin Bay was considered, but was rejected from the screening process on grounds of economic viability.

In relation to the arterial drainage schemes, the OPW carries out these works in order to ensure that the level of drainage afforded to the benefiting agricultural lands is maintained. Arterial drainage maintenance provides benefit to in excess of 242,800 hectares (600,000 acres) of agricultural land and provides a level of flood protection to in excess of twenty thousand dwellings and properties located within the benefiting lands and over seven thousand properties which are located behind scheme embankments. In addition, a significant level of flood protection is afforded to dwellings, properties and infrastructure in the towns and villages through which these arterial drainage scheme channels flow.<\/p>  <p>  These maintenance works are carried out in accordance with relevant legislation, through a range of environmental assessments, including Strategic Environmental Assessments, Appropriate Assessments and Ecological Assessments.  These maintenance operations are carried out in line with the OPW&rsquo;s Environmental Guidance,  Drainage Maintenance and Construction Procedures. This guidance was developed in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Inland Fisheries Ireland.   Benefiting opportunities are often taken, both directly and in conjunction with other agencies, to include environmental enhancement measures as part of their maintenance operations.

","asker":"1467","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":688,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 246 and 247 together.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I have responsibility for the development of policy to ensure adequate expenditure oversight on capital projects and for public procurement. National rules governing public procurement must comply with the relevant EU, WTO and national legal requirements and obligations.  Public procurement rules include provisions addressing EU and national legislation on the protection of labour rights. <\/p>  <p>  As a consequence, public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts and applicants are required to make declarations in relation to their financial standing, their legal standing and in relation to payment of taxes and social welfare contributions.  They are also obliged to declare whether they have breached aspects of employment law.<\/p>  <p>  The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.<\/p>  <p>  The Capital Works Management Framework, (CWMF), managed by my Department, through the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), provides the necessary tools for Contracting Authorities to manage the procurement process and to ensure adequate supervision and oversight on construction projects.  This Framework is mandated for use on all capital funded construction projects. The provisions include the conditions of the Public Works Contract which outline the functions of the contract administrator; the Employer's Representative during the construction stage of a project as well as dedicated guidance, (Guidance Note 3.1-Implementation Process), on the management and oversight of the project once works commence.<\/p>  <p>  A Sectoral Employment Order (SEO) fixes the statutory minimum rates of pay and other conditions for example, sick pay and pension entitlements for persons employed in a given economic sector. An employer in that sector has a legal duty to comply, at minimum, with those terms. <\/p>  <p>  Clause 5.3 of the public works contracts contains provisions about Pay and Conditions of Employment which applies to all those engaged on the works, regardless of whether they are employed by the contractor or their subcontractors. <\/p>  <p>  This clause requires the contractor to be compliant with certain aspects of employment and health and safety law.  It also requires a contractor to ensure that all deductions from payments to workers as required by Law, are paid accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  The main contractor is obliged to display a copy of the Pay and Conditions of Employment clause from the public works contract in a prominent place on the site for the benefit of all those employed on the project.<\/p>  <p>  The main contractor is required to provide a certificate of compliance (titled &lsquo;Rates of Pay and Conditions of Employment Certificate&rsquo;) with each interim statement submitted (normally on a monthly basis). Failure to provide this compliance certificate will result in payment not being made by the contracting authority. If a main contractor provides a certificate of compliance that is subsequently found to be untrue or partly untrue the contracting authority has the right to deduct the money relating to the work or part of the work covered by the certificate from any sums due to the main contractor. This money can be withheld until the pay and conditions of employment issue is made right. The ultimate sanction if a main contractor continues to be non-compliant is for the contract to be terminated.<\/p>  <p>  The public works contracts also oblige a contractor to maintain records of pay, timesheets and any deductions made on behalf of all those employed on the site.  These records are subject to inspections by representatives of the contracting authority as required.<\/p>  <p>  In summary a contracting authority has the right to: to withhold payment if certification of compliance with the provisions of clause 5.3 is not provided; audit specified documents; deduct from payment if certification is proven to be incorrect; and terminate the agreement where the contractor fails to remedy the situation. <\/p>  <p>  The foregoing are contractual remedies available to the contracting authority where there is evidence of non-compliance.  There is also a statutory framework in place to enforce employment law.  The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is an office under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is a statutory office and is independent in the exercise of its functions. The role of the WRC is to achieve compliance with employment legislation, including SEOs. Employees whose rights under an SEO have not been complied with can refer the matter to the WRC for investigation.<\/p>  <p>  My Department would not typically receive complaints of non-compliance with employment law for particular projects. Such complaints would go to the relevant contracting authority or directly to the WRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400071#WRN02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":689,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400071#WRN02800"},{"type":"question","counter":690,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[10031\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400071#WRN02900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if works are planned in 2021 on a river (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":691,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) is responsible for the maintenance of Arterial Drainage Schemes completed under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.

This introduced digital legal deposit in Ireland. Allied to that is the challenge of archiving the web and the difficulties of collecting, preserving and providing access to information as digital content grows at an unprecedented rate.  Since 2011, as part of its mission is to collect, protect and make available the recorded memory of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland (NLI), has selectively archived the web, moving toward the creation of an archive of Irish websites.  Web archiving is the process of  &ldquo;harvesting&rdquo; portions of the web and preserving the collections in an archival format to ensure it remains accessible in the future.  The harvested sites are preserved sometimes long after the original site has disappeared.  An archived website is fully functioning and can be navigated like a live website.<\/p><p>The NLI&rsquo;s web archiving activity since 2011 has collected websites of important events in Irish life.  The collection includes inter alia websites such as government websites, websites for sporting events, festivals, elections, referenda and websites of political parties.

The public is encouraged to recommend websites through a nomination form on the website.

They can decline at any point to being included in the web archive.  Sites are collected by a &lsquo;web crawler&rsquo; which is a piece of automated software designed to capture websites at a particular point in time.  The crawler downloads code, images, documents and other files that are essential to reproducing the website and its contents so that it is as similar to its original form as possible.

The importance of a strong and independent media sector has been highlighted in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. The production and publication of newspapers, journals and periodicals and the distribution of those publications has been listed as an essential service. <\/p>  <p>  The sector faces a fall in revenue arising from the pandemic, but also longer term challenges as a result of changing patterns of media consumption, technology and shifts in advertising revenue. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of these longer term challenges, the Programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission to consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion.  The Commission, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, recently concluded a public consultation to which a number of stakeholders in the print sector have made submissions. The Commission is currently in the process of engaging with key stakeholders in a series of thematic dialogues. I look forward to receiving the Commission's Report on the completion of its work which will inform media policy, including print media, over the next 10 years. <\/p>  <p>  Commercial radio is supported by a statutory scheme provided for under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 and largely funded by the television licence. This scheme is limited by statute to audiovisual and sound media and is administered on an independent basis by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. There is no equivalent statutory scheme for the print sector but recommending an approach to the longer term sustainability of media, including the print sector, is among the matters to be considered by the Future of Media Commission. In terms of specific supports for the sector, it is of particular importance in relation to media organisations to avoid any perception of Government interference or influence and the funding of newspapers is therefore a complex issue.<\/p>  <p>  I am however cognisant of the importance of this sector, and the financial issues which it currently faces. The Government has put in place a range of supports for all businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which are available to local newspapers. <\/p>  <p>  Since I assumed formal responsibility for the media sector in September 2020, I have engaged in meeting key stakeholders including Newsbrands, Local Ireland and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ).  Work is continuing to explore the issues arising, with a follow up meeting between my officials and the NUJ taking place on 3rd February. I had a further meeting with Local Ireland on Wednesday 17th February and I have asked my officials to continue engagement with Local Ireland to further explore the issues facing the sector. <\/p>  <p>  My officials have also raised with the Government Information Service the importance of including the local  print sector in Government advertising spend, and I understand that the sector received &euro;3.4m of advertising spend related to COVID-19 in 2020. The sector is also included in the current resilience campaign. <\/p>  <p>  The enactment of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and the consequent establishment of a Media Commission is a commitment in the Programme for Government. Following Government approval of additional provisions on 8 December 2020, the finalised General Scheme was published and the Department is working closely with the  Office of the Attorney General in relation to the drafting of the Bill.  The General Scheme was also referred to the relevant Joint Oireachtas Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny which has now commenced. <\/p>  <p>  A free and pluralistic media is an essential component of a democratic society as the over concentration of media ownership into a small number of hands represents a potential harm to media plurality and runs counter to the public interest. In this context, the Competition Act 2002 (as amended) provides that all media mergers must be notified to me and that I must make a determination within 30 working days as to whether or not the proposed media merger may proceed based on an assessment of its impact on the plurality of media in the State. Every Ministerial determination since the establishment of the process has been made within the statutory 30 working day timeline. <\/p>  <p>  The review of the Defamation Act 2009 is a matter for the Minister for Justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400072#WRO00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Organisations","counter":733,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400072#WRO00600"},{"type":"question","counter":734,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[9750\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400072#WRO00700","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the system used for elite cyclists to gain entry on the high performance unit of Cycling Ireland; if guidelines have been set by Sport Ireland for this elite group in terms of funding and access; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":735,"content":"<p>Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, including high performance sport and its funding allocations.

In 2020, Cycling Ireland received &euro;440,000 in High Performance Programme Funding.<\/p>  <p>  The International Carding Scheme provides financial support to athletes for their training and competition programmes. The primary purpose of this funding is to support Irish athletes in reaching finals and achieving medals at European, World, Olympic and Paralympic level. The Scheme is criteria based, requiring athletes to achieve standards set forth by their NGB in agreement with Sport Ireland. These standards are based on performances achieved at international competitions. Athletes are considered and approved for funding by Sport Ireland based on applications received from Cycling Ireland. As part of the International Carding Scheme Sport Ireland allocated &euro;426,000 to Cycling Ireland, which was made up of &euro;224,000 for their Olympic Programme and &euro;202,000 for their Paralympic Programme.<\/p>  <p>  Further to those listed on the International Carding Scheme, Sport Ireland recognises that there will be other athletes who will require support from the NGB, specifically those who are tracking to compete in Paris 2024.

The Report made 11 Specific Conclusions and Recommendations, many of which reflect or complement the actions set out in the Audiovisual Action Plan which is in train and whose implementation is overseen by a Steering Group comprising representatives from across Government. In May of 2019, the D&aacute;il debated a motion regarding the Report and the Minister set out progress in implementing the recommendations of the JOC Report. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendations 1, 3, 5, and 11 have been addressed under revisions to the section 481 tax incentive. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 1 states that &ldquo;section 481 is a key and central component within the Irish Film Industry\". Changes were made to section 481 in the Finance Act 2018, improving administrative processes and to extend the tax credit beyond its 2020 deadline to 2024. The Regional Film Development Uplift was also introduced. This is a short-term, tapered relief providing additional credit, commencing at 5%, for films made in an area designated as an assisted region under the State aid regional guidelines. The regional uplift will be phased out on a tiered basis. Changes made in Budget 2021 mean that the credit is available for an extra year at 5% in 2021, 3% in respect of claims made on or before 31 December 2022, 2% in respect of claims made on or before 31 December 2023, and reducing to 0% from year 2024 on. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 3 sought &ldquo;the reform of training in the sector to ensure that all training has a recognised qualification where possible, has a beginning and an end, and that trainees are not forced to repeat specific training&rdquo;. The Committee also recommended a wider geographical spread of training courses, the introduction of formal apprenticeships and additional finance to improve this training and development. The Regional Uplift measure outlined above is specifically designed to support the geographic spread of the audio-visual sector and ensure a spread of production activity beyond the current traditional production hubs in Ireland by incentivising the training and development of new, local pools of talent in the film sector in areas outside the current main production hubs.  Changes to Section 481 in 2019 has seen a strong focus on life-long learning and a more expansive range of skills development at all levels, including hard skills, soft skills, future skills, technical skills and leadership skills.  As part of an application for section 481, many companies are now required to work with Screen Ireland to develop training plans that consider the skills needs of the production, the company, the participant and the sector as a whole and to reflect on how the planned activity will address skills needs across different levels and different departments of the production from new entrants, trainees and crew to above the line talent and company leaders. This is designed to move away from a system where individuals are labelled as trainees and in doing so, addresses the concerns that the Committee flagged. Screen Skills Ireland, the training and skills development division of Screen Ireland, established a Screen Industry Education Forum in November 2018.  This event brings together industry stakeholders and education providers on a regular basis to focus on the skills development challenges and opportunities facing the screen sectors in Ireland. Due to COVID-19, it did not prove possible to host the event in 2020 but it is intended to hold the event again in 2021 if the circumstances allow. Screen Skills Ireland frequently collaborates with education providers to develop and deliver accredited\/certified programmes for participants in a range of roles and at all stages of their careers, and which emphasise inclusion and progression.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 5 outlined that an &ldquo;international comparative study should be constituted to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the Section 481 tax credit&rdquo;. Since the  publication of the Report, as part of its work for the Finance Bill 2018, the Department of Finance published its review of the section titled &lsquo;Review IV:  Cost Benefit Analysis of Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 &ndash; Film Corporation Tax Credit&rsquo;.  This analysis was the catalyst for the administrative changes to the section 481 application process. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 11 called for &ldquo;Public funding and adherence to employment standards&rdquo; to be linked. The Film Regulations 2019, introduced to give effect to changes in the section 481 procedures, include a requirement to provide a signed undertaking in respect of quality employment which requires both the producer company and the qualifying company to comply with all obligations in the field of environmental, social and employment law.  The producer company and the qualifying company must be responsible for compliance with all statutory requirements of an employer, have in place written policies and procedures in on Grievances, Discipline and Dignity at work (including harassment, bullying and equal opportunity).  The companies are also required to provide details of any Work Place Relations Commission decisions aligned with confirmation that any findings against the companies have been followed or an explanation where the finding has not been followed. This also addresses Recommendation 2 of the Report which expressed concerns with regard to working terms and conditions. While matters relating to collective bargaining rights of freelance workers do not fall directly under my remit, my Department has used the opportunities presented by the changes made to the section 481 procedures to improve conditions in the industry particularly in relation to training commitments by producer companies.  Recommendation 8 also deals with working conditions and more particularly, calls for state support for &ldquo;the precarious existence of actors and sustainable pension structures for workers within the Irish film industry&rdquo;. This comes within the remit of the Department of Social Protection, who passed legislation in the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 in December 2018 which addresses insecurity and unpredictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours. The Social Welfare Scheme for Self-Employed Artists has also been extended to the wider creative community which means that self-employed artists in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance for the first year that they are out of work will be able to focus on their artistic work and developing their portfolio, rather than having to participate in the normal labour market activation activities. Artists eligible to apply to the scheme include actors, theatre and film directors, dancers, opera singers, set, costume and lighting designers, musicians, composers, choreographers, architects and street performers. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the report of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce, which was a commitment in the Programme for Government, and which was published in 2020. That report outlined ten recommendations, including a proposed mechanism for rolling out of Universal Basic Income (UBI) through the establishment of a pilot project which would last three years. There is already a commitment in the Programme for Government to assess a pilot UBI and one that is informed by a review of previous international models. While my responsibilities as Minister do not encompass a UBI scheme, building on the  recommendation of the Taskforce, officials in my Department are engaging on this matter with the relevant Government Departments including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Finance.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 6 called for workers within the craft grades of the industry to have representatives nominated to the Irish Film Board to feed in their perspectives and needs into the industry&rsquo;s development. However, under the provisions of the Irish Film Board Acts 1980 to 2018, the Board of Screen Ireland as it is now known is not a representative board in the sense of comprising representatives from the various industry sectors:  Section 12 of the Act provides that 7 members shall be appointed to the Board by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Vacancies arose on the Board in 2020 and were advertised by the Public Appointments Service in October 2020. In the call for expressions of interest, applications were sought from people with a broad range of profiles and skillsets.  Appointments to the new board are expected in the coming weeks. Members of all State Boards are required to act on a fully informed basis, in good faith, with due diligence and care, and in the best interest of the State body, and are subject to the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 9 sought for the further integration of the film industry on a north\/south basis with the creation of formal north\/south structures, development plans and investment.  While Screen Ireland competes with Northern Ireland Screen in its efforts to attract inward production into the Republic of Ireland, it also regularly cooperates with Northern Ireland Screen in efforts to attract inward production to the island of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 4 saw the Committee call on the Irish Film Board to constitute the Board&rsquo;s Film Forum, with an independent Chair, in order to allow all stakeholders within the sector to meet and work together to develop mutually beneficial solutions for the industry while Recommendation 10 called on the unions and the representative organisations to work towards a mutually beneficial and respectful understanding.  As my predecessor previously set out to the House, despite efforts made by Screen Ireland in 2019, it did not prove possible to constitute a forum of all stakeholders that would adopt a collaborative approach as suggested by the Report. Instead, it seemed that the forum would simply comprise of the airing of disputes and grievances which are more properly dealt with by the State through other mechanisms such as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). In 2020, the WRC published a report following its audit of the Independent Film and Television Drama Production Sector. The audit set out to:<\/p>  <p>  -  examine industrial relations generally, employment practices and procedure,<\/p>  <p>  -  assess issues arising (if any), and<\/p>  <p>  -  make recommendations for their improvement where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The WRC received submissions from thirty-four groups and individuals from across the sector and made 4 recommendations.  <\/p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the WRC report was that an agreement be negotiated by the principal parties in the sector for their members, addressing pay, terms and conditions such as hours of work, per diems, travel time, overtime, sick leave and pensions, could be adopted as the industry norm.  Shortly after the publication of the WRC report came the very welcome announcement in December last by Screen Producers Ireland (SPI) and SIPTU that SIPTU members had approved a new Shooting Crew Agreement. This concluded over 3 years of negotiations between SPI and SIPTU in developing a modernised Crew Agreement which will act as a framework for the industry. Of particular importance is that the agreement implements an industry pension scheme operating under the Construction Workers Pension Scheme (CWPS) and establishes a monitoring structure to oversee the operation of the agreement. It also includes a commitment to developing the first Work\/Life Balance policy for the film and television industry. SPI has also delivered a number of workshops on HR best practice. The WRC Report acknowledged the value of continued skills development and work in this regard continues under the auspices of the audiovisual action plan. Screen Skills Ireland are also currently working with the Guilds to support development of competency frameworks. They also offer courses that support the Guilds in other ways and will examine the development of a training module, which was another proposal of the WRC. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work through the Audiovisual High Level Steering Group to address issues raised in the audiovisual industry, and to support the industry and the people who work in it. Officials continue to engage with stakeholders and through Screen Ireland to address matters arising, including the ongoing COVID19 challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400072#WRO04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":770,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[10336\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400072#WRO04300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the actions she is taking to end the practice of blacklisting of workers in the film industry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1497","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":771,"content":"<p>Where individuals believe they are being deprived of employment rights, they may make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court.  <\/p>  <p>  WRC inspectors can also be asked to investigate breaches of employment legislation or complaints arising from alleged breaches.

The Government believes it will be possible to reach a collective agreement which addresses the interests and concerns of all parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400073#WRP02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Persons Data","counter":822,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400073#WRP02800"},{"type":"question","counter":823,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[9557\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400073#WRP02900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of children and families in hotel accommodation and family hubs; and the prospects of secure housing for these persons.","asker":"1572","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":824,"content":"<p>My Department publishes a detailed monthly report on homelessness, based on data provided by housing authorities. The Report outlines details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities.

The Reports are available to access on my Department's website at the following link:  www.gov.ie\/en\/collection\/80ea8-homelessness-data\/.<\/p>  <p>  The most recently published report, in respect of December 2020, confirmed that there were 970 families in emergency accommodation during the survey week. This represents a 37% reduction on the position one year previously and is the lowest number of families in emergency accommodation since March 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  For families experiencing homelessness, family hubs offer a greater degree of stability than is possible in hotels with access to more appropriate living, storage, cooking and play areas for families.  There are currently 35 operational family hubs nationally, offering more than 760 units of family accommodation in key urban housing authorities. <\/p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of housing, particularly new build social and affordable homes, is a key priority of this Government. The Programme for Government commits to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000, with an emphasis on new builds. In Budget 2021, we backed this objective with funding of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing. Subject to the impact of the Covid related restrictions on the construction sector, the available funding will deliver 12,750 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing.  A major focus of this investment is the delivery of new build, with an overall target of 9,500 new homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400073#WRP03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":825,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400073#WRP03100"},{"type":"question","counter":826,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[9561\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400073#WRP03200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will consider issuing exemptions in written format to private citizens having to conduct emergency works under level 5 restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":827,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[10147\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400073#WRP03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if family home renovations will be considered specifically when planning and giving guidance for the reopening of the country over the coming weeks due to the substantial additional cost to families of delayed projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":828,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 292 and 329 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government announced that additional public health restrictions would apply under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19 on 6 January 2021.

In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. <\/p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner \/ cohabitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensuring the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature.

These encompass mainstreaming biodiversity into decision making across all sectors; strengthening the knowledge base for the conservation; increasing awareness and appreciation of biodiversity and ecosystem services; conserving and restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services in the wider countryside; the marine environment; expanding and improving management of protected areas and species; and strengthening international governance for biodiversity and ecosystem services.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan is an all-of-Government document and progress is monitored through the inter-departmental Biodiversity Working Group (BWG) and also by an independent advisory group, the Biodiversity Forum. In 2019, the members of the BWG reported on progress with implementation of relevant actions. On the basis of their submissions, my Department prepared and published an Interim Review in 2020. In late 2020, my Department funded the Biodiversity Forum workshop to report on the progress of the Plan.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the report of the Biodiversity Forum and its findings. The report notes that although there has been an increase in public awareness and cross-sectoral engagement in biodiversity, the status of biodiversity in protected areas and beyond is in poor condition and continues to decline. Though not surprising, there are a wide range of reasons for this situation, including long term funding for nature conservation and the way we use our land. The report outlines the strategic approach that is needed to address this biodiversity crisis.  <\/p>  <p>  There are strong commitments in the Programme for Government for biodiversity, including a commitment to review the remit, status and funding of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), to ensure that it is playing an effective role in delivering its overall mandate and enforcement role in the protection of wildlife.

The Act modifies the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 to prevent any notices of termination served by landlords, in all but limited cases such as anti-social behaviour, from taking effect in geographical locations and during periods specified by the Minister for Health in Regulations made by him under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 in respect of which a restriction applies on the movement of people outside a 5 km radius of their place of residence. The tenancy protections also apply during the 10 days directly following the period specified by the Minister for Health in the aforementioned Regulations.  <\/p><p>A moratorium on evictions taking place is currently in operation throughout the country from 31 December 2020 to 15 March 2021, with limited exceptions.

The Minister for Health is empowered to make Regulations to provide for any further extension to the 5km restriction on people's movement, as necessary to strengthen Government efforts to suppress the spread of Covid-19.  If further regulations are made restricting peoples movements to 5km then the protections provided for in the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 will automatically apply. On 23 February, the Government announced that level 5 restrictions will remain in place until 5 April.  Therefore, the moratorium on evictions will be extended to 15 April once regulations, currently being prepared by my colleague the Minister for Health, are made.<\/p><p>Separately, the provisions of Part 3 (Residential Tenancies) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 came into effect on 11 January 2021 to provide for temporary modifications to the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, subject to certain conditions, that during the period from 11 January to 12 April 2021 a 90 day (rather than the usual 28 days) termination notice period applies, where a tenant is in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and is at risk of losing their tenancy. The earliest termination date allowed in such circumstances is 13 April 2021. Rent increases are prohibited for relevant tenancies until 13 April 2021, with no back-dating allowed.

Through the URDF, successful applicants are receiving targeted integrated support for innovative holistic solutions to the issues that have hindered the regeneration and rejuvenation of our large towns and cities. To date provisional allocations totalling almost &euro;300m have issued in respect of these projects. <\/p><p>The programme has been very well received and supported, and while responsibility for the advancement of proposals is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant applicant my Department is working closely with applicants to advance these projects as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>Call 2 for proposals under the URDF was announced in 2020, with a primary focus on contributing to compact growth objectives through the support of integrated urban developments, strategic development areas combining a number of elements and schemes that support wider climate action objectives and liveability factors within our cities and towns.  Applications under Call 2 were open to local authorities only.  76 proposals were received, with every local authority submitting at least one application. Because of the nature of the URDF programme the proposals are of significant scale and complexity, and each requires detailed assessment.  <\/p><p>This assessment process is nearing completion, and I intended to soon announce a new tranche of approved URDF supported proposals, which will augment the existing pipeline of projects from Call 1 and contribute to the achievement of Programme for Government commitments and the objectives of the National Planning Framework and Project Ireland 2040.<\/p><p>The Table below lists the 87 projects approved under Call 1 together with up-to-date provisional URDF funding allocations and details of the payments made to each applicant in respect of their projects in 2019, 2020, and to date in 2021. As the announcement of successful proposals under Call 1 of the URDF was made in late 2018 there was no expenditure on the URDF supported capital programme in that year.<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>County<\/th>       <th>Applicant<\/th>       <th><div> Project<\/div><\/th>       <th>Provisional Allocation<div><br \/><br \/>&euro;

The operation of these Missions is regulated by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 as transposed into Irish law by the Diplomatic and Immunities Act 1967.  Privileges and immunities of accredited diplomatic agents in Ireland are governed by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963, as incorporated into Irish law, by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Acts 1967-2006.<\/p><p>Article 29 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations provides that a diplomatic agent shall not be liable to any form of arrest or detention, while Article 31 provides that a diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State. Diplomatic immunity must be expressly waived for criminal proceedings to commence. <\/p><p>Road traffic offences allegedly committed by people entitled to diplomatic immunity in Ireland may be brought to the attention of the Department of Foreign Affairs by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In such cases, the Department reminds resident Diplomatic Missions about their obligations under Article 41.1 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which requires all persons enjoying privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State, and informs the concerned Diplomatic Mission of the alleged incident. The number of alleged road traffic offences committed by members of the diplomatic community in Ireland is proportionately low. In general, Diplomatic Missions operate in compliance with Irish law. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, my Department expects all those agents duly accredited here, who are entitled to privileges and immunities in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, to respect Irish laws and regulations, as indeed, we expect our Embassies abroad to respect the laws and regulations of the host country. I recall that the purpose of diplomatic privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the effective performance of the functions of Diplomatic Missions. In addition, Article 31(4) of the Vienna Convention provides that the immunity of a diplomatic agent from the jurisdiction of the receiving State does not exempt the agent from the jurisdiction of the sending State.<\/p><p>The tables below have been compiled from electronic records held by the Department of Foreign Affairs and relate to alleged incidents brought to the attention of the Department by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: <\/p><p>(i)  the number of alleged road traffic offences in each year from 2010 &ndash; 2020;<\/p><p>(ii) the number of alleged road traffic offences for each Diplomatic Mission from 2010 &ndash; 2020.<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>No. of alleged Road Traffic Offences<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2010 <\/td>       <td>15 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2011 <\/td>       <td>15 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 <\/td>       <td>7 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 <\/td>       <td>11 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 <\/td>       <td>9 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 <\/td>       <td>15 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 <\/td>       <td>8 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 <\/td>       <td>11 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 <\/td>       <td>15 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>11 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>9 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>No. of alleged Road Traffic Offences<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2010 <\/td>       <td>15 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2011 <\/td>       <td>15 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 <\/td>       <td>7 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 <\/td>       <td>11 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 <\/td>       <td>9 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 <\/td>       <td>15 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 <\/td>       <td>8 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 <\/td>       <td>11 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 <\/td>       <td>15 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>11 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>      <td>2020 <\/td>        <td>9 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Diplomatic Mission<\/th>       <th>No. of alleged Road Traffic Offences 2010 -

Irish students will, however, be treated on the same basis as UK students from outside Scotland.  <\/p>  <p>  This means that Irish undergraduate students living in the UK or Ireland will be liable for fees of up to &pound;9,250 per annum for courses at Scottish higher education institutions, beginning later this year. In light of this, and with a view to mitigating the negative impacts of this change, Scotland has however set aside a residency requirement, which will allow Irish students to access its student loan system. It is important to note that these new arrangements will not impact on Irish students who have already commenced their studies at higher education institutions in Scotland.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Common Travel Area, Irish and British citizens are afforded the right to access all levels of education and training, and associated student support, in each other's State, on terms no less favourable than those for the citizens of that State. I recognise in this context that Irish citizens will be treated no less favourably than British citizens, resident outside Scotland, for the purposes of student fees in Scotland. Notwithstanding that, I regret the introduction of the policy, which may impact on student mobility.  <\/p>  <p>  I - and officials in my Department - work on an on-going basis with the British Government to ensure the smooth operation of Common Travel Area and its associated rights and privileges. This work is mirrored across Government Departments, and each sectoral area.  <\/p>  <p>  Both the Minister for Further and Higher Education and I have spoken with our Scottish counterparts on several occasions in relation to the new fee arrangements for Irish students. We are also looking ahead and have discussed how best to develop future co-operation between Ireland and Scotland in the areas of further and higher education and research.<\/p>  <p>  The Ireland-Scotland Joint Bilateral Review Report 2021-25, which I launched with the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for External Affairs in January, is focused on developing the Ireland-Scotland relationship in the round in the coming years.

These issues have been discussed in a series of virtual meetings which I have had with EU and European counterparts recently while they also arose at the virtual meeting of the General Affairs Council which Minister Byrne attended on 23 February.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions regarding a coordinated approach to travel within the EU took place within the General Affairs Council last autumn culminating in the adoption of Council Recommendation 2020\/1475 establishing the EU traffic light system for travel in October 2020. The Council Recommendation was further updated earlier this year in order to allow greater discretion to Member States to impose tougher restrictions, if warranted by the epidemiological situation in their country. A number of Member States including Ireland have in recent weeks temporarily departed from the traffic light system for travel in response to the emergence of new variants of the COVID-19 virus. It is hoped that once the epidemiological situation improves both in Ireland and across the EU that the traffic light system for travel can once again be fully implemented by the majority of Member States in order to facilitate freedom of movement and travel within the EU and across the continent generally. <\/p>  <p>  Over the last number of months, a number of Member States have also raised the issue of &lsquo;vaccine certificates&rsquo; and suggested they could be used, amongst other things, to facilitate greater ease of travel in the EU once restrictions are lifted in Member States. The EU has since published guidelines in relation to covid vaccination certificates but these guidelines limit their proposed use to medical use only, rather than for travel.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to differentiate vaccine certificates, which are used to identify and monitor those who have been vaccinated, and an immunity passport which may allow an exemption from public health measures on the basis that the person has purported immunity to COVID-19. The WHO has cautioned Governments against introducing immunity passports at this time and has advised that the focus should remain on vaccine certificates as a medical record.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the use of digital vaccination certificates for travel &ndash; or vaccine passports, whilst various technical solutions are being considered in case they are required, no policy position has yet been developed to determine whether they will be used or for what purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400076#WRS06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":1046,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400077#WRT00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Offices","counter":1045,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400077#WRT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1046,"qnumday":371,"qnumall":"[9367\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400077#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the facilities available in his Department to facilitate breastfeeding breaks in accordance with WHO guidelines of two years for women in the workplace and as part of the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1047,"content":"<p>My Department strictly adheres to the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004, including the associated Regulations which provide for the protection of mothers who are breastfeeding.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has offices in Newbridge, Galway, Roscrea and Dublin.

Public health remain of the view that schools are low risk environments and that the infection prevention and control measures in place in school are effective but recognise there is an ongoing need to reduce societal activity and movement to curb the spread of the virus at this time. <\/p>  <p>  The CMO has made it very clear in his advices to Government which are published on gov.ie, that schools are safe environments, with very little evidence of transmission within schools, and that the majority of infections of children and adolescents occurs outside the school setting. The decision to delay the reopening of schools was in recognition of the need to reduce societal activity and movement to curb the spread of the virus at a time where there was unprecedented levels of disease transmission in the community. This was not based on a changed assessment of the risks in relation to transmission levels in schools. <\/p>  <p>  Public Health have also stated that the new variants of the disease do not change the infection prevention and control measures required in schools. Schools have been supported by a funding package of almost &euro;650 m to put in place and maintain these key infection control measures. Public Health advice is that compliance with these measures ensure that schools remain safe places for children and staff.<\/p>  <p>  The vaccine protocol devised by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC), is endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and signed up to by Government. The Department of Health have confirmed that those essential to Education are estimated at this time to be in the first one third of the population captured by the Vaccine Allocation Strategy. My Department has further engaged with the Department of Health requesting that consideration is given to school community as the vaccination programme is rolled out in order to accommodate front line school staff within the vaccination programme at the earliest possible opportunity. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has developed a plan with the relevant education stakeholders for the phased return to in-school learning for children in primary, post-primary and special schools.  From the 1 March the first four classes at primary level &ndash; junior and senior infants, first and second class &ndash; and final year Leaving Certificate students will return to school.  This phase will also see a return to full attendance for children in special schools. This is in addition to the reopening of special schools on 11 February on a 50% attendance basis and all special classes reopened fully from 22 February. <\/p>  <p>  The full re-opening of our schools for all students in line with public health advice remains a top priority for Government and my Department is focussing on the safe return of all remaining cohorts of pupils and students to school at the earliest opportunity in March, with the last group of post primary students set to return to school after the Easter Break. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400077#WRT07900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Training","counter":1124,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400078#WRU00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1125,"qnumday":393,"qnumall":"[10519\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400078#WRU00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the case of students in a college (details supplied);

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. <\/p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation<\/p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs<\/p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools<\/p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. <\/p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards<\/p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act<\/p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council<\/p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. <\/p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; <\/p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).<\/p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.<\/p><p>- an independent appeals process.<\/p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. <\/p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.<\/p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act, including the individual sections of the Act referred to by the Deputy, have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. <\/p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support - 1\/5 of the Department's budget and up over 42% since 2011.<\/p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  <\/p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. <\/p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. <\/p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. <\/p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. <\/p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  <\/p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.<\/p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:<\/p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. <\/p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. <\/p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400078#WRU05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"question","counter":1179,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[9483\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400078#WRU05800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a July provision in-school style programme will be run during the Easter holidays for children with special educational needs in autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classrooms; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1180,"content":"<p>My Department is conscious of the fact that closing schools has hugely adverse consequences at individual, family and societal level and that the effect on children with special educational needs can be even greater.

It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  <\/p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need.

However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.  <\/p><p>Most children with special educational needs are enrolled and supported in mainstream classes and data is not collected on the numbers.

The NCSE continues to work at local level to identify any and all relevant suitable placements. <\/p><p>Special classes in the Dublin area generally operate at capacity, and the NCSE is working with a significant number of schools in the county to encourage and support the opening of new ASD classes at all levels. <\/p><p>I can also reassure the Deputy that the local SENOs continue to be available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>Further information on special schools, special classes and contact details for SENOs is available at www.ncse.ie. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400079#WRV01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil-Teacher Ratio","counter":1213,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400079#WRV01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1214,"qnumday":418,"qnumall":"[9545\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400079#WRV01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of primary and secondary schools across areas in south-east Dublin; the staff to student ratios and levels of each by patronage in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1555","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1215,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, data on schools across the country is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.education.ie under the &ldquo;Find a School&rdquo; function.

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. <\/p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation<\/p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs<\/p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools<\/p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. <\/p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards<\/p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act<\/p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council<\/p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. <\/p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; <\/p><p>-  an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>-  consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).<\/p><p>-  the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.<\/p><p>-  an independent appeals process.<\/p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. <\/p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.<\/p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act, including the individual sections of the Act referred to by the Deputy, have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. <\/p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support - 1\/5 of the Department's budget and up over 42% since 2011.<\/p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  <\/p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. <\/p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. <\/p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. <\/p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. <\/p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  <\/p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.<\/p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:<\/p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. <\/p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. <\/p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons.

These supports include teachers engaging with their pupils\/students on a regular basis, through a blend of guided and independent learnings tasks and experiences.

As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie\/backtoschool. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074\/2020  (Communication\/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.<\/p>  <p>  Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, my Department published an updated version of the publication which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects.<\/p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above the SEC has advised schools of the flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework. Details of revised schedules for these components will be issued to schools shortly.  <\/p>  <p>  Putting in place both the examinations and a corresponding measure of SEC-Accredited Grades is essential to ensuring a fair system, having regard to the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and the loss of learning that has occurred for this group of students due to the interruption of in-person teaching and learning during the periods of school closure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400080#WRW02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Educational Psychological Service","counter":1276,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400080#WRW02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1277,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[9888\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400080#WRW02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the supports being implemented to address the mental health needs of students and the increased need for support; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1278,"content":"<p>Promoting wellbeing is a fundamental element of the Department&rsquo;s overall plan to support school communities as we continue to manage the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  <\/p><p>The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department is leading on supporting the wellbeing of schools communities at this time. The response to support the wellbeing of all within school communities requires a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate and largely preventative and proactive.

NEPS will also continue to provide support to schools in the event of a critical incident.  <\/p><p>In the event that the need for a more targeted counselling or a specialised intervention is identified by the NEPS psychologist, a referral is made to an outside agency for evaluation and ongoing support.  The NEPS psychologist will identify the most appropriate referral pathway and support schools with the onward referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team (CAMHS), HSE Primary Care\/Community Psychology teams, or an identified local community based specialist mental health service.  <\/p><p>At post primary level, each school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, which is calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  Counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. The Guidance Counsellor is key in developing and implementing innovative approaches to wellbeing promotion on a whole schools basis though the school&rsquo;s Guidance Plan.  <\/p><p>As part of the resources announced to support schools 17 additional NEPS psychologists were sanctioned to provide enhanced services to support the wellbeing of our school communities at this time and 120 additional posts have been provided for guidance counselling in post primary schools.<\/p><p>Overall responsibility for the provision of child and adolescent mental health services lies within the remit of the Department of Health.

My Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within the particular area and its ability to meet increased demand.  <\/p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following: <\/p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.<\/p>  <p>  The requirement for additional school places is kept under on-going review and work on an updated exercise to assess needs for the coming years is at an advanced stage.<\/p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.   <\/p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been in operation under my Department since 2018 and provides objective information to parents in the relevant school planning areas to assist them in making an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction for the new school.  (Previously, applicant patrons were required to collect parental preferences directly from parents and submit these with their application to the Department.)  <\/p>  <p>  A prospective patron can chose the school(s) it wishes to apply for and complete an application form in that regard for each school, for submission to my Department.  The Department provides details on the OPPS of the school(s) and the list of applicant patrons which have applied for patronage of the school(s).  Parents can then access the OPPS website, which allows them to access the appropriate survey for their area, to input the details of the eligible child(ren) and to select their preferred patron and language of instruction (with the exception of the Irish-medium primary Gaelscoileanna which have been designated as Irish-medium prior to the opening of the OPPS - in the case of these schools, parents can select their preferred patron).  Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process. <\/p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400080#WRW04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Site Acquisitions","counter":1297,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400080#WRW04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1298,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[9929\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400080#WRW04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status on the site identification for a new secondary school in Gorey, County Wexford; when confirmation of the site location will be forthcoming; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1622","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1299,"content":"<p>I can confirm that officials from my Department are working closely with Wexford County Council towards acquiring a permanent site to meet the needs of the school to which the Deputy refers.

The Department of Education will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or over 20% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.<\/p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.<\/p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.<\/p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.<\/p><p>There are currently 36 special classes providing placements for students in Dublin 5, 13 and 17 at Primary and Post Primary level. I can assure the Deputy that where schools notify NCSE of vacancies within their specialist provision, SENOs work locally to ensure parents are made aware of these special class places.<\/p><p>Through ongoing consultation at local level, the NCSE is aware of those parents whose children will be seeking placement for the 2021\/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work to identify any and all relevant suitable placements.<\/p><p>Special classes in the Dublin area generally operate at capacity. The data available to NCSE suggests that additional special class placements are required in the Dublin 5, 13 and 17 postal areas and as a result NCSE is engaging with every local primary and post primary school to create additional placements and to identify the supports\/building requirements a school may require. The NCSE have specific plans in place to open a number of additional classes in schools in the postal codes areas referenced by the Deputy and in North Dublin generally.<\/p><p>The NCSE's local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs.

Also, due to the uncertainties of how GLPs would happen, any scheduled placements were put on hold for the 2020\/2021 academic year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been working for some time with stakeholders, including the Teaching Council, the Higher Education Institutes (including the College referred to by the Deputy), the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and CONCOS (umbrella body for Gaeltacht Colleges), to develop contingency arrangements to allow for the completion of GLPs in the current academic year. An agreement has now been reached to proceed with the delivery of an online version of the course in 2021.   <\/p>  <p>  These contingency plans allow for all placements scheduled to take place this year, related to the 2020\/21 academic year, along with those postponed from 2020. It will also ensure that any final year students have the opportunity to graduate as scheduled in summer 2021.   <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided for the re-instatement of the grant to cover the full cost of the Gaeltacht Learning Periods (GLPs) for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary ITE programmes, with effect from the 2020\/2021 academic year.  The grant was previously funded by my Department up to the 2012\/2013 academic year, when it was ceased due to financial constraints. The rate of the re-introduced student grant for 2021 has been set at an average of &euro;650. This will cover the cost of the undertaking the fortnightly online course in 2021. The re-introduced grant will be made available for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes. This is in line with normal practice for other grant payments per students qualifying requirements.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, it is understood that students had paid an average of &euro;750 for undertaking a fortnightly GLP in the Gaeltacht. This average cost has been in place for many years and included a contribution to cover accommodation costs associated with attending the course in the Gaeltacht. While the accommodation costs do not arise this year, it is acknowledged that Gaeltacht College providers do face a number of additional costs associated with the preparation, design and delivery of a new online programme. It should be noted that in normal circumstances, Gaeltacht householders who provide accommodation to trainee teachers attending recognised courses in Gaeltacht regions also qualify for a daily grant of &euro;10 per night under the terms of Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.<\/p>  <p>  It is the shared aim of all of the stakeholders involved that students experience a quality online programme. HEIs are currently working directly with their Gaeltacht College providers on implementing the practical and administrative arrangements for delivery of the GLP.<\/p>  <p>  An allowance has been made for 2nd year Professional Masters in Education (PME) students (including students in the College referred to by the Deputy). Those 2nd year PME students who have not completed any GLP will now complete a 3 week online programme (had previously been required to complete 4 weeks). 2nd year PME students who have completed some of their required GLP will now be required to complete the remaining balance (up to a total requirement of 3 weeks) online. This particular allowance, approved by the Teaching Council's Education Committee, recognised the significant timetabling issues facing 2nd year PME students in respect of school placement, the GLP and normal course work.<\/p>  <p>  The College referred to by the Deputy is an independent private provider of ITE programmes. In relation to the cost of the online programme for students in the College referred to by the Deputy, my Department has recently responded to a proposal from that College confirming that both my Department and the Teaching Council has no issue with that College, working in collaboration with a Gaeltacht College(s) to provide an online programme based on the agreed syllabus for their own students and to negotiate and set the cost for undertaking that programme for their own students.<\/p>  <p>  The estimated cost of extending the grant to cover all cohorts in the College referred to by the Deputy due to attend the GLPs in 2021 is &euro;1.19m. This is estimated using a variety of average costs due to the duration of the GLP ranging from one to three weeks.  The estimated costs of extending the grant to those in their final year only is &euro;0.53m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400084#WRAA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1486,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400084#WRAA02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1487,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[10508\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400084#WRAA02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the safety measures being put in place in schools, for example, ventilation and air purification systems, in order for them to re-open safely; the sourcing, installation and costing of same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy\/colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom. This will assist in managing comfort levels in classrooms. Managing comfort levels will be easier for schools now than during the winter period.<\/p>  <p>  In updating the guidance in November, the Department's Planning and Building Unit reviewed the HPSC guidance that consideration be given to installing an indoor air quality monitor in classrooms. The updated guidance sets out that in the main windows are likely to be required to be open at a frequency and level in the classroom irrespective of whether the opening of windows is prompted through the indoor air quality monitor (re-active approach) or through the pro-active approach outlined in the Department's guidance and that therefore it is not considered necessary to install such monitors in classrooms.

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated that it had to have regard to any potential Exchequer exposure associated with dealing with the specific issue as regards CE supervisors arising from the Labour Court recommendation.<\/p><p>At this point, I want to acknowledge the valuable and dedicated service that CE supervisors provide in running CE schemes delivering local based community services while providing a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.<\/p><p>The current position is that officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing CE Supervisors continue to engage in discussions and I am hopeful that, with goodwill and flexibility on all sides, a resolution can be found in the near future.<\/p><p>The Deputy should note that funding of any potential pension provision for CE supervisors will ultimately be a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the wider economic and budgetary context in which any such scheme will need to operate.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>Nevertheless I, and my colleague the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform are keen to find an approach that will resolve this issue in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400085#WRBB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Offices","counter":1519,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400085#WRBB01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1520,"qnumday":553,"qnumall":"[9379\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400085#WRBB02000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the facilities available in her Department to facilitate breastfeeding breaks in accordance with WHO guidelines of two years for women in the workplace and as part of the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1521,"content":"<p>My Department operates 13 main offices and 75 Intreo and public offices.

Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2021 is expected to exceed &euro;1.4 billion.   <\/p>  <p>  At the end of December 2020, there were 88,906 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The estimated expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2021 is approximately &euro;953 million. <\/p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn adequate income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities. This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most. <\/p>  <p>  In order to support a carer&rsquo;s continued attachment to the workforce and broader social inclusion, carers may engage in some limited employment, education or training, of up to 18.5 hours per week while still being regarded as being in a position to provide full-time care.  Just as in the case of other income support payments carer's allowance is not intended to be a compensatory payment for the full value of earnings foregone nor is it a payment by the State in recognition of caring services rendered. <\/p>  <p>  My Department carried out a comprehensive Policy Review of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2019 including an examination of the means test.  <\/p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  By comparison, the income disregard applied to Disability Allowance is &euro;120 per week (as per Budget 2021 this will increase to &euro;140 per week from June 2021).  For Jobseeker's Allowance, it is &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60, and the balance is assessed at 60%.  For Jobseeker's Transitional Payment, the weekly income disregard is &euro;165 with 50% of the balance assessed as means.<\/p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall expenditure and policy context and from an evidence-based perspective.  It should be noted that some 92% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard.  <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the key role that family carers play in our society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.  However, any improvements or additions to these supports can only be considered in an overall budgetary context and in the light of available financial resources. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400086#WRCC06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension","counter":1626,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400086#WRCC06200"},{"type":"question","counter":1627,"qnumday":590,"qnumall":"[10464\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400086#WRCC06300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if an application for an invalidity pension by a person (details supplied) will be expedited.","asker":"1496","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1628,"content":"<p>Invalidity pension (IP) is a payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and who satisfy the pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions. <\/p>  <p>  The Department received a claim for IP for the person concerned on 09 October 2020.

A policy document \"Combating Violence Against Women: Minimum Standards for Support Services\", published by the Council, references two standards: either one shelter space per 10,000 head of adult population, or one shelter space per 10,000 head of female population, with specific mechanisms for measuring population and calculation of shelter spaces. In line with reporting conventions previously used by the Department of Justice, Tusla has applied the latter standard, given that this reflects the community-focused integrated response for victims, where community-based organisations and outreach supports are in place alongside refuges. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla is undertaking a review of emergency accommodation nationwide. This will assess the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation. The review's findings and the recommendations of the Monitoring Committee of the Second National Strategy on DSGBV will inform Tusla's future decisions on priority areas for investment and development of services. Tusla has advised me that the report will be published in Quarter 2 this year.<\/p>  <p>  It is of the utmost importance that the needs of those who experience domestic violence are met in the most appropriate way possible. I strongly support the work of Tusla and its funded service providers and I am committed to supporting the Agency in meeting the needs of individuals who experience domestic violence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400087#WRDD05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":1683,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400087#WRDD05500"},{"type":"question","counter":1684,"qnumday":609,"qnumall":"[9713\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400087#WRDD05600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of adults and children in direct provision accommodation in County Donegal in each of the years 2017 to 2020 and to date in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1685,"content":"<p>There was no international protection accommodation centre in Donegal until 2019, when the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department first began to accommodate residents in Portsalon House. <\/p><p>The below table provides the number of adults and children accommodated in Co.

All children and young people need safeguarding and the Government recognises that specific groups of children and young people are particularly at risk and need additional supports. <\/p><p>Significant progress has been made under outcome 3, action 3.1, with the introduction of the Children First Act 2015. The Act, which was signed into law in November 2015 and fully commenced in December 2017, provides for a number of key child protection measures, including raising awareness of child abuse and neglect, improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children and the introduction of mandatory reporting of child protection concerns by certain key professionals. <\/p><p>The Act also places specific obligations on organisations providing relevant services to keep children safe from harm whilst availing of their services, to carry out a risk assessment and to develop a Child Safeguarding Statement that outlines the policies and procedures in place to manage the risks identified.  <\/p><p>The Act operates side-by-side with the non-statutory obligations provided for in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children. The guidance sets out definitions of abuse, and signs for its recognition. It explains how reports about reasonable concerns of child abuse or neglect should be made by the general public and professionals to Tusla. It sets out what organisations need to do to keep children safe. It also describes the obligations under the Children First Act 2015 and who they attach to. These guidelines have been in place since 1999 and were fully revised and published in October 2017 to include reference to the provisions of the Act. <\/p><p>Work under outcome 3, action 3.1 is continuing including through the Children First Inter-Departmental Implementation Group (IDIG). The Group, which was established on a statutory basis under the Children First Act, is chaired by my Department and includes members from every Government Department as well as representatives from Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive. The Group promotes compliance by Government Departments with their obligations under the Children First Act and is a forum where members can raise child welfare and protection issues of general concern or with a cross-sectoral dimension.  <\/p><p>There has been much progress in relation to learning from investigations and reviews on child protection.  In the context of these themes both my Department and Tusla has further progressed significant improvements in these areas as summarised below: <\/p><p>- Early intervention &amp;amp; family support &ndash; through the What Works and the Prevention, Partnership and Family Support Programme.<\/p><p>- Out-of-hours services &ndash; expanded from the Dublin region to the entire country with on call support through a dedicated phone line and with social workers located in each of the 17 Areas of the country. <\/p><p>- Interagency collaboration - through full scaling and implementation of Children and Young People's Services Committees; and Tusla establishment of National Interagency protocols with the HSE and has a Joint Working Protocol with AGS under Children First. <\/p><p>- Child and youth participation &ndash; Tusla has developed and is in ongoing implementation of a Child and Youth Participation Strategy 2019-23.<\/p><p>- Child protection conferences &ndash; Tusla has a national children&rsquo;s register for children at ongoing risk of significant harm called the Child Protection Notification System and this system is accessible by other key professionals who play a role in safeguarding and protecting children. <\/p><p>- Recording and Data Management&ndash; Tusla has established one integrated National Child Care Information System and has a comprehensive Data Management Strategy.<\/p><p>- The HIQA Statutory Investigation 2018 and its report and recommendation saw the establishment of an Expert Assurance Group to oversee Tusla&rsquo;s progress against all actions arising from this investigation report. <\/p><p>- In 2017 Signs of Safety was adopted as the national approach to practice, to assist in the delivery of consistent responses to child protection concerns nationally. There was a three year implementation strategy to train all Tusla staff in the Signs of Safety approach, to upgrade all IT systems to align with the Signs of Safety format and to realign all internal policies with the new approach. The child protection and welfare strategy, called Creating Effective Safety runs from 2017-2022. <\/p><p>- Child sexual abuse - Development of the Barnahus model which is an Icelandic and EU model for child friendly centres for abuse victims. Integrating forensic medical, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla specialist interviewing with therapeutic support in one centre to reduce trauma for the child. Tusla is a partner in the Barnahus network.  <\/p><p>My Department works closely with Tusla to ensure that the learning from the range of review and regulatory mechanisms in place relating to child protection and welfare serves to directly inform policy development and organisational performance. Tusla as an organisation has proactively placed a priority focus on this area in its self-assessment mechanisms and its performance conferencing processes. <\/p><p>Next month, my Department is planning to bring together the range of regulatory and review bodies to share the learning relating to the protection, welfare and wellbeing of children. This will support a more strategic approach to ensuring the transfer and implementation of learning to address issues that impact on the safety, welfare and protection of children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400088#WREE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Leave","counter":1699,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400088#WREE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1700,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[9971\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400088#WREE00600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he will bring forward primary legislation to amend the Maternity Protection Acts 1994 to 2004 in order that women who had already started or completed their maternity period would be entitled to take a further 13 weeks leave; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1701,"content":"<p>The Maternity Protection Acts provide for up to 26 weeks paid maternity leave, and a further 16 weeks unpaid leave.

The specifications for this tender included the provision of food and household items through a points system by way of an on-site foodhall whereby residents can obtain the items they need at no cost to themselves. Under the terms of the contract the service provider is also required to consult regularly with residents to help ensure the produce available in the in-house store is both ethnically and culturally appropriate to their needs.   <\/p>  <p>  This model was used in all eight of the regional tender competitions for the provision of such accommodation, of which the Borders Region was the last chronologically to take place. The provision of an onsite foodhall was crucial to the bid from all successful tenderers and would have been factored into their costs.  Tenders were evaluated on the Most Economically Advantageous Tender model, whereby bids are assessed on a combination of the quality of the proposal of service delivery and price. Quality of the proposal of service delivery was 60% of overall marks while price was 40%.<\/p>  <p>  It would undermine the integrity of the procurement process if bidders were asked (either individually or collectively) to change the service delivery model from that contained in the specifications following assessment and contract award.  <\/p>  <p>  Port Road, Letterkenny will be the 30th accommodation centre to come through the tendering process. All of the accommodation centres that have been procured through this process provide residents with items through the points based foodhall system. The foods available to residents generally include a wide range of fresh meats, fruit, vegetables and ethnic goods. Residents can carry over points not used in any one week to the next week, subject to a maximum of four weeks. The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department understand that the foodhall system works very well and residents are generally satisfied with the system.

Under the scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.<\/p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.<\/p>  <p>  The application process generally opens in late March\/early April. When students apply for grant support, the application is assessed and the student is notified of the decision in principle. This allows the student an opportunity to appeal a decision before a final decision is made. In a small number of cases, some students don&rsquo;t subsequently qualify for grant support.

Some of those representations have student mental health as the primary topic, while many others express concerns regarding the subject together with other matters. My Department would require to undertake further analysis to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s query therefore or perhaps the Deputy could provide some more specific information as to the correspondence he is referencing.<\/p>  <p>  The support and wellbeing of our students is one of my priorities, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the increased stress and pressure resulting from it.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, I secured a comprehensive package of financial support in the amount of &euro;168m for the Higher Education and Further Education and Training sector to mitigate against the direct financial impact of COVID-19 on our Universities, institutions, colleges and students in 2020. This package includes additional funding of &euro;3m to underpin wellbeing and mental health and student services in our higher education institutions (HEIs), and is in addition to the &euro;2m that was allocated in Budget 2020. This funding is enabling institutions to enhance their student facing services, such as by employing additional student Counsellors and Assistant Psychologists.<\/p>  <p>  The HEA wrote to all HEIs in 2020 setting each institutions funding allocation towards student support and mental health and wellbeing and the conditions attaching to the funding, including a request that the HEIs distribute it in support of specific student facing areas such as the recruitment of additional Student Counsellors, and implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework, which I launched last year.<\/p>  <p>  This Framework is Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national approach to address student mental health and suicide prevention. The Framework delivers on a commitment to develop national guidelines for the higher education institutions (HEIs) in relation to suicide risk and critical incident response, thereby helping to address any gaps which might exist in the prevention of suicide in higher education. The Framework additionally recognises the many challenges students face, and sets out ways in which institutions can support and respond through working proactively to maximise mental health and wellbeing.<\/p>  <p>  The Framework provides very clear guidance to higher education institutions regarding implementation of good practices in responding to student mental health difficulties. The HEA has partnered with the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention and Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education Ireland (PCHEI) in providing training in a specialist suicide assessment and management approach. Over 300 psychologists and counsellors across 26 higher education institutions are currently undertaking Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality training, a first in world at this scale across a sector.  The CAMS approach is supported by over 70 studies and given the origins of its development was a university mental health setting, it fits well in a higher education context.  This is further support for student counselling services to meet the complex and challenging needs that present on campuses at an increasing rate in the past number of years.  This also addresses Goal 5 in the Department of Health&rsquo;s Connecting for Life &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020: \"To ensure safe and high-quality services for people vulnerable to suicide.\"  Together with the crisis text line 50808 that I launched in October 2020, I'm confident that capacity to respond to students experiencing high distress and mental health difficulties has been significantly improved over the past 6 months. <\/p>  <p>  Funding has also helped develop the student counselling services across the Higher Education sector in many ways besides student counsellor resourcing. For example, some institutions have developed new roles of Assistant Psychologist, Student Support Officer and Mental Health Advisors for student mental health supports. Heads of Services have been appointed or further resourced.<\/p>  <p>  I am very encouraged that the Framework and the additional funding has had immediate impact. The increased capacity has created a lot of activity in outreach to students: online support groups (anxiety support, mood management); open, drop in groups to support connection\/reduce isolation and loneliness; groups specifically targeting international students, first year students and postgraduates. The additional funding has also supported a very significant increase in workshops being offered such as on resilience; managing fear\/anxiety\/uncertainty; grief and loss during the pandemic; motivation\/staying engaged with college.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400090#WRGG04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Costs","counter":1852,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400090#WRGG04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1853,"qnumday":674,"qnumall":"[9933\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400090#WRGG04700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the parents of a person (details supplied) can be reimbursed in view of their circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1854,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the challenges faced by students regarding student accommodation this year due to both financial pressures, and the blended learning format of the 2020\/21 academic year. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the university sector has been actively engaging with students on the issue of accommodation refunds. As a result of the decision to minimise on-site teaching, all universities have confirmed that students who opted to leave their university-owned student accommodation as a result of reduced on-campus activity will be offered refunds or rental credits. The processing of these refunds is a matter for the universities themselves, and any student who wishes to receive a refund for their on-campus accommodation should engage directly with their university&rsquo;s accommodation office. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of privately-owned student accommodation, I am urging providers to be flexible in finding solutions given the circumstances that students find themselves.  There are, however, no powers available to me under the current legal framework to direct any particular course of action.  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year.  In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached. If this is not possible, students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board. <\/p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students.

This initiative which enabled a bulk purchase of approximately 16,500 laptops on behalf of higher education institutions is intended to help address concerns regarding the digital divide in the context of the shift to online and blended models of learning, and the importance of supporting disadvantaged students to adapt to these new models of learning.<\/p>  <p>  The delivery through the National Broadband Plan of high-speed internet connectively nationwide will ultimately provide a solution to current differences in broadband experience for students and learners. In the interim there are initiatives across a number of Government Departments to facilitate connection through community-based broadband hubs and liaison with telecommunication providers on packages, including unlimited data. It is also worth noting that, at the present time HEAnet provides a WiFi solution - Eduroam - designed by and for the higher education community which operates across the education locations nationally.

It is not possible at this stage to indicate when the Bill is likely to be published or to predict the timeframe for the legislative process with regard to the Bill after its publication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400093#WRKK03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2022,"content":"<p>Question No. 734 answered with Question No. 712.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":2023,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400093#WRKK03400"},{"type":"question","counter":2024,"qnumday":735,"qnumall":"[10115\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400093#WRKK03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date in the determination of an application for naturalisation in the case of a person (details supplied); if further information is required in this case; when the application is likely to be brought to a conclusion; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":2025,"content":"<p>An application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy on 12 February 2018.

The maximum prison sentence for carrying a knife is five years, which is high in comparison to other common law jurisdictions, with higher potential sentences for knife-enabled crime such as theft or assault. International research points to increased sentencing not being an effective strategy for reducing knife crime. <\/p>  <p>  Instead, international best practice points to targeted interventions and community engagement as being the best approach to tackle knife-crime and other criminal activity that is particularly prevalent among young people. <\/p>  <p>  The Department will therefore also focus on analysing existing data, as well as developing new sources of data, and looking at international best practice to inform policy in this area. Officials are working to see how we can adapt elements of the Scottish and London approaches to tackling knife crime to Ireland. This work will see them engage with hospitals and education services to build a greater understanding of the problem of violent crime in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Much good work has already been done by my Department and by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, operating in conjunction with local communities and other state agencies.  My Department is also helping to coordinate the roll-out of the pilot Local Community Safety Partnerships.  These partnerships are the structures proposed under the Department&rsquo;s new Community Safety Policy to take a holistic approach to safety issues in partnership with the community involved. The pilots will operate at local authority administrative level and will be made up of local representatives, a range of local services, community representatives and residents.  They will be aimed at tackling a range of problems, including knife-crime at a local and community level. <\/p>  <p>  The forthcoming Youth Justice Strategy will also strengthen and enhance our supports and interventions for young people who are at risk of involvement in crime and anti-social behaviour.  In addressing youth offending, our goal is to support young people to stop offending and to foster socially beneficial changes to their behaviour, most especially with regard to knife-crime.  I am very conscious of the need to help rehabilitate young people who commit knife-crime, as is the Government.  My Department's review of the legislation in the area of knife-crime will be governed to a certain extent by this overall objective. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400093#WRKK05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Justice Strategy","counter":2045,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400093#WRKK05700"},{"type":"question","counter":2046,"qnumday":743,"qnumall":"[10306\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400093#WRKK05800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the new youth justice strategy will be implemented; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":2047,"content":"<p>Minister McEntee and I will shortly be bringing to Government and publishing a new Youth Justice Strategy to cover the period from now until 2026.

This will include a review of the 12-month deferral currently in place for men that have sex with men. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400094#WRLL03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":2087,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400094#WRLL03900"},{"type":"question","counter":2088,"qnumday":758,"qnumall":"[9389\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400094#WRLL04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if Ireland has a policy for emergency preparedness for infant feeding protection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2089,"content":"<p>My Department does not have a policy for emergency preparedness for infant feeding protection.  <\/p><p>However we have agreed with our colleagues in the Department of Health in Northern Ireland that the facilities of the Human Milk Bank in Co Fermanagh will continue to operate as usual and mothers in the Republic of Ireland can continue to provide breastmilk and avail of breastmilk supplies as before Brexit. <\/p><p>A new Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes in public health services is in final draft and is due for implementation, across all health services in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400094#WRLL04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":2090,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400094#WRLL04200"},{"type":"question","counter":2091,"qnumday":759,"qnumall":"[9390\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400094#WRLL04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the new children&rsquo;s hospital will have lactation facilities for HSE employees and a lactation department; if so, if this will include mothers attending with their children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2092,"content":"<p>Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) has advised that nursing mothers will have access to lactation rooms in the Emergency Department, Outpatient and Radiology Departments and throughout the public realm concourse of the new children&rsquo;s hospital.

In section 12 of the Bill a specific obligation is placed on health services providers (with an identical one placed on health practitioners) to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the patient and their family in the course of making an open disclosure of a notifiable incident. <\/p>  <p>  The provisions of the Bill will apply to all health services providers and health practitioners. Section 3 of the Bill explains in detail which organisations and individuals fall within the scope of the definition of health services provider.  In essence, a health services provider is intended to include public and private organisations and entities involved in providing health services, such as hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, primary care centres etc.  For the purposes of this legislation a health practitioner is defined as including registered healthcare professionals such as medical doctors, nurses, midwives, dentists, pharmacists, health and social care professionals and ambulance personnel.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 49 of the Bill sets out that a health services provider who fails to comply with the obligations to make an open disclosure of a notifiable patient safety incident (section 5(1), 19(9), 20(5)) to a patient and \/or their relevant person, without reasonable excuse, shall be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine.  It is open to an individual to take a case against a health services provider who they believe has failed to comply with the obligation to ensure that open disclosure took place as required by the legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  If a health practitioner does not engage in open disclosure as they are required to do under this legislation, then this would be a matter for the relevant health professional regulatory body ( such as the Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Board, the Dental Council and other regulatory bodies). <\/p>  <p>  The Bill is part of the current Programme for Government and due to go to D&aacute;il Committee Stage at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400097#WROO03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2286,"content":"<p>Question No. 821 answered with Question No. 771.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2287,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400097#WROO03600"},{"type":"question","counter":2288,"qnumday":822,"qnumall":"[9642\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400097#WROO03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of mop-up clinics that have been set up to date, by county; the number of mop-up clinics that are still waiting to be set up, by county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2289,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400097#WROO03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2290,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400097#WROO03900"},{"type":"question","counter":2291,"qnumday":823,"qnumall":"[9644\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400097#WROO04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if Irish citizens are permitted to travel to the UK for family reunification purposes; if partners are considered family; if family reunification is considered essential travel; if An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na accept that this is essential travel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2292,"content":"<p>The current Regulations in effect providing for public health restrictions are the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 10) Regulations 2020 (S.I.

However, in order to do so one must make a series of assumptions about the number of close contacts that occur in a setting, the number of close contacts that occur in the population as a whole, the relative risk that such close contacts lead to infection, and the effect of mitigating measures such as the use of PPE. Small changes in these assumptions lead to very different outcomes in terms of impact upon R. IEMAG is of the view that it is not feasible to provide reliable estimates of the impact on R of very specific interventions.<\/p><p>Technical notes on the approaches used to estimate effective reproduction number (Re) or time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) are published on the Department of Health website (). The approaches used are in line with best practice and associated references are available in the above mentioned published technical notes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400098#WRPP00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Funding","counter":2327,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400098#WRPP00500"},{"type":"question","counter":2328,"qnumday":834,"qnumall":"[9720\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400098#WRPP00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the funding and or grants for building, plant or equipment provided to Mayo University Hospital since 2015, in tabular form.","asker":"1610","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2329,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare infrastructure projects and management of healthcare equipment, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400098#WRPP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2330,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400098#WRPP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2331,"qnumday":835,"qnumall":"[9721\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400098#WRPP00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons awaiting plastic surgery in Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown.","asker":"1610","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2332,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last year as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is currently recommending that only critical time dependent elective procedures are undertaken at this time due to the on-going and significant increased demand for capacity related to Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. <\/p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling.

Vaccination of this group started in the week beginning the 15th of February.<\/p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.<\/p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400099#WRQQ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabilities Assessments","counter":2418,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400099#WRQQ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":2419,"qnumday":866,"qnumall":"[9831\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400099#WRQQ03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the options available for assessment of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2420,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future,\u00a0recognises the need to improve services for both children and adults with disabilities through better implementation and by working together across Government in a better way.<\/p><p>The Government commits to prioritising early diagnosis and access to services for children and ensuring that the most effective interventions are provided for each child, to guarantee the best outcomes<\/p><p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400099#WRQQ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"question","counter":2422,"qnumday":867,"qnumall":"[9832\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400099#WRQQ03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children under 18 years of age waiting for a first assessment for speech and language therapy up to 24 February or the latest date available by local health office, LHO; the number waiting less than four months, between four and 12 months, and more than 12 months, respectively, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Furthermore, their intended use is typically in symptomatic individuals in the early stages of infection, where samples are taken, and tests conducted by trained health professionals. There is limited performance data currently available for the use of antigen tests in asymptomatic populations. The studies also show that performance in symptomatic individuals is much better than in asymptomatic individuals where data are available.<\/p>  <p>  While rapid Antigen Detection Tests (ADTs) are described as rapid and simple to perform, they are not designed to be delivered in large numbers and there are considerable human resource, operational, quality assurance, and clinical governance considerations in their administration. To date, validation work indicates that ADTs are most effective in detection of symptomatic cases, when symptom onset is within the last 5 days and when the likelihood of test positivity is greater than 10% among the target population. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is currently putting in place deployment options for the use of ADTs for specific indications in the acute hospital setting and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting in symptomatic vulnerable populations and their close contacts, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from ADTs undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable work has been undertaken to date to evaluate the use of ADTS in an Irish context and this will continue on an ongoing basis due to the role they can have in the national testing strategy. In particular, further setting-specific ADT validation work continues to be undertaken by the HSE. Antigen testing will not, however, replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing.<\/p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s national testing policy under continuing review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400100#WRRR04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2488,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400100#WRRR04300"},{"type":"question","counter":2489,"qnumday":893,"qnumall":"[9886\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400100#WRRR04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the plans being considered for the reopening of the gay men&rsquo;s health service which has been closed since March 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2490,"content":"<p>The Gay Men's Health Service is a community STI service and is managed through HSE Community Healthcare East (CHO6).<\/p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented interruption to normal healthcare activity, with all services affected.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys. On foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine. <\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine,\u00a0must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400102#WRTT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2602,"content":"<p>Question No. 935 answered with Question No. 755.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Data","counter":2603,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400102#WRTT04200"},{"type":"question","counter":2604,"qnumday":936,"qnumall":"[10056\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400102#WRTT04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of funded consultant posts by discipline and speciality for each hospital by hospital group; the number of posts funded, filled and vacant; the basis on which they are filled, that is, permanent, temporary, agency and locum by whole-time equivalent in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2605,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400102#WRTT04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2607,"qnumday":937,"qnumall":"[10057\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400102#WRTT04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of funded registrar posts by discipline and speciality for each hospital by hospital group; the number of posts funded, filled and vacant; the basis on which they are filled, that is, permanent, temporary, agency and locum by whole-time equivalent in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2608,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400102#WRTT04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2610,"qnumday":938,"qnumall":"[10058\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400102#WRTT04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of funded senior house officer, SHO, interns posts by discipline and speciality for each hospital by hospital group; the number of posts funded, filled and vacant; the basis on which they are filled, that is, permanent, temporary, agency and locum by whole-time equivalent in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The first is a supernumerary placement for 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students in their first semester with a healthcare provider, where students are not counted within the funded staffing allocation. Fundamentally, nursing and midwifery students, while on supernumerary clinical placements (which refers to the students being surplus to the rostered complement of nurses or midwives while on placement) are being educated. In line with Directive 2013\/55\/EU, this education is carried out on the frontline, as part of a team, across the wide variety of care settings and under supervision. That supervision is provided by qualified, experienced nurses and midwives called preceptors. Those student nurses and midwives can claim vouched travel and accommodation allowances to support them while undergoing such placements in line with HSE Circular 09\/2004.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support the continued protection of the nurse\/midwife programme of which supernumerary placements are a key component. Changing the supernumerary status of those placements to that of an employee would remove those educational protections that enable such students to learn, unencumbered by an employment contract.<\/p>  <p>  The second category of placement is a 36-week internship for final-year student nurses and midwives, for which they are considered a 0.5 Whole-Time Equivalent member of the workforce and for which they are already paid a salary. Following a 2% pay increase on 1 October 2020, the annualised salary for this group is now &euro;21,749 (or &euro;10.72 per hour) for general nursing and midwifery students and &euro;22,229 (&euro;10.96 per hour) for psychiatric nursing students. I also fully support the continuation of the paid work internship programme in fourth year that is in place for student nurses and midwives.<\/p>  <p>  I know that the pandemic has presented challenges to student nurses and midwives to continue with such placements. In recognising this and to further assist student nurses and midwives while on clinical placement, I appointed Professor Tom Collins to carry out an independent review of clinical placement allowances and I received his report on 31 December 2020. The key recommendation in his Report is to implement a &lsquo;Pandemic Placement Grant&rsquo; of &euro;100 for each supernumerary placement week during the pandemic. I have accepted the recommendations and am very keen to progress this additional support.<\/p>  <p>  A second, longer-term review is due to examine the accommodation and travel allowances payable to student nurses and midwives on supernumerary clinical placement, and pay for 4th-year nurses and midwives on paid internship placement. Preparatory work has commenced on this review. My Department are currently engaging with the stakeholders, including the trade unions, on finalising the terms of reference for this review and I look forward to that review progressing with its work in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400105#WRWW05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2809,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400105#WRWW05100"},{"type":"question","counter":2810,"qnumday":1006,"qnumall":"[10337\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400105#WRWW05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if older persons in assisted living arrangements will be prioritised for Covid-19 vaccination; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2811,"content":"<p>The COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy sets out a provisional list of groups for vaccination.

The output of this HTA will be an important input into the decision-making processes of the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The application for Sativex remains under consideration with the HSE and is being assessed in line with the 2013 Health Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400106#WRXX01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":2837,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400106#WRXX01800"},{"type":"question","counter":2838,"qnumday":1016,"qnumall":"[10412\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400106#WRXX01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address the situation in which a person (details supplied) in need of a psychology appointment was advised there is currently a 75-week waiting time for primary care clinical psychology appointments; the steps he will take to address the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2839,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400106#WRXX02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2840,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400106#WRXX02100"},{"type":"question","counter":2841,"qnumday":1017,"qnumall":"[10416\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400106#WRXX02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when nurses attached to an organisation (details supplied) will be vaccinated; and the reason for the delay.","asker":"1496","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2842,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400106#WRXX02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2844,"qnumday":1018,"qnumall":"[10417\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400106#WRXX02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cohort of persons who will be using the Covid-19 vaccination centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2845,"content":"<p>On 15 February, I announced 37 HSE Vaccination Centres, with at least one for every county.

The Scheme closed in November with 181 aquaculture enterprises applying.

The shellfish sector particularly bore the brunt of the impact with the value of exports down by 29% to &euro;126m.

The primary surveillance system is through tissue tagging of calves. In 2020, 725 animals were disclosed as persistently infected BVD animals. All 725 animals have been disposed of. <\/p><p>Of the 725 animals disclosed as PI in 2020, 616 (85 %) were disposed of within 28 days of the initial positive test.

The direct financial supports available in 2021 for BEEF HERDS: &euro;220 for beef breed animals removed with a registered date of death on AIM within 10 days of the initial test, reducing to &euro;30 if removed between 11 and 21 days after the initial test and for DAIRY HERDS: Dairy heifers and dairy cross animals: &euro;160 if removed within 10 days of the initial test, reducing to &euro;30 if removed between 11 and 21 days after the initial test.  In addition, my Department will fund any required testing and vaccination of animals in any farm restricted <\/p><p>Very significant progress has been made in recent years but I am keen to see BVD eradicated as a matter of urgency. The focus on the programme in 2021 and 2022 is to achieve the status of BVD free as set out the new European Animal Health Law by end of 2022. Compulsory BVD testing may then cease, however it is key that sufficient surveillance must be conducted to ensure we meet the criteria set out to prove continued BVD free status.  <\/p><p>Details of the 2021 programme were agreed by the BVD Implementation Group (comprising relevant stakeholders) and publicised as in previous years.  My Department issued a press release on the future pathway of the BVD programme in December 2020.  Information was released through all channels including through AHI, DAFM, Veterinary Ireland, and through the farming organisations.  A full page advertisement was taken out by AHI in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal<\/i>, and Programme Key messages were distributed to all the farming press by AHI.

Loans from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000 may be used for working capital and required business changes as a result of COVID-19 with loan terms up to three years. Terms include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium.<\/p>  <p>  I engage regularly  with the main banks on the specific liquidity and financing needs of farmers, fishers and agrifood businesses and have stressed the need for the banks to support and work with their customers through this challenging period.  All the banks responded to the economic disruption arising from the pandemic with announcements of flexibility for their customers.  The advice is that farmers should engage with their bank at an early stage to discuss emerging cashflow issues. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400109#WRAAA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":3000,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400109#WRAAA00500"},{"type":"question","counter":3001,"qnumday":1077,"qnumall":"[9937\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400109#WRAAA00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of the voisinage agreement as it relates to reciprocal access to the 0 to 6 nautical miles around the island of Ireland following the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement; and the specific text in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement that addresses this matter.","asker":"1463","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":3002,"content":"<p>The Voisinage (or &ldquo;neighbourhood&rdquo;) arrangements between Ireland and Northern Ireland have provided reciprocal fishing access for more than 50 years.

At this meeting, officials were given an update of the state of play of the negotiations with the UK, a presentation was given on the updated JRC study on EU catches in UK waters, there was discussion on the Commission proposals on fishing opportunities and discussions on preparations for a no-deal were resumed. <\/p><p>On 6th October 2020, I, along with my Ministerial colleagues in the Group of 8, met with Mr Barnier, Fisheries Commissioner and DG Mare, where we were given an update on the state of play in the EU-UK fisheries negotiations. I set out Ireland&rsquo;s position at this meeting, making it clear that Ireland was seeking that  the Task Force  stick to the mandate to maintain the status quo and use the leverage of other negotiations to support this objective.<\/p><p>On 27th November 2020, I, along with my Ministerial colleagues in the Group of 8, met with Mr Barnier, Fisheries Commissioner and DG Mare, where we were given an update on the state of play in the EU-UK fisheries negotiations. At this meeting, I urged Mr Barnier to stay firm on the link between the overall economic partnership and the conclusion of a fishing agreement and not to agree to any short-term arrangement on fisheries which would serve to break this link. I stressed that Ireland&rsquo;s fishing industry needs a strong and stable EU\/UK Fisheries agreement, and is in a particularly vulnerable position sharing our main fish stocks and our waters on three sides with the UK. I also emphasised that any outcome in the future relationship negotiations that results in a loss of quota share for the EU would be damaging to Ireland&rsquo;s fishing industry. <\/p><p>On the 20th January 2021, I, along with my Ministerial colleagues in the Group of 8, met with Mr Barnier, Fisheries Commissioner and DG Mare, on fisheries related matters post-Brexit. At this meeting, I made it clear that Ireland considers that the transfer to the UK involves a very high share of some of our most important stocks, including mackerel and prawns. I pointed out that within the Common Fisheries Policy, Ireland contributes by providing rich fishing grounds for EU Member States, and that our Exclusive Economic Zone provides spawning and nursery grounds for many of the core stocks shared with the UK and on which the Trade and Cooperation Agreement quota package and the Common Fisheries Policy depend. I also strongly expressed disappointment that the principle of burden sharing within the EU Member States has not been adequately respected. I made clear that the inequitable relative contribution of quota share by Ireland is contributing to a strong sense of grievance within our fishing industry and indeed more broadly. Mr Barnier and the Commissioner noted Ireland&rsquo;s concern pointing out that the case made was understood. Mr Barnier advised that the UK priority was increased shares of pelagic stocks and in particular mackerel and Ireland is the largest EU share holder of this stock. <\/p><p>I will continue to keep the focus on this situation and use any opportunity available, to seek constructive solutions that would help to alleviate this unacceptable position.<\/p><p>The share allocation of stocks between Member States was established as a principle of the first Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in 1983 and was based on the average catch of each Member State over a period of reference years (track record).  The only exception to this relates to the Hague Preferences, on the basis of a special recognition agreement of the underdeveloped nature of the Irish fleet and the heavy control responsibility on us when Ireland joined the EU. The Hague Preferences give Ireland an increased share of traditional stocks (cod, whiting, haddock, sole and plaice) when TAC levels fall below a specified level.<\/p><p>Any change to the existing system of quota allocations would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system. This would require other Member States to give up existing quota shares. Any change to relative stability would involve a loss for some other Member States and therefore poses particular challenges in a qualified majority voting context.<\/p><p>The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by 31 December 2022 when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP. The review is expected to be detailed and comprehensive.  At EU level, it is expected that all stakeholders will have an opportunity to engage actively in the review work including the fishing industry, eNGOs and Member States. <\/p><p>I will consider how Ireland will prepare for and participate actively and effectively in the upcoming review of the CFP, including the interaction with stakeholders, to prepare Ireland's case and identify priorities.  I have previously stated that I am committed to using all opportunities including through the review of the CFP to secure additional quota shares where possible for Irish fishers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400109#WRAAA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Young Farmers Scheme","counter":3010,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400109#WRAAA01600"},{"type":"question","counter":3011,"qnumday":1081,"qnumall":"[10032\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400109#WRAAA01700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a young farmer payment will issue to a person (details supplied) for the years 2019 and 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":3012,"content":"<p>The closing date for receipt of applications under the 2019 Young Farmers Scheme was 15<sup>th<\/sup>May 2019.

This migration brings some of the fish into the Irish 200 miles zone for part of the year. At the time we see fish in the Irish zone, there are also fish being caught in the international high seas and over a wide area from Spain to Norway. There is no survey from which the abundance in Ireland's 200 miles zone may be determined.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland does not have a national quota for Bluefin Tuna. The available Bluefin Tuna quota is allocated each year to Member States on the basis of relative stability as established in the late 1990s. At that time, Ireland did not have a track record of commercial fishing for Bluefin Tuna and, accordingly, did not receive a quota allocation.<\/p>  <p>  A small Bluefin Tuna by-catch quota is available to Ireland, primarily for use in our important Northern Albacore Tuna fishery and Celtic Sea Herring fishery where there can be Bluefin Tuna by-catch. In this regard, the UK also had a share of the Bluefin Tuna by-catch quota and, under the EU\/UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, a share of the EU&rsquo;s Bluefin Tuna quota (0.25%) has been transferred to UK. We are seeking that this transfer to the UK is taken from the overall EU quota and is not taken from the by-catch quota available to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, Ireland was successful, for the first time, in securing agreement that allowed countries without a commercial quota to set up a catch-tag-release fishery to contribute to the collection of scientific data. A Catch-Tag-Release science-based fishery for authorised recreational angling vessels has been in place in Ireland since 2019 and supports the collection of valuable data on the migratory patterns of Bluefin Tuna in Irish waters.<\/p>  <p>  The EU percentage share of the international TAC is set down and there is no likelihood that an international country will concede any share to the EU. The only way to obtain a share of the EU quota now would involve changing relative stability within the EU and would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system. This means that EU Member States, with a national quota, would have to give up a share of their allocation to Ireland. Any change to relative stability would involve a loss for some other Member States and therefore poses  particular challenges in a qualified majority voting context.<\/p>  <p>  The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by 31 December 2022 when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP.

Agro-forestry provides financial support to grow trees on land being used for farming. Forestry-for-fibre allows landowners to plant fast growing trees suitable for a range of purposes, including wood panel and fuel production. The Department will shortly be preparing the next Forestry Programme, which will be open for public consultation at the appropriate time.<\/p>  <p>  The new CAP programme proposes a higher level of environmental ambition &ndash; and will dedicate a significant sum of direct payments to eco-schemes promoting farming practices which are beneficial to the environment and go beyond standard conditionality. These will be complementary to the programme of supports under the rural development programme for the new CAP. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has already held consultations on the new CAP, is currently inviting submissions on the draft scoping report for the Environmental Assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan 2023-2027 and will hold more public consultations later this year.

The question of the administrative structures for the delivery of the programme will be considered as part of that work, having regard, inter alia, to the provisions of the EU Regulations governing the structure of future Local Action Groups, a review of the 2014-2020 programme, and the outcome of consultations with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400111#WRCCC04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tidy Towns Committees","counter":3165,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400111#WRCCC04900"},{"type":"question","counter":3166,"qnumday":1137,"qnumall":"[10270\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022400111#WRCCC05000","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the supports, funding and grants available to registered tidy towns groups; if she is considering increasing these supports; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":3167,"content":"<p>The SuperValu TidyTowns competition has been in existence since 1958 and continues to grow in popularity, with a record 924 entries in 2019.<\/p><p>The TidyTowns Committees operate on a voluntary basis and the continued success of the competition is testament to the time and effort which volunteers, young and old, put in to the competition right across the country.<\/p><p>In recognition of the contribution which the TidyTown Committees make to their local communities, grant funding of &euro;1.4 million was made available by my Department to TidyTowns Committees in each of the years 2017, 2018 and 2019.<\/p><p>This funding has allowed the Committees to better prepare for the annual competition through the purchase or upgrade of small equipment and other materials.<\/p><p>While the 2020 competition did not proceed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I have given a commitment that the competition will go ahead in 2021, under an adapted format, if necessary, to comply with public health guidelines.<\/p><p>With this in mind, last December, I announced funding of &euro;1 million to help TidyTowns groups to prepare for the 2021 competition.
