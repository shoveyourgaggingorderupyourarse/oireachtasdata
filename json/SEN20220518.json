I welcome the Minister of State and thank her for coming to the House.<\/p> <p>A year, a week and a day ago, the Minister for Health announced that there would be 24 new lactation consultants appointed in 2022.  My simple question to the Minister of State is: where are they?<\/p> <p>I must credit the wonderful campaigning group, Bainne Beatha, for alerting us to the date last week.  When the announcement by the Minister was made last year, we very much welcomed it, but from talking to campaigners on the ground, there is a real question mark now as to where exactly are those posts.  Have people been appointed?<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State will be aware, the scale of the challenge is enormous if we want to improve breastfeeding rates in this country.  It is about improving the interventions; it is about improving the peer-to-peer experience and it is about improving the culture, both within hospitals and within the community.<\/p> <p>It is really important to acknowledge that it is every individual family's right to decide how best they want to feed their own baby, but it is those women and families who want help and who have been seeking help but have been so badly let down by the public system that we really need to help.<\/p> <p>According to the Irish Maternity Indicator System National Report 2020, breastfeeding was initiated after birth for 62.3% of babies born in 2020.  That is a decent number.  That falls to 58.5% either exclusively breastfeeding or combination feeding upon discharge of hospital.  Within six months, that falls to approximately 15% of babies.<\/p> <p>There is a real failure, both in hospitals that we would see any drop in breastfeeding rates between when a baby is born and upon discharge, and then, of course, when women are back within their own communities.<\/p> <p>I suppose the failures are that we have considerably inconsistencies in hospitals with regard to culture, practice and availability.  I was talking to a woman the other day who was telling me of how she struggled trying to feed and, unknown to her and without her permission, her baby was given a bottle of formula when she happened to be asleep.  This was only two years ago in a national maternity hospital; that is disgraceful.  The hospital has yet to acknowledge that such an incident happened and yet two beds over, a woman had a completely different experience and does not recognise that other lady's terrible experience at all.  We have situations where the master of a maternity hospital and the ward sister are walking around telling mothers to put away the bottles that are on their shelves and hiding that babies are being fed formula.<\/p> <p>Of course, there are issues with the availability, particularly at weekends, of lactation consultants.  We know from the Bainne Beatha survey last year of women repeatedly making requests for a lactation consultant within the hospital, yet those requests went unheard.  We accept we have had Covid and all that, but this is not a new phenomenon.  This has been going on for many years.<\/p> <p>Within the community, I am still hearing varying experience with regards to the service and advice, in particular, that public health nurses are providing.  I am told within CHO 9, within Dublin north city and county, that all 22 public health nurses have received breastfeeding training, yet I know on the ground that there are some public health nurses actively advising mothers to give up breastfeeding and that there is an easier way.<\/p> <p>Do we have these new posts on the ground and what is being done about training those who are in really important roles with vulnerable mothers at an important time in their lives?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->How does the Government propose to improve the situation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#A00500","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I am delighted to be here, as a woman, to discuss this.  The Senator focused on one line which she said was important.  It is up to each family to make the decision and the Senator is clear on that.  We agree that it is important the family make the best decision for the mother and baby.<\/p> <p>I am answering this on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  The promotion, support and protection of breastfeeding is a priority for children's health in Ireland.  Breastfeeding in a Healthy Ireland: Health Service Breastfeeding Action Plan 2016-2021 is the framework for progressing supports for breastfeeding.  The HSE is partnering with key divisions to provide the supports that mothers require at all stages of the breastfeeding continuum.  The Deputy is right that if that decision is taken, it has to be understood that the supports are there.  Some people find it difficult and some find it easy.  We all know of cases where people give up in frustration even though they want to continue to breastfeed.<\/p> <p>Due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the delivery of some actions, the HSE will extend the implementation of the breastfeeding action plan into 2023 and continue to work on the priority outstanding actions.  Ireland has a culture of bottle feeding and, in order to improve child and maternal health and reduce childhood obesity, we need to improve our breastfeeding rates.<\/p> <p>While breastfeeding is the most natural way to feed the baby, it is a skill that mother and baby develop over the first days and weeks.  With the right help, support and information, most mothers can start breastfeeding and continue for as long as they want to.<\/p> <p>A combination of interventions at public health, public policy, clinical and community levels are the most effective way to support mothers to breastfeed for as long as they wish.  Evidence-based interventions at clinical level include changes to policy and practice within hospital and community settings in line with best evidence on practices that support optimum infant feeding in maternity, paediatric, and community services.  Integrating routine lactation consultant support improves the experience of care that mothers receive, along with breastfeeding initiation and duration rates.  Midwives and public health nurses are trained in supporting breastfeeding, commencing in the antenatal period with the delivery of antenatal breastfeeding education.  Midwives support antenatal education and help mothers to establish breastfeeding in the early days.  Public health nurses, many of whom are midwives and paediatric nurses, continue to support breastfeeding mothers through the postnatal period.  Every mother is visited by a public health nurse within 72 hours of leaving hospital.  Breastfeeding mothers receive follow-up support if needed.<\/p> <p>Until 2020 the implementation of the breastfeeding action plan was undertaken within existing HSE resources.  The Minister for Health has advised me that a total of 34.5 new infant lactation posts were approved through the national maternity strategy and the Department between 2020 and 2021 to ensure every maternity unit and community health service will have dedicated posts in place.  The HSE, most importantly, has recruited a national lead at the end of 2021 to support implementation of national infant feeding standards within maternity services.<\/p> <p>To answer the Senator's main question, of the initial 10.5 infant feeding posts approved through the national maternity strategy, eight are currently filled and recruitment continues for the remaining 2.5 posts.  The Minister for Health announced funding for 24 additional infant feeding posts in May last year, with funding for these permanent appointments confirmed in the national service plan 2022.  Following sign-off of that plan, primary notifications for these positions have been secured and recruitment has commenced.  I have requested the HSE to provide specific details on the recruitment campaign, and this information will be forwarded when it is available.<\/p> <p>I have a list of where the 8.3 posts are in place and can share it with the Deputy after this debate, if it is helpful.  There are currently 8.3 whole-time equivalent posts working in community services and 14 of the 24 new posts announced last year are allocated to community services to ensure that every public health nursing service has dedicated breastfeeding supports within their service.  The breakdown of the allocated posts is 14.5 for community services and 9.5 for maternity services.  I can share the information with the Senator afterwards.  I have a breakdown of which counties it is currently being provided in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#B00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I raise this on behalf of the 36 children excluded, particularly Eimear and her mom Julie.  This is about the availability and accessibility of a life-changing cystic fibrosis drug.  A total of 36 children between the ages of six and 11 are being excluded.  It makes no sense, as the treatment prevents damage to the lungs.  Cystic fibrosis diminishes the quality of life and left expectancy of young children who have it.  This new medication Kaftrio allows cystic fibrosis patients to live a fairly normal life.  I know of a number of young children who have it and have benefited enormously from this drug therapy.  Their quality of life has been enhanced beyond words.  It is a vexing issue for the families in question, that is, Eimear, her mom Julie and the 35 other children.<\/p> <p>There is the issue of gene mutation not being covered by the HSE.  Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, which has done an extraordinary amount of work and advocacy, including on this matter, has asked the HSE and the pharmaceutical company to return to the negotiating table to allow the 35 children to access this life-saving drug.  It is a pricing dispute, from what I can gather.  More important, this is about enhancing the quality of life of young people, ensuring we do not allow further damage to their lungs and pancreas and, as the Minister of State said, the postcode lottery is eliminated and we allow for accessibility.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Cystic Fibrosis Ireland asks that the children in this case are not used as pawns in a pricing dispute between a pharmaceutical company and the HSE.<br\/><br\/>We are discussing a difficult issue.

For Eimear, her mum Julie and the 35 other children he referred to, this is a very important issue, especially for families with children who suffer from debilitating conditions.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will know, the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes and for the administration of the community drug schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<\/p> <p>Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.  In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the reimbursement list.  The HSE robustly assesses applications for pricing and reimbursement to make sure it can deliver the best value in terms of  each medicine and ultimately make more medicines available to Irish citizens who need them.<\/p> <p>HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost-effectiveness as a health intervention.<\/p> <p>The HSE has advised that on 7 January 2022, the European Medicines Agency approved a change to the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Kaftrio.  This change expanded the group of cystic fibrosis patients for which this medicine is now licensed and that is good news.  On 21 March 2022, the HSE received a rapid review dossier from the manufacturer for a pricing and reimbursement application for Kaftrio to treat a group of patients aged between six and 11 years covered by the EMA's expanded marketing authorisation.  Following assessment by the HSE, and in line with agreed processes, reimbursement is in place from May for these children under the high-tech drug arrangements.  The HSE has also advised that another pricing and reimbursement application with respect to Kaftrio for a further group of patients of the same age was received on 11 April 2022 and is currently undergoing assessment in line with the 2013 Act.<\/p> <p>The HSE has, to date, engaged in five commercial meetings with the manufacturer between 6 January 2022 and 14 April 2022 to discuss this application.  The NCPE rapid review assessment report for the application was received by the HSE on 10 May 2022.  The NCPE advised that a full health technology assessment was recommended to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this indication compared with the current standard of care.  The HSE advises that it commissioned a full health technology assessment on 16 May as per standard process.<\/p> <p>The HSE executive management team is the decision-making body for the reimbursement of medicines under the Health Act 2013.  It will, following the NCPE's assessment and receipt of the outcome of the drugs group's deliberations, make the decision on whether Kaftrio will be reimbursed for this indication.<\/p> <p>To sum up, the Senator was quite right that this all about enhancing the quality of life of these children.  A lot of work is under way behind the scenes.  Four meetings have taken place, one of which was held as recently as 16 May.  I am hopeful and confident that because this drug has been made available to some children who have cystic fibrosis, more progress will be made for the families to whom he referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#C00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the encouraging words at the end of her contribution.

I would like to hear very clearly from the Minister of State, who is here on behalf of the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, what the Government proposes to do to regulate exotic pets.  Ireland has a completely lax system when it comes to exotic animals.  I often raise concerns about the treatment of dogs and horses.  At least in the case of dogs, we have microchipping and licensing laws, albeit that they are poorly enforced.  There are no such regulations governing exotic animals.  Only a few weeks ago, we heard from the exotic animal sanctuary that it is inundated with calls from people seeking to rehome their pandemic parrots.  We also see news reports of reptiles being found abandoned or living in watercourses.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is literally nothing stopping people from buying exotic animals.  These animals have complex needs and in many cases are exceptionally long lived.  They live for far longer than cats and dogs.  The Federation of Veterinarians of Europe, which has daily interactions with exotic species, has said it is clear many species are not suitable as companion animals.  They can experience extreme stress, boredom and depression and have severe behavioural issues, including self-mutilation.  Irresponsible breeding, which is happening, has seen animals taken from the wild to feed the captive breeding industry.  While Ireland is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the evidence is there to show the exotic pet industry is having an impact on wild animal populations.  The trade is also having an impact on our biodiversity here as some species become invasive.<\/p><p>Ireland needs to get a handle on the exotic pet industry.  We need to look at what other countries are doing, see how effective their regulations are and introduce what is most effective.  In the North there is a licensing system and Britain has introduced a certification process to ensure potential owners have completed a course to show they know how to look after the exotic species.  I particularly want to focus today on the Cypriot proposal, which has a lot of merit.  I want to hear the Department's view on it.  Cyprus proposes to introduce an EU-wide positive list system for companion animals.  Belgium introduced such a list in 2001 and it has clearly been very effective there.  Proponents of the positive list argue it provides clarity.  It is simpler and better than a negative list as it avoids the situation whereby if an animal is not listed it is permitted by default.  Positive lists are a precautionary approach and are more effective against new unforeseen trends we might have in various exotic animals.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State outline what Ireland's position will be at the AGRIFISH Council meeting on 24 May?

Exotic animals can have an impact in areas other than agriculture.  It is important that all stakeholders and Departments are engaged in the process   This is what we are doing with the interdepartmental group.  This in line with the programme for Government and Ireland's Animal Welfare Strategy 2021-2025 - Working Together for Animal Welfare.  Initial meetings of the group have taken place and its work will focus on regulating the keeping, breeding and trading of exotic animals.

We will give it due consideration and the Minister will work on it prior to the meeting on 24 May to see the implications of moving to a positive list as opposed to a negative list.

The strategy is backed by resources and expertise in the Department and involves dialogue and co-operation with other Departments, agencies, stakeholders and civil society.

It has gone from where we had one in five of those aged between 18 and 28 in 1980 going on to higher education to now having more than three in five, with many others going into apprenticeships and further education and training.  It has become much more accessible.  Even in financially difficult times during the 2010s we saw the number of places expand from 200,000 to 245,000.  In response to the challenges facing students because of Covid, the Government rightly expanded the number of places in higher education.  The difficulty, as the Minister of State knows, has been that while we continued to expand the number of places, the commensurate amount of money has not been made available to fund these places.<\/p> <p>I welcome the fact the Minister, Deputy Harris, has announced a specific fund of &euro;307 million will be available in the very near future to address some of the core funding issues.  However, I am concerned.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister has announced that there could be an additional 1,000 places provided in higher education this autumn, yet there is not complete clarity that those places will be properly funded.  I welcome the expansion of places in higher education.  It is important that we expand the number of places in apprenticeships and in further education and training, in particular in areas where we have skills shortages.<\/p><p>The indications are that the 1,000 places will be in the areas of medicine, healthcare, engineering and climate change.  This is particularly welcome for those on medical and healthcare-related courses where, as we know, just over 40% of college courses that required 550 points or more last year used random selection in the allocation of those places.  It is a very cruel blow to any student who has achieved those high levels to be excluded from a place.  Expanding the number of places is welcome.<\/p><p>However the difficulty is that we have to have a very clear commitment that those places will be funded.  If, for instance, as the Minister has said, expanding the number of places on medical courses will involve an additional 120 places being created over the next two years, that is something that is very welcome.  Given that the full economic cost to the State of educating a student in medicine over a six-year period is in the order of &euro;100,000 or even more, those 120 places will be an additional cost to the Exchequer of in excess of &euro;12 million.  If we are going to continue to expand our higher education system for every single additional place in terms of current expenditure, we need clarity that there are guarantees that the full economic cost will be covered.  <\/p><p>In addition to that, there are also major challenges around capital costs.  We cannot continue to squeeze more and more students into higher and further education places unless there is significant investment.  If we talk to those involved in higher education institutions, they will all talk about the capital challenges they face.  The expansion of higher and further education is incredibly welcome, but we have to ensure the model we use is sustainable and we need to give a guarantee, as a Government, that any new places that are created this year will be properly funded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#D00500","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Byrne for raising what is an important issue.  I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  We are very aware of the demand that exists for places in higher education.  Demographic factors mean demand will only increase in the coming years and we must work to ensure there is a place in third level education for everyone who wants one.<\/p> <p>Our higher education system has already expanded considerably over the past number of years.  As the Senator outlined, full-time graduate enrolments rose by 9% between 2014 and 2020 and are expected to increase by another 15% by the end of the decade.  A significant number of additional places were created in 2020 and 2021 in response to the disruption of Covid-19, as the Senator said.  This year, officials are working with the HEA and the higher education sector to create additional places in key skills areas, as identified by our skills architecture.  This work is at an advanced stage and it is hoped a significant number of additional places can be created.  These places will help to address skills need in areas such as healthcare, construction and green skills.<\/p> <p>When we are increasing capacity in any area of education, it is vital that we do so in a sustainable way and maintain the high quality for which our education system is known.  That is at the heart of the points raised by the Senator.  We talked about securing funding for this and being able to provide for places into the future, based not on demographics but on the increased demand we need to meet.<\/p> <p>Earlier this month, the Minister, Deputy Harris, published Funding the Future, the Department's ambitious policy document that seeks to address funding issues in the higher education sector, improve the quality of programmes and learning outcomes and reduce the cost of education to students and their families.  The Senator referenced the &euro;307 million in funding.  That planned additional investment will be made over a number of years to address the core funding challenges.  This does not account for future demographic needs or new policy proposals for higher education.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Harris, will shortly convene a high-level higher education reform implementation review group to drive reform in this area.  It is also important that we examine how we increase capacity, not only in the higher education sector but also in further education, training and apprenticeships for those most suited to those areas.  I can talk a little more about the apprenticeship side in my supplementary reply.<\/p> <p>I take on board the points raised by the Senator.  They are very valid.  We want to create additional places.  We have to make sure they are funded sustainably all of the way through the system.  The points he outlined, such as the example of medical students, are valid.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is working to ensure that the places that are delivered are sustainably funded and that we have as many as we need and can provide.  That is the approach and determination across the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#E00200","speaker":"1586"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I appreciate that it is not his portfolio, but the commitment is welcome.  It is notable that, as he said, the &euro;307 million the Minister has referred to is about addressing current challenges around core funding, rather than dealing with future challenges.  That is why it is essential that if the additional places in further and higher education are created, we have to make sure every single one is funded sustainably.  We cannot continue to say that we have solved the problems of the past with a sticking plaster and then create more problems.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State knows, the problems are not just demographic.  Some reports have suggested that because of the convergence of new technologies, within the next decade 65% of current jobs will either be redundant or significantly change and, as a result, we will all need to upskill and reskill.  There is a major role for our further and higher education systems to address that.  We have to be radical.  The model we use has to be sustainable.  I would like the Minister of State to take the message back to the Minister that if he is creating 1,000 additional higher education places, as well as places in further education, that is all very welcome, but they must be funded into the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#E00300","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his follow-up response.  We are committed to supporting a balanced further and higher education system which has a multitude of pathways for learners to follow.  The action plan for apprenticeships sets out new ways of structuring funding and promoting apprenticeship, with a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per year by 2025.  In 2021, a record 8,607 new apprentices were registered, an almost 40% increase on the figures in 2019, the last normal pre-pandemic year.<\/p> <p>We are working to strengthen the further education and training system under the strategy for the sector.  It is important that capacity in the higher education sector is not increased in a way that undermines this work.  That gets to the heart of the Senator's point about sustainability, namely that whatever increase in places we have is sustainably funded.  People do not just enter into first year; they are there for the long haul.  The Senator mentioned medicine, which can involve six or seven years of education.<\/p> <p>If a significant number of places are provided in the further and higher education system in ways that are not sufficiently targeted, learners may end up migrating away from further education offerings that represent better learning options for them and provide superior career opportunities.  This has the potential to impact on retention and success rates.  We will continue to work to ensure our education system expands in a sustainable and balanced way that ensures a pathway in education is available to all who want and need it.  That is at the heart of what the Senator has spoken about today and what we and the Minister, Deputy Harris, need to do to get this right.  In terms of the additional places for which there is demand, we want there to be an array of different education options that are adequately funded so that people can see a pathway through when they choose one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#E00400","speaker":"1586"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652866200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an Seanad ar fionra&iacute; ar 11.19 a.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ar 11.34 a.m.  \r\n\r\nSitting suspended at 11.19 a.m. and resumed at 11.34 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1652866200,"counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#G00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The Order of Business is No. 1, Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 - Committee Stage, to be taken at 1 p.m. and to adjourn at 5 p.m. if not previously concluded; and No. 2, Private Members' business, Quality in Public Procurement (Contract Preparation and Award Criteria) Bill 2021 &ndash; Order for Committee Stage and Committee Stage, to be taken at 5.15 p.m. and to adjourn after two hours if not previously concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#G00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I will raise three issues.  I welcome the three-year strategy on research and development announced this morning by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris.  It is a comprehensive document.  It places greater emphasis on interdisciplinarity in research and refers to how we need to learn from the experience of Covid-19.  The Minister is also committed to introducing underpinning legislation to strengthen our research capability.  Given the enormous changes we will see in technology and some of the challenges we will be facing with climate change in the next decade, it is important that not only are we prepared for these developments but also that Irish research endeavours are able to contribute collaboratively to shaping some of these changes.  Therefore, I ask that we have a debate on the research strategy and the importance of research in this country.<\/p> <p>The Deputy Leader will be aware that much mention has been made in the news of the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA.  The Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Chambers, has indicated he will look at potentially withholding funding if action is not taken in the IABA to resolve some of its current difficulties.  When we listen to former coaches and, more importantly, for me, some of the people involved in boxing on the ground talking about how dysfunctional this organisation is, it becomes clear something is wrong.  When John Treacy appeared before the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, I asked him if he thought this was a case similar to what happened with the FAI in the context of some of its past problems.  He said he did not think it was.  Frankly, based on the stories now emerging, this situation may be worse than what was going on in the FAI.  Our only interest should be focused on being able to support young boxers and boxing clubs around the country.  It is time for an independent person to be appointed to examine the IABA and the sport of boxing.  It is too important a sport to this country to allow this issue to continue to be unresolved.  I ask the Deputy Leader to raise this issue with the Minister.<\/p> <p>The Deputy Leader will also be aware that Finland and Sweden this week submitted their applications to join NATO.  It is not something I am suggesting Ireland should do, although I have said here that we should co-operate more closely with the non-aligned EU member states, such as Finland, Sweden and Austria.  This development puts Ireland in a very different position.<\/p> <p>The Deputy Leader will also be aware that I have regularly raised, as she indeed has herself, the question of food and energy security, as well as that of cybersecurity.  We are not taking these issues sufficiently seriously.  Considering the decisions made by Finland and Sweden, we must have a significant debate around Ireland&rsquo;s future defence capabilities.  I ask that such a debate be arranged urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#G00300","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>The first phase of the redevelopment of Kickham Barracks in Clonmel is under way, in conjunction with the building of a sports hub just outside the town.  This involves funding received in the context of the urban regeneration development fund and allocated by the then Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government several years ago.  It is an exciting and significant project for Clonmel.<\/p> <p>Last year, however, a second phase application was submitted by the county council, involving an ambitious proposal for a further &euro;50 million development of Kickham Barracks and the rejuvenation of the town centre in Clonmel.  The main thrust of the application was to move the premises of what was previously the Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, and which is now part of the Technological University of the Shannon, TUS, from outside the town into Kickham Barracks and to transform that old Army facility into an educational centre.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Garret Ahearn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It was to a be a real hub for the town, creating a new atmosphere and new town centre, essentially.  Unfortunately, we heard that the application was unsuccessful before Christmas.  A new application will be submitted when the call goes out from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, probably next month.<\/p><p>When the application was unsuccessful, many Opposition politicians, local politicians in Clonmel and national politicians were critical of the decision and gave up all hope.  Some even criticised the council itself for the application that was submitted, saying it was being too ambitious.  That is an outrageous accusation, in my view.  We can never be too ambitious for Clonmel and in respect of what we can do for the region.  On the back of that disappointment, in fairness to the Government, the Taoiseach has been down to visit Clonmel.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has been in contact constantly about what needs to be done.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has also visited the town, seeking to establish what his Department can do.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burke and the Minister for Defence have also both visited the area.  They have all visited.  None of the people who criticised the project were there when they visited.<\/p><p>The reason I say that is because, at the time the application was made, one of the requests from the Minister and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage was that the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science would provide more funding because the project was for an educational complex.  It requested that the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science put up some money to justify the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage supporting the rest of it.  I ask that we get a decision from the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  Perhaps the Senator, in her capacity as Deputy Leader, could write to the Minister in support the application.  I know the Minister of State has submitted a similar application for a project in Mullingar.<\/p><p>If we can get funding from the office of the Minister of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, it will reduce the amount of funding we need from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and increase the possibility of the application being successful.  The Minister has around &euro;200 million left to use from the urban regeneration and development fund.  There will be many applications being submitted looking for support.  If we can reduce the cost, we have a better chance of getting the funding, but we need the support from the Minister of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science's Department.  He has been very positive about it.  He was very positive when he visited Clonmel.  It is a key decision if we are going to be successful in the application for funding and the redevelopment of Clonmel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#G00400","speaker":"1629","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order to Business, that No. 18, Planning and Development (Built Heritage Protection) Bill 2022 - First Stage, which is being introduced on behalf of my friend and good colleague, Senator Norris, be taken before No. 1.  I understand my colleague Senator Keogan will be seconding it.<\/p> <p>Today, I ask for a debate on the 2021 annual report of the Ombudsman for Children.  Yesterday the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, talked about how his office was frustrated by the lack of places available for children with special educational needs.  It was one of the key takes from the report.  The ombudsman stated he was concerned the best interests of children are still not put at the centre of decision-making, but instead many choices about children are being made based on available budgets and funds.  I understand where he is coming from and I understand the constraints of Government.  However, we have to be ambitious.  We must put the child at the centre of all Government policies.  When the ombudsman voices his concerns, we really have to be concerned.  I took the time to look at the 2021 annual report, which was launched yesterday.  In the report, key issues such as education, health, homelessness, local authorities, justice, finance, social protection, welfare, family supports for children and care and protection for children are highlighted.  Interestingly, I did not find much in the report about housing, so I took the time to do a word search.  I was somewhat surprised how little mention there was of housing.  However, there was mention of homelessness, which was interesting.  I also want to share the ombudsman's positive commentary on the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022, which we will be discussing later.  I think that when an advocate for children, such as the ombudsman, talks about an issue like that, we should sit up and listen.<\/p> <p>The Office of the Ombudsman for Children is required under statute and law made in these Houses to submit to the Oireachtas a comprehensive annual report on the performance of its functions.  Therefore, I call on the Deputy Leader to arrange for a debate, in line with the provisions in legislation that the ombudsman lays his report before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is timely.  It is not good enough to have a report sitting in our libraries gathering dust.  When Deputies and Senators passed legislation relevant to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, it was clearly envisaged we would review these annual reports and their recommendations.  It would be helpful if we could have a debate on the report, time permitting, focusing specifically on the ombudsman's recommendations and the current annual report that was launched yesterday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#H00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Will the Senator confirm that his amendment is \"That No. 18 on the supplementary Order Paper be taken before No. 1\"?

The commitment followed legislation in the Seanad that I proposed in 2018.  The Bill remains on the Order Paper today.  Yesterday, at the Museum of Literature Ireland on St. Stephen's Green, LGBT Ireland launched a campaign to ban conversion practices.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, who was there, reiterated his commitment that conversion practices would be banned within this mandate.  The Minister has said Government research will be published by the end of the summer.<\/p> <p>All of this is taking place while the British Government is taking a very different approach in excluding our trans bothers and sisters from the ban.  I know Ireland will do better.  No lesbian, gay or bisexual person needs to be cured.  Certainly, no trans person needs to be cured either.  Indeed, members of the trans community in Britain are twice as likely to be offered conversion therapy to change or repress their gender identity.  What we are saying is there should be no predetermined outcomes in therapy.  No person needs to be cured.

I thank Mr. Damien Douglas, Ms Niamh Ryan and Ms Anna Budayova, and indeed their children, Una, Ailis, Liam and Esther, for their powerful contributions to the committee meeting today.  We all know what carers do for us.  It is estimated they save this State up to &euro;20 billion per year in costs.  One of the issues we discussed today was the means test.  There is a growing call for the means test to be disregarded.  I support that call.  We need to debate the issue.  We need to bring the Minister back to the House to speak about what carers do for us in this country, and to talk about getting rid of the means test once and for all.<\/p> <p>I also want to raise again the issue of housing adaptation grants.  It was discussed at length at the committee meeting today.  Unfortunately, the current limit on housing adaptation grants is &euro;30,000.  I have cited previously in the House the example of a family with whom I am dealing.  The cheapest quote they could get for essential work for a loved one coming out of D&uacute;n Laoghaire hospital was &euro;70,000.  They are still seeking the adaptation to be carried out.  They are still seeking that difference in funding to create a loving home space.  In fairness to them, they want to take their loved one home.  We need to review the housing adaptation grants.  We also need to provide social housing adaptation grants.  I am aware there is a two-and-a-half-year waiting list in my own county for social housing adaptation grants.

The GoFundMe page that is set up to ensure someone's loved one can come home and stay with them is now included in the means test and many of those people are now being thrown out of the carer&rsquo;s allowance, for want of a better description.

However, this morning, we learned how sport is actually invaluable.  Those of us listening to RT&Eacute; radio sport on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; earlier will have learned of the world record-breaking exploits of an Irish man, and more importantly a Navan man, Keith Russell, who was competing in the gruelling Race of Champions Backyard Masters in Germany.  This race began last Saturday and runners had to cover 6.7 km every single hour since last Saturday.  Keith had competed last year and ran 63 laps but, by last night, he and his opponent from Germany, when there were only the two of them left in the race, had both broken the world record of 85 laps as they set into a fourth night of running.  In the early hours of this morning, while we were in bed, his race came to an end at 89 laps after covering 597 km in a time of 66 hours, 14 minutes and 22 seconds.  This is an epic event and it is by invitation only.  Keith had smashed the Irish record in County Down last June and had been invited to this world championships.<\/p> <p>I know Keith personally.  He started running only in 2016 for his daughter Alanna, who had cerebral palsy, and he ran the 2017 Dublin marathon pushing Alanna in her special running chair.  Sadly, Alanna has passed since then but Keith has maintained his dedication to her memory and to fundraising for children like Alanna as well.  He described himself to RT&Eacute; last year as just a runner, just an average person.  I think he is far from average.

There are a number of these centres around the country offering a diverse range of services to anyone who is in need of them - tax and money services, free legal advice, immigration assistance and Workplace Relations Commission issues.  The importance of these centres cannot be overstated yet many fear they are going the same way as the humble post office, with people thinking that if they do not use it, it cannot be that important.  In the same way, however, not everyone orders online from Amazon or Etsy, and not everyone has the capability to join a Zoom conference or do DIY research on tax or immigration law.  That is why these services exist - to help those people who have no recourse to alternative measures.<\/p> <p>It would be appear the Citizens Information Board, the statutory body under the remit of the Department of Social Protection, is implementing a switch, becoming mainly a telephone and website service and failing in the delivery of the traditional face-to-face consultations which have served the people of Ireland very well.  The centre in Rathmines was one of the busiest in Dublin, serving Dublin 2, 4 and 6, and anyone could call into it.  That centre closed on 22 April and will not be replaced.  The paid staff were told of its closure only a week before it closed.  Closures also happened recently in Enniscorthy and Wicklow town, and I am told the Crumlin centre is similarly under threat.  Buildings used for these centres are seeing their leases run out, with no attempt at renewal and no effort to find alternative premises.<\/p> <p>If this trend continues, the service of face-to-face meetings with experienced people in the user's locality will effectively end.

There are two key points that I thought valuable and we should have a discussion about them at some stage in the future.<\/p><p>One of them was a point I had raised previously, which is that anyone who does not have access to a private driveway cannot avail of an electrical vehicle charging point, so anyone in a terraced house on a street cannot get one.  There are a number of ways around this but one of the key ones is to have dedicated charging points on streetscapes where there are 20 to 30 fast chargers operating over 30 minutes.  We need to start the process now of local authorities identifying those areas within the urban setting where these fast-charging hubs can go, so people on streets who do not have connections to private driveways can go along, charge the car for 30 minutes, get a full charge and drive away.  It is important that, at local authority level, we start to identify those areas now.<\/p><p>There is another issue that many people come across and as we move towards the mass adoption of electric vehicles, this will become more and more common.  When people get a charger installed in their home, they then realise that because of the age of their house, rewiring of the house needs to take place to accommodate an electric vehicle charging point, and that rewiring can cost anywhere between &euro;2,000 and &euro;4,000.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John McGahon:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We should look at some sort of a subsidy, perhaps within the retrofit programme, specifically for the rewiring of a home in which someone wants to put in an electric charging point for an electric vehicle.

Nowhere is this more stark than in the case of legacy.<\/p><p>If the British Government is so confident that this legislation will now deliver for families, why did it not consult with them on it?  For years, the families of victims have been told the system does not work, but suddenly an approach is promised involving robust and independent investigations into killings.  We suddenly find that unprecedented access to the UK documents record will be opened, promising an in-depth examination of UK Government policy towards Northern Ireland during the conflict.  Why are these only in the gift of the British Government now?  Why is access coming with strings attached?  More importantly, why has there been no consultation with families of the victims?  They have already given so much, including provisions in the Good Friday Agreement that saw the release of prisoners and a cap of two years for future prosecutions.<\/p><p>Instead of comprehensive legacy proposals for victims, yesterday we saw yet more concessions for perpetrators, for whom immunity will be given to those judged to have co-operated by a panel appointed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

We know planning delays is one of them, as is the cost of grid connections.  I want to raise those concerns about the RESS 2 auction, but we also have concerns around battery storage.  In Britain, battery storage is now displacing gas fuel burners.  Whereas we have a grid that does not recognise multi-hour or multi-day battery storage on the grid, and we are introducing seven temporary gas powered stations to feed data centres.<\/p> <p>We also have a ban on direct lines, which prevents renewable energy connecting directly to buildings.

That is fine as it is very hard to source workers in rural areas.  Due to Government policies, we almost have full employment and it is not as easy to get casual work as it used to be.  In what I am sure is a minority of cases, this is being abused by rogue operators who find out who is looking for a service such as gardening.  They get the details, offer a price and come on site.  In some cases, they do not give any service at all.  It leads to an awful lot of problems and very often they leave the premises with the job undone and the money paid up.  That should be regulated.  I do not know what Minister should do that.  If one has a problem with these operators and one looks for recourse, one is more or less told to take a jump.  They say they cannot help.  They are just like the Golden Pages.  However, they constantly bombard one with questions and ask whether one needs a professional painter and gardener.

I thank all Members for their contributions this morning.<\/p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne kicked off by welcoming the three-year strategy announced by the Minister, Deputy Harris, on research and innovation.  He then spoke about the difficulties in Irish amateur boxing.  It might be worthwhile to have a debate on sport in the House, but perhaps a Commencement matter on that issue would be worthwhile at the outset.  The Senator then spoke about Finland and Sweden's decision to join NATO.  We note the implications of that.  I have heard some Finnish politicians speaking about this.  They have been far more aligned with NATO over the years and have built up a relationship.  However, it is a significant shift in the geopolitical landscape and will no doubt have implications for Ireland and the European Union.  We need to discuss this.  I have requested a debate on a defence at the earliest opportunity with the Minister.<\/p> <p>Senator Ahearn spoke about the urban regeneration fund and the money that was made available in Clonmel for the regeneration of Kickham Barracks and the development of a local sports hall.  The Senator raised a specific question about getting part-funding from the Departments of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and Housing, Local Government and Heritage to try to make phase 2 of that project potentially more successful.  I suggest a Commencement matter on that issue might be appropriate because the Senator has a specific question.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan initially proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, seconded by Senator Keogan, to introduce a planning and amendment Bill around heritage.  I believe the Bill has been drafted by Senator Norris.  I am happy to accept that amendment.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan then spoke about the publication yesterday by the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Muldoon, of a report which relates to particular issues with children around special education and the difficulties in accessing school places and services.  He asked for a debate on that report and the work of the Ombudsman for Children.  We will request that debate with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.<\/p> <p>Senator Warfield spoke, as he has on many occasions, about the banning of conversion therapy.  That needs to be progressed.  I am not sure what the delay is on that front, or whether the Senator has tabled a Commencement matter on it or met with the Minister.  He might talk to the Leader or me about getting a debate on that because it needs to be advanced, especially given the Senator has legislation on the Order Paper since 2018.<\/p> <p>Senator Wall mentioned the attendance at the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands of representatives of Family Carers Ireland.  He referenced the very powerful testimonies given by some of the witnesses there.  We know the important and valuable work that carers do in this country.  Not only do they save the State a considerable amount of money, but they also do very valuable work, often at their own expense.  That needs to be recognised.  The Senator raised the limit on housing adaption grants, which he has raised on numerous occasions.  There are ongoing difficulties with the increased costs of acquiring building materials and getting work done.  He also spoke about the need to work on gambling restrictions and referred to other Senators in that regard as well.<\/p> <p>Senator Cassells spoke about a local Navan man, Keith Russell, and his incredible sporting achievements since he took up running in 2016 in support of his daughter.  I concur with the Senator's remarks and wish Mr. Russell well.  We are all in awe of his achievements.  He is certainly not an ordinary individual.  He is an extraordinary individual.  Senator Cassells may follow in his footsteps with similar sporting exploits.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Senator Conway spoke about the welcome and really good news that Ryanair is to lease a hangar at Shannon Airport, with an investment of &euro;10 million in the airport and the region and the creation of 100 to 150 jobs.  I wish all in Shannon Airport the very best with that.  It is fantastic to see some good news.  That level of announcement is important for the airport.<\/p><p>Senator Keogan spoke about citizens information, the digitisation of those services and the lack of face-to-face interaction.  I agree with the Senator that face-to-face interaction is important for many people.  Those services are there.  We must acknowledge as well, though, that times are changing and many people are accessing information online through their phones or their PC and over the phone and email.  It is a matter of trying to strike the right balance to cater for those who still want the face-to-face interaction but acknowledging that nothing remains the same, services change and move, and people are accessing information remotely at a greater level.<\/p><p>Senator McGahon spoke, as he has done previously, on the challenges facing the electric vehicle industry and the charging network and the fact that if a person does not have a private driveway, he or she cannot install a charging point.  The Senator made an interesting suggestion around a retrofit grant for the installation of charging points where it may be necessary to rewire the house.  It is a good suggestion.  That would come under the remit of Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  It would be certainly worthwhile to raise a Commencement matter on that because it is quite a specific question.  It is an interesting suggestion by the Senator.<\/p><p>Senator Crowe spoke about long-term illness benefit, the particular conditions that are covered and, more importantly, those who are not covered.  The Senator referenced specifically Crohn's disease and the need to look to try to expand that service.  That is an interesting suggestion.  I agree there are certain other conditions now we know are debilitating and lifelong conditions that do not have a cure and that there is a strong argument for those to be included under the scheme.  The Senator might want to liaise with the Leader's office in terms of talking to the Department about that, and perhaps raise a Commencement matter.<\/p><p>Senator Currie made a passionate contribution.  I concur with everything she said about the ongoing legacy issues in Northern Ireland, the treatment of victims and families, and the actions and commentary in recent days by the British Government to try in some way to take unilateral action to remove completely the rights of some victims and families to access justice and get accountability.  The Government's position is that we are totally opposed to this.  I am sure all Members in this House would join in the Senator's remarks by saying we absolutely oppose any action by the British Government to deal with legacy issues that removes the rights of victims and families to get justice and accountability for what has happened to them.<\/p><p>Senator Boylan spoke about the World Meteorological Organization and its recent report on climate.  I agree with the Senator that there is a need to focus on the cost of renewables.  In this country, we must focus on the need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels as well.  The recent debate on turf burning showed there are difficulties and not all parties are in agreement.  Some parties could not decide what their position was on the turf burning issues.  Some parties are not in favour of carbon tax, whereas carbon tax and carbon budgets are important mechanisms and tools by which we are reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.  You must be on one side or the other.  It is difficult to see how the two situations can be married.  Certainly, the cost of renewables needs to be tackled to make them the more affordable choice.<\/p><p>Senator Burke spoke about Irish Water and the need for a debate.  We will request that.  We have requested a debate with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the housing issue.  Obviously, Irish Water comes under his remit as well and we will try and get some answers on that.  I am aware of the issue with Irish Water and the fragmented holdings, which is of particular concern to smaller farmers, particularly in the west, where land might be in different locations and a connection fee is charged for each holding even though it is one business or farmer.  My information is the IFA is now involved in that issue.  The Department is awaiting the outcome of a meeting with the IFA to try to advance that issue, but the Minister is aware of that concern and is looking to address it.<\/p><p>Senator O'Sullivan spoke about the task force on liquefied natural gas, LNG.  I agree with the Senator that often these task forces can go on for a protracted length of time with maybe little or no action flowing from them and that there is a need to keep an eye on them.  Perhaps we will seek regular updates in this Chamber on where that is at and keep the issue live and at the top of the agenda.  I take on board the point the Senator is making about the exploitation of some workers and some clients when it comes to getting people to do odd jobs or different types of work around the house.  It is difficult to get workers, but it is an industry that requires regulation to protect the consumer, first and foremost, to make sure there is transparent information and that there is recourse to some sort of a dispute resolution mechanism or complaints mechanism where there is a difficulty.<\/p><p>Senator Dolan spoke about vacant and derelict houses and the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme.  It is my understanding that 5,000 properties will be delivered over the next four years under that scheme.  It has just been announced but I understand the roll-out will happen quickly and certainly by the end of this year.  On the specific issues in Ballinasloe, perhaps the Senator would raise a Commencement matter because it is quite a specific question about how many units there will be for her area.  I understand the scheme is under way and will be moving very shortly.  It is a four-year scheme.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer spoke about the Irish Property Owners Association.  A number of Senators attended that briefing.  A debate request has gone to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We will get the Minister into the Chamber at the earliest possible opportunity.  We need to have a conversation around why are landlords leaving the market and how we stop that from happening.  There is a big difference between the small landlord with maybe one or two properties and the big institutional investors with which we have particular difficulties, but we need to maintain supply, and access to rental properties is a big problem.  We have requested that debate.<\/p><p>I should say as well we have a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications in the month of June.  The date is to be confirmed, but next month we will have the Minister, Deputy Ryan, into the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#L00800","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Senator Boyhan has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That No. 18 on the Supplementary Order Paper be taken before No. 1.\"  Is that agreed?

There are several reasons this is problematic.  First, the Adoption Act 1952 came into force in 1953.  At that time, the Adoption Board did not exist and the adoption societies were not registered.  This means that any person adopted outside the State whose adoption was facilitated prior to 1953 might not be included under the provisions of the Bill as it stands.<\/p><p>The second concern is that this is not simply an unfortunate issue of timing.  These adoptions were knowingly excluded from the adopted children's register even when adoption was legalised in 1952.  In his contribution to the Seanad debate on the Adoption Act 1963, the then Minister for Justice, Charles Haughey, stated, &quot;the Adoption Board have no function in regard to a child taken out for adoption in America&quot;.  We know that many of the adoptions to America and elsewhere were illegal.  There is a concern that there may be a large number of adopted persons who were subjected to illegal arrangements and whose rights may not be protected under the Bill.  Amendment No. 1 is our attempt to rectify that and make it clear that the Bill would also cover those placed for adoption outside the State.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 2 is effectively an alternative seeking to address the same issue.  In the context of speaking about adoption only coming onto a legal basis in 1953, it is worth noting there was heavy lobbying against it.  The Minister will be very aware that there have been times when the State has tried to put things on a different, legal or State basis and those who were in relationships with the State for the provision of services have often lobbied against such changes.  I refer to the mother and baby home report in that regard.  Nonetheless, I think the Minister will agree that this is a serious omission.  I hope he can address it.  <\/p><p>As I understand it, amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are part of this grouping.  Amendment No. 3 introduces a new paragraph (f) under section 2 that specifically includes all persons subject to an illegal birth registration as being listed under those defined as being adopted people born in the State.  The legislation currently only applies to people whose births were illegally registered before 31 December 1980.  It is a deeply flawed decision to insert a date limit as there is no evidence to suggest illegal registrations ceased on 31 December 1980.  Any person illegally adopted outside the date limit might not be able to access his or her rights under the Bill.  The Bill should be amended to ensure that all affected persons subject to illegal birth registrations are included.<\/p><p>Similarly, amendment No. 4 is a variation.  It introduces a new subsection (1)(e).  It is the same principle of ensuring that those who may have been subject to illegal registrations after 31 December 1980 are recognised properly under the Bill.  <\/p><p>These are two different issues but both relate to the core principle that if we are trying to move forward and make redress, we need to ensure it is not a piecemeal approach and that all relevant adopted persons are able to access their rights under the legislation, explicitly including those who were adopted overseas and those who were illegally adopted or whose adoption involved an illegal birth registration after 1980.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#Q00500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  At all times in the work that has been ongoing on the Bill, including prior to the initial drafting of the general scheme, the detailed work that took place during pre-legislative scrutiny and the detailed Committee and Report Stages in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, we have sought to clarify and strengthen the definitions contained in the legislation to ensure that as wide a range of people as possible will be able to use the very important provisions of this legislation to get full and unredacted access to all their information.   We are confident that we have achieved that in terms of the provisions of the Bill laid before Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  As such, we consider the four amendments in this grouping as unnecessary because these issues are already addressed within the Bill.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 propose changes relating to persons who were adopted outside the State.

That amendment was to insert section 2(1)(b)(ii), which states: \"removed from the State by any other person for the purpose of the effecting of his or her adoption outside the State, and whose adoption was effected outside the State,\".  This amendment ensures that, in all cases, a child born in Ireland who was sent for adoption abroad is included.  The person does not have to have been sent by the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  The provision covers all children who were sent outside the State for adoption, so I believe we have covered the issue Senator Higgins has raised.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 relate to including a person subject to an illegal birth registration and illegal adoption in the definition of \"adopted person\".  These amendments are unnecessary as the persons to whom they are relevant are already sufficiently provided for.  They are provided for in the definitions of \"incorrect birth registration\" and \"relevant person\".  Furthermore, seeking to include them in the definition of \"adopted person\" is counter to its meaning as, in the scenario of an illegal birth registration or illegal adoption, an adoption was not legally effected.  Therefore, the person subject to it is not an adopted person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#Q00600","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

As we know, there are rights to broad categories of information provided for in this legislation.  These include rights to the birth certificate, birth information, care information, early life information, incorrect birth registration information and to provided items.  As such, I argue that the amendments being suggested by the Senator are unnecessary.

The information about vaccines is explicitly covered in the definition of early life, and it is also implicitly captured in the definition of medical information.  I believe the amendment is superfluous.<br\/><br\/>It is unclear to us what is being proposed in amendment No. 7, and on that basis we cannot accept it.  From listening to the Senator, I think what she seeks to include is already encompassed in the definition of &quot;care arrangement&quot;.

It is not simply a record of a person being vaccinated, but of having an entitlement to records of vaccine trials.  If persons were one of 12 or 100 subjects in a vaccine trial, they would not simply be informed that they were vaccinated but if they were part of a vaccine trial they would be informed in relation to the records of the trial, what it was being used to develop and who was involved in it.

For example, if particular drugs or vaccines were bring trialled or developed.  It is one thing to state in a record that a person was vaccinated and another thing to say a person was part of a vaccine trial and to outline the stage of development of the vaccine, what it was part of and who was being paid for it.  There is a lot more information relating to a vaccine trial.  I will not press the amendment now.<\/p> <p>I accept that amendment No. 6 probably is not needed and is covered by what is in the Bill, but in amendment No. 5 there is something slightly different and it is just a case of clarifying the position.  Simply saying one received X or Y vaccine would not be an adequate coverage of the fact that one was part of a vaccine trial, for example.  I may introduce an elaboration of the amendment on Report Stage.  We might even seek to have vaccination covered in the section on early life care and see if it is something that could be clarified.  It is a very different thing to be vaccinated and to be part of a vaccine trial.  I will not press the amendment, as I agree with the Minister on the placing.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 6 is probably adequately covered by the medical information and the other provisions the Minister has outlined.  Regarding amendment No. 7, the problem is that the care arrangements, as currently described in the Bill, almost describe the formal care arrangements to an extent, in terms of the nursed out or boarded out arrangement.  It is those institutions that may be part of the Schedule.  The Minister will be aware that there are concerns around what is or is not in the Schedule.  The purpose of paragraph (d) in the amendment was to capture the wider arrangement that might not be a formal nursing out or boarding out arrangement, a foster care arrangement or an arrangement under the Child Care Act.  We know that there were informal arrangements that took place as well, that may not have happened under the particular Act, be it the Child Care Act or in relation to whatever limited organisation or institution or to a formal nursed out or boarded out arrangement.  The amendment seeks to capture those informal care arrangements that we have heard of.<\/p> <p>I am also conscious that one of the groups I will be talking about later in terms of the Schedule is psychiatric institutions.  That is why we have included a reference to \"care of children and mothers\" in the amendment.  We know there are a lot of cases, for example, of mothers being sent postnatally to psychiatric institutions, and in one case I am aware of a person spending the rest of her life there.  I am trying to capture the wider spaces and ensure things do not fall through the cracks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#S00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I know the Senator is not pressing the amendment, but on the point on the vaccine trials, we must recall that on the substantive provisions to do with the release of information, it is about the release of information and a copy of the records on all the different headings.  For example, section 15 refers to &quot;Relevant body or Authority to provide medical information&quot;.  I know it is not care information, but they are mirrored.  Section 15(2)(a) states: &quot;shall, to the extent that it is practicable to do so, provide the relevant person with a copy of the records specified&quot;.  That is repeated for the other provisions as well.  It is not the bare information that a person was subjected to a vaccine trial, full stop.  It is copies of records as well.  I hope that offers some reassurance on that first point.<\/p><p>In terms of the definition of &quot;care arrangement&quot;, we refined this as we went along and we feel that it now captures both the various formal nursed out or boarded out arrangements, fostering under the Child Care Act, and arrangements where someone was placed with an adoptive parent but an adoption did not materialise in the end.<\/p><p>Our approach to the catch-all is in paragraph (e), &quot;an arrangement under which a child was cared for as a resident of an institution specified in the <i>Schedule<\/i>&quot;.  We believe that is the most effective way.  What Senator Higgins is putting forward is incredibly broad and it is hard to understand the remit of that.  We have provided a remit.  We have provided a Schedule and the Schedule can be amended to include additional institutions, as necessary.  When concerns were raised about the Schedule or who falls within or falls without, I did ask for examples, as we added that because someone had given us an example of a person who was in an institution for a number of years and who eventually left and returned to their mother.  They are not adopted, fostered or boarded out and they could not have used the provisions, so we did make a change to reflect the unique situation, but we believe we have captured those situations now and the matter is addressed under the current definition of &quot;care information&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#S00500","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>In terms of the record, again the danger might be that it is a record of vaccination, but we can come back to vaccination trials on Report Stage.

The provision as I outlined it is quite wide in terms of those involved in care, but it is because the Schedule is insufficiently wide, if the Minister knows what I mean.  The other way that some of the concerns could be addressed, for example in the case of psychiatric institutions, is by addressing it in terms of the Schedule.  I know the Minister sees the Schedule as the catch-all, but in its current incarnation it is not really a catch-all.  I have given one example, but there are others that are not currently covered by the Schedule and we do not have a guarantee that they will be.  That is where I am coming from.

That would include information on the correspondence between somebody who may have provided care and an institution, for example.  In circumstances in which people were boarded out and did work, and in other examples, it would give a texture to what the arrangements were, not the mechanical arrangements for care but, rather, what the relationship was between those who were arranging for such care and those who were providing it.  Those are the administrative processes that surround a relevant person&rsquo;s care.<\/p> <p>The amendment seeks to go a bit deeper.  It is similar in a way to the question of vaccine trials, whereby persons would be able to access the information about them but also be able to see where they fit into patterns of arrangements.

My response will be somewhat similar to my response to the point she made about vaccines.  Much of what she is seeking to address in the amendment is covered under the definition of &ldquo;early life information&rdquo;.  That is where the matter is most appropriately addressed.  The various pieces of information provided for under early life information, include, in paragraphs (g) to (k), inclusive, information on any medical treatments, procedures or vaccinations administered to him or her; information on the duration of the period during which his or her mother remained with him or her; information on whether he or she left the place referred to with, or separately from, his or her mother; information on whether any person, whether a parent or other genetic relative, visited or inquired after him or her; information on whether any person made arrangements for the adoption of the person, whether or not an adoption was effected in respect of him or her; and, where an adoption was effected, the name of each of the adoptive parents.<\/p> <p>There is therefore a substantial amount of information provided under the early life category that deals with those issues of care of the individual.

As such, the list is not definitive but it includes those as categories under which information can be released.<\/p> <p>As the Senator knows, I will be producing guidelines in respect of the application of the legislation by the various bodies.  Central to these guidelines will be a presumption of release.

There is that kind of granular detail but there is slightly less information on care arrangements.  One of the reasons it is relevant is that some of the care arrangements, including some of the boarded-out arrangements and others, included situations which were exploitative of child labour.  Some of them were abusive and some were problematic in other ways.  The names, details and mechanics are there.  The reason we raised the question of the correspondence around the arrangements relates to whether there had been concerns, issues or wrongful expectations in relation to a child when he or she was being boarded out or fostered out.

He will be aware, however, that a minimalist approach to giving people information has been taken for decades.

Tusla, the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the various institutions should not be given the benefit of the doubt in terms of an assumption that there will be an expansive interpretation of this Bill.  People's experience has been that they are given the absolute bare minimum and reasons are found not to even give them that.  While some of these provisions may not seem necessary in a circumstance where the Bill is generously or widely interpreted, these are the reasons we are trying to copper-fasten them in the legislation.

We are not just talking about the information.  If the dates and care information are held in a letter, that is the record.  It is not the case that people will be given a file saying, \"You were in X or Y\".  They will be given a copy of the records as well.  That was really important. The Senator has tabled an amendment that will be discussed later.  In an earlier version of this Bill, we accidentally omitted the records.  We replaced that on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.

There will probably have to be a bit of back and forth because that clump actually deals with quite different topics.  That is why I was surprised by the grouping.<\/p><p>In terms of amendment No. 9, at the moment under subsection (f) it refers to &quot;information on any medical treatments, procedures or vaccinations administered to him or her.&quot;  I am specifying that it should refer to &ldquo;medical information, including&rdquo; information on any medical treatments.  It is just to get that wider definition of &quot;medical information&quot;.  I know at a later stage, the Minister defines medical information as &quot;relating to his or her ... history&quot; but in this section, in terms of early life information, I feel that medical information should be double referenced.  That is more of a technical issue so that it does not fall between the gaps and we do not end up with a narrow version of medical information.<\/p><p>There are a couple of details in respect of amendment No. 10 that I think are really important.  One is this idea of the &quot;genetic relative&quot;.  The Bill states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t(a) his or her mother or father,<br \/><br \/>(b) a child or parent of his or her mother or father,<br \/><br \/>(c) a sibling ... whether the relationship is of the whole blood or half blood, or <br \/><br \/>(d) a person to whom, but for the adoption of any person, <i>paragraph (b)<\/i>or <i>(c)<\/i>would apply; <\/blockquote> <p>Again, why are we narrowing this to &quot;genetic&quot;?  We have the Children and Family Relationships Bill 2015, which recognises that there are different kinds of family relationships.  There could be people who have married into a family, for example.  There may be people who may not be blood relatives but are effectively relatives of a person and who are the relevant people.  Given that we have the Children and Family Relationships Bill 2015 and we have moved on from that definition, I am concerned about going back to a kind of genetic definition of relatives in this regard.  I know maybe there is a relevance for this with regard to the medical information side but in general, I think there is a narrowing of that definition of relative.  I am uneasy about it.  It also could end up excluding persons.  It may be that it is being inserted with regard to how it may relate to medical records.  That might have been what was in mind but it is nonetheless kind of the version of relatives that is going in.  There is another in terms of a qualified relative, which I also have problems with, that comes in another later section of the Bill.  However, I am concerned that this could actually end up excluding other persons who are relatives.  It is out of sync with where we are in society and out of sync even with the tone of the Children and Family Relationships Bill 2015.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 11, and this will be one of the things that is most important for somebody in his or her record, relates to information about persons who may have inquired about someone when he or she was in an institution.  One can imagine looking back and trying to figure out one's own early life, and how important it would be to see a record that said somebody visited or inquired.  I think it is unacceptably narrow.  This is probably one of the clauses I feel most strongly about in the Bill.  I cannot imagine what it is to look at a record and see that somebody called, asked or inquired and not be able to find out who they were.  Three amendments deal with this, namely, amendments Nos. 11, 12 and 13.<\/p><p>The Bill at the moment states, &quot;whether any person, being a parent or other genetic relative of him or her, visited or inquired ...&quot;  Again, perhaps it was not a relative by blood who inquired but another relative or somebody else who was not in that blood or half blood framing.  Amendment No. 11 would insert &ldquo;or any other person&rdquo;.  Maybe it was a teacher who inquired about what happened.  Maybe it was a person who cared or a friend who inquired.  Maybe the person was, in fact, a partner or former partner who may not be a relative, or who may have been a former partner or new partner of a person's mother, for example.  There are lots of people but it is this idea of narrowing.  Why are we narrowing who gets reported in terms of having inquired about or visited a person?  Again, I do not see why that is being narrowed.  The wording of &quot;any person, being a parent or other genetic relative&quot; immediately shrinks what visits or inquiries are reported on.<\/p><p>The next section about which I am concerned is the deletion or replacement of the phrase &quot;but does not include the name of the other person.&quot;  I am suggesting in amendments Nos. 12 and 13 that the Bill either would say, &ldquo;which shall include the name of the other person where that is known,&rdquo; or else just delete the phrase that says, &quot;but does not include the name of the other person.&quot;  Again, this is that same narrow presumption.  A person will get told in that case, even under the Bill as it is, that his or her father or sister called 15 times to the institution to try to inquire, but the person will not be told his or her sister or father's name.  Again, these are not persons who have opted out based on even a no-contact preference.  This does not even reference the no-contact preference in the register.  This basically assumes that somebody who has inquired about a person or visited that person in an institution will not want his or her name shared, and that takes precedence over the person knowing he or she was visited or inquired about, in this case by a parent or genetic relative, or, if I have it in the wider definition, which I feel it should be, any person.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Perhaps it is a lingering from the old version of the legislation that needs to be untangled but given the changes that have taken place in other parts of the legislation and that we are now, as the Minister described it, going with this presumption of information, it seems like an anomaly and a double restriction that is embedded into finding out who cared and who inquired about the person.<\/p><p>I will speak again on the other amendments.

What the Senator is proposing is not necessary.  The information set out in this category gives clear direction to relevant bodies that health and medical information on the applicant can be released.  The tripling or quadrupling down that the Senator is proposing is not necessary.  It is very clear with regard to the release of medical information.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 seek to amend subsection (1) of the definition of \"early life information\".  As currently drafted, the subsection provides for information on whether a genetic relative visited or inquired about the relevant person.  While it includes the degree of relationship, it does not provide for the name of the person visiting.  I do not agree with the proposal to remove the term \"genetic relative\".  Genetic relative is broadly defined in the legislation.  It includes a sibling, an aunt, an uncle or a first cousin, so there is a wide range of family members whose visit to, or inquiring about, the relevant person will be recorded and information about that visit can be released.  It is also important that records of other people visiting can be released under other parts, so records of visits by persons who made arrangements for the child adoption or care arrangements, and there is a very broad interpretation of care arrangements such as social workers or personnel of adoption agencies, can be released under the category of care information, and names can be released there.<\/p> <p>On amendments Nos. 12 and 13, the legislation seeks to allow an adopted person know that he or she was visited and lets the adopted person know the degree of relationship between him or her and the person who visited.  If it was the mother or the father who visited, under the provisions of this legislation those names can be released.  Under the legislation a relevant person is entitled to the name of his or her mother and father.  However, there is a balancing mechanism provided in this section in terms of whether the release of other people's names should be allowed.  What the legislation provides for is to identify that relative's existence and that relative's efforts to ascertain information about the relevant person, and the facility of the tracing mechanisms in this legislation can be used.to confirm that the relative, who is not a mother or father, wishes his or her name to be released to the relevant person.<\/p> <p>Where, for example, a sibling has made an inquiry about a relevant person, the relevant person will be told that somebody who is a sibling made an inquiry about the relevant person and the relevant person can use the tracing mechanism in the legislation and the tracing service will inquire after the sibling.  If the sibling is dead, his or her name can be released to the relevant person.  If the sibling is still alive, the sibling is asked if he or she wants his or her name to be released to the person.  In a situation where we are not referring to a parent, we have provided a means whereby a relevant person is notified of the existence of this person, is notified that this person sought information about him or her and through the tracing system is provided with a mechanism whereby that sibling or relative can give his or her consent to the release of his or her name to the relevant person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#V00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins should speak to the group of amendments if she can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#V00300","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":136,"content":"<p>It is a very large group and they are quite different topics.<\/p> <p>I find the Minister's response unacceptable.  The definition of \"genetic relative\", and the Minister did not address the question, includes full-blood or half-blood relative.  That is not a very wide definition.  I do not understand why there is still this lingering theme of how much it can be shut down.  It is still there in that definition of \"genetic relative\".  It is the sibling, uncle, aunt or first cousin of his or her mother or father.  Is a cousin of the relevant person included, who is clearly related to the person?  That is not clear.  If it is a first cousin of the relevant person or if it is a first cousin who is an adopted first cousin who is not, in fact, a blood relative, are they covered?<\/p> <p>As the Minister pointed out, genetic relative is not simply related to the medical area.  It is being used in defining whether one gets told that somebody inquired.  If a non-blood relative, who is not full-blood or half-blood, inquired, is it not worth informing somebody of that?  The current framing is \"a sibling, uncle, aunt or first-cousin of his or her mother or father, whether the relationship is of the whole blood or half blood\" so it is not a cousin of the relevant person.  That person cannot inquire.  All these things might seem broad in the generality, but when the relevant person is looking at a record and if somebody has inquired about the relevant person, the relevant person perhaps would not be told, if that person was just a cousin, that the cousin had inquired about him or her.  That is how it reads.  One would not be told if another person had inquired.  In fact, under the legislation the relevant person will not even be told if another person who is not related to him or her had inquired, even if the person might have inquired multiple times.  Perhaps the person came 20 times to ask, and that will not be in the records the relevant person will get about his or her early life.  The person might have visited the relevant person ten times and it will not be in the early records.  I do not understand why.  I do not know why we are trying to narrow it down.  That is even leaving aside the releasing of the name.  It is just being told one was visited or inquired about.<\/p> <p>Then there is the Minister's point about these presumptions and the balancing act because there is another provision.  We have been told there is information and tracing.  They are separate.  This is about information.  Frankly, if somebody has inquired about or visited the relevant person, that is information that is relevant to the relevant person.  Under a subject access request, one would be entitled to that information so I do not understand why this is in the Bill.  I ask the House to bear in mind that one of my amendments simply deletes that.  One amendment provides that one shall have the name but another amendment simply deletes what is a legislative prohibition on sharing the name, but does not include the name of the other person.  This is saying that early life information will not include the name of the other person.  If the Minister wants to leave it in a space where it will be determined in a balancing act, then he should simply remove that phrase and let it be determined on the balancing act in respect of each individual query.  I have an amendment with provides that one shall be entitled to it.  If that is too far, the in-between and balancing thing to do is to not have a prohibition and not have a mandatory entitlement.  I have suggested an entitlement and the Bill as it is suggests a prohibition.  I would remove reference to how the name of the other person would be treated altogether.  That is the in-between piece which allows relevant laws, including general data protection regulation, GDPR, laws, to be applied.

We are talking about a balancing test that needs to be applied to the release of other people's names to an individual.  The legislation provides that parents' names will always be released to individuals.  That is essential for their understanding of their identity.  With this legislation we are seeking to vindicate an individual's right to their identity.  It is impossible for someone to know their identity without knowing the name of their mother and father.  It is not impossible for them to know their identity when they do not know the name of a sibling.  That sibling or cousin may have visited many times, as Senator Higgins outlined, but for whatever reason they may not wish their name to be provided to the person involved at this stage in the process.  That is a balance.  Particularly where families have been separated, there needs to be consent on both sides in order for a family reconciliation or some coming together of a family to take place.<\/p><p>This provision gives the relevant person the information that they have a sibling or a cousin.  It gives them the information that that person visited them.  Other provisions of this legislation provide a mechanism whereby if there is agreement on both sides, names can be shared, information can be shared or contact can be maintained.  However, to vindicate the identity rights of the relevant person it is not essential that the name of someone other than their mother or father is provided to them.  We have gone back and forth with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on a number of occasions to ascertain how far we could push this.  We have been told that the existence of another relative and the nature of that relationship can be provided but the name cannot.  However, we have a mechanism through tracing where, with consent, a name can be shared and contact potentially established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#V00600","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I will be frank with the Minister; that is completely wrong.  It is the same argument I had back in 2017 when I listened to the exact same discussions about birth certificates.  I sat in ministerial offices hearing advice from Ministers.  This was back when there was the assumption of a preference for privacy versus identity, with the assumption being made wrongly and, in fact, interfering with private life.  This Bill wrongly assumes that someone who has made inquiries or visited somebody does not want their name released.  It literally legislatively states that the name on that record would not be released at that point.  That was the assumption back in the early iterations of this Bill in the previous Oireachtas which I thought we had moved past.<\/p> <p>I listened to those exact same arguments at that time and we pointed out that it was wrong.  It was found to be wrong and incompatible with GDPR.  Measures needed to be put in place afterwards.  We went through all these issues, as well as the fact that it needs to be treated on an individual case-by-case basis rather than making a blanket assumption.  It is not simply about the right to identity.  That is one part of this but there is also a person's right to personal information and subject access requests, for example.  There is the full spectrum of what that covers.  This is a line in the Bill which is at odds with what people are entitled to.  It also makes assumptions about the other person.  I have enormous respect for the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney General but in this area the advice has often been slow to reflect general data protection regulations.  In respect of this matter, on at least three occasions I have been told things were not possible and it subsequently emerged that they were.<\/p> <p>I will press one of the amendments.  I will not press the deletion amendment.  I urge the Minister to examine that again because I think it is a fundamental mistake and inconsistent with certain rights.  The State is, in fact, prohibiting something.  What if someone visited 20 times and asked for the person to be told they visited or inquired?  Under the Bill they still cannot have that information shared unless they have a letter or other correspondence they submitted, which they may have, but they may have just inquired multiple times and requested it.  They may not have sent in a letter.  People should not need to jump through hoops to find each other.<\/p> <p>With respect, the tracing service is a separate piece.  This relates to information.  It is not solely about identity; that is the birth certificates.  It relates to information.  Somebody visiting a person or inquiring about a person is information relevant to that person.  To prohibit in legislation the name of the visiting person from being released as part of a record of the fact of them having visited the person is not appropriate and is simply wrong.<\/p> <p>I have other matters to deal with because this is a very large grouping.  Amendment No. 56 would delete the words &ldquo;to the extent that it is practicable to do so&rdquo; in respect of providing the relevant person with a copy of the records.  The concern relates to how the term \"practicable to do so\" might be interpreted.  I understand there are established uses of the word \"practicable\", but I would be concerned that this needs to be copper-fastened to ensure that \"practicable to do so\" does not become \"might be quite difficult and would require resources\".  We cannot have someone saying, \"We may not have access to those records and we will have to track them down somewhere because they were put in another location.\"  We need to be clear on how the term &ldquo;to the extent that it is practicable to do so&rdquo; is to be interpreted.  We need to ensure that time or financial resource constraints are not considered sufficient grounds for determining that an action is not practicable.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 57 seeks to insert the words &ldquo;the personal data of the relevant person&rdquo;.  That just gives a slightly wider frame of personal data and puts it in line with the GDPR framework of personal data of the relevant person.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 58 inserts a requirement to \"provide the relevant person with a summary of all relevant records it holds, including information to which the application does not relate, and shall offer to supply the relevant person with the additional records upon request\".  If they require something, they should get the specific thing requested but they should also be told the authority also has records A, B, C, and D.  That would again prompt the person that they have the right to apply for those records.  For example, in certain cases people believed each other to be dead.  A person may be inquiring about something without knowing that they have a sibling who is alive.  We should be letting people know that there are other relevant records.  I am not suggesting that all those records would be released when a single record is requested but that people should be informed that these records exist and they are entitled to them.  When people are making an inquiry, it is fishing in the dark.  They do not always know what questions to ask.  The purpose of the amendment is to avoid a minimalist interpretation and to provide people with the breadcrumbs they might need to seek out additional records.<\/p> <p>Section 11(2)(b) states \"may provide the relevant person with a statement setting out the early life information, care information or incorrect birth registration information to which the application relates\".  Amendment No. 59 proposes that it \"shall\" provide the relevant person with such a statement.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 61 relates to page 22, line 14.

We have a lot of work ahead of us this afternoon.  I will follow on from Senator Higgins's point, especially in respect of amendments Nos. 56 and 57.  In the context of all this, we have to remember there is perhaps not as much information held as we might like to think or wish for.<\/p> <p>I will share some experiences.  As I said to the Minister the other day, I am one of seven children, all from the same mother and father.  I can tell him I have been on this road, as have others.  It is important we do not assume there is a lot of information.  The offices of many institutions were separate from their residential quarters.  They protected themselves, in many ways.  There were constant changes in staff and trustees, who were good and well-meaning people, but many of them thought it was easier to destroy documents.  People told me over the years it was a terrible situation for that particular man or woman, whatever the circumstances were, and it was better to throw the information in the bin and let them get on with their lives, as we all have to get on with our lives.  I do not necessarily agree with that but it was said many times.  Many institutions were run by religious organisations, but there were also ones that were non-religious.  The institution I grew up in was wholly and exclusively run by the Church of Ireland.  It is not all about the Catholic Church.  It was part of the culture at that time that so many documents were destroyed, and we cannot presume there is as much detail in some as others.  That is important.<\/p> <p>In many cases, our mothers and fathers made decisions, for whatever reason, because they carried a certain shame and guilt.  I remember my mother when she was very elderly - I had a great relationship with my parents in the end and I am the youngest of seven - asking me a question not long before she died when she was sick in Tallaght hospital.  She asked me if I had ever got the information I was looking for.  I looked at the woman and thought, \"You don't need to know that.  It would be unfair to revisit it.\"  It was empowering in itself for me to say this woman in her 90s does not need to know.  What struck me, however, was that she carried that throughout her entire life, even though she lived into her 90s.  She was somewhat relieved when I turned around and said I had seen and got all my correspondence, and it was an amazing discovery, but many things were missing too.  I remember thinking about her absolute relief.  Dare I say, in a way that was a gift from me in that I felt I had the right to say that to her and I said \"No\".  I knew then that it was not too late, but it was not necessary.  We had all moved on and we had all come to understand.  Different sets of circumstances played for each and every one of us.  I just wanted to make that point.  Somehow, I thought it strange a woman in her 90s could think that all along.  The fact she thought that was interesting, as was her anxiety.  I wanted to share that emotional connection.<\/p> <p>However, it is also important that people know.  We talked the other day about identity but it is also about belonging.  Who am I?  Who are you?  We all ask these questions.  Some things do not make up.  Every family has a story to tell.  Many a family took in their cousin's daughter or niece, who became sisters, brothers and part of the extended family.  One of the good things about Ireland, and we had many bad problems and hid a lot of issues, was that families were families.  Blood was thicker than water and they rallied around.  It relates to that description of many families being tribal in terms of their heritage and protecting one another, for many reasons, not all of which are right and good.<\/p> <p>I will return to what Senator Higgins said.  It is also important because I know of many cases, on journeys where I have taken people and assisted them in accessing information, where they discovered an aunt who did not marry, took a great interest in them and secretly visited them in an institution.  It should be remembered that children lived in care right up to the 1970s.  In 1961, I went from a mother and baby home to an institution in which I lived until I was 16.  I was not adopted and was not living at home.  I was in State care but there were not ten or 20 of us; there were 40 and 50 people.  Five of these institutions were in D&uacute;n Laoghaire alone.  That is how big it was.  It was a huge organisation.  There were many in the State who held back parents and would not let them in the door.  Remember, the State had a role.  There were many parents who denied to their families these children were in care.  That was the other side of the story, which is important.<\/p> <p>I remember speaking to a fella from a little farm in west Cork.  He was a single person.  It is much harder when someone is single - it is different when there are six or seven siblings - and many years after a long discovery, he got information.  This is very important to the point I am making.  Fifteen birthday cards that had never been opened were in the file.  They had never been given to him or to the institution but were in the headquarters of the institution.  There were some handwritten letters from his mother in the file written on pages that had been torn out of a jotter, a schoolbook she might have bought, and sent in secret to institutions.  She sent &euro;5 every year, knitted a jumper every year and said - I will not mention the man's name - \"I hope you like the jumper.  Boys like blue and green.\"  I thought how real and vivid that was.  She wanted to keep the connection.  She did not give consent for him to be adopted.  She wrote to the adoption society and other people to say maybe she would meet a fella and maybe she would get her son back.  We can understand that.  No two cases are alike, which is important.  When he saw his file, he was angry initially but he said he knew his mother cared for him because she sent birthday cards, she wrote and she gave a little donation, even though she did not have a lot of money, she was not working and she did not have the support of her family.  The treasure of knowing that a woman, his mother, never denied him, spoke about taking him back if circumstances changed, sent the little knitted jumpers and the little birthday cards and did her best, comforted him because he felt that actually she really liked him.  As a result of all that, for a few years, because she did not live for many years after that, he got to know her and built a relationship with her.<\/p> <p>We cling onto everything because of that sense of belonging.  People had brothers, but let us not airbrush uncles, aunts, cousins and people out because sometimes they made an effort to keep in touch.  It is reassuring to look back and say this unravels the story and tells someone a little more about it.  This is about information.  As Senator Higgins rightly said, every opportunity should be given and afforded to people because this is not about identity alone.  It is about that belonging and understanding.  Someone may never meet this person, but he or she might have a little photograph.  I am sure we have seen television programmes such as \"Who Do You Think You Are?\", and when the interviewer asks, \"Would you like to see a photograph of your mother or your father?\", they all light up when they see it.  What does that tell us?  It gives a sense of \"She is like me or not like me\", but they take that photograph away.  It is a prized possession.  It is sometimes out of context, but when people have little, they cling onto it.  It is their lineage, their heritage and their belonging.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>I will finish on that point.  This Bill and legislation is only about tracing, not about redress or anything else.  Let us keep the focus on what it is about.  It is about that sense of connection and belonging.  Let us go the extra mile to empower people, where at all possible.  It is not always right for a mother to say a person cannot have information.  I know mothers who said that and years later thought it was great.  No, sorry.  We talk about child-centred when we talk about young children.  We never cease to be children in some ways.  We all seek affection, love, affirmation and confirmation.  These are bog standard things we all need all of the time throughout all our lives.  If we do not, there is something wrong.  We should support and err on the side of giving more information.  Remember, time is moving on and people are getting older.  This is less of a problem in the 1980s and 1990s.  There was much more progressiveness around childcare in those later days.  I wanted to share that story about clinging on to any sense of connection and belonging.  It is also important because I know people have met a brother or sister they never knew they had, or an aunt or cousin, and have said they now realise that a particular aunt came every second week to see them and that meant so much to them.  They did not know it then, but they know it now and that is important too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#X00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendments Nos. 58 and 59.

We need to be careful that the language in the statute does not promise material that is not there and that cannot be obtained.  We should not be overly prescriptive and we should put in a caveat on expectation to the extent it is practicable to do so.  The term \"shall provide\" puts a mandatory obligation on the provision of something that may not exist or be able to be obtained and in so doing it is reasonable we have a statutory limit on expectations for what can be provided.  This is caring language and that is the right thing to do.  Senator Boyhan began with this point but one of the features in the opening of the mother and baby home report is that there is considerably less information sitting on file than people may think.  The Bill says it \"shall provide\" a person with a statement setting out his or her early life information.  If we use the term \"may\" instead, that does allow for the fact it may be impossible to do so and that there are individuals for whom no information can be provided because the information was devious misinformation.  We have to be careful in our language so that we are ready for that eventuality and so we do not set up an entitlement and expectation that can never be realised or honoured.  I agree with everything else that was said.  I thought that was what the Senator was about to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#X00300","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Senator McGreehan made a point about the genetic relative.  I understand it is relevant in the medical area and in the question of illegal adoptions and that.  There is a purpose to genetic relative in the Bill.  The problem I have is there is no parallel definition of \"relative\" and that it is genetic relative that is applied as the limitation in terms of information on who has enquired.  I have not really heard from the Minister why that limitation is being placed on being told who has enquired about a person.  The Minster mentioned that, separately, those who have made arrangements for a person's adoption are covered but I do not understand why it is being limited to genetic relative in terms of who has enquired about a person.  It may be a neighbour or that person's mother's best friend.  I do not understand why that limitation is there.  I understand genetic relative is relevant in tracking situations where people have been incorrectly or illegally registered or where information has been falsified and it is relevant in the medical area, but I do not know why genetic relative is still the frame in this area.

I agree with her and she has articulated her point well.  I was just touching on some examples but I agree with her that it is about managing that expectation and being responsible.  In time, when this process starts to unravel, we will eventually know the institutions that kept forensic records.  I could tell the Senator 20 of them off the top of my head that could tell you they bought a raincoat for a child in 1956.  Some of them kept amazing records and they nearly made it a business.  They had a lot of people in vocations who did not have a lot to do and they kept impeccable ledgers.  In time, when we unravel institutions and look at many of their archives we will be fascinated when we start to list and set out all of this rich archive.  It is a rich archive because it tells a story with many aspects.<\/p><p>I was able to go to the Department of Education some years ago and source roll books from the Church of Ireland Representative Church Body Library and they were able to dovetail.  In those records they had an X where they identified the children from the local institution, so with a little bit of thinking, there is a lot of information out there.  We were able to cross-reference those roll books with other records when we went to some other churches.  There were some notorious churches in Dublin that <i>en bloc<\/i>christened a lot of these children and gave them different names or changed their names.  Again you will see particular priests and clergy who did this and the same person appeared as the godmother of all of these children.  There are common threads and when they are all pulled together, layers of information can be built.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Seery Kearney because of my experience and I know and keep in contact with many people who grew up in institutions and who grew up with me.  These people have been brought in and handed a little file with three bits of paper on their vaccines and they ask where the other records are only to be told there are none.  We should be honest that many people arrived at the institutions, left a child outside the door, pressed the bell and ran away.  That is a fact whether we like it or not and there is no information to be found in those cases.  There is a process but in time we will see that particular institutions did or did not keep records.  We cannot analyse or say for sure what the motives for that were.  We can suggest or speculate but if the records are not there, they simply are not there.  I agree we have to be careful in how we handle that and in how we manage that expectation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#Y00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their contributions.

Before I speak to amendments Nos. 56 to 61, inclusive, I want to say that Senator Boyhan is right to remind us all that, once this legislation is passed and operational and once adopted people are using its provisions, there are people who will be deeply disappointed because the information simply is not there.  The Senator is right we have to be wary of raising expectations and the Senator knows far better than I do because of the many people he has spoken to who have done the journey and who have got so little information or none at all.  We have to be cognisant of that fact.  The Senator spoke eloquently about an example where the finding of items has been of such value to an individual in filling in a blank and providing knowledge of having been loved, cared for and thought of at all times.  Everything the Senator spoke of there is provided for in this Bill.  Those letters, jumpers and everything like that would be provided for under this legislation.<\/p> <p>I refer to the issue of the release of the name when the name is not the name of the parents.  I am happy to go back to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and discuss this further.  I want to make it clear we have done that and that this provision has been discussed at length in trying to make broad provision.  That is where we are and we are happy to go back there again.  What is in this Bill is not a result of not considering this issue and I want to make that clear to all Senators.<\/p> <p>I will talk specifically to the last set of amendments.  Amendment No. 56 seeks to remove the term \"to the extent that it is practicable\".  This is a term that is used in legislation and it means as soon as possible.  It is reasonable to include this term but it is important to remember that, on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, I brought in amendments that set timelines for relevant bodies to provide records within one month, which is comparable to the timeline provided for subject access requests, and those were Government amendments on the timeline.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 57 seeks to replace the categories of information with the term \"personal data\".  The current construction of the Bill provides for the full release of information and records to a relevant person and more than they would receive under a subject access request and with a guarantee of release.  Amendment No. 58 places an obligation on relevant bodies to provide \"a summary of all relevant records it holds, including information to which the application does not relate\".  This amendment is unnecessary as relevant bodies will already be providing a supporting statement.  I refer again to the ministerial guidelines that will be brought forward and that will stipulate that an enabling approach should be taken, whereby bodies should release any information over and above the categories of information set out in the Bill, except when they would be prohibited by law from doing so.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 59 seeks to make it an obligation for a relevant body to provide a statement alongside the records.  In almost all cases a statement will be provided and the ministerial guidelines will promote the provision of a statement.  There may be certain circumstances in which a statement is not necessary and Senator Seery Kearney spoke to such situations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If an applicant applies to the General Register Office to receive their birth certificate but nothing else, a statement is not necessary because the birth certificate is the birth certificate and in all circumstances speaks for itself.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 61, the Bill is placing obligations on relevant bodies to provide a summary of all relevant records it holds, including information to which the application does not relate.

The ministerial guidelines are promoting the use of that statement.  I believe that in the vast majority of cases, a statement will be provided but it is not necessary in all circumstances.

It has been long established that the State has been aware of illegal adoptions and yet this fact is not reflected in the drafting of the Bill.

The amendment is extensive and cuts to the very core of many of the issues with this legislation.  I do not know how we can justify calling it \"incorrect\" rather than \"illegal\".<\/p> <p>I will share an experience.  I met a family last weekend.  There were six children, all of whom were illegally adopted from thet institution the Minister has spoken about at great length.  It is one of the institutions about which we have the most information.  Two of the children, two boys, were eight weeks apart in birth.  When the adoptive parents came to pick up one of the boys and saw another one, a nun said, \"You might as well take him too\", and they did.  They stalled his birthday for one year to bring him into line with their designer family.  All of those children had everything in terms of material provision.  They lived in a lovely home.  They were put on display and dragged to the front of the church every Sunday.  The family were much admired by the congregation for their kind work in adopting these children.<\/p> <p>However, it became clear after a short period of time that the children developed at different levels.  None of the children were connected by blood; they were not related by blood.  Those two boys joined the other members of that family.  There was a certain amount of social engineering involved to reflect what the adoptive parents thought was right and correct for this family.  Some of the children excelled academically and others did not do so well.  They all went to the best private schools in this State.  They were one of the wealthiest families in the State.  They were assisted by the particular adoption society and guild.  They were fitted out with Catholic certificates and baptismal certificates, and the State was fully aware of it.  These people were in a powerful position within this State and it was not uncommon for politicians to sit at their table on a Friday or Saturday night and play cards.  The children were brought in to entertain the politicians.  I am completely satisfied as to the truth of the story.  I know the people involved, who are personal friends of mine.   How can we square all of that?  <\/p> <p>One of the children, at the age of 14, approached the mother and asked who they were and where they belonged.  The mother gave them a slap across the face and told them not to ask questions and not to be ungrateful.  That is the reality of it.  They had access to the best of the material world.  They went to the best schools.  Some of them struggled and some of them excelled.  <\/p> <p>Returning to the core issue, all of these children say they were not facilitated by the agency.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->All of them say they were not facilitated by the agency.  Two of them arrived at the door of the agency, but they were not facilitated in any way.  They were told that they were the most ungrateful brats in terms of the good care and the good family that had worked for them and supported them.  This is not uncommon.  I was telling them about the proposed legislation the other day.  Some of them do not talk about it very much.  Others verbalise a lot about it.  I asked them what the biggest issue is for them.  Two or three of them do not have passports.  They have never engaged with the State.  Two or three of them have never paid a penny to Revenue.  They worked illegally on the black market.  They are the sort of realities.  They are paranoid about the State and the systems, and they do not have a sense of identity.<\/p><p>I am not going to lay the blame for all of that on anyone, because that would not be the right thing to do, but one of the recurring themes is that they say they were illegally adopted and they want that to be acknowledged.  It was facilitated by the church and the State.  I asked them what they would ask for if they could ask for one thing.  If possible, they want to be connected to their families.  The families may not even want to be connected with them.  That is the reality of it and they are aware of that.  They want it acknowledged by the State that the State was fully aware of it.  For the past 30 years they have been banging on State agency doors telling them about it, and they have not had a lot of help or support.  The word \"illegal\" as opposed to \"incorrect\" is important for these people.  While it is only a word, it is very fundamental.  It is very important, and it goes to the very core of this legislation.<\/p><p>I can attempt to suggest why the Government is resisting the use of the word \"illegal\" over \"incorrect\".  Is it that there is potential litigation down the road?  So be it, if there is.  I do not have an answer.  We know that drug trials were carried out on the kids in institutions and we know the State had reasons there.  I am not going to go into that right now.  If possible, could the Minister outline in two or three sentences what advice he has received about the option of using the word \"incorrect\" as opposed to \"illegal\"?  That is very important for these people, and they need to understand it.  How can we stand in Parliament and somehow agree to water down the impact of illegality?  If it is illegal, it is illegal.  Who gave consent?  We can argue there was not a regulatory framework in place, but we now have an opportunity to address this issue.  I would like to hear from the Minister what the advice is around all of that, because it is perhaps the most important aspect of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#Z01900","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Earlier in this debate, on Second Stage, the Minister began with an apology, in part, in respect of illegal adoptions.  We have been speaking about these illegal adoptions but there is no reference anywhere in the Bill to \"illegal\".  As Senator Boyhan says, it was illegal and to put in \"incorrect\" is insufficient.  It simply does not cover everything and \"incorrect\" is not an umbrella under which \"illegal\" can fit.  It is a different thing.  It is giving an excuse and providing a new frame, which is \"incorrect\", that can be applied even to situations where we know the extent to which this was absolutely 100% intentionally done.<\/p> <p>These are not situations where people are tiredly putting down a wrong detail or a wrong piece of information.  These are situations in which we have intentional situations of deceit, where there is straight-up false information, which is different from \"incorrect\" as well, even leaving aside the illegal issue.  That is not covered by the reference to \"incorrect\", which is a soft framing.  There may be situations where there are incorrect records, but to somehow amalgamate false and illegal birth registrations under that same heading does not work.  If it is not possible to amalgamate them under that, the question is why illegality is not specifically being identified.<\/p> <p>There are two different approaches.  There is a large volume of amendments.  The amendments from Senator Warfield and others are trying to give a definition in respect of illegal adoption.  They are looking to insert a specific reference to the personal data of a relevant person whose birth was illegally registered.  In the case of my amendments, I primarily attached \"or illegal\" after \"incorrect\" so it would read \"incorrect or illegal\".<\/p> <p>The question of \"or illegal\" arises throughout the Bill.  It is in multiple places.  \"Incorrect\" is used consistently throughout.  It embeds a framing which is woefully inadequate for a large number of cases where we know that birth registration and other information has been intentionally and illegally falsified.  The use of \"incorrect\" is a get-out clause.  I do not mind the word being in the Bill.  Some of the amendments suggest the removal of all references to \"incorrect\".  I do not mind \"incorrect\" being there, but it needs to have \"illegal\" placed alongside it.  That is very important because, as Senator Boyhan says, many of the illegal registrations are known about and that has been the case for a long period without being properly pursued.<\/p> <p>We had the sampling exercises to see how widespread it was.  I acknowledge journalists like Conall &Oacute; F&aacute;tharta, who has been exposing these issues for years.  It is not appropriate that the State would suggest that we have learned, we are apologising, and we recognise that these terrible things have happened and then have a Bill that explicitly does not include recognition of the fact of illegal birth registrations, and does not include that in the conversation about how people can access their relevant information.<\/p> <p>I join with Senator Boyhan in asking if there is a reason it is not being inserted.  We need to know why.  If that reason is we are concerned that people will be afraid that they may implicate themselves on having committed a crime, then we can put caveats in around offences relating to the destruction of records that may relate to a crime.  What we should not do is give an indirect implication of some kind of half indemnity or immunity by saying we will just treat the information as \"incorrect\" if it is given over to us.  I know that is probably not the intention, but I worry that it could be the effect of how this is framed in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#AA00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I disagree with the amendments for the following reasons.  In the apology the Minister gave to those affected, in this House, I did speak about the fact that illegality has an implication of criminality and that there needs to be a mechanism for assessment of that.  On that basis, and following other discussions I have had around this, when the file is reviewed by the specialist entities that are being put in place on foot of the recommendations of Conor O'Mahony and the response to that, which is to implement his recommendations, at that point an assessment could be made as to whether to refer this to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Garda for a criminal complaint.  The issue then is who is the complainant.  Is there a statutory footing?  Is it a common law offence or a statutory offence?  It has been illegal since 1874 to register adoptions in this country.  It is not that there is not a provision in law for it and we suddenly need to create it.  It has been there for more than a century.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to have a mechanism in place.  In establishing the specialist tracing entity to look out for this, we will be putting specialists in place, which is one of the recommendations taken up by the Minister and now being implemented.  This will provide a pathway to potential criminal proceedings, if necessary.  The report of Conor O'Mahony, whom I hold in great regard, also makes a recommendation with regard to the possibility of a State inquiry into illegal adoptions.  That is still on the table for consideration at some point but we need to get a birth information and tracing system in place and in action.  <\/p><p>I do not agree with the characterisation of every misrepresentative or erroneous entry as being illegal.  In these provisions, we need to make sure the bar is that an entry is incorrect because we need to have a statutory response to that.  If people have got married, signed a mortgage or done a whole heap of other things in a name that is not their own and in an identity they believed to be theirs but which is not, a statutory response to that with regard to succession is required.  Parts 8 and 9 of this Bill are a specific bespoke response to that issue so to say that these people have no rights under the Bill is blatantly untrue.  There are two whole parts of the Bill that specifically address these issues and needs.<\/p><p>We need to consider where this is going.  Who gets prosecuted?  There is an issue with the Statute of Limitations.  In other arenas where there have been long-running historical instances of abuse, we have managed to overcome that issue so it could potentially be overcome again.  Post the case of the Cloyne diocese, we can deal with matters like that.  Prosecution requires a criminal act but also a criminal intention.  While the entities and homes had criminal intent, not every parent did.  I know of an instance of the public health nurse showing up at the door of a house and telling a fantastic lady that she would make a fantastic mother.  The woman assumed everything flowed from that and she loved those two children, who are her sons as far as she is concerned.  How do we start prosecuting these cases?  That needs careful consideration.  I would rather that was done following an inquiry in which all of these matters were addressed.<\/p><p>Putting the word \"illegal\" into this Bill may address some of the anger and some of the needs but we must come back to what the Minister said in his speech last week.  The response must be real and in-depth and must consider all of the ramifications, one of which might be that parents are prosecuted.  How do you prove that parents had criminal intentions?  There are individuals who do not want their parents caught up in this.  This Bill puts in place a mechanism in place whereby files are reviewed along with birth information and tracing services and specialists.  All of that is here and will be in existence as soon as we pass the Bill into law.  If we have specialists in place who can refer files onward, a pattern will emerge just as it did with St. Patrick's Guild, where a particular marker was found.  Some things are recurrent.  In the case of files being referred, it is more appropriate to start with a threshold of incorrectness and a mechanism to address everything that flows from an incorrect entry.  We know that there is a criminal statute and that this is an offence so we have a mechanism to refer cases for prosecution where appropriate but in many instances it is not appropriate.  What is appropriate is to have a response to everything that flows from it.  <\/p><p>While I understand why the amendment is being proposed, I do not support it.  It is too dramatic and may potentially catch cases where mistakes were made.  Not everybody is as fastidious as those cited by Senator Boyhan.  Some are downright careless.  Some of these entries were simple mistakes.  Where these incorrect entries were criminally minded and on the level of an enterprise, there is a mechanism in the Bill to address that.  I believe that is sufficient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#AA00300","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Following on from Senator Seery Kearney's comments, including the term \"illegal\" in the legislation would set a really high bar.

This would exclude an awful lot of the people involved because so many of those illegally registered were not the subject of an adoption order.  They were never adopted.  If we put in this amendment regarding illegal adoption, we would be excluding these people because an adoption did not happen.  These people were not adopted.  They were illegally registered.  It would be misguided to accept this amendment and to include the term \"illegal adoption\".  There were many possible reasons for illegal adoptions.  They may have involved coercion or otherwise been carried out without consent but adoption orders were completed so they are considered adoptions.  This amendment would conflate two different things: adoptions that were possibly illegal and illegal registrations.  It is very important to clarify that these two things are separate.

These are all things that should be considered but, to be clear, it is not simply a question of whether there should be prosecutions for everything.  That is a separate conversation.  The problem with the Bill as it stands is that access to anything it provides and people's route to any of the entitlements under it is constrained.  To give one example, the Bill refers to a person who has \"reasonable grounds for suspecting that he or she is, the subject of an incorrect birth registration\".  There is no provision for access to these things.  People must say that they were incorrectly registered.  That is their route in.  Leaving aside the questions of the term \"illegal\", parents, who did what and the investigations, it is a matter of people effectively having to describe what happened to them as incorrect registration in order to access information on birth and early life and to get their records released.

It is relevant to those who have been affected by the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild investigations, for example.  For such a person, maybe his or her registration is in fact being investigated or is recognised as being illegal.  Is the Minister suggesting that this is encompassed by the references to \"incorrect\" and \"false or misleading\"?  Is he saying that the word \"incorrect\" fully encompasses &ldquo;\"illegal\"?  If \"incorrect\" encompasses \"illegal\", why not include with the consideration of the word \"incorrect\" not just \"false or misleading\" but also \"illegal\"?  Why not specify the word \"illegal\"?  I say this because there is a muddying of the waters where this \"incorrect\" frame is applied.<\/p> <p>A person who was illegally adopted will have to say that he or she was subject to an \"incorrect\" adoption.  It may be that it was \"false or misleading\", but if such a person suspects or knows that he or she was illegally adopted, he or she should not have to describe what happened to him or her in a way that does not reflect what happened to him or her.

I think that is important.<\/p> <p>We need to be careful here.  We are legislators and we are dealing with this Bill, but there are many hundreds of people listening in, looking in and reading the transcripts of what we are saying here today.  I am conscious of that.  This is particularly the case for an issue like this, which will be documented and will be covered in the national press and in all various forms of social media.  Let us be clear about the message we are giving here.  I cited the case of the children of a particular family, all of whom said it was illegal.  They are the people who matter.  They are the ones who have lived this life.  They are the ones who have had issues. <\/p> <p>I wish to focus on amendment No. 14, which provides that \"\"illegal adoption\" means an illegal adoption\".  That is pretty logical.  I understand that the Government has a job to do.  The Minister is putting his best foot forward in terms of his legislation.  It is the Government&rsquo;s Bill.  I will not be critical of it because I think there is a huge amount of positivity in it.  I would like to be in a position to support this Bill.  I want to put that on the record.  I want to be in a position to support this Bill.  I think the Minister has taken responsibility and has led on what has been a very difficult issue, as I said at the outset.  This is one of a suite of different measures regarding people in institutional care, issues around the family, issues relating to people who were outside the family and inside the family and issues around childcare.  The Minister is hugely committed to the Bill, as are his officials.  I thank his officials for being today, as well as all the officials who have supported him around this.<\/p> <p>I am saying I do not think that we are that far off.  However, this is also about empathy and about sending a message that we understand what people have experienced.  People are saying to me that there was illegality around the issues.<\/p> <p>I would like to read some of the lines from the amendment before the House, which seeks to define \"illegal adoption\".  It refers to circumstances in which \"a non-marital child was registered as the natural child of the adoptive parents without the mother&rsquo;s knowledge or consent and no adoption order was made\".  That is simple and logical.  It is in English here in front of us.  The amendment also refers to circumstances in which \"a non-marital child was registered as the natural child of the adoptive parents and an adoption order was made\".  It also refers to circumstances in which a \"child over a year old was sent overseas for adoption without the consent and knowledge of the mother\".  They are illegal acts.  I do not think we should get hung up on it.  They happened; they are illegal.  I cannot understand why there is an issue with this.  What is the downside of including the word \"illegal\" in the legislation?  Could somebody explain that?  I know the Minister will come back in.  He will have an opportunity to explain this.  I am speaking about what I am picking up. <\/p> <p>I want to acknowledge the work of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  It has engaged extensively with all of us here on this issue.  It has made some really strong points on this particular issue.  I believe that this is the core.  This is one of the core issues around this legislation.  It is a fact that people had unfettered access into institutions and - I might add - into families.  There were illegal - you can call it what you like, but they were illegal - arrangements made.  They were supported by different faiths and different churches in terms of baptismal certificates, name changes and the falsification of documents that were required later in the State.  There were many layers of people who were complicit in this illegality.<\/p> <p>I am not in the business of laying blame with anyone at this point, but I am in the business of trying to equip people to understand what happened and empathising with them.  It was an illegal act.  It should not have happened.  That is what we have to acknowledge.  What would any of us in this House have to fear by accepting and acknowledging that it was illegal?  It should not have happened.  I understand the reasons it happened.  These were different sets of circumstances, different times and different taboos.  The Chair spoke recently about the issue of great shame, stigma and taboo.  People did not know how to handle the situation.  I am not going to try to apply today&rsquo;s standards and understandings in retrospect to these issues as they arose in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.<\/p> <p>I believe that this Bill is going to start to unravel many of these issues.  I do not think it is as complicated as some of us think, as I said earlier.  I do not think there is as much information out there as people might think there is.  I know where the Minister is coming from, but this issue of illegality is critical, and is one we have to grasp and acknowledge.  It happened.  It should not have happened, and it was illegal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#CC00500","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I would like to speak about the issue of illegality.

Indeed, I would be nervous about being overly-prescriptive about it because anything up to 20,000 people may have been affected.

As we get in to the tracing aspect of this and as the provisions of this Bill come to life and into effect, we need to leave it open-ended and the terminology within the Bill already allows for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#DD00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I wish to speak to amendment No.17.

The aim is to ensure that people's medical information is considered their personal data and that they have a fundamental right to access, not just the information contained in a record but the record itself.  This has been addressed by the Minister.  He has spoken about the fact that there is an effort to provide the original records.

I will seek to address all that was said.  First, I wish to respond to Senator Warfield's comment that some people who are illegally adopted have no rights under this Bill.  As Senator Seery Kearney said, that is just wrong.  The very centre of Parts 8 and 9 is about dealing with the situation of those who were the subject of illegal birth registrations.  I need to put that on the record of the House.<\/p> <p>I want to talk about the terminology we are using.  The terms \"illegal adoption\" and \"illegal birth registration\" are being used a lot.  I have always used the term \"illegal birth registration\" to deal with the situation of those who were in St. Patrick's Guild and to deal with those we suspect were in a similar situation.  I say \"illegal birth registration\" because there the issue is the changing of the names but there are other ways in which an adoption could be illegal.  There could be issues around consent, for example.  There are other reasons and what Parts 8 and 9 are trying to deal with is the issue of illegal birth registration, so that is the term I am going to use.  That is why I am very concerned about bringing in the term \"illegal adoption\" because in the case of the St. Patrick's Guild cases, adoptions did not occur.  Adoptions did not occur so it is not correct to say \"illegal adoption\".  They were never adoptions as recognised by Irish law.  That is why all of those individuals, the people who joined us here in the Public Gallery last week, have so many questions, not just on identity but basic legal questions with which they must struggle and that is what we are seeking to address in this legislation.  <\/p> <p>Whereas I may disagree about the use of the terms \"illegal adoption\" or \"illegal birth registration\", there has never been any disagreement from me on the question of illegality.  Senator McGreehan helpfully pointed out that when I spoke and gave the apology on behalf of the Government last week, I used the term \"illegal\" 44 times in my speech.  There has never been any question for me as Minister, or for this Government, that this was an illegal act that was undertaken and an illegal act that has had enormous consequences for the individuals affected.  I hope the actions we have taken reflect this.  I include here the actions of my predecessor, the former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr. Zappone, who set up an independent review following the discovery of the St. Patrick's Guild files.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I published the review following the publication of the commission's report, but I felt that was not enough.  I felt it was a good piece of work but there were no firm conclusions, so I looked for a further piece of work specifically on the issue of illegal birth registration.  I asked the special rapporteur to conduct a piece of work.  He did and acted very rapidly.  He gave some detailed recommendations and I took a bit of time to consider those.  He brought forward 17 recommendations and many of them are being implemented in this legislation.  He also brought forward the recommendation of the apology, which I implemented.  He has brought forward some other recommendations, one of which, as Senator Seery Kearney referenced, is still being considered.<\/p><p>I have spoken in both Houses many times on the issue of legacy and I have always used the term \"illegal birth registration\", recognising the illegality that took place in those situations.  What is at question in this Bill and the section we are talking about today is not the question of illegality.  The question of whether these registrations were illegal is not at question.  There is legislation, as Senator Seery Kearney has referred to, that clearly shows that what happened in these situations was illegal.  We are not questioning the legality or otherwise of what happened.  What we are doing is providing a mechanism for people to access the provisions of this legislation, and primarily the provisions that will allow them get the information to confirm or finally clarify those questions as to whether the registration of their birth was illegal.  That is the issue that we are trying to address.<\/p><p>The law we are bringing forward is to allow people access information, but particularly for those where it is shown a birth registration was illegal, it allows the rectification of their legal issues in terms of succession, the confirmation of contracts and their relationship with the family they were raised with and whom many believe were their birth parents.  That is what we are trying to do here.  That is the question we seek to address.  It is for that reason I believe the definition of \"illegal adoption\" being proposed here is unnecessary because those who need to use this legislation and who need the benefits of it are already covered within the existing definitions.  They are covered within the existing definition of either an \"adopted person\" or \"incorrect birth registration\" and I will come back to our understanding of that.  I have heard, and throughout this process I have heard, the concern about illegality, and that is why we made that change to the definition of incorrect birth information.  We have included a specific reference that it is as the result of the giving of information that was false or misleading.  This legislation recognises the falsity.  It recognises that misleading information was provided.  That is explicit.  It is referenced twice in the legislation.  It is referenced in the definitions in section 2 and in section 54.  The falsity is clearly recognised within the text of this Bill.<\/p><p>In terms of the definition and the approach we take, and again recognising we want as many people as possible who have questions, who do not have any certainty as to whether an illegal act took place but who have questions, to be enabled to access the provisions of this Bill.  That is why we have the concern about the use of the term \"illegal\" or \"illegal adoption\".  To include the term \"illegal\" rather than \"incorrect\" would require an additional criteria of illegality to be met.  That would be such to establish that an illegal act lay behind the making of the registration.  It would have to define what the illegal act was and, indeed, who perpetrated that particular act.  It may be much more difficult to establish illegality or that an illegal act had occurred resulting in a false registration rather than establishing only that an incorrect registration had occurred, and that is because of the very secretive nature of the practices that we are doing here.  I have gone back and forth with officials on this issue because it was in pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, and it was brought up on both Committee and Report Stages.  This issue has been teased out extensively with officials.  They came back with the addition of the term \"false and misleading\" to ensure the falsity of what happened is recorded within the framework of this legislation.  They were not able to provide me with an alternative that would not involve the restriction of the people who could use this particular legislation, and that is what I do not want to see.  I do not want to see us putting language or terminology in the Bill that is not going to change the illegality of what happened, because its illegality has already been made clear from existing legislation, but could potentially lessen the pool of people who can use the provisions of this legislation.  People need to be able to use this legislation because not only does it give them information but it also provides legal avenues to address very real problems and challenges they face as a result of finding out they were subject to an illegal birth registration.  They are real challenges they have spoken about in Oireachtas committees and, indeed, in their engagement with many Senators directly.  It is for that reason I believe the changes we made in the D&aacute;il, the addition of the term \"false and misleading\", which recognises the falsity of what happened but also ensures there is a wide definition that people can use to avail of the provisions of this legislation, is the best way forward, notwithstanding the fact that I and the Government have always recognised, and recognised on the floor of this House and in the text of the apology provided, the illegal nature of these birth registrations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#DD00500","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I would like if the Minister would address my amendments.

The Minister has set out clearly some of the issues.  However, Senator Higgins has made a point for inserting the term \"or illegal\" as part of it as opposed to \"incorrect\", because for many people it was illegal.  The Minister has confirmed it was illegal in terms of birth registrations, and that is the message.  It is about language and about words, and we always know it is, and people hang on every word, especially in the circumstances around this.  There is a bit of a job for us all to communicate that issue around illegal birth registrations.  I am thinking as I am going down to tea today of ringing up my colleagues - the family that I mentioned - who I know are listening to this debate and asking them if they are any wiser in terms of the issue of adoption as opposed to the illegal birth registration.  Remember that organisations and institutions in this State facilitated that illegal birth registration.  Even emphasising that in some way helps them to understand.  That is important.

I, too, welcome this opportunity, which is longer perhaps in this House than the Committee Stage was in the other House.  It is useful to tease through the issues.<\/p> <p>Specifically on Senator Higgins's point on using the word \"or\", I confirm that I specifically raised the issue of looking at \"or\" rather than having a pure substitution.  Again, having engaged with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, it has not been possible to achieve what the Senator spoke about, that is, using the words \"incorrect or illegal\", in a way that is legally sound and that would not require the State to set the standard of illegality and burden of proof, even were we to use the phrase \"incorrect or illegal\".  Since we were not able to find a way to do that, I looked for other mechanisms and that is the reason the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel came back with the insertion of the term \"false or misleading\".  As I said, that term recognises the falsehood but in a way that does not risk excluding people from being able to use the provisions of this legislation.  I believe it recognises that point.  It keeps the definition of who can use these legislative provisions broad, which is the key point on which we are all in agreement.<\/p> <p>None of that takes away from the very clear acknowledgment made in the apology, in the discussions on this Bill and in other debates related to legacy in both Houses, in the wider Government response to Professor O'Mahony's report and in the very real actions we are taking both in setting up a specialist tracing service in Tusla and making changes in this legislation that provide a much better legal basis for tracing where there is a suspected legal birth registration.  I believe all those actions demonstrate the very real recognition by the State of the illegality of what happened.

I still have concerns.<\/p> <p>I am speaking not in terms of consequence or prosecution but in terms of access points again.  It is that same issue of access points.  The fact is that somebody seeking to use this Bill will be describing a birth registration in relation to them, which may have been illegal, as incorrect with false or misleading information.  That is how they will be describing it and how they will need to describe it in terms of accessing what is in the Bill.  It will not be open to them to describe it as illegal adoption.  This is about having an additional access point for those who, as I said, believe or know they have been subject to an illegal adoption.  That additional access point might be true for somebody.  That is what I was saying.<\/p> <p>The fact is that when the Minister, whose understanding is that this was illegal, and his Government are gone, the legislation and how people describe the birth registration, and the Minister is right to frame it as birth registration rather than adoption, will be as an incorrect birth registration.

There are many things on the record but it is a great gap in the Bill that \"unlawful or illegal\" is not recognised.  I worry that we will have multiple instances arising from this legislation where things that may have been illegal will be described as incorrect.  One could maybe say separately they may be pursued as illegal and all of that, but they will have been described in a way that is inadequate and untrue.  That is why I will not press many of these amendments but I am going to have to press a couple of them because I cannot in good conscience let the Bill go through without attempt to have illegality become one of the ways in which people are able to describe their experience in terms of accessing their rights under this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#FF00300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I absolutely accept the sincerity in which all these amendments are offered.

Phrasing it as \"may\", leaves open the possibility of \"may not\".  That is the concern. <\/p> <p>The Minister has inserted time clauses elsewhere in the legislation so amendment No. 64 is another attempt to copper-fasten expedience in the provision of information.  The way it is framed at the moment, information will be provided only where it relates to the application and where the body is satisfied with regard to the guidelines.  With that framing, there could be a process where the body needs to satisfy itself of these things.  It has a presumption of it being difficult.  It frames it as going through these hoops before giving the information.  These could end up being lengthy processes which constitute a bottleneck or delay for people accessing their rights.<\/p> <p>I will let the Minister reply while I check my notes on amendment No. 65.  This is Senator Ruane's amendment and I am speaking on her behalf so I just want to make sure I am faithful to her note on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#KK00300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":215,"content":"<p>We discussed a similar issue earlier.  Amendment No. 55 seeks to amend the definition of \"early life information\" from what it currently is, \"information on any medical treatments, procedures or vaccinations administered to him or her\", to read \"medical information, including information on any medical treatments, procedures or vaccinations administered to him or her\".  I cannot support this amendment.  Examples that are provided for under this subsection of the definition of \"early life information\" are clearly medically related but they are not restricted solely to that information.  In addition, medical information is covered as an entirely separate category of information available for release.  The categories of information were purposely drafted to be as broad and as encompassing as possible, with overlap in several places, including medical information.  I cannot accept this amendment as to do so could restrict the examples of information that may be made available under this definition.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 62 and 63 would replace \"may\" with \"shall\" in relation to the provision for release of a statement setting out the medical information.  The statement released alongside the medical records is a flexible provision to allow the authority to accompany records with as much or as little additional information as is required to contextualise the information given.  I do not believe this amendment is necessary.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 64 would delete the phrase \"to which the application relates only\" and insert \"without delay\".  I cannot accept this amendment.  It is similar to some that were introduced in the D&aacute;il, which also sought to compel bodies to release records that the applicants did not ask for.  My response is the same as it was then.  I believe it is appropriate for people to have full agency in what they apply for and receive.  This legislation seeks to empower relevant persons to have control over what information they choose to access and as such I would not support this amendment as I think it would undermine that process.  If a person wishes to seek all the information that is available, it will be as simple as ticking a box on the application form.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#KK00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":216,"content":"<p>On amendment No. 55, what the Minister described is a previous amendment of mine, where I sought to include and name medical information within the definition of \"early life information\".

As the Minister has said, he has chosen to list medical information separately in the definitions and it is not encompassed within the definitions of either \"care information\" or \"early life information\".

Section 15 deals with medical information, so the matter is dealt with separately to section 11.  It is important that the adoptive parent of a child be able to apply for information on behalf of that child.  Many adoptive parents have been supportive of, and advocates for, their children in accessing the relevant information.  This is what amendment No. 65 addresses.  It reads: &quot;The adoptive parent of a child who has not attained the age of 16 years may apply in writing to the Authority for the provision by it to him or her of medical information&quot;.  This could be significant and relevant medical information for health decisions in respect of that child.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 66 is another instance where I seek to substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;.

It seeks to alter the process through which the release of third-party medical information is provided.  This issue is one that was subject to detailed consultations between us, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Data Protection Commission.  Throughout my time in this role and in my engagements in the lead-up to the drafting of this legislation, I have always recognised that access to the medical history of someone&rsquo;s family at birth is an important issue to many adopted people, but the release of other people&rsquo;s information &ndash; third parties&rsquo; information &ndash; has to be surrounded with safeguards.<\/p> <p>It is important to recognise that, under this legislation, there are mechanisms to secure a route to access information held by parents who gave their children up for adoption.  Adoptive parents can undertake a trace to request information on behalf of their children, make an entry on the register to request information on behalf of their children, and apply for a provided item on behalf of their children.  Therefore, the Bill allows opportunities for adoptive parents to seek and be provided with that contemporaneous medical information on behalf of their children.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 66 and 67 replace &ldquo;may&rdquo; with &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I have been clear on this, in that an open approach to the provision of information will be taken in respect of this Bill.

As such, I do not believe the proposed changes are necessary.<\/p> <p>Turning to amendment No. 55, I take the Senator&rsquo;s point.  I was responding to a slightly separate earlier amendment from her.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that access to medical information is sufficiently covered under section 15, which is titled, &ldquo;Relevant body or Authority to provide medical information relating to relevant person on application by relevant person&rdquo;.

We know, and it is a fact, that these drug trials took place.  They were the subject of a very comprehensive statement by the Taoiseach when he was the Minister for Health and Children all those years ago.  He came to both Houses for exhaustive engagement and statements.  He raised similar issues of concern and engaged Dr. Jim Kiely, who was the Chief Medical Officer at the time, to carry out some random samples.  Bessborough was one of five institutions involved in the test case but there were many others.  The scope of the inquiry was subject to litigation.  It was found to be <i>ultra vires<\/i>, partly because it was tied in with the Ms Justice Mary Laffoy commission.  It went on extensively and there were various inquiries in relation to it.<br\/><br\/>We know also that there was extensive documentation under discovery relating to the carrying out of these drug trials in institutions, including the one I lived in.  I want to acknowledge that on the record of the House.  GlaxoSmithKline wrote to a number of people, including me, to ask if we would like to avail of the idea of documentation.  That is an ongoing process which I am not at liberty to discuss in any great detail in the House.  It is not the only company involved.  Having met many people involved in this matter on the journey they have taken, I am now 100% satisfied, as was the then Minister and then Chief Medical Officer, that vaccine trials took place on children in care.  Who was acting <i>in loco parentis<\/i>is still questionable, but it happened.  We secured some legal advice.  The issue of bodily integrity is critical in the context of our constitutional rights.<br\/><br\/>There is a load of issues around this.  I do not want to deviate too much but I will say that the people who were held in State institutions for whatever reason should have a right of access.  From the engagement with a number of drug companies, we know they have substantial information.  To be fair, they are co-operating in some respects.  Under the motion for discovery related to the State's tribunal into these issues, which ran into the sand in the end, we know there was very substantial confirmation as to the nature and level of use of vaccines on these children.  It is very interesting to see reference to vaccines in various proposals and amendments to the legislation.  I just want to keep my focus on that.<br\/><br\/>It is important to acknowledge that a lot of people have struggled to get this information.  From my experience and from talking to other people involved in this, I know they approached institutions and were told the institutions did not have information.  When people started to initiate legal proceedings, these institutions were suddenly more forthcoming in confirming they were involved in the trials.  I spoke with three people who were involved, one of whom was my GP with whom I retained a great friendship until he passed on some years ago.  I also spoke with two of the eminent professors based at UCD who were involved in these trials.  The trials were the subject of extensive coverage on &quot;Today Tonight&quot; and &quot;Prime Time&quot;.  I met people directly involved in these drug trials and in their co-ordination who were based in UCD.  There is a lot of information about this.  I want to acknowledge the Taoiseach in particular.  Little did I think I would become a Member of this House and little did he think when he was the Minister for Health and Children that he would become the Taoiseach.  There was a commitment, an engagement and an understanding by all sides in both Houses that we would get to the bottom of this issue.<br\/><br\/>The amendments deal with the right to know and the right to discover.  I do not want to conflate the two issues, other than to say that the Minister will recognise the real importance of medical records for people in these situations, in particular records on the vaccine trials, which is an area I have a huge interest in and on which I have ongoing engagement with GlaxoSmithKline.  I would be very interested in the Minister's views on that or any other mechanisms he might suggest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#LL00600","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I call Senator Seery Kearney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#MM00200","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I believe Senator Higgins is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#MM00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>According to the notes, you are the next speaker, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#MM00400","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I will let Senator Higgins speak in my slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#MM00500","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":228,"content":"<p>That is no problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#MM00600","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":229,"content":"<p>This suite of amendments largely relates to the question of GDPR and how it intersects with this legislation.  The Minister will be aware that we have had lengthy discussions on the general data protection regulation.  Some of my very first discussions on this were back in 2018 when that regulation had come into effect.  There has been a very long journey of understanding the implications of the GDPR within all of the relevant bodies, including Tusla, the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Department.  The GDPR changed things and created a hierarchy where we have an EU directive in EU law, which is applicable and cannot be eroded.  It is important that there is not even a perception that national legislation could give rise to a conflict with or limitation on GDPR.  Amendment No. 23 is not my amendment but I recognise that it is an attempt to provide the widest possible definition of personal data and bring what constitutes personal data in line with the GDPR definition of personal data.  It is trying to address the specific situation.<\/p> <p>While not excluding other provisions that may be inserted - we cannot always be completely exhaustive - these amendments attempt to be more exhaustive than the Bill itself sets out to be.  The desire to be as wide and comprehensive as possible arises from the experience that a minimalist approach has been taken to providing access to information.  While I understand the Minister's experience and perspective and his desire in terms of culture, there is a very deep and long-established culture of taking a minimalist approach to information.  The Minister will know this because we have encountered it again and again.  Despite revelations and changes in terms of realisation, people still have the feeling that they are trying to get blood from a stone.  That is shifting and having such a comprehensive list, as I understand it, is an attempt to help that shift.  These are the starting points of things that must be considered.<\/p> <p>My other amendments in this group are intended to copper-fasten.  Amendment No. 103 seeks to ensure that among the information the authority is required to provide to people requesting information is information on their rights under GDPR.  Not everybody would be aware of that.  This would mean that persons accessing their rights under this legislation would also be made aware that they have rights under the GDPR.  The amendment provides that when the authority is making an entry in the register and informing persons, it would inform the persons of the legal basis under which their personal data are being processed and would also inform people of their rights in relation to the general data protection regulation.  This information would be included in the conversation the authority might be having with such persons.<\/p> <p>As regards amendments Nos. 124 and 125, the Bill states that the Minister \"may prescribe suitable and specific measures\".  The Minister should be prescribing suitable and specific measures around the process, especially in terms of safeguarding.  Under the Data Protection Act, suitable and specific measures are a requirement when permissions such as those provided for in section 66 are being given, for example, where the Minister is authorising a number of bodies in relation to the processing of personal data.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Deletion is recognised as a form of processing.  I am not suggesting that deletion would meet the necessity and proportionality standard, but the reason there are special regulations for the Minister in terms of suitable and specific measures is to copper-fasten it so it is not solely left to these bodies to interpret what is necessary and proportionate.  Other suitable and specific measures are being put in place as a safeguard.  I urge that the Minister would definitely do that rather than the Minister may do that.<\/p><p>Finally, regarding amendment No. 125, it should not really need to be stated but it is important to include: \"Nothing in this enactment shall be construed as infringing upon or limiting the right of a person to make a data subject access request under Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation\".  We have already identified in the course of the debate areas where, in fact, people are entitled to information under the GDPR in terms of a subject access request and it would be very important that a narrower set of rights or concerns is not being substituted or even perceived as being substituted for that.  I gave the example of the person who inquired about a relevant person.  I believe that somebody would be entitled to that information in a subject access request.  If the person makes a subject access request under Article 15, he or she would be entitled to have that considered directly under EU law in Article 15.  The fact that there is national legislation which sets out a more constrained version and says the name shall not be given as a blanket provision, which one cannot do, would be subsidiary to the person's right to make a subject access request of that body under Article 15.  As I said, there is a danger of a national law being potentially in conflict with the exercise of rights under GDPR.<\/p><p>I am concerned that section 66 may be seen as the process being the denying or redacting.  What I want to be copper-fastened is that it is not an effect of section 66, combined with narrower provisions here and there, that effectively we have this legislation serving to constrain rights under Article 15 of the GDPR in terms of subject access requests.  Of course, there are lots of other rights under GDPR, but it is because there is that danger that I am seeking to insert a reminder of it.  Again, there is an argument for not simply mentioning Article 15 of the GDPR, but mentioning the GDPR more widely.  I would be open to that because the Minister specifically mentions restrictions in respect of Articles 12, 14, 18 and 21.  Those are explicitly restricted.  Article 15 is not explicitly restricted but it could potentially come into conflict with some of the provisions in the Bill or what it provides for could be different and wider than what is allowed for.  I mentioned the example of the redaction of a name of a person who inquired after a relevant person.  That could be in conflict with the proper interpretation of Article 15.<\/p><p>Does the Minister see where I am coming from?  I am a little concerned about us creating problems down the line.  We have been getting things wrong in this area for a while and I want to ensure we do not set ourselves up for further conflicts and ambiguities, or even the perception of conflict between the two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#MM00700","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":231,"content":"<p>While the suggested amendments are certainly an extensive list of information to be provided, I do not believe it is necessary.  It is dangerous to be prescriptive.  Once we start getting into prescriptive categories to this extent, we run the risk of not including information that needs to be disclosed.  The reason we need specific legislation with regard to a GDPR right is that GDPR is the interface of a number of people's rights specifically in the area of birth information.  Heretofore, redacting information has been problematic because of the operation of GDPR or the interpretation of its operation, and this is to actually restrict that redaction in the case of individuals who have an entitlement to information about themselves.  While the intent behind the amendments is laudable, I fear they would undermine the purpose by being so prescriptive.<\/p> <p>As regards vaccination information, it is included in the Bill under the definition of \"early life information\" under subsection (f).

It is a source of great concern for many people who were in mother and baby or county home institutions or other institutions.  As Senator Seery Kearney said, vaccinations are explicitly listed in the definition of \"early life information\" and they are implicitly also covered by the term \"medical information\".  Those definitions are in section 2, but there is a right to early life information set out in section 11 and a right to medical information in section 15.  As we said previously, it is a right to the information and also the records.  It is not just confirmation that somebody was subject to a vaccine trial and that is the end of it.  The person is entitled to the records of that vaccine trial as well.  We explicitly reference this on the face of the Bill so I hope that provides reassurance, and I hope the processes set out here will look to provide information from the bodies covered here.  Separate processes are under way with some of the corporate bodies, the successors of companies that undertook these trials and may still have information.<\/p> <p>With regard to the significant amendment proposed by Senator Warfield, I cannot support amendments Nos. 23 and 24 as they are seeking to insert a definition of \"personal data\" in the Bill.  It is a lengthy definition and has 46 different elements.  The vast majority of these examples of personal data are already encompassed in the definitions we have legislated for in the Bill.  The vast majority of the items and the types of information covered in the list in the proposed amendment are covered in the definitions of \"birth information\", \"early life information\", \"care information\", \"medical information\" and \"provided item\".  There are a couple of exceptions.  The definition also contains a number of subsections that could not be considered the personal data of a relevant person.  That includes personal information about the circumstances of a mother prior to the birth of a relevant person or after an adoption took place.  That is not information directly relevant to the relevant person, so that is why we would be concerned about them.<\/p> <p>Along with the list, it is also important, and Senator Higgins touched on this, that we are not even modelling but directly defining \"personal data\" in this legislation according to the definition in the GDPR.  The definition section states clearly that the term \"personal data\" in this legislation is given the definition that is given in GDPR.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is deliberate because that definition, as contained in the data protection regulation, will change and be enhanced and probably be broadened by rulings of the European Court of Justice.  While this definition is lengthy, it will remain the definition until such time as it is changed by subsequent legislation, whereas if we use the definition of personal data as it is set out in the GDPR, as soon as the European courts change that definition, our understanding of that definition changes and broadens as well.  I therefore have a concern that what is proposed here actually fetters the definition of personal data and could, in the medium term, lead to personal data being defined by the GDPR and European courts in one way and personal data as defined for this one piece of legislation not having moved with the times and not having broadened as the definition.  That is not something we would like.  All pieces of information that are listed in this amendment and are legally permissible to be provided are already provided within the Bill as it stands.  I have a real reluctance to go down the route of giving a conclusive definition of personal data because that would result in a kind of bifurcation between the definition of personal data here and that contained in EU law.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 103 proposes that when a person makes an entry into the contact preference register, he or she is told he or she can make a subject access request for all data held by the authority.  I have a concern this will cause confusion because there are many people who apply to the register who would not have any personal data held by the authority.  For example, a sibling or family member looking to register his or her name on the contact preference register has probably had no other engagement with the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, before.  To start telling that person he or she can do a subject access request now at this point would not be the best place.  We are very clear and will discuss later on that there will be major information campaigns about the new legislation to make people aware of it.  We will be very clear that those people also have existing rights under GDPR.  For certain categories of people, that is very important, especially mothers.  We will be making them aware.  From engaging with groups of mothers, I am aware many of them were not aware they could already apply to many of the institutions for information about themselves.  That came up during the joint committee hearings.  Making sure that route is clear will be one of the things we hope undertake in the context of the information campaign.<\/p><p>I am reluctant to accept amendment No. 124 in terms of the Minister being obliged to prescribe in regulations safeguards to the rights and freedoms of others.  This is a forward-looking provision.  It is enabling and allows me or a future Minister to make those regulations as they are required.  We should give that degree of freedom.  GDPR is taken seriously and where they are needed they will be undertaken.<\/p><p>I move finally to amendment No. 125.  To be very clear, the Bill does not restrict in any way a person's right to apply for his or her information through a subject access request.  Article 15 rights are in no way interfered with.  Article 15 continues to exist as a pathway.  That is probably something we will discuss tomorrow as well but it continues to exist.  There are a very small number of GDPR rights limited.  As we know, the GDPR allows for the limitation of rights but they have to be clearly set out in legislation, and that is the purpose of section 65.  There are a small number of rights that are limited and they are set out there clearly.  However, the limitation is done in a narrow way and it is only to ensure the full operation of this Bill and, in particular, the fact release of information takes place in all circumstances because, as we know, under the GDPR the release of information is not guaranteed in every circumstance.  Even with a subject access request under Article 15 there is the balancing test of the rights and freedoms of others.  In our legislation we are working on here, because this information is seen as so vital, the legislative intent is to ensure the full release of all information on every occasion, and that is why we are going this route rather than relying on the GDPR.  We did not want even one situation left where somebody could be refused access to his or her identity information on the basis of the rights and freedoms of others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#NN00500","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I was not necessarily touching on medical vaccines or ones given by consent.  I am talking about research, as does that amendment.  The House should remember we now know children in State care aged up to seven years were being involved in research and we know something of the adverse reactions some of them had.  That was a point I wanted to make.<\/p> <p>I also inform the House the BBC has commissioned a documentary and I have been part of it.  Indeed, it came to this House some weeks back.  The documentary was to go out in June but will now go out in July.  The BBC is covering this very extensively and quite a number of people are being interviewed for it and teed up for this.  This is a programme that has been in the making for 12 months.  It is important we are clear.  I am not taking away from what the Minister has said but we cannot emphasise enough the difference between medically approved vaccines, and adverse reactions to those are a different issue, and the fact these were children in care or in institutions, with State involvement or not, who were gathered up and used for vaccine trials.  We know this happened and it is factual.  I think the Minister has made that clear.  That is the reason I wanted to talk specifically on that, just so we were clear.  It would be a pity if we do not really get that message out.  Nobody but nobody is going to block their access to that information.  There are other strands of investigation and court proceedings going on as we speak.  We know there is a very substantial amount of information but we know also there is a very substantial amount of this information in the hands of institutions that are still operating, albeit historically a long time, are in receipt of State funds and are still very much part of the care system and the health system.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for clarifying that.  He might just reiterate that point.  It is about communication.  We have to get the message out that there is no hiding place for anyone who was involved and took advantage of children, with the support of some people who ran these organisations, because the medical crowd did not break the doors down.  They were facilitated, they were invited in and in many cases they were paid.  That is an important message to get out there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#OO00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>To follow-up on Senator Boyhan's point, it relates to some of the earlier amendments we discussed.

That is why there is this attempt and this desire for these wider definitions.  It is not to exclude other provisions but for more and more things to get named.  People know they can battle for a phrase to say they believe it includes X, Y or Z, but they are not necessarily going to have that legal representation to make that battle for them, and they do not want to have to go that route.  If there is a minimalist approach that says a person was given this or that vaccine, it is an explicit thing that is not in the Bill at the moment for a person to know he or she was part of a vaccine trial and to have some information or some record of what that person was part of, as might be appropriate.  It obviously does not have to involve names of others who were subject to the trial.<\/p> <p>It also comes to a question of where there was financial exploitation of children.  That is part of the information people should be able to access in respect of themselves.

These are the criteria on which decisions as to how public contracts are awarded are made.  Under the EU procurement directives, contracts must be awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender.  There is provision within these directives for three approaches to assessing what is the most economically advantageous tender.  One approach is based on a price-quality ratio, another is based on price or cost only and another is based on the life cycle costing.  In my Bill, I seek to ensure that the price-quality ratio, either on its own or in combination with the life cycle costing, becomes the default main measure.  However, I do not preclude the use of lowest price or lowest cost criteria only in my legislation.  The Bill is quite clear that there is no prohibition on the use of a lowest price or lowest cost approach only but simply requires that where that approach is taken, a declaration is made that explains why that approach was chosen.  I believe this is absolutely consistent with the requirements of the EU directives.<\/p><p>This is the core part of the Bill because, while we have those three options available and while they are equally encouraged, the lowest price and lowest cost approach has effectively become the default mechanism.  It is the one used most easily.  It is seen as the shortest route to take the lowest price approach even though there is incredibly strong evidence that, when that approach is taken, it often results in further costs down the line arising from supplementary claims.  We could list examples, from CervicalCheck to Carillion and others, where taking the lowest price approach has ended up costing the State more in the long run.  <\/p><p>My Bill does not remove the existing discretion.  That was an option when the directive was originally being transposed.  The 2014 directive encouraged states to use procurement as an effective tool to deliver on environmental and other goals.  The State chose not to exclude the lowest price only approach, which was an option under the directive.  My legislation respects that decision.  Under the Bill, contracting authorities will still have discretion but they will be required either to think about quality in the sense of putting together a request for tenders based on price and quality or to think about why they are not considering quality and to provide a declaration setting out the reason they have chosen the lowest price approach.<\/p><p>I am happy with and appreciate the constructive engagement we have had with the Minister of State and his office but, while we can look at the detail within section 3(4), my Bill does not preclude the use of the lowest price approach, although it does require an explanation.  Unless that is included in the Bill, it is not clear what the legislation adds because it is about changing the culture.  It is already possible under the legislation to use approaches based on the price-quality ratio or the lowest price.  The Bill just asks us to stop and think about the use of the lowest price approach.  When the lowest price approach is used, the reason must be explained.  <\/p><p>I will come to the question.  I do not know if this relates directly to section 3(4)(b).  Again, I am happy to engage further on Report Stage but it would be useful if the Minister of State were to indicate which paragraphs of section 3(4) are likely to be the subject of discussion at that point because, again, they do slightly different things.  I will be really clear for the record.  The Bill does not remove discretion.  It creates accountability.  That requirement for an explanation is an attempt to shift the culture because, while some public bodies already use the price-quality ratio approach a lot, others do not.  The Bill endeavours to empower procurement officers who want to go for the price-quality approach and to make that approach the easier and more automatic option.  It aims to make using the lowest price approach an exception rather than the rule.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#QQ01600","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":258,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome.

I wonder if this proposal could lead to further delays in the awarding of tenders, although I believe there is merit in what the Senator is proposing and has laid out.<\/p> <p>Another point relates to certain contractors that might not have the best record in the delivery of certain projects, who came through the system having offered the lowest prices for those projects, then tendering for similar projects.

There is merit in looking at that because we have seen this issue in certain public developments and in private developments that received certain amounts of public money that I can think of.  In these cases, a given company submitted the lowest tender but its reputation was such that, if it could have, the board would not have accepted it based on what it had heard, what it knew and previous history.

The provision is that they would require a minimum of 50% quality weighting unless there is a declaration explaining why they are choosing not to apply such a weighting.  It is important to note that this is allowed under EU law and there is case law that demonstrates that.  One relevant case is Irish Waste Services <i>v<\/i>. Northern Ireland Water Limited and another, which was heard in the European Court of Justice, which is the highest court in respect of this, is the EVN AG and Wienstrom case.  In the latter case, the European Court of Justice concluded that a contracting authority is free to choose both the award criteria and their weightings.  There is case law from the highest level, at the European Court of Justice, which makes it very clear that the weighting can be chosen.  In that regard, that does not preclude the setting of a minimum threshold.<br\/><br\/>My Bill does not interfere with the discretion of an authority to choose the weighting but it allows for a declaration which explains the reasons for the choice in respect of it.  Again, if a public or contracting authority has a &euro;10 million project and decides to do it with a 75% weighting on cost and only 25% on quality, it can do so but it must explain why.  An example of how that might be relevant is the national children's hospital, where 75% of the decision was based on price and only 25% on quality criteria.  Of course, we know that project has ended up costing close to &euro;1 billion in supplementary claims and other costs because it was not addressed at the time.  That would be an example whereby, if this Bill had been in place, it would still have been an option to do that but we would at least have a very useful record explaining exactly why the contracting authority chose to go with 75% price and only 25% quality.  That would be useful in terms of accountability and transparency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#RR00500","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":263,"content":"<p>In broad terms, what we are trying to do with public procurement is get a good price.  We want to get value for money for the State and for the taxpayer but at the same time, we want to get the highest quality product and we want to do our purchasing in a transparent way.  Lastly, we have strategic procurement, which is a new thing and the issue here is our compliance with Government objectives in terms of climate change, green procurement, social procurement and so on.  These are the overall goals of procurement.<\/p> <p>I share the objectives of this Bill and believe that we all want to arrive at the same place.  The Senator has asked about the wider implications from an EU point of view.  There are EU directives on procurement with which we must comply.  Effectively, they are European law and with that in mind, when I spoke to the Attorney General's office, the advice I got was that it was not happy with the wording and was concerned that the Bill would be not in compliance with European law.  I have to take that seriously but at the same time, I know that the Dutch have managed to achieve this goal.  The Dutch are under the same regime and have to comply with the same EU directives.  In that sense, I know we can get there.  I know that between now and Report Stage I can work with the Attorney General and we can find a way to word this so that we achieve what we are trying to achieve without exposing ourselves to the risk of breaking European law.  <\/p> <p>We are looking here at quality criteria.  For some people, there is a fear that quality criteria means subjective criteria and that we are moving away from objective criteria, such as the amount of money we are willing to pay, towards more subjective criteria which makes the process more like a beauty contest.  In fact, however, quality does not have to be subjective.  There are many ways to measure quality on a numerical scale, including various ratings, the qualifications of the staff who will carry out the task and so on.  We do not necessarily have to equate subjective criteria with quality criteria; they are not always the same thing.<\/p> <p>I have detailed the section I am trying to amend in order to remove any risk of being non-compliant with European law, namely section 3(4).  I want to minimise legal challenges.  While we cannot avoid them altogether, one of our the objectives in the context of this Bill is to make sure we are not inviting ourselves into a world where every decision is challenged and projects are delayed as a result.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#SS00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652866200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Before I move on to section 4, I want to acknowledge the presence of our former colleague, former Senator Billy Lawless.

This is a consequence of the proposed amendment to section 3.  If we amend section 3, we are likely to require an amendment to section 4 too.  From a policy perspective, the requirement under section 4 of the Bill for the chief deciding officer, for example, a Secretary General or a CEO, to make a declaration on every procurement procedure where price is the only award criterion could be onerous and unnecessary.  Such a declaration may be subject to legal challenge by dissatisfied bidders, not least on the basis that the chief deciding officer, who may not be an expert in procurement, may be considered to have introduced a discriminatory input into the procurement process.  Interventions by a chief deciding officer to the assessment in the subject matter of the proposed procurement would need strong assurance that no material difference applied in quality or price-quality ratio, as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#SS00900","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister acknowledging the fact that my legislation mirrors the Dutch legislation, effectively, which is running without concern or obstacle.  It has been assessed as delivering 2.4 times better value from contracts.  We are not balancing value for money against quality.  The fact is that quality is part of value for money.  That is why the price-quality ratio approach and the lowest price approach both qualify under that umbrella of most economically advantageous because the EU directives recognise that quality is often one of the ways to deliver value.<\/p> <p>As the Minister mentioned, the Dutch legislation has been applying and has been found to deliver greater value by taking the exact approach set out in this Bill, which is consistent with European law.  It has been mentioned that it would be difficult to sign off every time we go with price-only criteria but the goal of the Bill is to ensure that price-only becomes the exception rather the rule.  It is a requirement and I do not think it is too much for chief decision makers to explain why they are opting for price-only.  If it is simply a matter of them feeling it is easier to go with that model because it is the most hands-off model, that is not necessarily the model that is delivering best value for the State.  That is a model that simply delivers most convenience or deniability which is not actually a win for public money, for &euro;17 billion of public money or &euro;165 billion of national development plan money.  <\/p> <p>Those who have agreed with me and who have engaged with me on this issue do not think that the current procurement system is working as well as it should.  Effectively, if my Bill makes it harder to continue with business as usual and with not having to think about these issues, then that is okay.  This is about a culture shift.  I have engaged with many groups on this, including the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, RIAI, the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, Chambers Ireland, Social Entrepreneurs Ireland, academics from the National University of Ireland, Galway and the University of Limerick, the Chartered Institute of Building, and SIPTU.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->From the Construction Industry Federation to SIPTU, people are agreeing that the model needs improvement.  Simply arguing that doing this might change what we do, make what we do already more difficult and make us shift is not really an argument for not doing it.  It is an argument for doing it because otherwise we hear it may be simpler and it can be easier to go with price only and we do not think we will get the same challenges.  We need to streamline.  We are putting inertia and convenience over the purpose we should all have, which is getting the best and most genuinely advantageous value from how we spend our public money so that it delivers for us in terms of quality.<\/p><p>We must bear in mind who benefits from putting in those quality criteria.  We talk about the legal challenges from the disappointment involved, but let us think about who we disappoint when we do not want to think about quality.  When we do not think about quality we penalise good companies that put the effort in to innovate, put work in, have decent employment standards, have better environmental standards, and push ahead in thinking ahead of the contracting authority about what is going on.  It is hard to punish or exclude companies that have bad records but it is a lot easier to reward companies that have good records and ones that show they always deliver on time and that people love what they have given to the State.  If we think about who loses, the current lowest price model being the default model penalises good companies, including SMEs, that are doing good work and that want to lead.  I would point out again that this Dutch model is being taken up all over Europe, so by not bringing it in we are disadvantaging our companies because they will not be navigating the same systems as others.  It is important to bear that in mind.  It involves doing things a little bit differently but that will become streamlined and it is hoped it will become the exception.  It should not be the case that 1,000 sign-offs are coming across the desk of a chief officer but it should be the odd or occasional one where there might be a good reason for it.  It is okay that we shift things around a little bit, move on in this and use it better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#SS01000","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I want to make some brief points on section 5.

I inserted that legal advice to have that in but I am happy to look at that.  For me, the fundamental part of section 5, and a principle which the Minister of State supports, is that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, which has a requirement for a public duty on equality and human rights, establishes a public duty that is placed on every public body in respect of actively promoting equality and human rights.  I am happy to look at the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 provisions and ensure their compatibility, but the core part for me is that reminder to public bodies that when they are giving contracts, they have a public duty on equality and human rights.  That duty applies to Departments or public bodies in what they do and in their contracts.  We have had scenarios in the past like the example of Bus &Eacute;ireann contracting buses that did not allow for disability access and, therefore, were not delivering on the equality obligations of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Even though they were private contractors, Bus &Eacute;ireann had that responsibility.  It is a matter of following that duty through and embedding an understanding of the public duty on equality and human rights, and it applies to all of a public body's actions.  This section of the Bill does not create a new obligation.  The obligation is already there but this requires reporting in respect of how the public duty on equality and human rights has been reflected in procurement when the procurement activities for the year are being reported on under the statutes that already exist.  I am happy to look at the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, but for me the core of this is that public duty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#TT01100","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I support this Bill.  I want to express my respect and admiration for my Civil Engagement Group colleague, Senator Higgins, for the diligent research and massive effort that went into the Bill.<\/p> <p>I want to speak to this section, which details a procedure for the Minister to produce guidelines for the qualitative, environmental and social human rights and equality considerations that arise in procurement for use by bodies that would be regulated by this Bill.  It would be a welcome antidote to the narrow focus on cost that defines current procurement procedures.  Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 imposes an equality duty on public sector bodies.  This means concerns around human rights and non-discrimination must play a role in their strategic outlook and that they must detail the steps taken to comply with this duty in their annual reports.  There is a clear intention to place an ethical responsibility on public bodies, and this is understandable.  We should hold those who are tasked with improving the lives of Irish people to high standards and they should endeavour to conduct themselves in a way that respects human rights and the value of equality.  However, the area of public procurement elides this duty and it is a major oversight this Bill rightly rectifies.<\/p> <p>I will give a practical example of how low-cost tendering has injured a valuable public body.  We can look at the National Gallery of Ireland, for example, which is the largest art institution in Ireland and one that provides a wonderful public service.  Art has immense social and political weight and the National Gallery of Ireland has reflected that with an exhibition in 2020 containing artwork from current and former asylum seekers.  This is what made outrageous the National Gallery of Ireland's decision to award the contract for its caf&eacute; to the multinational catering conglomerate, Aramark, which is involved in running several direct provision centres in the country.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not need to list the many outrageous elements of the direct provision system to the Chamber.

Its staff are embarrassed and demoralised, and several prominent artists have requested that their work is removed from the walls of the gallery.  This is the sort of damage that the narrow \"cost above all else\" model of public procurement, which ties the hands of public bodies, can cause.  While this Bill is not about excluding any firms from the tender process, it does empower public bodies to make decisions that make sense from both an economic and a public policy point of view.  This Bill will allow public bodies to consider social factors that are clearly relevant to the value created by firms bidding for the tender.  These social factors could include whether the applicants recognise their workers' trade union, whether they pay their workers a living wage, whether they employ environmentally sustainable production methods and many more worthy considerations.  A more holistic model of public procurement would extend the spirit of the public sector equality duty into all aspects of public service provision.  It would also enable public bodies to maximise the positive impacts that they can achieve with the resources that are available to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#TT01200","speaker":"1632","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>There are times when the procurement rules can be short-circuited, compressed or skipped altogether and they tend to occur when there is an emergency.  I mean one cannot hold a tender for something when, for example, something is on fire.  We saw this during the pandemic.  When one has to buy syringes or something one may not have three months to get the best price.  The same applies during the Ukrainian crisis with trying to find accommodation and food.  One can reach over and pick the first available largest thing that can satisfy.  One will always try to get some quotes and try to do something but sometimes that is what the result is.<\/p> <p>I cannot comment on the National Gallery's procurement exercise, whether it was followed correctly or on a particular company.  Earlier another Senator asked me a question that I did not answer.  I was asked about the history and reputation of a company and how that can be taken into account when awarding contracts.  What the law and European law says is that if they have broken the law in some way then that can be taken into account.  So if a company has a judgment against it then one can rule it out.  However, if a company is still in court and is fighting with it all of the time then that may not be enough to rule it out, and it probably is not enough, because one cannot say a determination is faulty or a judgment has been reached.  What one can do is ask for references from past contracts.  One can take various approaches to this matter but public procurement is very different from private procurements.<\/p> <p>As public procurement tries so hard to be non-discriminatory, give everybody a fair chance and avoid one country picking its people over another country or somebody who is connected to the government being chosen, then one attempts procurement in a very transparent way.  However, it is hard to rule out people simply because it was bad working with them or one had a bad experience but one would have that option with private procurement.  If a private company hired somebody to do some work and it was a nightmare then one would not hire it again but it is difficult for us to avoid that.<\/p> <p>On the question of social considerations, these are key because they are part of the Government's strategic objectives.  For example, we can put criteria into contracts stipulating how much training will be provided by the contractor and will be considered as part of the criteria for deciding whether to award the job.  Other criteria can be how much local employment will be provided, how many people with disabilities will be employed etc.  So one can put in social considerations.  We have guidance and that guidance will be strengthened in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#UU00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":286,"content":"<p>We are discussing an interesting topic.

These are areas of State policy on things like emissions reductions, our obligations under the United Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Istanbul Convention and Irish Sign Language recognition.  The State has many concrete policy areas and goals.<\/p><p>Circulars have been issued and I wish to refer to the extremely useful Dutch guidelines as they state what goes into that place.  The Netherlands has avoided legal challenges due to having clear guidelines on how things are reflected.  Another reason is having a list of things to be aware of and consider at the design point.  I have discovered that a lot of procurement legislation often tries to deal with social clauses, which are attached to a contract after it has been awarded.  My amendments seek to go a little higher and design the criteria on which the allocation of a contract will be based.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is also a step further up in terms of design.  For example, if a playground is being designed, the contracting authority would not just state it is a contract for a playground, but also that it is doing a request for tenders for a playground that will also promote public goals in respect of inclusion and accessibility and will, for example, reflect the biodiversity or pollinator goals the State may have.  By ensuring provisions are included early on, and we are not saying they have to be put in, we allow a contracting authority to make the initial request for tenders better.<br\/><br\/>Schoolbooks and library books are other examples.  One of the instances where there was concern across the House was when the contract for library books was bundled into one very large contract that went to one company, whereas if there were, for example, provisions to support a local reading culture, a different approach would have been taken to how library books might have been purchased on a national level.  Just transition, which will be very important, is another example.  Where we have contracts in which one of the goals is just transition, and some of the funding is coming from just transition funds, it needs to be very clear that such factors will be factored into the design of that contract.  I can give examples of where that did not happen.<br\/><br\/>In that context, these guidelines are a very powerful and useful resource for contracting authorities to design a better contract at the beginning.  When they do so, that allows and justifies because the criteria that are attached have to relate to the performance of the contract.  It is almost like setting the mission and the criteria then have to relate to delivering on that mission.  That is where these guidelines can be incredibly powerful and useful.  They have the potential to deliver the intention of the 2014 directive, which was around the achievement of these core public policy goals through public procurement as a tool and not just a shopping list.<br\/><br\/>However, I recognise that because these guidelines deal with multiple areas that may be quite wide, and the needs of particular contracting authorities may be different, the language in section 6(3) of the Bill could be too prescriptive.  At present, it states that &quot;Contracting authorities shall comply with any guidelines issued under <i>subsection (1)<\/i>&quot;, but there are of course different contracting authorities.  Some guidelines will be relevant to some contracting authorities, while other guidelines will be relevant to other contracting authorities.  I am conscious that section 6(3) is framed too widely at present and is too hard an obligation in that regard.<br\/><br\/>I have proposed three ways we can address this.  I am interested in what the Minister of State believes is best.  We could address it by stating contracting authorities &quot;shall consider&quot; any guidelines.  That is the culture change and the requirement that there would be consideration of the guidelines.  It creates an obligation but it is only an obligation to consider.  That is one process.  The other approach would be to use the wording &quot;may comply&quot;.  Again, it is stating contracting authorities might comply.  It puts compliance into the Bill but the wording is &quot;may comply&quot;, which recognises there may be exceptions where complying with a particular guideline might not be appropriate.  The third approach would be to go with &quot;shall consider &quot; or &quot;may consider&quot;, which is very weak but would at least indicate authorities may consider these guidelines.  It loses a little of the strength in that we want people to at least look to the guidelines when a tender is being designed, but we would still be in a situation where they are being provided with a better tool through strengthened guidelines.  Those are the three approaches.  That is why I have those two words because they can be combined in four different ways.  I am very open because I recognise this sentence is currently too narrow and too restrictive.  I am open to those three approaches.  My preference is probably for &quot;shall consider&quot;.  That creates an obligation, although only one of consideration.  I am open to the Minister of State's thoughts on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#UU01300","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":297,"content":"<p>The first problem I have with this is that if we, as the amendment indicates, directly substitute \"comply\" with \"consider\" we end up with a sentence stating the contracting authorities shall \"consider with\" any guidelines issued under subsection (1).

Section 6 sets out provision for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the issue of guidelines on social considerations, which contracting authorities are obliged to follow.  Notwithstanding the amendment tabled by Senator Higgins today, the prescriptive nature of these guidelines could lead to increased legal challenge to procurement competitions and this could disrupt the provision of goods and services for the State, in particular the procurement of urgent and potentially life-critical goods and services.  For example, as I mentioned, there are times when we will want to carry out emergency procurement as we did during the pandemic.  Would that be affected by these guidelines?  It is just something we need to make sure we consider and do not get ourselves into a sticky situation.<\/p> <p>The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, has Circular 20\/2019 on social considerations, with which the Senator is probably familiar.  There is also an information note in this regard.  The OGP chairs the strategic procurement advisory group across government, which provides policy advice and direction to public procurers with representatives of the relevant policy Departments on how they can implement social considerations.  This will further enable the inclusion of social considerations into procurement processes in an effective manner that has the flexibility to drive the important social considerations that are relevant at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#VV00600","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I note the guidelines on social considerations proposed in this Bill would complement and expand those contained in the 2019 circular.  I was very actively engaged with the OGP at that time on the development of that circular because I also dealt with legislation on these issues in the period of the last Oireachtas.<\/p><p>I understand and appreciate the situation in respect of emergency provisions and so forth.  That can certainly be accommodated.  However, the guidelines are very important because a contracting authority in the Department of Education, for example, will not necessarily be <i>au fait<\/i>with environmental goals.  That is similarly the case if someone is procuring.  It is really about strengthening the process because we cannot expect every procurement officer in the country to be an expert in every single area in the decisions they may make.  I gave a very simple example, which is an important one for this House, of legislation driven by the Seanad in respect of Irish Sign Language, and the fact that when public buildings are designed now, because Irish Sign Language has that recognition, there is thinking about how an interpreter is planned for.  It is a small thing, but including it in how we think about public buildings affects the kind of criteria that are looked for.  It is a similar situation around the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as I mentioned, or indeed the issue of short-term disability.  This is complementary and builds on that existing scope.  It is something that is very useful and will give confidence to procurement officers in widening the value they seek to deliver from the contracting process.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#VV00700","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":303,"content":"<p>There is a clear indication that this can be sorted on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#VV00800","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>In that case, I withdraw my amendment with the indication to come back with the revised wording as discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#VV00900","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652866200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 8, line 37, to delete &ldquo;comply&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;consider&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>Again, there is agreement to come back with a revised wording.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#VV01100","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652866200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652866200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Section 6 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652866200,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Sections 7 and 8 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652866200,"counter":310,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652866200,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":312,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Report Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#WW00300","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051800002#WW00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1652866200,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
