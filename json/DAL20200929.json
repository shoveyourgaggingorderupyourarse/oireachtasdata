The announcement that mortgage breaks will come to an end after this week has caused a great deal of anxiety and stress.  These mortgage breaks gave homeowners and businesses some relief as the economic effects of the emergency and public health restrictions bit hard.  Nobody expected the mortgage breaks to go on forever but they should certainly have been maintained for as long as the pandemic continued.  In other countries, mortgage holders have been given breaks of nine months or even a year but that is not the case here.  Here, mortgage holders got a break of three months followed by an extension lasting a further three months.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, we learnt that the banks will return to business as usual but it is not a case of business as usual for many families and businesses.  There are families and businesses that will simply not be able to return to repaying their mortgages normally.  Leaving mortgage holders to go it alone and relying on the sympathy of the banks to deal with individual cases is, frankly, unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday's meeting between senior Government Ministers and the banks was a facade.  There was no real intent on the part of the Government to reach a solution that would help mortgage holders.  All of this is happening at a time when the cosy connections between the Government and the financial sector are once again on show.  We have learnt that the former Minister of State, Senator Michael D'Arcy, is leaving the Seanad to be appointed as CEO of a financial lobbying group.  In summary, all of this means that there will be no relief for struggling mortgage holders but a big job for a former Minister of State.  What does this say to the families and businesses that were relying on the Government to stand up for them and to go to bat for them?  This is the second former Minister of State at the Department of Finance to go through the revolving door from the Government into the world of high finance.  In fact, during yesterday's meeting, Ministers from the Taoiseach's Government sat on one side of the table while a former Minister of State at the Department of Finance sat on the other side representing the banks.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, has warmly welcomed Senator D'Arcy's new job.  He said that he understands why, after 20 years in public life, the Senator might wish to start a new chapter in his life.  He said that he will always be welcome should he decide to run for election again.  He went on to say that his new employers are fortunate to recruit someone of his calibre.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, another of the Taoiseach's colleagues in government, said something different.  He said that he has concerns about all of this and that he has shared those concerns with the Taoiseach.  We know that the Standards In Public Office Commission, SIPO, has certainly had concerns about this revolving door.  Over the last five years, it has approached the Government to seek changes to legislation that would give it the power to investigate and prosecute Ministers who do not adhere to the rules on cooling-off periods before moving to jobs with lobbying groups.  SIPO's approaches in this regard have been consistently ignored by the Government.  One has to wonder why.<\/p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste has one point of view of the appointment.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has a different point of view.  He says he has concerns and that he has shared these concerns with the Taoiseach.  Will the Taoiseach set out for us his position on this matter?  Does the Taoiseach share the concerns of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan?  If he does, what are those concerns?  What action, as Head of Government, does the Taoiseach propose to take on this matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601382900,"counter":8,"content":"<p>There are two substantive issues contained within the question that the Deputy put.  In the first instance, I want to say that I fully understand the anxiety and stress that many individual mortgage holders, many people with personal loans and many small and medium-sized enterprises feel in terms of the ongoing impact of Covid-19 on their capacity to repay loans and on the general economic situation.  It has to be said that the payment breaks were invaluable to thousands of people in respect of those breaks over six months.  Irish SMEs in particular had the highest share of loan repayment breaks up to September.  What is interesting is that quite a majority of people were in a position to return to normal repayments after the initial three-month payment break.  Elements of Ireland's payment break system compare favourably to other countries in some aspects, in particular the length of the payment break, the wide-ranging nature of the payment break and its uniformity across the system.  That is not the same in other European countries.<\/p>  <p>  The meeting yesterday was not a facade.  It was a genuine engagement, as there has been continuing genuine engagements between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, and the T&aacute;naiste with the banks in terms of ensuring that people are treated fairly and seriously in a sensitive and sensible way.  Again, it is important to point out that the 30 September deadline refers to new applications for payment breaks after that date.  It is a regulatory application deadline set down by the European Banking Authority.  That is the key point in respect of that.  It is not the cliff edge, as has been presented in terms of various presentations.  There are various protections for consumers and people in mortgage arrears or in difficulties with their loans.  Those protections will continue.  Government will continue to engage with the banking system to ensure a sensitive and sympathetic approach is adopted.  People will obviously have to continue to engage.  The next phase is individually tailored approaches to individual loans with a view to providing alternative solutions and proposals for those borrowers in different situations, such as interest-only payments or different approaches that can be adopted by the banks.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the former Senator and Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy, I believe there should be an effective cooling off period.  I am not happy, or in any way comfortable, with people who have been in office taking up positions, particularly in the area they had jurisdiction over or responsibility for, immediately after or within months of having left office.  I believe the legislation should be reviewed.  Government agreed this morning that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will initiate a review of the standards in public office legislation in that respect.<\/p>  <p>  More widely, I have long been concerned at the fact that parties and movements can raise foreign donations to an extraordinary amount.  I think that should be examined by the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Deputy McDonald's party has raised $15 million over the years in the United States.  I worry about that.  That money has been raised from big vested interests, from construction and financial elites, in the United States with which Deputy McDonald seems to have no difficulty.  Referendums have been influenced by large amounts of money the origins of which we do not know.  That is a more fundamental area to our democracy.  Some people have funded projects, including commemorative projects celebrating 1916 and so on.  My understanding is that one particular project - I am open to correction and Deputy McDonald might correct me - was funded by loans from abroad but there was a political agenda attached to that as well.<\/p> <p>I would favour a review and reform of the SIPO legislation.  Any cooling-off period should have the force of law and sanctions and penalties attached to it.  That review is on the way by the Government now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900004#B00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601383200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Tea and sympathy for mortgage holders is of no use to them.  Of course, some will be in a position to return to full payment of their mortgage sum but many others will not.  The question is why the mortgage breaks were stopped for families and businesses that still require them at a time when we are still in the grip of a public emergency, when additional restrictions have been placed on Dublin and Donegal, and when there is the very real prospect that will happen elsewhere throughout the country.  That is the issue.  The Government left this matter until the eleventh hour and demonstrated no serious intent to secure a continuation of those very necessary and invaluable, as the Taoiseach called them, arrangements for mortgage holders.<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues, Deputies Pearse Doherty and Farrell, have prepared legislation that will be published today in respect of reform of SIPO powers, particularly in terms of section 22, and allowing SIPO to investigate and make concrete sanctions against former Ministers or Ministers of State such as Senator D'Arcy, who has moved through that revolving door from politics to lobbying.  The Taoiseach should remember that last week, Senator D'Arcy was on his feet in the Seanad, addressing issues very close to the financial services industry and of great interest to investment managers.  This week, we learned that he is moving, changing and going to be a CEO for one of these organisations.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad the Taoiseach has agreed the law needs to be changed.  We do not need a lengthy review; we need this change to happen quickly.  We are happy to provide the legislation and I hope the Government will support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900005#C00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1601383200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>It does need a wide review, not just of this specific issue, which needs to be dealt with, but also of the influence of foreign money on Irish politics.  That is something that needs more rigorous inquiry in this country than has been the case to date.  I have been through a number of referendums.  That has been a concern for me and it continues to be a concern.<\/p>  <p>  It is also a concern that projects, organised by political parties but separate from them, seem to be funded by American money, with a political agenda but, on the face of it, circumventing SIPO guidelines.  That is something the Deputy needs to address.  She might correct me if I am wrong but that seems to have been the case for the alternative commemoration to the national commemoration of 1916, and the agenda that Sinn F&eacute;in represents of the continuing link from 1916 to the war in the North, the conflict and the murder and mayhem that ensued and that the party continues to endorse.<\/p>  <p>  These are very serious political issues, and while the Deputy may not think so, I do.  It is not one rule for one group of politicians and a separate rule for others.  I accept there has to be a cooling-off period.  I do not approve of a former Minister of State going into a post that he had responsibility for as an officeholder.

I want to make a couple of points to the Taoiseach and get his response.  Dr. Ronan Glynn said we are going to be living with this for the next six to nine months and that it is going to be a very difficult period.  I am glad that he referred to that length of time because people needed to hear it.  I have said before in this House that when Covid came, it was the best time for us, as we had spring and then summer.  We are now facing into a very difficult six months.<\/p>  <p>  Over the weekend, I met Mair&eacute;ad, who is over the age of 70.  The one question she had for me was whether she would be able to see her only child, her daughter, who is working in London, at Christmas.<\/p> <p>I was taken by that because the whole lot of us in the political system, including the Opposition and the Government, need to sign a contract from now until Christmas with the public to say that we will work together and follow a roadmap, which the Government will lead, and then Mair&eacute;ad might see her daughter at Christmas.  Then we will need to do another three-month contract from New Year's Day until St. Patrick's Day so that we can break the back on the difficult six months that are ahead of us.  I ask the Taoiseach to commit to something like that.  None of us have all of the answers but we need to break this down for the public because they are fatigued and worn out.  We need to do it in bite sizes from here until Christmas and then from New Year's Day until St. Patrick's Day.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider what I have just said and the Labour Party is happy to sign up to working with the Government on that.<\/p> <p> I was taken by what was produced in the winter plan last week.  Beds are an important issue but there is no point in having the beds if we do not have the staff.  We need to be ingenious in how we will get all of these nurses, doctors and consultants in such a short space of time.<\/p> <p> The other issue I want to raise with the Taoiseach is non-Covid healthcare.  I have deep concerns about this, especially after talking to people working at different levels in the HSE over the last two weeks.  I know the Taoiseach will not have the answer to this today - I am not trying to catch him out.  I ask him to do a comparative analysis of coronary care and cancer care to see how many people are being treated and diagnosed month-on-month compared to last year.  I would like to know the answer to that because I do not know what it is.  Anecdotally, we have all heard of issues with the volume of people who may not be diagnosed this year and that is worrying because we all know that the longer it goes on the less chance one has of survival, particularly with those seriously acute conditions.  Could the Taoiseach provide that information to us?  I will ask the Taoiseach this question again next week in order that he can provide the answer.  I will give him a week to come up with the answer.<\/p> <p> Given what Dr. Glynn has said, will the Taoiseach consider a roadmap that is based around two pivotal dates - Christmas and St. Patrick's Day - so that the political class can collectively look at supporting that to get people through the next six months?  Will the Taoiseach carry out an analysis of non-Covid critical health issues so that we can see whether we are dealing with them appropriately, as we tried our best to do last year, for example?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900005#C00400","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601383500,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his query and I would commit to that.  I have publicly said on a number of occasions that the implications of Covid will be with us right through 2021.  We need to take it in bite sizes and the immediate necessity is for all of us to take stock on our individual behaviours in reducing social contacts and the level of congregation in which we engage.  This is essential to get the numbers down and in some counties and cities to avoid having to be put on level 3, but it is within our grasp.  Limerick and other areas have proven that by getting the numbers down.  Cities are volatile at the best of times when it comes to Covid because one event or incident can lead to a significant outbreak, as we saw in Cork with restaurants and pubs in one or two areas leading to approximately about 70 cases of Covid-19.  The impact of that on our health services is significant.<\/p>  <p>  I share the Deputy's concern about non-Covid services such as coronary care and cancer care but it is essential that we tell people we want to continue non-Covid health services, to get waiting lists down and to improve diagnostics and speed at getting diagnostics.  However, a lot of that depends on our behaviour with Covid because the greater the number of Covid patients we have to admit to our hospitals and ICUs, the less capacity we will have to deal with coronary care, cancer care and other key ailments and diseases, etc., that affect the major organs of the body.  There is a contract and an objective there.  The better we behave collectively and individually, the better we give capacity and space to our front-line workers and hospitals to deal with non-Covid healthcare.  The winter initiative is about providing unprecedented resources of &euro;600 million over the next six months to alleviate capacity constraints.  It is also aimed at dealing with the resumption of health services and enabling diagnostics and operations to take place in parallel with our approach to Covid.<\/p> <p>That is the objective and it very much depends on keeping the lid on increasing cases and suppressing the virus insofar as we can.  I urge people to do that so people can see their children and grandchildren at Christmas in a meaningful way.  Whether they can will depend on our capacity to suppress the virus and get the numbers down and stabilised over the next number of weeks.  It remains the Government's position.<\/p> <p> On the winter initiative, we are also looking at increased and enhanced community provision around community diagnostics and around the prevention area in terms of community respiratory clinics.  This is to prevent people having to be admitted to hospitals in the first instance and particularly to accident and emergency departments.  That is our overarching agenda, along with the home care hours.  There will be a very substantial number of home care packages this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900006#D00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601384100,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I say the following genuinely and I hope the Taoiseach takes it in that spirit.

I welcome the Taoiseach's comments.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless I am concerned about what the Taoiseach said about non-Covid health services.  We cannot have a position of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  We have to diagnose people with cancer or coronary issues.  Capacity issues arise because of Covid-19 but we cannot have one or the other, especially when it comes to issues like those I mentioned.  It cannot be one or the other; we must deal with both.  Otherwise, the number of people who will die from non-Covid diseases will be more than those who die from Covid-19.  I suspect that could be the case already but we do not know.  Honestly, I do not know and neither does the Taoiseach.  It is why I am asking him to revert with those figures.<\/p>  <p>  I am saying this genuinely as too many consultants and people working in the HSE have said the same to me that I have decided to say to the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il.

By the way, we can stabilise the numbers and get them down.  We will do our best at the Government level.  I know the deputy Chief Medical Officer and his team will do likewise, as will the HSE.  This is important.<\/p>  <p>  We know from experience that too many people up to now and in previous winters were in acute beds for far too long.  When the acute phase of treatment was over, hospitals found it very difficult to find suitable placements, particularly when it came to rehabilitation.  Some 631 additional rehabilitation beds will be provided up to April 2021 as a key mechanism to ensure people can leave hospital promptly when their treatment is over to go to a suitable placement for treatment afterwards.  Approximately 4.76 million additional home care hours will be provided, which is also important, as are the additional acute beds in general hospitals and additional intensive care unit capacity.<\/p>  <p>  We will also utilise the private sector for diagnostics and operations for public patients over the next number of months.  I take the Deputy's point and the objective is to manage Covid-19 while also dealing with the non-Covid cases.  In the original lockdown period, for a variety of reasons, we could not do that but on this occasion we will go for it and attempt to do it.  Its success will be dependent on strict adherence to Covid-19 guidelines and getting the numbers down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900007#E00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1601384100,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Waiting lists are at a record high.  It is all well and good to have a winter plan but we are still waiting for the detail of that plan and what will happen in each of our hospitals around the country.  It is difficult to see how our hospitals will cope this winter as some are already struggling and it is still only September and we are facing into a second wave of Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  At the last Leaders' Questions session I contributed to in July, I spoke about a number of practical measures that could be taken to relieve this pressure.<\/p> <p> Patients are also waiting longer for tests.  Since April, during a period when only those who are really concerned with their health have gone to the doctor, 38 people have been added every single day to the waiting list for CT scans, MRI scans and other tests.  These people are waiting in constant pain.  Because of their delayed diagnosis, many will have very poor medical outcomes.  We need proactive measures aimed at treating patients as efficiently as possible and we can do this by taking some simple actions.<\/p> <p> As an example, I refer to the CT scanner at Portiuncula University Hospital in Ballinasloe, which has been out of action for 144 hours this month alone.  Despite this being the tenth time that it has broken down in the past 18 operational months, the HSE has confirmed that it will not be replaced until some time in 2022.  It is 63rd on the list for replacement, even though it has been out of warranty sine 2017.  Where is the logic in that?  These machines are breaking down in hospitals throughout the country.  This impacts on our waiting lists and adds to the overcrowding in emergency departments.  A perverse example of what is wrong with our health service is provided by a CT scanner just down the road in Roscommon University Hospital.  It can cater for many more patients but uses a different software system from the one in Ballinasloe.  This is despite the fact that for the past eight and a half years both hospitals have been meant to be working together closely as part of the same hospital group.  Is it not about time we had a small bit of joined-up thinking and started to get the basic things right?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900007#E00400","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601384400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I am not responsible for operational decisions at the level of individual CT scanners, but I do not accept that this issue must wait until 2022.  I will talk to the Minister for Health and the HSE about what is going on there.  To be fair to all concerned, Roscommon hospital has been advanced in recent years.  There were political rows about emergency departments and election commitments which perhaps were not grounded in the proper medical approach, but nonetheless effective investments were made in Roscommon hospital's outpatient and diagnostics capacity.  There is no reason the CT scanner there should not be used.  The Deputy has identified the issues around the CT scanner in Portiuncula.  It is faulty to say the least and is not operating to satisfactory levels.  It needs replacement, the sooner the better.  I will pursue that issue.<\/p>  <p>  On the wider issue, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, had arranged up to 66,000 outpatient appointments at the end of August.  This supported public hospitals in providing access to diagnostics for patients as well as services for their outpatient departments.  The treatment purchase fund will now work on both the diagnostic and the operational side where outpatients are concerned, and it will work to procure additional private sector capacity where it is required to facilitate increased diagnostics along with procedures.  That will continue.<\/p>  <p>  It has to be said that Covid-19 did impact on the entire health service.  There is no point in pretending that Covid-19 or the lockdown did not happen or that there were not huge restrictions on hospitals which stopped a lot of elective procedures and diagnostics from happening for two or three months.  There has been something of a recovery in that regard, albeit constrained by guidelines provided by public health advice, which is important.  Patient safety in the context of Covid-19 is always at the forefront of these decisions.  Unfortunately this has negatively impacted on throughput, volume of procedures and volume of diagnostics.  Of that there is no doubt.  The work to improve the situation around diagnostics is continuing.<\/p> <p>I know the Deputy has for several years raised the issue of the situation in County Roscommon and the utilisation of the technology there.   He has been pursuing the issue for the past five to six years and may know operationally what is going on there on the ground and be familiar with the inability of the two groups in question to connect more effectively.

It is not just about the lack of upgrading of equipment or the purchase of a software package.  The issue of medical politics is also at play.  After I placed pressure on the then Government in 2015, it eventually installed a state-of-the-art telemedicine rapid access for stroke and neurological assessment, TRASNA, telemedicine stroke machine at Portiuncla University Hospital which would allow doctors at other hospitals to make life-saving stroke diagnoses of patients in Ballinalsoe, thus providing it with a 24-7 stroke service.  However, that never happened because clinicians within the Saolta University Health Care Group would not agree to operate the machine or another machine at Mayo University Hospital.  The same type of machines were installed in hospitals in Mullingar, Kerry and Wexford, as well as in St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny.  How many stroke patients were treated using those machines in those hospitals?

What is the Government's plan in respect of people who get sick in the Killarney area?  Is it telling them not to get sick?  Is it telling people who are getting old and must go into a public nursing home not to get old?

She works in the public sector.  Her husband, who works for himself, has hardly worked since March because he has been minding his intellectually impaired son.  They have three other children but cannot bring them anywhere.  The children must make do and get to matches and other events by themselves.<\/p> <p>They need financial assistance to hire trained people to help them out.  Otherwise, many of these parents will be unable to continue under this pressure.  Their mental health is suffering.<\/p> <p> It is the same with families who have a partner or husband, mother or father, with dementia.  I refer to all the services of the day-care centres that the buses used to bring them to, such as Rockmount in Kilgarvan, four or five days a week.  Such centres are all closed.  There were wonderful highly trained people running all these places - Rathmore, Scartaglin, Castleisland and Knocknagashel.  The closure of these centres placed savage pressure on husbands and wives and sons and daughters.  The Government needs to provide financial assistance for the families.<\/p> <p> We need to talk about home help.  Old people who wanted to stay in their homes as long as possible are not getting the home help they should get.  This is putting more pressure on our hospitals and nursing homes by not providing more home help for them to stay in their homes longer.  That could happen if the services were provided for them.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to do something about these issues that I am raising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900009#G00600","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601385300,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising two issues in his leaders' question.  The first relates to the closure of beds.  I do not know the specific local circumstances of Killarney or, indeed, Columbanus house which the Deputy mentioned.  I met with the HSE for the south region on Friday last.  They said they were actively looking for additional beds, in terms of community nursing beds and rehabilitation beds, with a view to making sure that there were proper placements and appropriate beds, for example, for patients who had left acute hospitals and who needed convalescence or nursing home beds.  It would appear to me that this may be a HIQA reconfiguration where HIQA would say one has to move from the wards to better single-room en suite accommodation.  That has been going on for quite some time and has had an impact on certain centres.  I do not know whether that applies here or not.  What I know is that quite a substantial amount of funding has been provided to enable the HSE in all regions of the country to procure and provide for additional rehabilitation beds and additional beds in nursing homes with a view to making sure that there is a proper flow through our acute hospital system on an ongoing basis from here right through to the middle of next year and beyond.  If the Deputy gives me the details of the specific cases, I will pursue them and get replies for him.  It is more, not less, beds we need to deal with the impact of Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  Second, Covid-19 has had an unfortunate negative impact on the provision of services for adults with disabilities, particularly in terms of day-care services.  Nonetheless, there has been a programme since August of restoring aspects of those disability services for as many people as possible.  For example, 19,000 people with a disability attend the adult day services.  I refer to the disability day-service locations which closed in March.  Day services reopened at approximately 40% capacity throughout August and early September.  The increased funding has been provided already so that the level of service available to people attending adult day services can be increased as well.  Additional funding has been provided in the winter initiative to provide for an additional services and additional volume of services, likewise for school-leavers and also intensive support packages to deliver to quite a number of individuals who are in a chronic situation.  There is quite a number of people in emergency situations which I am particularly concerned about, as are the services on the ground.  We intend to work with the service providers to see can we deal with those emergency situations more effectively than has been the case to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900010#H00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1601385300,"counter":29,"content":"<p>In that case, in relation to the families with children with physical and or mental disabilities, where the Taoiseach cannot provide the service, could he give them financial help so that they themselves could hire somebody because they cannot continue under the pressure they are experiencing at present?<\/p> <p>The district hospital and the Columbanus Home in Killarney are on the same campus.  We read that the Government was going to provide more beds but the opposite is happening in Killarney which only has the one community hospital.

We are told that HIQA has demanded this.  Where was HIQA for the last 20 years, when the same number of people were going?

Yesterday, news broke of a 500-bed co-living development in Smithfield, Dublin 7.  At the latest count, there are almost 4,000 proposed co-living beds planned or in the planning process in Dublin and our other urban centres, which is in stark contrast to the number of planning applications for genuinely affordable homes for working people.<\/p><p>The question is how we got here.  In 2016, in the dying days of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, Deputy Kelly, the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, introduced very controversial legislation that gave, for the first time in modern history, a Minister with responsibility for planning the power to unilaterally introduce changes to planning law without a vote of the Oireachtas.  That very controversial power has been used only twice, both times by Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the subsequent Minister at that Department.  In 2018, he published mandatory ministerial guidelines for apartment dwellings, a copy of which I have to hand.<\/p><p>While the majority of this document was in line with previous guidelines issued by the Department, two substantial changes occurred.  For the first time in planning history, in the modern history of the State, it was permissible to provide homes with personal living space of only 12 sq. m for an individual.  That is the size of a car-parking space.  For couples, the requirement was for personal living space of 18 sq. m.  Of course, there had to be further communal space but we know the problems with that.  The same regulations also introduced build-to-rent design standards that were lower than in the case of apartments currently being built to purchase.  There would be less dual aspect, less storage, more studio apartments, fewer lifts and stairwells and less car-parking space.  For some reason the then Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, thought that if someone was renting, he or she did not deserve the same design quality and quality of living as someone who owns his or her own home.  To be clear, our cities do not need glorified tenements for people.  The idea that someone would spend &euro;1,300 a month to live in a shoebox, without even basic tenancy rights because he or she would be a licensee, beggars belief.<\/p><p>These kinds of developments also have a significant impact on land prices and neighbouring developments.  Take Fumbally Lane in Dublin 8, for example, where a plot of land was bought by a developer for &euro;4 million a number of years ago.  There was a three-storey planning application, with a shop and retail on the ground floor and 35-odd family apartments.  In swooped the Collective, one of the world's leading co-living equity-funded investors, which doubled the price of the land overnight to more than &euro;10 million and then submitted a planning application on exactly the same floor space for 200-plus co-living units.  If anybody thought co-living was a good idea before Covid-19, imagine the idea of 40 or 50 people sharing a kitchen, a leisure space or a workspace.  It simply makes no sense.  These planning policies have significantly shifted investment away from affordable residential homes for working people, which are what we need.<\/p><p>In May last year, the now Taoiseach described such developments as &quot;battery cage-type accommodation&quot;.  He asked whether we were going back to the era of tenements and I could not have agreed with him more.  Two months later, his then Opposition housing spokesperson, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, now the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, stated: &quot;If Leo Varadkar and Eoghan Murphy want this bonkers policy so much, they should co-live together.&quot;  He urged Fine Gael to scrap co-living.  Deputy O'Brien is now the Minister.  He could, on his first day in office, have scrapped these appalling forms of accommodation, but instead he announced a review.  We only subsequently learned, in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>last week, that in fact his review is not focusing on scrapping it but, allegedly, on modifying it to allow multinational corporations to develop it.  A very good freedom of information request by Killian Woods from<i><\/i>the <i>Business Post<\/i>showed that the review has not even commenced.<\/p><p>The Bill seeks to do three things.  It will scrap the controversial power for Ministers to make dramatic changes to planning law without a vote of the Oireachtas, ban co-living and ban substandard design of build-to-rent properties for renters.  These are basic, simple planning regulations.  We need a Government that stands up for renters and working people, not backs the vested interests, real estate investment funds and global equity investors.  On that basis, I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900018#R00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1601389200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900018#R00700","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1601389200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900018#R00800","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601389200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1601389200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900018#R01000","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1601389200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900018#R01100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601389200,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions","time":1601389200,"counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900018#R01300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizens' Assembly","time":1601389200,"counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900018#R01400"},{"type":"question","time":1601389200,"counter":158,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[25030\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900018#R01500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his plans for a new citizens' assembly in 2021.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1601389200,"counter":159,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[26525\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900018#R01600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his plans to establish a citizens' assembly in 2021.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1601389200,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.<\/p>  <p>  Under the programme for Government, the Government is committed to establishing a citizens&rsquo; assembly in 2021 to consider the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin.

The Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy has stated in the House that he has twice written to the Taoiseach to try to find out when the citizens' assembly might take place.  There is a feeling that in the middle of a pandemic, all that momentum for radical drug reform that had been building for years, on issues such as drug use, addiction and recovery, has, unfortunately, been lost.  When the opportunity arose within the programme for Government to announce the potential for a citizens' assembly, it was seized on by those in this area as a great opportunity.

While political parties will do whatever they can to make sure a particular candidate meets the criteria, and while I know it is the agricultural panel, would it not be quite powerful for the Taoiseach to do what he can to ensure that somebody who advocates for drug users and those in recovery could fill that space in the Seanad?  It could be somebody like Tony Geoghegan, Philly McMahon or Peter McVerry.  I know the criteria of the agricultural panel have to be fit, but at the same time, such an appointment would indicate to those who care deeply about this issue that the Government cares deeply about it and that it wants somebody in these Houses who has an intimate understanding of the complexities of it.<\/p> <p> Also, we need to know when the citizens' assembly will sit, because while I can speak about the health elements of this problem, for far too many families there is clearly a violent gang element to it as well, which is literally killing people on the streets in my constituency and throughout the country.

I have brought to his attention that some within the apparatus of the State are less than enthusiastic about that community participation provision.  The Taoiseach has agreed with me on more than one occasion that this participative piece of the strategy is essential in respect of the issue of drugs, drug use and misuse and recovery.  I would also like to know what the plans are for this.  The dangers and harm that drugs can cause are present and real.  Therefore, there is an urgency for individuals and their families as well as for communities, many of which can be readily identified and which have suffered disproportionately from drug use and misuse and from a lack of State support for services and a viable recovery model.  In fact, I represent such communities.<\/p>  <p>  I know we will talk about the Government's shared island unit later.  It is appropriate and obvious at this stage, however, not least because of the position of Boris Johnson, his Government, its Internal Market Bill and all that has arisen around the Brexit discussion and debate, that there is a need to plan in real time for Irish reunification.  By that, I mean there is a need for a real-world discussion around public services, such as the health service, for example, as well as educational provision and the economic model of a reunified Ireland.  All of these are key and critical issues and they will take time to consider and plan for.  I have said to the Taoiseach before that it is a reckless mistake for anyone to bury his or her head in the sand at this point and to try to imagine that profound political change is not under way, because it is, and that will find constitutional expression.  I am raising that matter with the Taoiseach again and I would like him to consider the establishment of a citizens' assembly or a similar mechanism - I do not mind what it is called - that clears the space for that conversation on constitutional change and a reunified Ireland, that brings the conversation beyond politicians and invites the citizenry in its entirety to be part of this conversation, which we know has started in communities across the island in an organic and real way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900019#S00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1601389800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>There is a difficulty with the citizens' assemblies in terms of timing, organisation and logistics because of Covid-19 and that has to be acknowledged.

I will ask my officials to discuss this with other parties and work out the logistical requirements in the context of Covid-19 and essentially in an online format.  For the foreseeable future we are looking at how effective such meetings of citizens' assemblies can be and examining if we can run some in parallel, because there are three to four of them that people would be anxious to have.  Given the slower pace of them, as a result of Covid-19, there will be problems around that.<\/p>  <p>  I want to stress that in no way should that weaken the resolve and the work that is under way in tackling the drugs issue and the issues of recovery and a multidisciplinary response to addiction and recovery that is rooted in community and community participation.  That is still required, irrespective of whether or when we have an assembly.  There should be no let up in advances or progression on a range of issues around that because the world cannot stand still.  We have to keep making decisions and policy, while getting it right with the Citizens' Assembly approach.<\/p>  <p>  On a citizens' assembly on the Good Friday Agreement or on the question of Irish unity, I have set up a shared island unit within the Department of the Taoiseach, which is designed to scope out a range of issues about what it would be like to share this island and to examine how we can best share this island into the future, irrespective of people's views on the constitutional position.  The Good Friday Agreement allowed for that and the genius of it was that it essentially meant we did not have to talk about constitutional issues every single day, and rather we could get to work on putting flesh on the bones of a lot of what is in the agreement.  We have not succeeded in doing that within the institutions themselves because they have been too stop-start from the beginning of the agreement and have been in abeyance and suspended for a lot of the time.<\/p>  <p>  There is a North-South dimension which needs strong momentum and impetus, and that is something I am committed to doing with the existing bodies.  I am also committed to looking at investment in North-South infrastructure, which has been on the agenda for a decade.  We want to take the initiative on that and follow through on the commitments made by the Irish Government in respect of New Decade, New Approach agreement.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lot to be done.  As opposed to grandstanding and indulging in rhetoric all of the time, an awful lot more can be done on putting flesh on the bones of the Good Friday Agreement, making it work and enabling it to work.  In some respects, the North-South bodies have not been given the support and momentum they deserve.  They did great work in the early phase of the Good Friday Agreement.  Waterways Ireland, Tourism Ireland and InterTradeIreland all do effective work, but they need new momentum and an injection of support from all sides.  The Irish Government will not be found wanting in that respect.<\/p>  <p>  Likewise, in terms of health we need to intensify cross-Border co-operation, particularly in paediatric, cancer and oncology services, to a far greater degree than has been done to date.  The community application of information technology, CAIT, initiative is one of the first and original initiatives on a cross-Border basis on health that has been added to in the utilisation of Altnagelvin hospital's oncology services and tertiary services for paediatrics.  There are two fundamentally differently structured health services, however.  In the North, it is essentially the National Health Service as experienced through the UK's historic model, although it is subject to a lot of pressure right now.<\/p> <p>Our model evolved differently because we did not have the same social insurance provisions in post-war Ireland as developed in post-war Britain.  In essence, that allowed for an initial voluntary hospital system to emerge from the beginning of the last century, which was religiously driven by various denominations, and then the State hospitals were introduced with the Health Act 1970.  This involved the expansion of health board hospitals and then State hospitals at St. James's and Beaumont.<\/p> <p> There was a very mixed evolutionary system in the Republic and that needs much reorganisation.  It is a big question in terms of the alignment of that with the structures in the health service in Northern Ireland.  With the shared island unit the idea is that we would commission substantive research to inform our perspectives.  That would be my approach in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900019#S00300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601390400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>We are out of time but I can allow a quick contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900020#T00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1601390400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>As the Taoiseach indicated, we cannot say we will deal with the drugs citizens' assembly question when the Citizens' Assembly meets.

A shared island unit has been established in my Department in support of this commitment and its work is now under way.  The unit&rsquo;s work is being led by an assistant secretary, with two staff appointed and further assignments in train.  The work programme and related resourcing for the unit are being further developed.<\/p>  <p>  The unit will examine the political, social, economic and cultural considerations underpinning a future in which all traditions are mutually respected.  This work will at all times be grounded in the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.  Strengthening social, economic and political links on the island and the promotion of all-island approaches to the strategic challenges facing Ireland, North and South, are key objectives for the unit.<\/p>  <p>  Research and dialogue are also at the core of the unit's work.  It is tasked with working collaboratively across the Government and with research, sectoral, business and community organisations, and with engaging with political and civil society representatives on an inclusive basis.  The unit will seek a broad base of contributions from across society on this island and work to ensure that people who have been proportionally under-represented in the peace process, such as women and new communities on the island, are fully represented.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans for a civic forum or citizens' assembly on the constitutional future of the island.  As I have said, I do not believe that a Border poll could be constructively pursued in the current term of the Government.  It would have a very divisive impact.<\/p>  <p>  The Government respects and affirms everyone&rsquo;s right on the island to make the case for the constitutional future for Northern Ireland they wish to see, whether they are nationalist, unionist or neither.  The Good Friday Agreement and the two sovereign Governments explicitly recognise and validate the legitimacy of both constitutional positions, which are deeply held.  I am and the Government is firmly committed to working towards a consensus on a shared future for the island in which all traditions are mutually respected.  The work of the shared island unit will support this and the Government will listen to and engage with the views of all communities and traditions on the island.<\/p>  <p>  Our approach will at all times be founded on realising the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement to sustain progress, deepen mutual understanding and further reconciliation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900020#T01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1601390400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>It really concerns me and many of the Taoiseach's grassroots and lifelong supporters that nowhere in the 1,900 words of the programme for Government section on the shared island unit does it mention a united Ireland.  That is why many supporters of the Taoiseach's party are leaving and joining Sinn F&eacute;in.  I can only speak from my experience in Mayo on that.<\/p>  <p>  This concerns me as the Taoiseach and his partners in the Government have not acknowledged their constitutional obligation to achieve a united Ireland.  There is no reference to the explicit commitment in the Good Friday Agreement for the referendum on Irish unity.  I have to ask the Taoiseach why that is so.<\/p>  <p>  Despite this, the shared island unit is tasked with a wide range of responsibilities, although I will not name them now.  The shared island unit must be capable of delivering progress in a wide range of areas that needs to be reflective of how it is staffed and resourced.  Expectation of a shared island unit are that it would establish a citizens' assembly, publish a White Paper on Irish unity and facilitate a Oireachtas joint committee to encourage structured dialogue North, South, east and west, which would also involve our diaspora and allow us to discuss how we share and shape this island.<\/p>  <p>  The hour has come for the Taoiseach to show me and people like me from all around the country that a shared island unit is a genuine attempt to unify our island.  The folly of partition is demonstrated over and over again, more recently with Brexit and Covid-19, and dismantling it, while always important, is now urgent.  Before he gives me a lecture about Sinn F&eacute;in having disregard for the Protestant, unionist or loyalist population, I tell the Taoiseach that I am a mother from the far west of Ireland.  I was born in London and I lived a very good part of my life in England.  I want the same opportunities for my sons as do mothers in east Belfast.  I want to see a good a respectful relationship between both our islands that embraces the Irish living in Britain and the British living in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900020#T01900","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1601390400,"counter":185,"content":"<p>There are two very important documents that frame this country.

The truth at the very heart of that document is the idea that the will of the majority of the people of the North of Ireland should direct its future constitutional location.<\/p> <p> I have heard the Taoiseach argue against Irish unity on several occasions, and I have heard him argue against the majority element of the Good Friday Agreement as well.  Why does he oppose elements of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic and elements of the Good Friday Agreement?

It is absolutely logical to be cautious with regard to Irish unity, but the chaos that has been created in our country by the Tory Government, which affects our ability to trade, move people and do business between North and South, must have limits in light of our own self-interest as a nation.  There must be some point on that spectrum where even the Taoiseach would come to the view that Ireland's self-interest makes it logical to set up an all-Ireland forum to which we can bring civic and political views from across the island of Ireland, discuss the best ways to ameliorate the worst excesses of Brexit and start to plan for Irish unity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900020#T02000","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601391000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I have to agree with what several speakers have said.

A huge number of people are now determining that they want to stay within the European Union, and if Irish unity is the way to do it rather than as part of the very dysfunctional so-called United Kingdom, this question may happen faster than anticipated, possibly faster than even we in Sinn F&eacute;in had anticipated or wanted.

Professor Brian MacCraith, former president of Dublin City University,  was appointed as chair of the commission.  The programme for Government has expanded the remit of the commission on the future of Irish public service broadcasting to become the Future of Media Commission, which will consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform-agnostic fashion.  The terms of reference have been amended in light of this expanded remit.<\/p> <p> Today, the Government approved the terms of reference and membership of the Future of Media Commission.  The commission is tasked with proposing how public service broadcasting aims should be delivered in Ireland over the next ten years, how this should contribute to supporting Ireland&rsquo;s cultural and creative sectors, and how this work can be funded in a way that is sustainable, gives greater security of funding, ensures independent editorial oversight and delivers value for money to the public.  The commission is also responsible for making recommendations on RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s role, financing and structure within this framework and how this is overseen and regulated while having regard to our European Union obligations, including the requirements of the revised audiovisual and media services directive.<\/p> <p> The members of the Commission have been selected to capture a range of expertise in the various areas of public service communications and are as follows: chair of the commission, Professor Brian MacCraith, former president of Dublin City University; Sinead Burke, writer and academic active in social media and member of the Council of State; Alan Rusbridger, chair of the steering committee of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford and former editor-in-chief of Guardian News and Media; Lynette Fay, freelance broadcaster with an academic background in applied communications through Gaeilge; Nuala O&rsquo;Connor, co-founder of South Wind Blows and writer and documentary film-maker in the areas of music and the arts; Gillian Doyle, professor of media economics at the University of Glasgow; Mark Little, CEO and co-founder of Kinzen and founder of Storyful, a social news agency; Stephen McNamara, director of communications at the Irish Rugby Football Union; and Dr. Finola Doyle-O&rsquo;Neill, broadcast historian at University College Cork.  Two further proposed members have agreed to serve on the commission, subject to approval by their employers.  Their names will be announced once that approval is obtained.<\/p> <p> It is expected that the commission will engage in wide-ranging consultation with all relevant stakeholders and sectors to ensure that all relevant perspectives are considered in its work.  It is to report within nine months on the necessary measures that need to be taken to ensure there is a vibrant, independent and sustainable public service media for the next generation.  I thank the eminent members of the commission for their commitment to chart the pathway for public service broadcasting and media, particularly Professor Brian MacCraith, who has been an innovator in education and is a pre-eminent intellectual in Irish public life.

This is a genuinely exciting opportunity to shape a new media environment rather than allowing our existing media to be hollowed out by some of the forces of change that are currently at work.

Does he agree that some trends in this area cannot be reversed, such as the decline in the use by younger people of traditional media as well as the growth of global platforms offering a wide array of content?

In concurring with the remarks of Deputy Bruton, I would note that journalism is in a very difficult position, not least in these Houses where it has never been more important to have good journalism.  Anybody who is reading the book \"Champagne Football\" or listening to the online podcasts about George Gibney will know that we need journalism to hold people to account, to find truth and to keep the institutions of the State, and every other institution, honest.  However, even in these Houses it can be seen that many former political commentators have drifted into becoming political advisers because there is a feeling that journalism is not a sustainable profession at this time.  It does not pay well, the hours are unreasonable and there does not seem to be as much of a future in it as may previously have been the case.  That said, a central tenet of any democracy is the ability of journalists to ask questions and find the truth.

They are at the core of our entire democratic system.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the point raised by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in regarding those in the profession of journalism.

As Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in stated, that has impacted on the quality of life of journalists and the quality of the job itself.  It is extraordinary that those currently working in journalism must marry so many different platforms and be on all of them almost simultaneously from morning to night.  It is often the case that when one checks one's Twitter account one sees that a journalist is reporting breaking news.  Journalists are competing to be the first to report breaking news in addition to having to write articles and columns and carry out analysis.  It is an extremely demanding and challenging job.<\/p>  <p>  The financial underpinning of all of this is a significant issue.  Overall, we must accept that editorially independent journalism is essential to underpin our democracy in the modern era.  It is vulnerable to attack from new platforms, as we know from the experiences in other jurisdictions.  The Irish system is no less vulnerable to such attacks than the system in any other jurisdiction, whether at election time or any other time.  That must be kept under review.  Above all, journalism should be financially remunerative.  Those working in the sector should be able to anticipate and aspire to a particular quality of life, but that is becoming more challenging and difficult.<\/p>  <p>  Public service broadcasting is very important.  I agree with Deputy Bruton's observation that Covid-19 has shown public service broadcasting at its best.  It has also shown the extent of the vulnerability of various forms of media.  Local media in particular came under significant threat because of the absolute collapse in advertising during the early phase of the pandemic.  Such organisations are still under pressure as a result of that collapse.  Advertising spend at a national level has been somewhat restored, which is helping broadcasting.<\/p>  <p>  We must be clear about the importance of arts and culture in this area.  The synergies between culture and creative media and broadcast must be explored.<\/p> <p>In terms of the music, I favour the symphony orchestra being separated out but getting ring-fenced funding for the future - it is not quite under the remit of this - as per a previous decision.  We need to clear the demarcation lines but also create synergies between broadcasting, media in general and the arts and culture.  That is why they are all situated within one Department now, which is far better than was the case heretofore.<\/p> <p> I believe we are at a crossroads.  We must be prepared.  In talking of the financing, I have been criticised for believing we should financially underpin our media and we should do it in a way that ring-fences its editorial independence, both in broadcasting and in print media.<\/p> <p> I think we should financially underpin it through a universal approach.  The licence fee, in itself, is not sufficient.  The methodology of collecting it is not sufficient.  Many people are paying it.  Quite a number are not.  That is not fair.  It is also not at present in a position to underpin the quality, breadth and width of public service broadcasting that the State requires to underpin our democracy.  Those are my general views on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900022#V00700","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Special Committee on Covid-19 Response: Motion","time":1601392200,"counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900023#W00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1601392200,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \t&quot;That the Order of the D&aacute;il of 30th July, 2020, relating to the reporting date of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, be amended by the deletion of '30th September, 2020' and the substitution therefor of &quot;7th October, 2020'.&quot; <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900023#W00300","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601392200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601392200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.13 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage","time":1601392500,"counter":236,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900024#Y00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1601392500,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I call on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to move the Second Reading.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900024#Y00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1601392500,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900024#Y00300","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1601392500,"counter":239,"content":"<p>There is 20 minutes for the Government.

I am pleased to have this opportunity to present the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 for the consideration of this House.  All Stages were completed in the Seanad on Friday evening after a comprehensive seven-hour discussion, and I am sure we will have something similar in this House.  I thank the Business Committee of the D&aacute;il for agreeing to waive the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the proposed Bill due to the urgency of the need to introduce this legislation.  The Bill has been in circulation in draft form since the end of July.  A month-long public consultation helped greatly to inform the draft put before the Seanad last week.<\/p>  <p>  As all Deputies will be aware, the forestry sector is experiencing its fair share of challenges in recent times, not least the ongoing difficulties with issuing licences for afforestation, roads and felling.  I am acutely aware of these issues, and my first and most pressing priority is to ensure we have an efficient and functioning licensing system.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for land use, biodiversity and forestry, I am enormously keen to shape the future of Irish forestry to ensure delivery for the environmental, social and economic well-being of our country.  The programme for Government is ambitious for forestry, with over 15 proactive, close-to-nature forestry commitments.  I am determined to work with all stakeholders to achieve that ambition.  My commitment, and that of the Government, to that ambition is unequivocal.  However, first we must overcome the current difficulties and get the licensing system functioning for all.  The reasons for the delays in issuing licences are well documented at this stage and have required the most fundamental changes to our licensing system in its history.<\/p>  <p>  As I am sure Deputies will be aware, there is a crisis in the forestry sector.  The licensing and appeals system has come under significant pressure in the last two years.  Not only are there delays in issuing licences due to the licensing process itself, which my Department is addressing and to which I will speak later, but there are also long delays in determining appeals against licences issued.  It is fair to say that the appeals system, and the forestry appeals committee, FAC, is currently overwhelmed.  The delays being experienced are unfair to both applicants and appellants.  A timely and efficient appeals process is needed, and that is why this Bill is being introduced.  The Bill includes a suite of measures, which will deliver a much more efficient and effective process and will meet and balance the needs of all.<\/p>  <p>  I will give Deputies some background information on the licensing system that is in place for afforestation, tree felling, forest roads and aerial fertilisation.  My Department is the sole licensing authority for such licences and it determines all forestry licence applications at first instance.  All licences must be issued in compliance with EU and national environmental legislation, including the 1992 EU habitats directive.  An Taisce, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and other bodies are statutory consultees on licence applications.  The current licence procedures allow submissions by third parties at application stage and provide for appropriate consultations with any relevant consultation bodies.  Applicants and third parties dissatisfied with a licence decision of the Minister may submit an appeal on that decision to the FAC within 28 days of the decision.  There has been an upward trend in the numbers of licences being appealed, with 14 licences appealed in 2017, 105 in 2018, 235 in 2019 and 402 to date in 2020.  While the FAC has increased the number of decisions issued year on year, with 31 in 2018, 55 in 2019 and 172 so far this year, it is simply not keeping pace with the appeals received.  Approximately 490 cases are awaiting the decision of the FAC at present.<\/p>  <p>  I have been engaging intensively with all relevant stakeholders on these issues.  I have met with the environmental pillar, with Forest Industries Ireland and with other groups.  I have had correspondence from many frustrated farmers who are confused about why they cannot get a licence to plant a native woodland or take out dead and dying trees from their forests.  The delays in issuing licences have led to serious difficulties for people working in the forestry industry.  If action is not taken quickly, we could face the prospect of sawmills running out of timber and of significant job losses.  While delays in hearing appeals affect the quantity of timber being felled and transported to sawmills, they are also influencing planting rates.  To date, my Department has supported the establishment of just 1,941 ha of new afforestation this year, which is down 35% on this time last year.  This is well off any afforestation targets we have set, and it needs to be rectified.<\/p>  <p>  Before I move on to the specific provisions of the Bill and the public consultation process undertaken, I want to say that the Bill is not being delivered in isolation.  We are also addressing the other issues and delays with forestry licensing.  It must be acknowledged that decisions on granting licences have been too slow, and we now have a significant backlog of applications.  This arose in response to a substantial change in our appropriate assessment procedures, which deal with the impact of projects on sensitive European sites.  We have completely overhauled our assessment process, which is now robust and responsive to the environment in which we operate.  This has meant that the Department has had to revise procedures, increase resources, develop training and guidance, and strengthen its ecology team.  While this has taken time, we now have a sustainable system and we are tackling the backlog through a dedicated project plan, which operates to key performance indicators.  A project manager is in place and a project management board is overseeing and monitoring delivery weekly.  This plan is already yielding progress, with the number of felling licences issued in August being the highest in the previous 13 months in both volume and area.<\/p>  <p>  The action taken in improving the number of licences issued must be matched by a responsive appeals system or an even bigger bottleneck will develop at appeals stage.  That is why this Bill is so important.  In order to ensure full public participation with these proposals, the draft Bill was published and open to consultation for four weeks.  I very much welcome the fact that almost 9,000 submissions were received by the closing date.  This shows that this is an issue is of intense public interest.  The vast majority of the submissions, approximately 81%, indicated support for the Bill.  The submissions received have been examined and categorised in terms of who made the submission, that is, industry, private, public representatives or other, and whether the submission was in favour or opposed to the draft Bill.  The submissions were also grouped and analysed based on the Bill head and section being addressed.  A copy of a report summarising the main outcomes of the public consultation, which was made available last week, provides an overview of the submissions made.  Careful consideration was given to the suggestions made, and as a result the draft Bill was updated to take account of the feedback received and presented to the Seanad last week.  All submissions will be published in due course on my Department's website in a suitable format that meets GDPR requirements.<\/p> <p>My Department is working hard to complete this as quickly as possible, hopefully very soon.  <br\/><br\/>The main provisions set out in the Bill include increasing the capacity of the forestry appeals committee to determine appeals by enabling it to sit in divisions of itself; enabling the committee to determine appeals without an oral hearing where it is possible to properly dispose of an appeal in that manner; providing the Minister with the regulation making power to specify, among other things, the procedures to apply in relation to appeals and for related forestry appeals committee matters generally; and introducing reasonable fees for appeals.  <br\/><br\/>Updates that have been made to the Bill to take into account suggestions made during the public consultation process are as follows.  It makes no change to the right of applicants and all third parties to appeal directly to the forestry appeals committee.  The removal of this &quot;relevant person&quot; provision will allow direct access to all.  It sets the quorum requirement for the forestry appeals committee at two, to consist of a chairperson or deputy chairperson, or a deputy chairperson is designated, and at least one ordinary member in order to increase the efficiency of the committee.  It provides that licensing decisions may be affirmed, varied, set aside and returned to the Department.  This brings clarity to the role of the forestry appeals committee.  It requires that all information and documentation must accompany an appeal in order to be valid.  This is to ensure the efficient functioning of the committee.  It provides clarity as to the circumstances in which the Minister might issue a general policy directive, that is, when prioritising certain classes of appeal having regard to the need to an ensure economically and environmentally yield of forest goods and service in the State.<br\/><br\/>These provisions were the subject of an informed and robust debate in the Seanad last week, where Senators put forward a large number of amendments to the Bill.  These were organised into 14 groups, and I accepted two amendments in that House to which I would like to draw Members' attention.  Text was added under section 2 at page 3, after line 26, which states that: &quot;A copy of the report will at the same time be made available to the public on the Government of Ireland website and the Government publications office.&quot;  I was more than happy to accept this change, which offers the widest possible visibility for the annual report of the chairperson of the forestry appeals committee.  Under section 3 at page 8, the text at 14D (2) was replaced with: &quot;When making a directive under this section, the Minister shall have regard to the need to support economically and environmentally sustainable forest goods and services in the State.&quot;  This text better reflects what the Minister must have regard to when issuing a directive to the forestry appeals committee to prioritise certain classes of appeal.<br\/><br\/>I firmly believe that all these amendments are necessary to remove the current delays being experienced in the system and to reduce decision times in the forestry licensing system overall.<br\/><br\/>I will now go through the Bill in detail.  Section 1 deals with definitions of the Forestry Act 2014 and the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001.  Section 2 amends section 14 of the Act of 2001.  It provides for the chairperson of the forestry appeals committee to make an annual report to the Minister of his or her activities and of the activities of the committee, and for copies of that report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, to be published on <i>Gov.ie<\/i>and be made available in the Government Publications Office.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 covers the amendment of section 14A of the Act of 2001.  It provides for the appointment of deputy chairpersons to the forestry appeals committee and for the committee to sit in divisions of itself.  It also provides for the committee to have a quorum of two, for a time limit of 28 days to lodge an appeal, and for the deletion of the provision that a decision of the forestry appeals committee may be appealed to the High Court on any question of law.<br\/><br\/>Section 4 deals with further amendments to the Act of 2001.  It includes provisions for procedures and arrangements for the conduct of appeals, including oral hearings, and for the types of decisions the forestry appeals committee may make.  It allows the Minister to issue general directives as to policy prioritising certain classes of appeal.  It enables the Minister to make regulations having regard to the efficiency of the system of appeals, and the publication of documents relating to appeals on the forestry appeals committee website.  It also gives the Minister the power to prescribe fees, by regulation.<br\/><br\/>Section 5 amends the Act of 2014 and allows for the publication of application documents on the Department's website.  It also deletes certain sections of the Act, so that the making of regulations to prescribe fees follow the procedures outlined in the Act of 2001.<br\/><br\/>Section 6 outlines the transitional provisions for the coming into operation of the provisions of the Bill.  In effect operational matters in relation to composition of the committee come into effect immediately on enactment of the Bill, as do directives from the Ministers.  Fees may be imposed on licences made on or after the Bill comes into operation.<br\/><br\/>While we must recognise the current difficulties, we must also look towards the future of forestry, and how the planting of the right tree in the right place can best serve the environmental, social, and economic needs of our society.  We have, however, a long way to go on delivering on these needs.  Forestry has a vital role to play in climate action and in dealing with biodiversity decline.  Getting this model right will be my primary focus.  Any new national forestry programme must deliver on these objectives, and I am committed to the development of an ambitious new programme, one which unites communities, protects habitats, delivers a measurable response to climate change, while supporting important rural jobs, and a vibrant timber sector.  This will not be an easy task, but I ask each and every Member to work with me on this.<br\/><br\/>I assure Deputies that this Bill will bring important efficiencies, proper procedures, and operational clarity to all stages of the forestry licence appeals process.  It will provide for forestry licence appeals to be conducted in a fair, straightforward and timely fashion.  While this Bill will not change the situation overnight, it will, along with our project plans for managing the licensing backlog, greatly improve the overall system, and will result in an increase in the number of licences available for planting and felling, and as a consequence will project jobs within the forestry sector.  In that spirit, I look forward to our debate of its provisions, and the reforms which it can put in place, and I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900024#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Senator Pippa Hackett)","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601393100,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be here today to support my colleague, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, as she introduces this forestry Bill to the House.  I echo her words of gratitude to the Opposition for working with us in recognition of the urgency of the legislation for the forestry sector and to work with us in ensuring the Bill could be accommodated in the Seanad last week and in the D&aacute;il this week.  We do not take that co-operation lightly and are very appreciative of it.<\/p>  <p>  Before turning to the Bill itself, I would like to say something about the forestry sector and our plans for its expansion.  I do not have to tell the House that we have ambitious plans, that can be seen in the programme for Government.  We want to expand afforestation beyond the current level of 11%, to deliver on the target of 8,000 ha per year.  In doing so, we want to plant diverse and resilient forests.  These will include all types of forestry - productive, mixed, native woodlands and recreational forests.  We want to promote sustainable forest management.  We want to grow healthy forests which will sustain our timber industry, an industry which supports many jobs in our rural communities.  Equally we want healthy and expanding forests to contribute to our climate change, biodiversity, and societal goals.  <\/p>  <p>  Forestry is an integral part of our response to the climate change challenge as recognised in the 2019 climate action plan, which is currently under revision.  It also has a role to play in contributing to halting the loss of biodiversity, as outlined in the national biodiversity plan.  It is all about having a forestry system which contributes to our aims as a society.  After all, forests and woodlands are multifunctional.  Productive forests produce an economic good, which those who have invested land in forestry over many years depend upon.  These forests provide jobs for those who plant, who harvest and who work in sawmills.  Then there are the pallets, building materials and other wood-based products produced at the end of the process, which we all use and need.<\/p>  <p>  Forests also occupy wonderful community and recreational spaces in many parts of the country.  My Department&rsquo;s NeighbourWood scheme has brought communities together to revitalise and plant woodlands, solely for recreational use.  These are collaborative efforts which promote a healthy enjoyment of the outdoors, for all age groups.  This is something which has taken on even more importance during these times.  I am sure everyone agrees that a stroll through our nearby woodland is good for both the heart and the soul.<\/p>  <p>  Our native woodlands are also a source of pride and I am more than pleased that the area being planted with our native species is on the rise.  These are biodiversity hotspots and as part of the Host a Hive initiative align with the national pollinator plan.<\/p> <p> Farm forestry is something that I am keen to see more of, as trees in a farmland setting can deliver many benefits.  Shelterbelts can provide shelter for animals and from wind.  When sensitively planted near rivers, they can prevent erosion and flooding.  They can contribute to water quality and to our Water Framework Directive obligations.  Trees planted in the right place can also provide connectivity corridors for wildlife.<\/p> <p> I am acutely aware that we must promote forests that respond to the evolving needs of our society.  This will be the aim of the new forestry programme and strategy.  The strategy will be a shared endeavour requiring action from public bodies, landowners, foresters, communities and businesses.<\/p> <p> Before we get to that point, however, we need a properly functioning licensing and appeals system.  Every tree planted, every tree felled and every forest road built must have a licence.  As all in the House know, these licences are not available because of delays in the licensing and appeals system.  This situation is unsustainable and no encouragement to anyone who wishes to plant.  In fact, because of these delays, the very future of the sector is at risk, with jobs in sawmills up and down the country under pressure as a result.  That is why the Bill is so important and urgently needed.<\/p> <p> My Department is beginning to address the delays in issuing licences, but good progress being made is being hampered by long delays in dealing with appeals.  This serves neither the landowner nor the appellant.  Each has a right to a timely decision from the forestry appeals committee.<\/p> <p> I fully support the changes proposed in the Bill.  They are suitable to the task at hand, that of improving the functioning of the appeals system.  A committee that can sit in divisions, ensure that relevant information is provided when an appeal is lodged and charge a reasonable fee are all sound provisions.<\/p> <p> The independence of the committee in dealing with individual cases is fully protected in this Bill, as is the right of any party to appeal directly to the committee.  While I welcome the option I have of prioritising certain classes of appeal, it is not something that I would take lightly.  To be clear, I may direct the committee to hear certain classes of appeal, but I may not interfere in an individual appeal in any way.<\/p> <p> The importance of this issue has been more than demonstrated by the level of response to the public consultation.  People wish to see the system fixed quickly.  We can move closer to that aim by bringing the Bill to a conclusion.<\/p> <p> I look forward to the Bill being considered in more detail in the House today and tomorrow, as was the case in the Seanad.  I commend the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, on her sterling work in introducing the Bill and, importantly, working with departmental officials on making a strong effort to get the Bill processed in a prompt fashion, with the co-operation of the Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900025#Z00200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601393700,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I bring apologies from Deputy Carthy, who is unable to attend.  I commend the Minister and Minister of State.  This is the first time that I have spoken in their presence and I congratulate them on their appointments.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises the importance of this legislation and welcomes that the Government is seeking to address the existential crisis facing the forestry industry.  The challenge the sector is facing is one that can now be measured in weeks.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have played our part in helping to bring this legislation to the floor in a timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  The Government must recognise and accept how this crisis came to be.  Last December, the then Minister, former Deputy Creed, spoke of being involved in a \"major triage operation\" regarding the building backlog in the forestry sector.  He spoke of recruiting additional staff and external environmental consultants, all of which we now know amounted to nothing.  By May, the then Minister was describing the backlog as temporary and unavoidable.  The reason for the crisis in our forestry industry is not one of too much democratic political participation, but of a lack of political will and interest in dealing with the issue.  Interest in rural Ireland is something that this Government has shown little of.  We have now reached this crisis point.<\/p>  <p>  That the Bill allows the forestry appeals committee to meet in divisions is to be welcomed and is the primary mechanism through which the backlog can be addressed.  Upon the passing of the Bill, the Government will be promptly tested.  It is incumbent upon the Government to ensure that the additional staff and resources that the forestry appeals committee needs are put in place urgently.  We can discuss the amount of appeals coming in and the reasons for same, but the real test will be the Government clearing the backlog, getting the timber industry, including sawmills, back to work as quickly as possible and ensuring that jobs are not lost.<\/p>  <p>  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have several concerns regarding the Bill.  It places too much discretion in the hands of the Minister and may limit ordinary citizens' access to the appeals process.  We have engaged constructively with the legislation and are seeking to address these concerns, which are shared by many, through the amendments that we have tabled.  This is not our preferred manner to legislate, however.  In particular, that amendments were required to be submitted for consideration today prior to the Seanad voting is a procedure that the Government must not believe will be welcomed as common practice.<\/p>  <p>  Our amendments will not seek to impinge upon any aspect of the legislation that seeks to address the existing backlog or even the way that appeals will be handled.  We seek only to add safeguards to ensure that any citizen may engage in the process freely, as is citizens' right.  We would extend the period wherein an appeal could be lodged to a reasonable six weeks.  We wish for the time a person has to appeal to be counted from when public notice of a licence is granted rather than when the decision is made.  We want to ensure that people appointed to the forestry appeals committee are suitably qualified.  We seek to ensure that ordinary people can engage in the appeals process without prejudice.  These amendments are reasonably worded and we appeal to the Government to recognise not only the rights of citizens to engage in the process, but also its own obligation to safeguard and ensure those rights.<\/p>  <p>  While the Minister and Minister of State may correctly point out the potential benefits of the new online portal that the Government is bound to make available, they will be aware of significant concerns that the portal will not be available for some time.  If use of this portal can deliver documents and materials critical to appeals in a timely manner, it would play an important role in making the appeals process more efficient.  What is not tenable is limiting people's ability to appeal today on the promise that a separate future appeal might be more streamlined.  I expect that the Minister and Ministers of State will give some undertaking that this portal will be available before any constraint is placed on appellants.<\/p>  <p>  Much of the discretion provided to the Minister within the Bill is unnecessary and a cause of concern.  I call on the Government to accept our amendments to rectify this.  The Minister is empowered to reduce the period wherein an appeal may be lodged but is prohibited from extending it.  To us, this is bizarre.  In addition, the discussion around fees in the Bill has often missed the point.  The Bill repeals the Minister's existing ability to introduce fees and then reintroduces it in a separate section, but with one key difference; the Minister will no longer have to justify these fees to the D&aacute;il.  I urge the Government to accept our modest amendments to place a cap on fees and mandate the Minister to provide a refund in cases where an appeal is upheld.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is imperfect, but by engaging with the Opposition constructively we can pass legislation that will allow for the existing backlog to be cleared in a timely manner without impinging on the rights of citizens.<\/p>  <p>  With the new forestry programme due in 2021, the Government will have an opportunity to shape Irish forestry policy for several years.  A proper forestry policy should deliver for everyone.  It should be of benefit to the community, the local economy and the environment.  A forest should be an amenity, somewhere people want to live near.  This means greater diversity requirements in afforestation, more native species and less Sitka spruce.  While the conifer may be the most commercially viable in the short term, the resulting monoculture provides none of the ancillary benefits while damaging soil in the long run.<\/p>  <p>  It is known that much of the cause of the backlog is opposition to forestry policy in general rather than individual operations.  Upon the passing of the Bill, while the Government's first duty is to clear the existing backlog promptly, its second duty and opportunity are to develop a new forestry policy that provides broader benefits not only for today, but tomorrow.  The Government should bring a new forestry programme to both Houses of the Oireachtas in a prompt manner, accompanied by further legislation to address the outstanding concerns and do so as a matter of priority.<\/p>  <p>  We will be supporting the substantive motion before the House in order to save rural jobs and ensure that the forestry industry can continue to operate, but the Government must live up to its part and ensure that rural Ireland can be made vibrant once again.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister and Minister of State will be aware, I represent County Leitrim, where up to 50% of the land available for forestry is under Sitka spruce primarily.  This frustrates and annoys the communities living in the areas in question.  Many years ago, I spoke to a man in Ballinamore.<\/p> <p>It was the evening and the lights were coming on as darkness fell.  He pointed to the mountain behind the town and said he remembered when there were hundreds of lights on the mountain and that the only thing there now was trees.  That is what is happening, not just in mountainous and hilly areas but in every part of County Leitrim.  It is really frustrating for farmers who want to buy a piece of land beside their farm but cannot do so because they are outbid by big corporations which purchase it for investment purposes and then plant it.  It is an issue that is extremely sore and annoying for people living in rural areas.<\/p> <p> My own parish has seen huge amounts of forestry development.  The local school has had its number of teachers reduced from three to two this year because there are so few families living there.  When I look at the horizon beyond my house, more than three quarters of it is made up of conifers.  Where the land is planted, there is no longer any need for the farmer.  There are no cattle on the land and no need for the vet to come out.  There is no tractor to be fixed and no roof to be put on a shed because there is no need for a shed.  There is no need for anything really.  As far as the community is concerned, that piece of land has become sterile.  There will be a lot of activity on it for three weeks every ten or 12 years when the trees are cut and drawn away but then there is nothing again for years.<\/p> <p> There is a really deep problem which the Government must address.  If we are going to have parts of the country under large amounts of afforestation, something must be done to replace the communities that are being displaced by that afforestation.  We see in those same parts of the country that people cannot get planning permission to build a house.  When that point is raised, the answer is often given that they should go and live in a town.  My parish does not have a town, nor do the parishes that surround it.  We live in a rural area with dispersed communities and there is no town.  Those communities have survived for centuries and can survive again if the Government would take the interest to ensure they are provided with the resources to be able to continue.<\/p> <p> Afforestation is a huge problem for many parts of rural Ireland but it should be a huge opportunity.  The difference is in whether the Government puts the right policies in place.  The policies in place at the moment are only about big corporate interests and being able to produce the maximum amount of timber off the worst kind of land as fast as possible to make the maximum amount of profit.  Everyone else can just stand by and watch as their community dwindles in front of them.  That is what I have seen happen and we must do something about it.  We will support this legislation to ensure the blockade is stopped and people who have forests grown can cut the timber.  The timber has to be got out and those jobs must be sustainable.  We recognise that and it is fine.  However, the other side of the issue is not being addressed with any urgency at all.  On my first day in the House I pointed out that we have a huge problem in that we are not delivering for rural Ireland.  That is not happening at all.<\/p> <p> If we are going to move forward on these issues, to look at all the factors in the round and ensure we deliver for people in rural areas, we have to recognise the problems that exist.  We must recognise, first of all, that the level of grant aid that has been given for afforestation to people who are not farmers must be different from the level of grant aid given to people who are farmers.  It was the case in the past that farmers got a higher level of grant aid.  If they had a small piece of land of poor quality which they wanted to plant, there was an opportunity to do so.  Now the same level of grant aid is offered to the investor who comes from wherever.  That has created a completely unfair scenario.  These people come with very deep pockets and can offer bids for land that put it out of the reach of any local person.  That is a huge problem.  At the same time, there are many wealthy Irish people who come together and invest in these companies to provide a pension fund.  They buy farms and land in places like Leitrim and plant them.  They do not know, understand or care what that does to the local community.  That is fine and understandable.  The Government should know, understand and care about the impact on communities, but that does not seem to be the case.  The Minister and Minister of State have an opportunity to do something about that responsibility.<\/p> <p> Another problem that has been arising for years in many parts of rural Ireland, particularly in counties like Leitrim where there is poor infrastructure, is that roads are being decimated by forest operations.  Part of the problem is that forestry is treated as an agricultural crop.  Every other agricultural crop grows in a year or two years, but this particular crop takes 40 years to grow and is harvested in a couple of weeks.  During those couple of weeks, thousands of tonnes of materials are coming out across small county roads which simply cannot sustain the load and are being crushed beneath it.  Local authorities are putting weight restrictions on those loads and trying every way they can to put pressure on the forestry companies to come up with answers to the problem.  What is really needed is for the Government put a fund in place to enable local authorities to replace the roads.  A simple solution that has been proposed is that a small portion of the grant aid to afforestation should be set aside for such a fund.  The hauliers will undoubtedly argue that they pay road tax and they have a point in that regard.  They are entitled to have good roads in place.  At the end of the day, the problem we have is that the weight of the forestry loads simply cannot be sustained by the roads on which they are being transported.<\/p> <p> Another huge problem is one that has been raised with me by people in the tourism industry.  In different parts of the country, formerly magnificent scenic views have been totally blocked out by a wall of dark green forest.  A tree is small when it is planted but it is 12 ft or 14 ft within a couple of years and 40 ft by the time it is ready to be cut.  It is like building a wall around a whole community and sometimes the trees are very close to people's houses.  My view is that anybody proposing an afforestation project of more than 5 ha should have to apply to the local authority for planning permission.  Any such project involves a permanent change of land use and a permanent change to the landscape.  I introduced legislation in the previous D&aacute;il to give effect to that provision and I intend to put it forward again in this D&aacute;il.  I hope the Government will co-operate with me and look seriously at the proposal.<\/p> <p> On Leitrim County Council, all political parties, including Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, Independent representatives and the CEO agree that we need to have a planning permission requirement for forestry.  There is also concern among local authority members about the amount of run-off coming from forestry.  An acidic sap that comes out of the trees in October and November is getting into the water and causing a lot of pollution.  In fact, the council tells me that apart from farmyard pollution, forestry is the next highest contributor to pollution in County Leitrim.  It will be the same in many other counties if the intention is to expand the amount of land planted.  There are consequences to that expansion and those consequences need to be examined and preparations made to mitigate them.  We must work with people to ensure the D&aacute;il is not still debating these issues in 20 years' time because some other problem has been created by poor foresight at this time.<\/p> <p> The answers to all of these problems are most likely to be found among the people who live in these areas and are dealing with the problems.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in particular to talk to people.  The Green Party and many other environmental interests in County Leitrim are absolutely in tune with everything I am saying in this regard.  They understand the problems and they see the way that conifer planting has destroyed communities.  There is little use in somebody who lives far away telling us that trees are lovely and we should plant loads of them.  Unfortunately, it is not as simple as that and we must work through the problems that are created by these issues.<\/p> <p> One of the biggest problems is the change of land ownership.  In places like County Leitrim, land is moving out of the hands of the community and into the hands of corporate interests.  If it does not happen at the beginning, it happens towards the end.  Farmers decide to plant their land and for 15 years they will get a premium on it.  By that stage, they are getting a little older, they might need a hip replacement or whatever else, and they need to get a few bob together.  They get the thinnings out of it but there is no more premium coming and it will be another 20 years before they see another bob.  It is at this point that the company which brought away the thinnings may offer to buy the whole lot, and that is when the land transfers from local to corporate ownership.  The same thing is happening all over the place.  In some instances, the land is bought by corporate interests in the beginning and ends up under forestry.<\/p> <p> These issues must be dealt with and I hope that happens in the next forestry programme.  There are also issues around agroforestry and how it is operating.  There is talk of only having six years of payment for agroforestry, which is nothing near what is needed.  The issues around forestry are not just to do with how big companies are being allowed to go in, cut fast, get the product out and then replant.  The issues are also around communities of people and rural neglect, and those are the issues that need to be dealt with first.  When that is done and people have confidence, they will embrace forestry.  Their problem is not with forestry itself but with the consequences of it.  In my community, as in many communities throughout the country, people have a very negative experience of those consequences.<\/p> <p> I understand the motivation behind this legislation.  We know why these changes have to happen, but we also know that a lot more needs to be done in dealing with this sector.  We will support the Bill.  I hope the amendments we have put forward will be accepted by the Government and will help to bring a new day for the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900026#AA00200","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1601394900,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Glaoim ar an Teachta Mair&eacute;ad Farrell anois.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900028#CC00100","nonspeaker":"Leas-Cheann Comhairle"},{"type":"speech","time":1601394900,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle agus leis na hAir&iacute; freisin.

It is welcome that this situation is being discussed in the Chamber as it affects the lives and livelihoods of people across the State, especially in our rural areas, as my colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, has outlined.  The backlog of appeals has had a major impact on the industry and, as a result, the industry has faced a crisis.  We know that this is not resolved, by January at the latest Ireland will need to import timber.  In all likelihood, that will happen even earlier.<\/p><p>The issue was ignored by the previous Government, even though it has been on the cards since December of last year when it was highlighted in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal.  <\/i>This once again highlights the lack of planning by successive Governments for rural Ireland.  These areas have also been severely impacted economically by Covid-19.<\/p><p>The establishment of the divisions is welcome but we need to ensure there is no delay in setting them up, and we must ensure the divisions are adequately resourced.  A key concern Sinn F&eacute;in has with the Bill is that there is no explicit requirement for those appointed to the divisions by the Minister to have relevant expertise.  I hope the Government sees sense on this issue and will support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to ensure members have expertise in biodiversity, water quality, climate change and environmental legislation.<\/p><p>As I said earlier, it is essential that we deal with this matter here today.  It is vitally important that Sinn F&eacute;in amendments to this Bill are taken into consideration and supported by the Government to ensure the best possible outcome for the sector and, of course, the communities and the people affected by the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900028#CC00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1601394900,"counter":248,"content":"<p>T&aacute;imid ag bogadh ar aghaidh anois go dt&iacute; P&aacute;irt&iacute; an Lucht Oibre.

M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I rise to support the Bill.  I welcome the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and I congratulate them on their appointments.<\/p><p>The issues are well articulated.  My colleague, Senator Annie Hoey, articulated the Labour Party position in the Seanad.  While the legislation is necessary, it gives rise to many questions, one of which is forestry policy in its totality.  The Labour Party is not convinced that this Bill alone is the answer or the panacea to the problems that exist within the forestry sector at present.  I believe the Minister and the Minister of State acknowledge there are problems inherent with the process.  We need to have these issues rectified if we are serious about ensuring we have a seamless, fit-for-purpose forestry sector that recognises the challenges of afforestation and increasing beyond 11% the rate of cover.  We must also recognise that the process of applying for licences is clearly not fit for purpose.  We need to investigate further after this legislation is passed, and presumably it will, why the process is not working.  We are all aware, across the party divide in the House, that it is not fit for purpose currently.<\/p><p>I ask that a lot of energy is given to ensuring that once the Bill passes, there is a root and branch review of policy in general so the requisite staff are appointed and the requisite whole-time equivalents are appointed.  We are told that additional staff are being appointed within the forestry service but we do not have a clear number of staff and the type of staff that are being appointed.  Much of the work could be done internally on the licence screening process, with regard to triage of applications and in the assessment of the ecological or environmental impact elements, without diminishing the right of anybody to appeal.<\/p><p>There is much in this legislation that gives voice to regulations that will have to come into force after the Bill has passed.  The Labour Party is worried about the number of regulations, as articulated in the proposed new section 14E.  I would dearly love the Minister of State to respond specifically to the point I am about to make.  I note that her officials are present.  Section 14E provides for 14 regulations that must come into force.  For this legislation to be taken seriously, the question that arises is when this will happen.  What is the timeframe for bringing those regulations into force once the legislation has passed?  According to the proposed new section 14E(1):<\/p> <blockquote> \tWithout prejudice to the generality of sections 7(2) and 15, for the purpose of the conduct of appeals, and having regard to the need for efficiency in the system of appeals, the Minister may make regulations to provide for all or any of the following: <\/blockquote>  <p>The section goes on to list potential areas of regulation in subsections (a) through to (n), providing, <i>inter alia<\/i>, for &quot;time limits to apply to the making and conduct of appeals&quot;; &quot;the constitution of divisions of the Forestry Appeals Committee and the assignment of appeals to those divisions&quot;; and &quot;the form and manner of making of requests by the Forestry Appeals Committee for information from a party to an appeal, or a person other than a party&quot;.  If we do not have sight right now of the timeframe, it could be argued that notwithstanding the bona fides of the Minister and Minister of State present in the Chamber in seeking to have this issue addressed, there is a danger that if those timeframes slip and are not tight there will be no systemic change in this process, notwithstanding the subdivision of the FAC, and there could be as many delays in the licensing process in the future as there are now.  If we had some sight of how the Minister will deal with these regulations and when they will be put into force, that will give great confidence to the forestry sector and would allay some of the fears of people in the forestry sector.  I ask the Minister to address that issue in response to the Second Stage debate.<\/p><p>We talk about afforestation policy and there are programme for Government commitments, but we are seriously lagging behind.  I am not trying to make a party political point on this because we all agree on afforestation in this House.  We want to see clear targets and we want those targets to be met.  We want to ensure that the Minister with responsibility for biodiversity will set out a pathway for those afforestation targets to be met, and that we achieve targets greater than 8,000 in 2021 to offset the missed targets in 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016.  Ireland is abysmally behind the curve, and I say this in a spirit of co-operation.  This Minister and the Government have an opportunity now really to hammer home the idea that Ireland needs to nudge well past the 11%.<\/p> <p>That is something the Government would get support for, but only on the basis that it is not just blanket cover but an afforestation policy that ensures that biodiversity is not damaged in any way.  I am stating the obvious as far as the Minister of State is concerned.  The issue of afforestation and forestry policy needs to have a radical basis now.  The Joint Committee on Climate Action in the last D&aacute;il published a report containing clear targets which had cross-party support.  The Minister of State will find that if she is radical in her approach to this, she will have the support of the majority of the Members of this House.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of fees I would ask the Minister of State to consider the impact of levying a fee.  The Minister, arguably, is silent on the issue of the amount of the fee.  It is another issue that will be given over to regulation or statutory instrument.  What people want is certainty with this legislation.  If the Minister of State is of a mind to instigate a fee - and it seems from her speech that she is absolutely clear on the need for a fee - we cannot have a situation where ordinary people, such as those for whom Deputy Martin Kenny spoke in places like Leitrim, are locked out of a process.  Ordinary people cannot be locked out of the process by dint of the fact that there is a fee put in their way that arguably diminishes their right to make a genuine submission to an appeal.  I ask the Minister to revisit that issue.  <\/p> <p> I repeat the point made earlier on the numbers and types of staff being appointed at present.  How many people have been appointed in the past number of months since the Government was formed and across what positions?  What are the proposals to appoint new people in the forestry service?  Again, I reiterate the point that the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture must come together and work with the Minister and Minister of State to shine a light into how the forestry service operates and unlock any of the impediments to the granting of licences in a way that balances the needs of industry with ensuring that the ecology and the environment are not damaged or put upon in any way.  The committee must give a voice to all of the stakeholders and contextualise the more 9,000 submissions in public.  If we are to agree a position on the workings of the forestry service, we must have an opportunity to have a hearing or some public articulation and give further voice, after this legislation is passed, to how we feel the forestry service needs to operate.  We must hear from independents and others within the sector as to how they feel the forestry service should operate.  I am talking about the stakeholders within the industry who are affected by the decisions of the forestry service day in, day out.  <\/p> <p> I also wish to give voice to the frustration of people, some of whom will also have contacted the Minister of State.  I know of one forestry application that was 823 days in the system with no decision.  I have learned of other applications that were 681 days, 713 days and 520 days in the system with no decision.  It is unconscionable for any modern public or civil service to take that long to process an application or an appeal.  It beggars belief.  I know that the Minister of State is conscious of this problem but we need to get to a stage where this is no longer happening and the sooner, the better.  <\/p> <p> I do not wish to tarry.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the issue.  I have asked very specific questions and hope that they will be answered when the Minister of State responds at the end of this Second Stage debate.  The Labour Party is generally supportive of the Bill but there must be a root and branch review of how the forestry service operates when all of this is over.  That needs to happen as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900028#CC00400","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601395500,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I wish to speak in support of this Bill.  There are 55,000 acres of forestry in County Clare.  Nationally the sector employs 12,000 people and it remained buoyant during the last recession.  It is a sector that should be valued in terms of licensing and felling in order to realise its full potential.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill because it will make the appeals system more efficient and will reduce the backlog of appeals at the forestry appeals committee.  It will also align forestry licensing with the planning process and its appeals system.  County Clare is hugely impacted by all of this.  Many constituents have contacted my office whose forestry applications have been in the system for inordinate and unacceptably long periods of time.  They are extremely frustrated.  At the same time, the building sector is running out of timber to build homes.  There is a real urgency to removing the backlog which, as things stand, would take approximately two years to clear.  A total of 382 objections were lodged this year and approximately 500 cases are awaiting a decision.  Serial and in some instances vexatious objectors have been throwing in objections to forestry licence applications.  Some of these objectors are the same ones that crop up in the planning process.  Three key projects in Clare are on the back burner because of serial objectors, namely the Clonlara flood defences, the coastal erosion defences at Doonbeg and the bridge crossing at Killaloe.  As we grasp this issue in the context of agriculture and forestry, we must also introduce pre-qualifying rules for those who object to planning applications.  Someone living in Rathmines has no basis for serially objecting to planning applications in County Clare.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I hope that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will encourage more of a mix of broadleaf trees.  There has been a 2% increase in the planting of such trees in the past year but we need to see far more.  In my constituency we have the Cratloe wood, timbers from which were used to roof the House of Commons at Westminster.  It is a fabulous wood but there are lots of conifers in there now, driving out native species.  We need to see more native trees being planted in there again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900029#DD00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601395500,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna (At\u00f3g\u00e1il) - Questions (Resumed)","time":1601396100,"counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900030#EE00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601396100,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Note: Ministerial and Departmental titles have been updated in the Question text in anticipation of the relevant Government orders to give legal effect to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 27 June 2020.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna ar Sonra\u00edodh Uain D\u00f3ibh - Priority Questions","time":1601396100,"counter":255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900030#EE00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","time":1601396100,"counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900030#EE00250"},{"type":"question","time":1601396100,"counter":257,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[27127\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900030#EE00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the action he has taken to address the prospect of mortgage distress for Covid-19 impacted borrowers as a shareholder in banks (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1601396100,"counter":258,"content":"<p>The pandemic, as we know, has caused huge financial distress for households and businesses right across this State.

Those related to mortgages, personal loans and SME loans, and they were a source of considerable relief to customers at a time of great uncertainty.  Approximately 89,000 of these payment breaks were granted to mortgage customers.  Almost 37,000 of those customers subsequently opted to take a second three-month payment break, meaning the majority of customers had enough confidence and certainty to come off their initial three-month break.  Payment breaks were put in place for 32,000 SMEs and for 4,000 corporate customers.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware of the guidance from the European Banking Authority, EBA, in regard to the phasing out of, and the changing of the guidelines on, payment moratoria.

Even if Germany has done this for 21% of its customers, the Minister will have failed to address it for anybody after this month.  Under the EBA guidelines, banks in this State could have announced a continuation or an extension of the breaks, which would mean these individuals&rsquo; credit rating would not be affected.  It would mean they would not be deemed as non-performing loans if they could not pay the full capital or interest.  It would mean the banks would not have to hold additional capital when we need banks to be lending to SMEs.  There are 32,000 SMEs affected, many of which cannot go back to paying full costs and, therefore, this will have a negative impact on their rates.

As ever, this is valuable analysis and I welcome the council's contribution at an early stage of the budget process.  It is also worth pointing out that around the same time, the Governor of the Central Bank wrote to me expressing broadly similar views to the council.  The council noted that the macroeconomic outlook is exceptionally uncertain, with key risks relating to future waves of Covid-19 as well as the potential for bilateral trade between Ireland and the UK to be on World Trade Organization terms from next year.  I agree with this assessment.  Infection rates have increased further and additional measures have been put in place for some counties.  Additionally, the Government has decided to base budget 2021 on the assumption of a disorderly end to the so-called transition period, given the high probability of it materialising.  It is worth pointing out that the council is supportive of the unprecedented budgetary response that has been implemented by the Government in response to this terrible disease.<\/p>  <p>  The council's view with regard to budget 2021 is that it should include a substantial multi-year stimulus so that targeted support measures are continued.  Given the uncertainty remaining around Covid-19 and the future trading relationship between the EU and UK, the council further recommends an appropriately sized contingency to help to manage these key risks.  Additionally, the council's view is that once recovery is established the public finances be brought back to a more sustainable trajectory.  I broadly concur with these views.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 will prioritise a continued response to this crisis.  The overall strategy will be to provide further countercyclical support to the economy.  We will prioritise preserving and maintaining existing levels of service, make improvements where we can and where needed and target any additional supports to those sectors and workers who are most in need.  I am also conscious of the need to put the public finances on a sustainable path.

I note, however, that the Deputy raised three separate but related issues regarding important measures in the tax code that support caring for people in vulnerable circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the suggestion to extend eligibility for the home carer tax credit to include single workers, this credit was introduced in Finance Act 2000 specifically in the context of a planned move to full individualisation of the income tax system to ensure a balance was maintained for married one-income families where one spouse works primarily in the home caring for children, the aged or incapacitated persons.  The home carer tax credit is, therefore, available only to jointly assessed couples in a marriage or civil partnership and not to single persons, as the issues the credit sought to address do not arise in their circumstances.  Instead, the single person child carer credit of &euro;1,650 and an increased rate band of &euro;4,000 are available to single parents with caring responsibilities for a dependent child who is under the age of 18 or, if over 18, is an incapacitated child who satisfies the incapacitated child tax credit criteria.<\/p>  <p>  As for the question of claiming tax relief on the cost of employing a care worker while also claiming the dependent relative or incapacitated child tax credit, there is no restriction on this and the tax relief is available at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax. <\/p>  <p>  I will outline further information in my follow-up response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900033#HH01200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1601397900,"counter":303,"content":"<p>There is a considerable anomaly here.  If a single carer, such as a widow or widower or someone who is divorced or separated, cares for a sister or mother, the carer cannot avail of the credit.  Perhaps the person is doing it full time, or works eight hours part time for sanity or just to keep heat in the house.  He or she cannot avail of the home carer tax credit.  That is fundamentally unjust.  I understand why it was put in place in the first instance, because it was intended that one person would work outside the home and the other predominantly in the home, but that second person could have part-time work.  The Government is saying, therefore, that for two people who are jointly assessed, one can work outside the home, while the other can have part-time work and still claim that credit, whereas someone who is a lone carer, for whatever reason, cannot claim that credit and work outside the home.<\/p> <p>While I know the Minister has said he will not increase tax bands or credits, that is a serious anomaly in its own right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092900033#HH01300","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601398500,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I will definitely consider the different issues the Deputy has raised.
