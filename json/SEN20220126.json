We had Covid spiking.  Now a lot of people are nervous about society re-opening so quickly and that will be stressful for many.  We also had the tragic events in Tullamore which rocked us all, as well as tragic suicides.  I want to send my condolences to all families affected by loss and premature loss.  <\/p> <p>This is an opportune time to talk about our mental health and specifically, the resourcing and management of psychologists in the HSE, of which there is a shortage in acute care, in community health teams and in disability and social care.  There also needs to be a wider focus, not just on HSE resources, but also on mental health resources in education, higher education, Tusla, the Irish Prison Service and acute hospitals.  They all need psychologists and a HSE plan will not take into account the breadth of the resource requirements.  <\/p> <p>We must address the current shortages while also focusing on the future.  A recent Government disability capacity review projected that in 2030 there could be a need for an increase of 107% in the number of psychologists for child disability services alone and a national project office report estimated that there was a need for 500 additional psychologists.  That is an enormous number but at the moment, we have only 66 clinical psychologists coming on stream.  The additional complication is that even if the allocated funding in this year's budget for additional training places on professional training programmes was to be increased, the psychologists would not be on the front line before November 2025.  It takes four years to qualify so whatever we do, we must do it now.<\/p> <p>When I raised this issue previously, I was told that a project team was tasked with considering the preparation of a workforce plan for psychological services in the HSE, including an examination of the current framework for training psychologists for the health service and the type and skill mix required for the future.  The report would also set out the significance of a review of the current funding model for future psychologists.  I note a report, entitled The Report of the National Psychology Project Team: Establishment of a National Psychology Placement Office and Workforce Planning, was published last January.  What recommendations contained therein have been implemented or progressed since then?  What is the plan?  <\/p> <p>It was recommended that a placement office be established to make sure that trainee and qualified psychologists are recognised and accredited.  That was deemed urgent in 2018.  I raised the issue previously of trainee psychologists and the inequity they face in their training.  Trainee clinical psychologists are paid &euro;34,000 per year for their placements and get 60% of their fees paid by the HSE but trainee educational psychologists do not, even though they are working side by side.  Educational psychologists pay their higher education fees and work for free on the front line in education settings, in the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and in section 38 organisations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Emer Currie:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These people work three years for free on the front line and pay to do so, while their colleagues and peers are supported through that period, as they should be.

In the way that I am committed to this job, they are committed to theirs and they have sacrificed so much.  They must step away from a career they have invested in because they cannot afford to do this.  A recent petitions by the Psychological Society of Ireland was signed by 2,400 people.

I acknowledge the enormous contribution made by psychologists in the healthcare system during the challenging times of the Covid-19 pandemic and before that as well.<\/p> <p>In February 2019, the HSE community operations unit convened a project team chaired by Dr. Cathal Morgan to consider the preparation of a workforce plan for psychological services in the HSE, including an examination of the current framework for training psychologists for the health service and the type and skill mix required for the future.  The work of the project team has been informed by a thorough stakeholder consultation process.  Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the work of the project team was delayed.<\/p> <p>The report of the national psychology project team, titled Establishment of a National Psychology Placement Office and Workforce Planning, was completed in January 2021.  In line with its terms of reference, the project team report sets out proposals to establish a national psychology placement function within the HSE.  The report outlines considerations for a workforce plan for psychological services in the HSE.  A recommendation on the consideration of funding of counselling psychologists along the same lines as clinical psychologists was also included.<\/p> <p>Currently, clinical psychologists in training are funded for 60% of course fees and are employed as trainee psychologists for the duration of their training.  This is unlike any of the other health and social care professionals.  A chapter of the report, titled Psychology Services into the Future, identifies a number of the key drivers that are likely to produce significant changes to the way and extent to which psychological services are delivered.  It also notes the implications this will have on workforce planning and the future psychological workforce.<\/p> <p>The projected global shortfall of healthcare workers by 2030 means consideration should be given to alternative and flexible approaches to how health services are delivered.  The changing role of professions and greater fluidity in skill mix will require a greater alignment of skill sets to work tasks.  This is critical in the context of community-based working through different modalities.  While new technology is unlikely to impact on the demand for mental health professionals, its effects on service provision can be transformational.  The psychological workforce will increasingly work in tiered arrangements and the workforce will require robust governance and supervision structures.  Memorandums of agreement and programme boards in higher education institutes will need to align with innovations and change within the healthcare landscape.<\/p> <p>While it is a matter for the HSE at operational level to determine the level of recruitment required across staff categories, given the level of workforce expansion required, it is likely that there will be additional posts available for professionally trained psychologists.  Implementation of the report's recommendations and the creation of a national psychology placement office must take priority.<\/p> <p>I take this opportunity to highlight that there has been a significant reduction of over 19% among under-18s waiting more than 12 months to be seen by primary care psychology staff.  This follows an allocation of &euro;4 million I secured last August to address such lists through targeted initiatives, enhanced capacity of mental health need and ease pressure on and reduce waiting lists for specialist mental health services.  This will ensure that children and young people will get the support they need when they need it.  The second key part was the announcement earlier this month of the establishment of the psychology assistant post on a permanent basis.  This also marks a significant achievement in promoting enhanced access to vital primary care psychology supports, which I know was very much welcomed by the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#B00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the update.

The Department should look to the North and what it does in the area of funding because there are examples there that we could use.<\/p> <p>Under our current system, someone could become an assistant psychologist and be paid but trainee psychologists must pay for their degree or doctorate and work for free.

I think there is a cliff-edge date where someone who has not worked in all three areas will not get the same qualifications.  We need to sit down with representatives of the Psychological Society of Ireland and we need a timeline for implementation.  We also need clear direction on who is responsible.

This has included an increase in capacity of primary care psychology services recently through the introduction of two initiatives, as previously mooted.  When I took up my post a year and a half ago I was concerned that approximately 10,000 under-18s were waiting for psychology supports.  I learned that 5,000 of them had waited in excess of 12 months.  Last September, I secured &euro;4 million and we ran a programme for four months under which each community healthcare organisation, CHO, had to see what it could do.  Some hired locums, some provided for overtime and others outsourced.  We managed to have 19% of those on the waiting list seen, which is a good proportion.  However, 81% remain on lists.

Sometimes companies did not honour vouchers.  An example would be where someone named Mary had her second name written on the voucher.

I refer to the company One4all and its application of maintenance fees.  Where a person does not use a voucher within one year, thereafter One4all applies a maintenance fee of &euro;1.45 per month.  I have been contacted by people who live in a small town where there is only one shop that accepts One4all vouchers.  These are elderly people who could not use their voucher during the pandemic as they were not going out and somebody else was doing the shopping for them.  To use the voucher in other ways, they would have had to go to the city or to another town.  They recently discovered that the value of the voucher has depreciated and they have lost quite a bit of money.  If someone has a &euro;50 voucher, it falls down behind a heater or whatever and he or she finds it four years later, it will be of no value.  This is not acceptable.<\/p><p>Ireland was the first country to regulate in regard to the expiration timeframe for vouchers, which was extended to five years.  At that time, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, wrote to the European Commission, which gave a commitment to review this matter and to consider how the problem could be overcome.  I have heard since that some shopping centres and delivery companies are applying a maintenance fee in respect of vouchers not redeemed within a required amount of time.  Employers give employees gift vouchers as a means of thanking them or for another particular reason.  People should be entitled to the full value of the voucher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#B00700","speaker":"1695","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Maria Byrne for raising this important issue.  According to the Consumer Protection (Gift Vouchers) Act 2019, the term \"gift voucher\" means any voucher, coupon, document or instrument, including in electronic form, that is intended to be used as a substitute for money in the payment in whole or in part for goods or services, or otherwise exchanged for goods or services.  This legislation, which provides requirements in relation to gift voucher contracts, was brought into Irish law in December 2019 by the then Department of Enterprise, Trade or Employment.  Many vouchers or gift cards purchased and used today now meet the definition of \"electronic money\" and are subject to regulation under the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011, as amended, commonly referred to as the EMR.<\/p> <p>It should be noted that vouchers that are deemed electronic money within the meaning of the EMR are excluded from the Consumer Protection (Gift Vouchers) Act 2019 on the basis that they are already regulated under the EMR.  The electronic money directive, which is the directive which the EMR transposed into legislation in Ireland, is a maximum harmonisation directive, meaning that EU countries may not introduce rules that are stricter than those set in the directive.  As per regulation 52 of the EMR, electronic money products have to be redeemable at any time and cannot have an expiry date.  This is an important measure introduced to enhance consumer protection.  In particular, regulated firms must design and sell products that are suitable to their customers needs and are capable of delivering the promised benefits, with key risks and charges with respect to those products appropriately disclosed.  Specifically, regulations 74 to 76 of the European Union Payment Services Regulations 2019, PSR, set out the specific requirements regarding the information that is required to be shared by electronic money institutions with payment service users, including in relation to charges.  This means that gift card or voucher providers regulated as electronic money providers must inform users of those vouchers of any charges applied.<\/p> <p>I have been informed by the Central Bank that while it does not comment on the supervision of specific firms, its expectation is that all regulated firms, including electronic money institutions, comply with their regulatory obligations.  The Central Bank also expects regulated firms to take a customer-focused approach and to act in their customers' best interests at all times.  This means that firms providing gift cards or vouchers under the EMR must comply with their regulatory obligations and, in this case, they must ensure that consumers are informed of any charges applicable to the voucher they are purchasing and-or using.<\/p> <p>It may be useful to know that as part of the European Commission's retail payments strategy, which was launched in September 2020, the Commission has undertaken to align the revised payment services directive, PSD2, and the electronic money directive frameworks by including the issuance of electronic money as a payment service in PSD2.  This will ensure greater consistency in the various legislation on retail payments which would include electronic money vouchers and promote robust supervision and oversight of firms in the relevant sectors.  This work will be carried out as part of the review of PSD2, which is expected to begin later this year.<\/p> <p>Officials in the Department of Finance will consider the issue of reducing balance fees as part of future discussions on the electronic money directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#C00200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

That is embarrassing.<\/p> <p>I welcome that this matter will be considered by the European Commission.  We need to keep the pressure on for proper regulation in this area.

It is incumbent that people purchasing vouchers are informed of the application of these fees.  On behalf of the Minister for Finance, this issue will be raised with the European Commission in the context of the laws that are being put in place.  It is important this is done.  Not every voucher scheme applies such fees.  In the meantime, I encourage people, when purchasing, to choose a voucher to which no fees are applied.  In some cases, these fees are disproportionate, in my view.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to speak to the House on this issue.  This is an important matter for consumers.  As stated, there is legislation in place in Ireland that ensures that these consumers are protected.  Firms that are providing gift cards or vouchers under electronic money regulations must comply with their regulatory obligations.  In this case, they must ensure consumers are informed of any fees or charges applicable to the vouchers they are purchasing and-or using.  As correctly point out by Senator Maria Byrne, in some cases this information is in very small print.

That working group called for radical reform and major reconfiguration of the coronial system and stated that a clear strategy for change was essential.  In April 2021, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, published research that showed that no significant reform had occurred in either policy or practice.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In fact, its research showed that bereaved families were, and still are, consistently failed by the State.  One of the clear failings in inquests is the manner in which the jury is selected.  Reform of this process was outlined in the ICCL's recommendations.  Jurors in inquests are often used repeatedly, are known to the bereaved families and are selected by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, even in cases where the Garda is party to the inquest itself.  The fact that the inquest system has not been reformed at all in the 20 years since the independent working group made its findings is shameful and means that bereaved families continue to be failed by a system that is just not human rights compliant.<\/p><p>On Friday, 25 September 2019, the Attorney General granted the families of those who lost their loved ones in the Stardust fire a new inquest.  He rightly found that a new inquest was not only warranted for the families who had been so badly let down by the original inquest, and the damaging inquiry reports that followed that inquest, but he also found that it was in the wider public interest that a new inquest be held.  As soon as that decision was taken by the Attorney General, the legal team representing the families, other elected representatives from various parties and I repeatedly sought and got assurances from the Minister for Justice that the inquest would not only be adequately funded by the State but that it would be human rights compliant.  What has happened to the families to date has been anything but human rights compliant.  Legal aid was denied the families earlier last year.  They were asked to submit deeply invasive information about their financial circumstances and some of them were refused legal aid.  This is despite the fact that they have waited 40 years for justice.  Recommendation 22 in the ICCL's report had already flagged this issue.<\/p><p>In recent days, the matter of jury selection at inquests has once again come to the fore.  Under no circumstances should the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be selecting the jury for the Stardust inquest.  It is a party to this inquest.  The ICCL's recommendations 44 and 45 state very clearly that jury selection should be randomly made from the electoral register and that in high-profile cases lawyers should be able to challenge the make-up of that jury.<\/p><p>The other issue with jurors in inquests is the fact that their income is not protected by law.  Is the State seriously going to ask jurors to sit for at least a year on the most significant and largest inquest in the history of the State without any income protection whatsoever?  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that the Juries Act will be applied to the coronial inquests?  While radical reform is still needed, surely that very small but highly significant reform could be applied in time so that it takes effect for the Stardust inquest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#C00600","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boylan for raising this very specific question on amending the Juries Act to allow for inquest jurors to be paid while they serve.

I again offer my deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the 48 young people killed in that fire over 40 years ago.<\/p> <p>As the Senator may be aware, there is no requirement for an inquest to have a jury.  That decision is a matter for the independent coroner.  Furthermore, there is no current statutory authority to prescribe fees or expenses to jurors for service at inquests when summoned to do so by a coroner.  Most inquests are completed within a short period.  The provisions of the Juries Act 1976 expressly do not apply to coroner inquests.

To even suggest that there would be no jury for the largest and most significant inquest in the history of the State, to say to the families that they have to go into a system akin to the Special Criminal Court and not have their case, their facts or their findings heard by a jury of their peers, is an insult.

He will be familiar with the fact that last summer there were two very serious E.coli outbreaks, one in Ballymore Eustace, which provides much of the water supplies of Kildare and Dublin, and the other in my home town of Gorey.  There were 52 confirmed illnesses, and potentially more, as a result of those outbreaks and the difficulties that happened at the time.  There has been an examination by the Environmental Protection Authority, EPA, of what happened.  My understanding is that Wexford County Council's report on the matter has been finalised but has not yet been published because it must first go to a number of the parties that were identified.  I hope it will be published in the very near future because it is important for the people for Gorey and everyone else that there is transparency in this process.  There must be an understanding of what happened, accountability and, more, importantly, assurances that the events that happened will not happen again, either in Gorey or anywhere else.  I am glad that a lot more precautionary boil water notices are being put in place.  It is not very pleasant for people to be subject to such notices but I think they would rather receive notices than risk drinking water that is far from good quality.<\/p> <p>At the time of the outbreaks, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, acted swiftly and ordered full inquiries.  I was very happy with that.  As part of that, he insisted on an audit of all the water treatment plants around the country, including the one in Gorey.  The audit identified the changes that were necessary at Creagh.  A commitment was given that there would quickly be an audit of the 20 largest water treatment plants in the country and that that would then be extended outwards because, of course, we have several hundred other treatment plants.  One of the basic things any individual expects is that if they turn on their tap, they will have access to a good, reliable and clean water supply.  I ask for an update on the audit of the 20 largest plants and where we stand regarding the audit of all the other plants.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A clear indication was given to local authority and Irish Water staff that there would be refresher courses on this.

I addressed it previously, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, also has addressed it previously.  It is an unfortunate incident and unacceptable, that must be said.  In regard to an update, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, met the managing director of Irish Water, as well as the chief executives of both Dublin City Council and Wexford County Council on 8 September 2021 to discuss the incidents at Ballymore Eustace and Gorey water treatment plants and held a follow-up meeting on 13 October 2021.  In those meetings the Minister requested Irish Water to undertake immediately a number of improvements, including audits of the water treatment plants throughout the country.  In November 2021, Irish Water provided an update to the Minister.  While initially prioritising the largest 20 treatment plants, the list was expanded to the top 25 water treatment plants to cover the largest for both population served and output volume.  With the addition of the Gorey plant this resulted in the top 26 water treatment plants being assessed.  These plants serve approximately 65% of Irish Water's customer base.<\/p> <p>During late September and early October last year, Irish Water completed the following: audits of the top 26 plants, which entailed evaluating the existing alarms and incident responses within the plants along with the applicability of shutdown procedures; site staff training at these plants; and the initiation of corrective actions based on the findings of the audits.  In addition to these actions Irish Water has subsequently provided technical specialist support on site to these top 26 sites and has rolled out incident management refresher training across all local authorities.  In January 2022 Irish Water established its national operations management centre.  This centre receives data from the top 26 water treatment plants via a national telemetry system, thereby allowing Irish Water to monitor critical alarm signals on a 24-7 basis.  The coverage of this central monitoring by Irish Water will be expanded to other water treatment plants on a phased basis.  In addition, Irish Water has undertaken to issue critical standard operating procedures to the top 26 plants during January 2022 and to complete works on these sites to deliver water quality assurance works.<\/p> <p>To conclude, Irish Water, local authorities and their staff have responded to the serious incidents at Gorey and Ballymore Eustace by putting in place a range of measures to provide greater assurance around the management of our water treatment plants including 24-7 monitoring of plants that serve the majority of the population.  It will be important to continue to monitor the effectiveness of these measures as Irish Water continues along its evolution to become a fully integrated company with full control over its own staffing resources.  It is important, as the Senator said, that we learn lessons from these incidents.  There were serious public health breaches that we must ensure will never happen again.  In regard to the point the Senator made in regard to Wexford County Council's report, I agree that should be published for transparency purposes.  All the outputs of the investigations into what happened should be publicly available for elected Members, the wider public, Irish Water and the local authorities to learn from the lessons of the mistakes on these two unfortunate incidents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#E00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

When will it be extended to all of the other water treatment plants, many of which serve smaller communities?  I note that 35% of the population still has not experienced this audit.  It is important for us to be able to guarantee to everybody in this country that they have access to a good, clean, reliable water supply.

I will take that point back.  It is important that there be a full audit of all water treatment plants because there is the potential for further incidents.  There is potential for that in those smaller plants.  Since the formation of this Government, one thing we have done is put in place record capital funding for Irish Water to be able to meet its water service delivery programme and to ensure as it is a basic human right that when people turn on their taps they have access to clean, potable water.  From that point of view it is critically important that as a Government, we work with Irish Water to ensure it is delivering on that and once it moves into being a fully integrated company with full control of its own staffing, that will be an important aspect of that work.  There is no doubt but there are lessons to be learned in this regard.  It is important that there is transparency.  All reporting of the incidents and what led to those incidents should be made available to Senators, elected Members, local authorities and to the public generally.

There is much pent-up demand within the country to travel abroad and, whether at the Easter break, the elongated St. Patrick's Day break or in the summer, Irish people will avail of opportunities to travel to Europe or further afield.  While we always encourage people to take staycations and to experience the great offers we have in this country in hospitality and tourism, we can understand that, given the pandemic, people have not had the opportunity to travel and there will be an appetite to do so.<\/p> <p>The issue of passports is one that, as public representatives, we all experience.  We have all experienced the fear, dread and upset felt by people when they find their passport has expired, or will do so presently, after having booked holidays.  The Passport Office does great work to expedite and assist public representatives and people in general to get passports processed, but there were issues last year and, based on all the evidence, there may be issues again this year.  We need urgently to have a debate on the plans of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to assist in the processing of, in particular, first-time applications for citizens to avail of passports.  We appreciate the relief when a passport application can be expedited, but we have also heard of cases of people who have had to cancel holidays or rearrange plans or where one group is able to travel while another has to stay behind because they cannot get their passports.  It is a great cause of stress.<\/p> <p>I have said previously that, with all the modern technology we have, it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility for a reminder text or email to be sent to remind people that their passport will expire in, say, five or six months' time and to encourage them to get online and apply.  Obviously, applying online is the most efficient and easiest way to apply and it allows for a quick turnaround time, so we have to encourage people in that regard.  Nevertheless, assistance needs to be provided to those who cannot apply online or who do not have the wherewithal to do so, and there could be a role there for Citizens Information or other State agencies to assist those people because online applications are faster and more efficient and allow for quicker processing.

It is now becoming a matter of serious urgency, so it could be arranged in the next week or two, it would be appreciated.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, I referred to the appointment of the expert panel that is due to be set up to examine how an individual complaints mechanism could operate with the office of the online safety commissioner that is due to be established as part of the online safety and media regulation Bill.  On &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night we saw further development of the story around Eden Heaslip and about how Eden Heaslip&rsquo;s bullying continued in the online space.  Very clearly, his family desired that there would be some form of individual complaints mechanism.  It is something that the Ombudsman for Children and children&rsquo;s rights organisations have all sought.  In addition, as I pointed out yesterday, our Oireachtas committee recommended this as well.  <\/p> <p>I was a little concerned when the Minister appeared on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night.  She indicated that this legislation will be coming to the Seanad very soon, and I welcome the fact that we will finally be debating it.

My concern expressed yesterday was around the terms of reference that were given to that expert panel.  <\/p> <p>The Oireachtas committee recommended it because we found the testimony of Ms Julie Inman Grant, the Australian eSafety Commissioner, compelling.  I have engaged separately with her office.  This being Australia Day, it is appropriate that we look and learn from our Australian cousins in respect of what they have done in this space.  There is a model that works very clearly in Australia and it is the model we want to see followed.  <\/p> <p>If the legislation is brought in here before we have any clear picture of what an individual complaints mechanism might resemble, I will propose an amendment to the legislation that will require the new online safety commissioner to introduce such a scheme within 12 months of his or her appointment.

The ECA is the body that is charged with ensuring taxpayer funds are spent wisely.  Historically, the ECA had very strong words for the Irish Government about the way it does energy efficiency upgrades.<\/p> <p>In 2020, the audit revealed that, incredibly, over half of the funding given out in residential schemes resulted in no energy rating improvements.  In the latest audit, which was released yesterday, the ECA turned its attention instead to energy efficiency upgrades in enterprises, which include public sector buildings.  <\/p> <p>The Government, again, does not make it through this audit unscathed.  In fact, no financial data were available.  The State did not plan any funds and it had no financial information to report for enterprise energy efficiency projects.  The EU programme allocated &euro;2.4 billion in total and the funds were divvied up between 12,000 projects across the EU.  Not a single penny of that money was allocated to Irish enterprises, neither businesses nor public sector. <\/p> <p>While Government was wasting EU funds in 2020, this time it is wasting the opportunity to spend EU funds and failing to plan to spend them at all.  Ireland was one of only three countries to not avail of funds for this priority.  This is despite being in the middle of a climate crisis.  Commercial and public sectors make up 18% of the primary energy use, according to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, Energy in Ireland report.  There is massive room for emissions reductions through efficiency improvements and these sectors need to be showing more leadership in setting an example of how energy efficiency should be done.  Instead, the opportunity to avail of funding to address the climate crisis has been squandered and potentially hundreds of millions are spent elsewhere within the EU.<\/p> <p>We are in the midst of an energy crisis and it is not just households that are facing increasing energy bills, as SMEs are feeling the squeeze as energy prices skyrocket.  One of the best things they can do to protect themselves from these price shocks is to insulate those buildings and make them more efficient.  Yet, not a single penny of the EU fund was spent on enterprises here.  <\/p> <p>Why is the Department allowing such prime opportunities to pass it by?  There was a Fine Gael Minister at the helm of climate change for the period in question.  Can the party representatives keep straight faces when they claim the mantle of economic prudence?  <\/p> <p>What change has the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan implemented to make sure that the mistakes of his Fine Gael predecessor are not repeated?

I raised this matter previously in the House through a Commencement matter, namely, the need for a national register of automated external defibrillators, AEDs in this country.  At the time, the Minister reported that such a register would be carried out through the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest strategy, which is obviously currently being carried out.<\/p> <p>Surprisingly, the Minister for Health, in a follow-up parliamentary question - which is what I stated last time I spoke on this late last year &ndash; said that there were no plans to carry out such a register.

The most recent reply through parliamentary questions to my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, and in a Commencement matter here in the Seanad yesterday, confirmed that this much needed register will be back on the table and will be implemented through that particular register.  <\/p> <p>Of course, there are some wonderful examples of groups throughout the country that have already completed an audit of their community AEDs and their locations.  For example, it has been done in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, and in County Laois.  I hope the current review will talk to those involved and gather their experiences which have improved a life-saving device in relation to their local communities.  <\/p> <p>A very important add-on matter that I would like to highlight as well is the urgent need to deal with criminal damage to our community-located AEDs that colleagues have highlighted to me.  This is an horrendous piece of criminality.  My colleague, Councillor Carrie Smyth, has recently highlighted a number of AEDs that were damaged in her area.  The national first responder network has also highlighted a number of other locations throughout the country where life-saving devices have been damaged.

While I cannot give the details yet, I am working on a creative project in the prison system, in Wheatfield Prison.  One of the suggestions for the project came from one of the men there.  He said that I cannot really ask the right questions, which was insightful because he is right.  He said I did not go into the system with bias or judgment because I am so used to working in these systems and living with people who had experienced prison.  He said that for them to really engage in the creative project with me, the prisoners would need to understand the biases people have, whether unconscious or conscious, and the preconceived ideas people might have about people who have gone to prison and what the prison system is actually for.<\/p><p>The survey in Members' inboxes and the questions were written and developed by another man in the prison to gather some ideas.  The survey is completely anonymous, so I ask Senators not to answer with a political hat on but to do so on the basis of what they think about people who are in prison and why and for what they might be there.  This will form part of a positive piece of work we are doing in the prisons.  I will hopefully be able to relay it back to the Chamber in a couple of months.  I encourage Members to support the work I am doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#H00600","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I raise again the issue of hyperemesis gravidarum, the medical term for a condition that arises during pregnancy whereby women become severely ill.

He wrote:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... a thirty-six-year-old migrant from the Ivory Coast, who was held at Al Mabani with her 14-year-old daughter for two months, told me that women were frequently taken from her cell to be raped by the guards.  'The women would come back in tears,' [she said].  One day after two women escaped from Al Mabani, guards grabbed ... [this lady], took her to a nearby office, and beat her for reasons that remain unclear. <\/blockquote> <p>This is not news.  The European Union knows about this.  I call for the disgraceful relationship to be ended.  The European people's Party and ALDE are propping it up.  How much longer are we going to see migrants beaten, raped and tortured?  The European Union not only turns a blind eye but gives financial support to the Libyan coastguard, which is implementing that policy.<\/p><p>We need state-led rescue missions to stop the drownings in the Mediterranean.  Instead, what we have are bandits from the Libyan coastguard financed by the European Union.  We hear about European Union values.  Where are those values?

We have heard all the right things being said over recent days and weeks.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When it comes to the bit, the Government has the opportunity to stand by these women, to do right by them and to properly investigate the concerns, allegations and awful situations they faced in their time in the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>When we debated the defence Bill in this House before Christmas, the Minister made what I found at the time to be very sincere and robust commitments in terms of acceding to the demands of these women but it is clear, having listened to them, that they do not believe the Minister's review goes far enough.  In fact, they are concerned that it has the potential to be a whitewash.  These allegations, as acknowledged by the Minister and his colleagues from every party and group, are much too serious to befall a whitewash.  We need a full commission of investigation with the power to compel witnesses in terms of the allegations raised by the Women of Honour group.  We urgently need a comprehensive and fulsome commission of investigation.  We need it to ensure that the culture and the practices that these women are so concerned about within the Defence Forces are changed.  I call on the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister for Defence, Deputy Simon Coveney, to come in here and speak to us about the allegations raised by the Women of Honour group, and outline exactly what his Department intends to do.  A debate would mean we have the opportunity, across the House, to raise our concerns and  views, and the views expressed by the Women of Honour. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#L00500","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#M00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>When I walked from my office to this Chamber I had to walk past the D&aacute;il Chamber and it is great to see Deputies working side by side.  I know that arrangements are under discussion but I think the sooner the Seanad gets back to normal the better.  We should set the standard as soon as possible because it does not make sense that we are social distancing here yet a couple of yards down the hallway things are back to normal.<\/p> <p>I wish to follow up on what was said by Senator Cummins and to refer to one of the things that is really unfair about the passport system.  For first-time applicants it takes 40 days, which is fair enough, particularly as there are many child protection issues.  However, if a mistake is made when filling out the form, and it could be a simple and genuine mistake, the application must go straight back to the back of the queue and wait another 40 days.  The other day a person came into my office and asked me to sign their passport application form.  I was absolutely terrified of signing their form in the wrong place for fear of creating a delay.  If we are going to reform the passport system, then we should create an appeals process.  We should ensure that when a mistake is made that an application is not sent back to the start of the queue and ensure we avoid delaying a child's first passport by 80 working days.<\/p> <p>Finally, I would appreciate if at some stage we could have a debate on the concept of a one-stop-shop for climate action.  It is an initiative that will be introduced in the next couple of months in local authorities.  It will mean that members of the public can walk into one of these offices and get good up to date advice about climate energy and efficiency savings that they can do in their house, how they can sell energy back to the grid when that is announced, and get information on a whole variety of things like Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grants.  I would appreciate a debate on that at some stage in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#M00300","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I support Senator McGahon in his call for a debate on a one-stop-shop for climate action and climate control, which is taking in some the local authorities.

It would be timely to have that debate now as we are at the start of the tourism season.  Plus many people seem to be going away on holidays and we should debate ways to attract people to this country to see what we have to offer.  We have some of the finest greenways and opportunities to climb mountains in the world.  We could at this stage divert some moneys towards different sporting activities like the use of lakes, water skiing and so forth.  That is an area we could debate if we had a debate on tourism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#M00400","speaker":"1636"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Minute's Silence to Commemorate 50th Anniversary of Bloody Sunday","time":1643193000,"counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#M00550"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Before I call on the Deputy Leader to respond to the Order of Business, yesterday it was suggested, and we discussed it at the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight, that we would have a minute's silence in remembrance of Bloody Sunday.<\/p> <p>On Sunday, 30 January 1972, in Derry a peace march for civil rights ended with innocent people being killed by members of the British Army, which is forever since known as Bloody Sunday.

The Order of Business kicked of with Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne raising the issue of the Passport Office.  There are ongoing delays but we would expect there to be a greater demand.  A number of other Members, including Senator Malcolm Byrne and others, raised a similar issue around passports, as did Senator John Cummins, in terms of passports for children.  A debate with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been requested.  We have not yet received a reply from his office but I hope to shortly schedule a debate on the very specific issue of the Passport Office.<\/p> <p>Senator Victor Boyhan raised the issue of a substantial report compiled by former Senator, Marie-Louise O'Donnell, in 2017, called Finite Lives.  He has requested that we have a debate or a conversation in this House on dying, death and bereavement.  If appropriate, I suggest the Senator liaise with the Cathaoirleach as this may be a topic appropriate for a panel debate.  Certainly, this is an interesting piece of work that requires further discussion.<\/p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne raised the issue of the Passport Office.  He also raised a specific issue around the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.  He referred to the newly established expert panel by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, to look at an independent complaints process.  Last night, on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, the Minister committed to bringing the Bill to this House in the next week or two.  I understand that the expert panel is not due to report for another three months so there may be an issue there.  Perhaps that is something we can work on, directly with the Minister's office, to try to find a pathway forward that would be agreeable to Members in this House in terms of debating that legislation as well.<\/p> <p>Senator Lynn Boylan raised an issue concerning the European Court of Auditors.  I have not read the report so I am not in a position to comment on its detail.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications is working extremely hard on the whole area of energy efficiency in his Department.  A significant amount of funding was announced in the most recent budget to cater for retrofitting and to deal with that whole space.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In previous years, we have not always availed of that funding.  We must do better.  If there is funding available from the European Union, we should be availing of every last cent of it.  <\/p><p>Senator Wall raised the issue of an AEDs register and the community groups that have worked very hard on that issue.  He mentioned that a different approach is now being taken by the Minister with regard to a register of those units, which is very welcome.  The Senator also raised the issue of those who do damage to life-saving equipment.  We all concur with the Senator's remark that it is an abhorrent act to remove those devices that could potentially save somebody's life.  We never know when we will need them.  <\/p><p>Senator Ruane raised the issue of the announcement by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, around the care system and the research and data collection project that has been initiated, which is the largest ever commissioned in the State.  We hope that the experiences of those who have been through the care system will not only be properly documented but acted upon and used to inform current and future policy in the area.  The Senator also brought to the attention of the House that she has emailed a survey to all Senators in regard to their biases, conscious or unconscious, of the prison system and those who are going through that system.  I would encourage all Members to respond to that survey.  I have not yet done so, but I will do it.  I thank the Senator for it.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of a vomiting condition, the proper term for which I will not even try to attempt.  The Senator said that it is a condition that affects 1% of women in pregnancy and that there is a drug available to treat it, the name of which I also will not attempt to pronounce, but that it is very costly at &euro;45 per week and is not covered under the drugs payment scheme.  I concur with the Senator that that needs to be reviewed urgently.  <\/p><p>Senator Lombard spoke about the upcoming local elections, which are two years away.  He also requested a debate specifically around local government and the issue of town councils.  I concur with the Senator that it was a sad moment for local government when the town councils were removed under former the Minister, Phil Hogan.  There are many Members in this House who would support a debate around how we might reintroduce that model in a way that would be acceptable and would work well in communities across the country.  <\/p><p>Senator Mullen raised the announcement of the appointment of Ms Marie O'Shea as the new independent chair of the review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.  I congratulate Ms O'Shea on her appointment and I wish her well in her work.  Senator Mullen raised certain issues around that which I personally would not concur with, but the Senator is entitled to his views.  He also drew attention to the &euro;3 million wastewater project announced for Ahascragh and the Bunowen River, and the positive impact that will have on his community.  <\/p><p>Senator Davitt raised the issue of apprenticeship schemes and the lack or shortage of places for applicants.  I am aware of the issue.  It is a matter that needs to be tackled.  The Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, is responsible for the area.  A great deal of work has been done to improve the services and opportunities for young people to enter apprenticeship programmes.  The Minister of State is aware of the acute shortage in the system and he is working to address it.  <\/p><p>Senators Maria Byrne, Gavan and Conway raised the urgent and desperate situation at University Hospital Limerick and the 111 people currently on trolleys, which is not a good situation to be in.  I know the Senators have worked hard on this issue.  I do not have an answer for them as to why it is ongoing and why there is such an acute problem in Limerick that does not appear to be presenting at the same level in other hospitals.  There is need for a bespoke solution for University Hospital Limerick.  At the end of the day, it is the staff working in those conditions and the patients who are suffering.  There is need for a broader look at the wraparound services in terms of home help, step-down facilities and GP services, and to identify why so many people are ending up in the hospital system.  It may be that some of the issues could be better dealt with elsewhere to take pressure off the primary centre.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer spoke about a specific report on CAHMS affecting Cork and Kerry.  He mentioned that 46 children were found to have been significantly harmed by the system.  I have not read the report so I am not in a position to comment specifically on the details of it, but I concur with the Senator that that is an extremely serious finding.  It is a matter that should be raised directly with the Minister for Health.  A Commencement matter on that very specific report might, perhaps, be a good starting point to get some answers on the matter.  <\/p><p>Senator Craughwell requested a debate on neutrality.  A request has been made to the Minister for Defence for a debate on defence, touching on the Women of Honour issue, but also general defence issues in terms of recruitment and retention and the issue around Russia.  There are a number of defence issues that have been consistently raised in this Chamber that require a significant and substantial debate with the Minister with responsibility.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell has particular views on Ireland's neutrality.  I would make the point that we are a militarily-neutral country.  We are not militarily aligned to any particular organisation, which is a distinct point.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell also raised the issue around Government and governance.  He requested a specific debate on the significant responsibility placed on the shoulders of individual Ministers, which differs from Department to Department.  They do have a considerable team of staff in terms of Secretaries General, researchers and so on.  It is not just a Minister working on any particular portfolio, but I appreciate the Senator's remarks.<\/p><p>Senator Crowe spoke about the issue of burglary and what he believes to be light sentences.  He also made specific comments around sentencing.  There is another element to that as well in terms of rehabilitation and prevention to try to reduce those numbers.  Senator Crowe requested a debate on sentencing with the Minister for Justice, which we will try to organise as the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p>Senator Seery Kearney raised the issue of human trafficking and a recent report which found, if I understood her correctly, that there was a correlation between the numbers of victims coming in, male and female, and sexual or labour exploitation.  She spoke about the need for a public awareness campaign to encourage and educate members of the public on how to identify and spot trafficking, which might better help the authorities to deal with that criminality. <\/p><p>As I mentioned earlier, Senator Conway raised the situation at University Hospital Limerick.  He also raised an important issue around cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine, and the need for a free catch-up programme to cover the significant cost associated with getting that vaccine for those who missed the opportunity to get the vaccine in school.  I concur with the Senator's remarks.  I suggest that the Senator table a Commencement matter to the Minister for Health, which might give a specific timeline for the introduction of that catch-up programme.<\/p><p>Senator Cummins raised the issue of the Passport Office, which I have dealt with.  We will arrange that debate as quickly as we can. <\/p><p>Senator McGreehan requested a debate with the Minister for Health.  We will, hopefully, get the Minister into the House in the next number of weeks, specifically around a complaints process to allow better oversight and accountability where there is a shortcoming in the provision of services and care of patients in different areas of the health service.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the issue of the Women of Honour.  I am acutely aware of the comments by the Women of Honour that they are not happy with what has been announced by the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  I would hope that the Minister might be able to sit down with the Women of Honour to find some way forward that is agreeable to the victims and to take on board their concerns.  I note that the Minister has since clarified that it does not preclude a full statutory inquiry.  Hopefully, a solution can be found that is agreeable to all sides.<\/p><p>Senator McGahon raised the issue of passports.  He also raised the issue of SEAI grants and the need for clarity in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Paddy Burke requested a debate on tourism, which I think would be quite timely.  We will try to schedule that at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#M01000","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1643193000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1643193000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 12.38 p.m. and resumed at 1.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Broadband Roll-out: Statements","time":1643193000,"counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#T00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>We will now hear statements on the roll-out of broadband.

I am sure the Seanad strongly supports the overarching objective of the programme to deliver a high-speed broadband fibre network to over 554,000 premises, 1.1 million people, over 100,000 farms and non-farm businesses and some 679 schools.  The national broadband plan high-speed broadband map is available on the Department's website at <i>broadband.gov.ie<\/i>.  The amber area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the national broadband plan, NBP, State-led intervention.<\/p><p>The NBP contract was signed with National Broadband Ireland in November 2019 to ensure that 100% of the premises in the State have access to a reliable, high-quality, high-speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500 Mbps from the outset, and with higher speeds available to businesses.<\/p><p>This plan is the largest infrastructure project in rural Ireland since rural electrification.  It spans 96% of Ireland's land mass and it will bring high-speed broadband to 69% of Ireland's total number of farms.  It will deliver fast reliable broadband through laying 140,000 km of fibre cable utilising over 1.5 million poles and more than 15,000 km of underground duct networks.<\/p><p>I recognise how vital telecommunications services are to citizens for so many aspects of their daily lives, including remote working, studying and e-health and, more recently, staying in touch with family members during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The pandemic has caused profound socioeconomic change and has brought to the fore the central role that digital connectivity and technology can play in transforming the way we work and connect with each other.  The pandemic has highlighted, now more than ever, the importance of current and future connectivity needs, not only in city centres but also across our suburbs, towns and rural communities.  Ireland will be a world leader in fibre broadband roll-out by 2026.<\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment.  Since the publication of the NBP strategy in 2012, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;3.3 billion upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high-speed broadband and mobile telecommunications services.  Extensive investment plans are in place by a range of operators in commercial areas.  Eir has stated it will roll out fibre to the home to a further 1.6 million premises in urban areas, bringing its overall fibre-to-the-home deployment to approximately 1.9 million premises.  Meanwhile, SIRO is currently completing the first phase of its fibre deployment.  To date, it has passed more than 400,000 premises with gigabit services.  It has recently announced plans to extend that network to an additional 320,000 premises.  Virgin Media Ireland has also recently announced a &euro;200 million investment to upgrade its broadband network to full fibre to the more than 1 million premises the company covers over the next three years.  Many other network operators and telecommunications service providers across the State also continue to invest in their networks.<\/p><p>Today, more than 2.4 million or 77% of premises in Ireland can access commercially available high-speed broadband services of more than 30 Mbps.  In the 2021 digital economy and society index, DESI, for the 27 EU countries, Ireland performed well.  It ranked fifth with a score of 60.3, which is well above the EU average of 50.7.  NBI will address the remaining premises through the national broadband plan State intervention.<\/p><p>As recently as six years ago, Ireland had a fibre-to-the-home, FTTH, network covering less than 1% of the 1.7 million broadband subscriptions.  Latest figures from ComReg for quarter 3 of 2021 showed that FTTH subscriptions are now at 340,000 or 20% of the 1.7 million subscriptions and growing.  This upward trajectory has been achieved through a combination of commercial investment and State intervention.<\/p><p>NBI commenced connections to the new fibre network in January 2021, just 12 months ago.  As of today, over 54,000 premises are available for order and pre-order for high-speed fibre broadband across 21 counties, including Carlow, Clare, Cavan, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Limerick, Louth, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Waterford, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow.<\/p><p>NBI has advised that over 154,000 premises are constructed or under construction, demonstrating that the project is reaching scale.  Over 5,400 premises have been connected as of 14 January and this figure is increasing weekly.  To date, the level of connections is in line with projections and in some areas it is exceeding expectations.<\/p><p>While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network, resulting in delays in the delivery of aspects of the programme.  Impacts include challenges with the mobilisation of key contractors, restrictions on operations and supply chain, as well as logistical delays, both nationally and internationally.  In addition, there have been challenges with the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale up, including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people.  Like all of us, NBI and contractor staff are at risk of contracting Covid-19 or may have had to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact.  This impact continues to be felt due to the current more contagious Omicron variant.<\/p><p>With a project of the scale of the NBP, it can be difficult for media commentary to fully communicate the scale of activity or work completed in terms of delivery of the NBP.  I will share with Senators some details of what has been achieved against the backdrop of challenging circumstances brought about by the pandemic to date.  Some 6 million m of cable has been installed; 25,000 telegraph poles have been remediated or newly installed; 152,000 premises have been submitted to Open Eir for make-ready; 250 section 254 applications have been submitted across all 31 local authorities, with 154 approved; 38 deployment area designs have been approved by the Department; over 150,000 premises in 45 deployment areas across 26 counties are either under build or build-completed; six deployment areas are now fully build-completed, with four more deployment areas nearing completion; three island deployment areas with build are under way; 26 local exchange sites with Nokia equipment installed are ready for network connectivity; there are 54,000 premises available to order or pre-order across 21 counties, as well as three islands off the coast of Donegal; there are 34,417 premises available to order by 31 January 2022; 7,355 orders have been received by retail service providers; 5,477 connections have been completed across 11 counties, with 1,300 connections made in December 2021 alone; 453 broadband connection points have been installed; and 50 retail service providers, RSPs, have been contracted, with 34 of those on-boarded.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ossian Smyth:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The ongoing investment in the roll-out is also creating employment opportunities.  There are 292 direct employees and 911 indirect employees working with build and design contractors.  They are now employed on foot of the NBP investment, with this number rising weekly as construction activity ramps up.<br\/><br\/>Broadband connection points, BCPs, are a key element of the NBP.  They are located in areas of community importance, allowing local residents to quickly get free public access to high-speed broadband in advance of fibre deployment under the national broadband plan.  BCPs are a key support for promoting balanced regional development as part of a sustainable and equitable post-pandemic recovery and will enable rural communities to avail of the opportunities presented by the digital economy.  BCPs have been developed to become digitally enabled community assets.  Activities currently under way include: the establishment of remote working facilities at a significant number of locations; remote e-health consultation booth pilot projects; digital skills training for children and young people and; a national BCP film festival that will be screened at BCPs.<br\/><br\/>As of 14 January, some 453 BCP sites in total have been installed by NBI and 255 of the publicly available sites are now connected with high-speed broadband service through a service provider contract with Vodafone.  As part of this initiative, primary school BCPs are also being provided with high-speed broadband, for educational use, through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Education.  To date, 185 schools have been installed, out of the total of 453 BCP sites, with high-speed broadband for educational access and 99 schools are now connected.  An acceleration of this aspect of the national broadband plan will see some 679 schools connected to high-speed broadband well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.<br\/><br\/>The House will also be aware of recent commentary on the ownership structure of NBI and parliamentary questions answered by me on this in the D&aacute;il in December.  I can confirm that the ownership structure of NBI remains as advised to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications at contract award in November 2019 and at the effective date of the contract on 9 January, 2020.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has rights of consent under the project agreement in respect of changes in ownership and NBI must notify the Minister in advance of any such event arising.  There have been no subsequent notifications of changes to ownership or control.<br\/><br\/>With large-scale projects of this nature, it is usual that the investors' investment in the project is structured through tiered holding companies.  NBI applies the highest standards to its corporate governance and the structures adopted by it are typical of investments in critical infrastructure not only in Ireland but globally where investors of international reach and scale are involved.

T&aacute; an tAire St&aacute;it ag obair go dian ar an bhfadhb seo.  Is d&uacute;shl&aacute;n m&oacute;r &eacute; at&aacute; ann le fada an l&aacute; ach, faoi dheireadh, t&aacute; ruda&iacute; ag tarl&uacute; agus t&aacute; s&eacute; ag bogadh ar aghaidh.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for taking on this role.  I know he has been working immensely hard on it.  We have had repeated meetings with NBI to see how we can get the entire process speeded up.  I see we are now reaching targets beyond those originally set.  I take my hat off to the Minister of State.  Despite Covid and everything else, it is good to finally see proper acceleration for rural broadband.  I cannot emphasise enough how important it is to everything in rural Ireland.  As a point of information, Macra na Feirme conducted a rural youth survey and sent a questionnaire to young people in rural areas.  Macra has more than 10,000 members.  Some 53% of young people said they would stay in their local village or rural area.  If there was good Internet access, they would be willing to stay and work from home or in a remote working hub.  It is such an key element to ensuring that rural areas remain alive.  For too long we have only seen old people and really young people in villages.  There was a complete brain drain of the young people who are needed in every village and town.  I remember living in Drumcolliher years ago and we started an organic horticulture course.  There was a bunch of 20-somethings involved.  All the old people in the village kept calling to my house saying it was great to have young people around the village.  Bringing broadband to rural areas is akin to bringing colleges and jobs to those places.  As we discovered during the pandemic, we can do most things from home.  It is interesting that rural broadband could bring so many young people, energy, ideas and innovation to villages and towns, all of which are so badly needed.<\/p> <p>It is great that more than 3,600 premises around Kilkishen, Sixmilebridge, Ballyhannon, Cloghlea, Bunratty, Shannon and Spancel Hill are getting fibre broadband.  The BCPs are brilliant as well.  They are definitely very useful while we are waiting for everybody to get rural broadband, and they will be needed after that.  I worked from home for 14 years.  I used to check into a digihub even though I had good Internet access at home.  That was just to have people around me and so I would not have to look at the laundry.  There is an important role to be played by digihubs or BCPs.  It is not a case of having one or the other; we need both.  It is really good to see them coming on board.  In my village of Inagh, we will have a new digihub in the coming weeks.  They are scattered all over Clare now.  In fairness to the local authority, Clare is leading the way because it has brought it on board.  There is a very successful digital hub in Ennistimon, and a brand new one in Ennis.  It can make a huge difference to people to have that connection, even those who have been working from home successfully.  I work out of the Ennistimon hub and I see the fantastic collaboration that is coming out of it.  People are working with each other and creating new ideas within the framework provided by rural digihubs.<\/p> <p>I want to ask the Minister of State a couple of questions.  A case was put by a neighbour of mine, who got more than 120 householders to agree that they would all sign up to fibre broadband.  I do not know how NBI works to prioritise where it goes, who gets fibre and when, but I am curious to hear a bit about that.  If we have 70 households, for example, to buy into it, is it more attractive then for NBI to have to go to each individual house in the hope that it will link in with it?  It must be worth the company's while financially as well, given that the cost is the main challenge in bringing rural broadband to individual houses that are scattered.  It is much easier and cheaper to bring it into an urban area.  Could we look at the idea of clusters of houses in a rural area?  Even though it is not a town, we could create the equivalent of a town of 120 houses in one small parish if they would sign up to fibre broadband?  Is that something that could be prioritised then to be rolled out?<\/p> <p>In some places they have got as far as getting the infrastructure in place.  The poles are up and everybody is very excited but then it is not linked or turned on.  A case in point is Barefield National School, which has 370 pupils and 35 staff but most days they cannot send emails.  The pole is outside the door and all the infrastructure is there but for some reason they are not connected.  I do not know what that is about.<\/p> <p>I would like an explanation of how the relationship between Eir and NBI works.  Are they competing or is Eir working under NBI?  I seek clarity on that because there seems to be some confusion in that regard as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#U00300","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  It is good to see the recent statement from NBI on the progress in surveying homes in Donegal.

It is important to recognise that progress is being made.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, for a plan of this magnitude, we really must dial back and look at the rate of progress and the meeting of deadlines.  That is where the questions may be.  Last December we were told by NBI CEO, Peter Hendrick, that only 3,335 homes and business had been connected to high-speed Internet under the national broadband plan since its roll-out 22 months ago.  That figure has been updated to 5,400 as of 14 July, according to that statement.  That is another 2,065 in the last month.  We are quite far off track on the original goal of delivering high-speed broadband to more than 540,000 premises over the course of the seven-year project.  In fact, NBI has not even set its annual goal for 2022, having failed to the reach the self-set goals for either of the two previous years of the roll-out.  All in all, it is disheartening between the costs, tendering and withdrawals.  By 2022 I hope most of us realise the importance of the role of the Internet.  That importance is not going to diminish.  It will only grow.  We need to think of broadband access in the same way we think of roads and the provision of water, light and heat.  The building of a robust, modern and future-proofed national broadband network is something the State must do for the benefit of the citizen and the economy and, to some degree, the core infrastructure must remain a public asset.  When it comes to providers and competition, I am all for healthy competition in the market but the infrastructure must be there first to ensure coverage and to allow for it in the first place.<\/p><p>I have a few suggestions on what should be done.  Our broadband infrastructure must be future-proofed.  By this I mean roads, footpaths, etc., should, where needed, include installed ducting that will be carrier-neutral for purposes of supplying broadband services.  Providing such infrastructure may afford revenue generation to pay for the investment over time.  It should also reduce the amount of work, road openings and overall cost of supplying broadband services as well as encouraging more competition.  While the broadband connection points are welcome they are limited in rural areas.  We need to supply and allow communities to provide for themselves with community broadband projects.  This model has been successful in other countries.  ComReg has not specified a specific rate of functional Internet access.  ComReg decided to specify that the data rate must not be less than 28.8 kilobits per second as a minimum data rate and an associated target that 94% of the installed telephone connections must be capable so supporting a minimum data rate of kilobits per second.  This is a minimum data rate in that it does not preclude Eir from offering data rates that are faster than this.  This needs to be raised to at least 2 megabytes.  Even that is far too low in the current year but the infrastructure is so bad in places.  It should be at least 10 at this stage.<\/p><p>There is another issue with regard to the cost of broadband, especially for the elderly.  I wish to see the cost of broadband included in the household benefits package.  Currently, that package includes electricity, gas, the television licence, etc.  The telephone allowance is only available to people who are living alone and are getting the fuel allowance.  That is &euro;2.50 per week.  Maybe the Government could incorporate the broadband costs for the elderly.  I would appreciate it if that were something it could take up in next year's budget.<\/p><p>This is all of vital importance.  We cannot penalise rural dwellers through our failure to provide necessary IT infrastructure.  It is not fair for those who do not live in major cities to be left behind by the digital revolution.  I thank the Minister of State for listening to my comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#U00400","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Like others I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House for more statements on broadband, which is something that has been a common feature of this Oireachtas and the previous one.  There is little doubt the pandemic has brought into sharp focus the need for high-speed broadband.  The vision for it was set more than ten years ago.  It has stood the test of time in that rolling out high-speed broadband to areas that would not normally be covered by the commercial sector is a policy position that has been taken by successive Governments.  The Minister of State rightly identified that there has been very significant investment across the more densely-populated areas by commercial entities.  They do so not for anything but to gain a return on their investment.  That is healthy and how it should be and it is working well.  If one is fortunate to live in one of those areas, which many people are, one benefits from reasonably good broadband access.  It is not perfect because there is not fibre to the home in many cases and we need to encourage the commercial sector to continue with that.  There are people who live in densely-populated areas not covered by the national broadband plan who still do not have a great Internet speed.  We therefore need, through our policies and through the Department, to continue with that effort with the ultimate goal of having fibre to the home.  Fibre to the cabinet is good in some areas but it is not enough.<\/p> <p>I do not want to go back over what did or did not happen with the national broadband plan and the contract associated with it.  The only comment I will make is the entire project should be seen as a doctoral thesis in how not to do something.  I will leave it at that.  I put plenty on the record of the relevant committee and of the other House during my time as spokesperson about this particular sector and how we got it wrong.  We need to learn from it and move on.  From the outset, I believed we should have done this by way of direct award.  The competitive process was not the right way to go and the result has proven that.  That is not to take from NBI, which is progressing the project, though not as fast as we would like.  There is a steep learning curve and NBI is undergoing that at the moment.  I felt from the outset we should have charged the ESB with responsibility and let it do this since it falls broadly within its field of competence.  That did not happen and we are suffering and will suffer for a considerable amount of time into the future for the decisions that were taken.  However, they have been taken and we must now work with NBI and its partners to try to move the project to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  We can come in here and throw insults at each other but that would not serve anyone.  We should work collectively to try to figure out how we make this happen more quickly.<\/p> <p>There needs to be a greater level of co-ordination.  I am aware that it was a policy position way back to try to bring together a commonality of approach at local authority level.  I understand from NBI and others that there is still not uniformity with applying for licences, getting results and getting access to certain permissions and that acts as a delay.  It is not the principle or primary delay but it is part of it.  Some of the issues the Minister of State identified as delaying the process were foreseen by some of us and we flagged them at the time.  NBI was probably gung-ho and rightly so, as that is needed.  However, NBI needs to get more customer-focused.  I have said that to the company as well.  The only broadband-related question I get at my constituency offices and clinics is when.  Some people still do not realise that it is a national contract and that it is not Eir anymore or is not SIRO or whatever company.  It is now a State contract and there is company in place.  They do not care about that and we get into great detail because we know how it is and how it is not.  What people want to know is when.  I appeal to the Minister of State to, insofar as he can, work with NBI to put in place a customer interface.  It has a good one for people who are within six months of getting it.  They can log on, see the area and know where it is at.  However, it is different if it is going to be four or five years.  Despite the fact the spin at the time was it would be done within five years, I always thought it would take seven.  I suspect it will be longer given the issues and challenges that have arisen.  Be that as it may, the one thing the vast majority of people want in life generally is certainty.  With the level of roll-out experience NBI has at this stage, it should be in a position to give an indicative timeframe.  You say to someone that they are going to be in year three.  The person may try to find some kind of an interim fix using a wireless option of whatever but NBI should at least give them that certainty, insofar as it can.  That is the piece missing at the minute.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said in the early stages of taking up office that the Government would look at trying to expedite the roll-out.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Timmy Dooley:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Has there been any more around that?  I understand National Broadband Ireland has signed up and has contractual arrangements.  If there is more money required at this stage, or if there is something that the Government can do, either in policy or financial terms, that shortens that period of roll-out, then we should be looking at it.  I go back to my opening comment; to some people, it would be nice to have it in the future as a lifestyle issue, for Netflix or for the kids to perhaps do a little bit of gaming or whatever.  It is now as important as the phone line was at one stage and probably more important.  To some extent, it was an overstatement when people say it would be as important as electricity; it now is, for most people.  Whether it was kids trying to access education or doing the basic things, that is now so important.  That is now a feature of life.  <\/p><p>Even with the legislation that was published by the Government yesterday giving people a right to request the opportunity to work remotely, many people will be required to work remotely.  To be sure, some companies need people in the office.  However, many others are now looking at their office and property portfolios and are scaling back because they see a benefit to the employee and cost reductions from their own operational perspective.  From now on, we will see people being employed on the basis that they will need to and have to work remotely.  That becomes a real problem for those who live in areas with a relatively poor level of broadband.  <\/p><p>People need certainty, and we should do anything that can be done to speed it up.  We have been able to find money to resolve issues in the very recent past and we can do it here.  We can work with local authorities and remove some of those impediments that are there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#V00200","speaker":"1655","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I am sharing time equally with Senator Buttimer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#W00200","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I tend not to be too party political in the Seanad, but in 2017 and 2018, the Taoiseach at the time, Deputy Varadkar, championed this issue when there was a chorus of people telling him it was too much, too expensive, too ambitious, it was not going to happen and suggesting it would be better to focus and divert attention elsewhere.  Due to a pandemic that has crossed the world, it has proven to be a very smart idea.  I would like to put on the record that the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, championed this issue from the very get-go.  Now we see how important it is that we are where we are today because of something that no one foresaw.<\/p> <p>When we consider where we are now with remote working, by having broadband in the most far-flung rural places in this country, it is putting everyone on an even keel.  This country and its development of infrastructure over the past 20 to 40 years has been either large-city centric or large-provincial town centric.  Finally, we are now able to put in infrastructure into rural Ireland to put it on the same level playing field, enabling people to access education, do their online banking and work from home at the same level as anybody else.  It is that level of equality and ensuring there is equilibrium between urban and rural Ireland that is one of the most important things about rural broadband and why I very much welcome it.  <\/p> <p>The other point about broadband is not just necessarily about working from home, but it is with the provision and the real push towards ensuring we have remote working hubs in rural villages.  What is good about that is that one is taking previously derelict or vacant buildings and repurposing them.  People are coming into rural areas and villages and ten or 15 people are working away in it.  That is an income as well to everyone else within that village, whether it is the shop, the butcher or wherever.  When people are coming into those areas they are spending money in those localities as well, and that is a result of bringing strong broadband provision in these areas.  <\/p> <p>When the history of this time of infrastructure will be written, very strong comparisons will be shown with the electrification of rural Ireland.  The Shannon scheme started in 1929 and the last rural areas electrified were in 1964.  It was a 30-year process.  Make no mistake about it; the infrastructural project we are embarking on here is of the absolute same colossal significance as was rural electrification.  It is the exact same thing.  Back then, naturally, it took over 30 years.  We are hoping to do it in a much shorter timeframe.  <\/p> <p>When I look at my own part of the world with NBI in County Louth, and Senator Dooley mentioned it as well, I have to compliment NBI on its ability to communicate.  It is a very good communicator.  One can log on online and, down to the very townland, to a couple of fields or to a small townland, one can see roughly when that is due to be connected.  That provides people with much peace of mind because they can acknowledge that they can put up with it for another six months or year.  <\/p> <p>We can only begin to imagine the sheer frustration of people when they could be getting towards a work deadline or project or whatever it is, and the Internet is dropping or it is not at the same speed as someone 20 miles down the road in an urban town.  It must be absolutely infuriating.  If we think about it, people living in rural areas much of the time can be treated as second-class citizens in terms of broadband because they do not have the same level of equality or access to it.    <\/p> <p>The point was mentioned earlier that we have moved so much more online in every aspect of our lives.  There are very few aspects of people&rsquo;s lives today that are not online and that it why it is so important that broadband will be rolled out into every single corner, parish and rural area of this country.  That is the big reason this whole project is vitally important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#W00400","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McGahon for sharing time.

That is why this project is so important.<\/p> <p>I would ask Members of the House who raised legitimate concerns and criticisms of the speed to engage with NBI, which has participated in a series of meetings with us as Members of the Oireachtas, to see first-hand the complexity of what is involved.

The committee that I am a member of will again tomorrow have a meeting with NBI in regard to the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  I can genuinely say that what I have seen is that there is a concerted effort being made to deliver.  There are concerns and it is a right to articulate those concerns about the missed targets.  We are all concerned about the delays associated with the project.  We are at a reflection point, perhaps, right now in the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  However, let us look at what has happened in terms of the work being done until now.  <\/p> <p>I would make just this one point.  NBI must lay 1.4 million new poles.  What does that mean?

Senator Buttimer was entirely correct when he talked about the significant project the roll-out of broadband will be.  The Senator compares it to rural electrification.  I would like to compare it to another big project, namely, the late Minister, Donogh O'Malley, making available secondary school education to children, in terms of the potential impact the roll-out of broadband could have.  The angle I want to come at it from is the importance of the roll-out of broadband in tackling educational disadvantage.  If we leave not only parts of the country but communities in rural areas behind in terms of access to broadband, we will be making a big mistake.  That is the equivalent.  People learn through information, information is available on the Internet and we access that through broadband.  We have seen that, particularly over the past two years of the pandemic.<\/p> <p>One of the most disappointing responses to the pandemic was when we closed down schools from January to March last year.  In doing that, we cut many children from an educationally disadvantaged background off, even from remote learning, because many of them did not have access given the high-cost of broadband in this country.  Some were relying on data in order to be able to access the education they needed.  Research from the ESRI and other research institutes around Europe has shown that other countries are providing catch-up funds for children because educational disadvantage has been exacerbated by the pandemic.  I would argue that access to broadband is a cause of that.<\/p> <p>On a most basic level, it is vital that both schools and education facilities across the country have access to high-quality broadband.  It is fundamental to ensure there is no divide in educational equality based on where you live.  We saw during the pandemic, when school children and students were required to engage in remote learning, that a lack of access to reliable broadband, or any broadband, quickly became an issue.  A lack of not only a good Internet connection but an Internet connection that is accessible and cheap for families from all backgrounds, should never act as a barrier to educational opportunities.<\/p> <p>Last year the Whitaker Institute at NUIG, in its policy brief series, noted that one in six higher education students in Ireland is from an area with poor broadband coverage.  It went on to note that students from areas with the lowest level of broadband coverage were on average more likely to be socio-economically disadvantaged and that the digital divide had the potential to create significant inequalities in education at all levels.  At the same time, we are seeing a greater reliance on technology in our schools and more children are using the Internet to help with their homework.  Intrinsic to this is not only basic Internet access, fast Internet access and reliable Internet access, but Internet access that is affordable or, preferably, free for families.<\/p> <p>No child in primary or secondary school or in a higher education institution should be put in a position where his or her potential educational achievement or access is being stunted by lack of access to broadband.  This is as much an issue of reducing inequalities in our education system as it is about facilitating remote working or helping business.  It will have long-term impacts on children across the country if the digital divide that has opened up is not closed.  Covid-19 and remote learning brought these issues into stark focus and it is essential that the Government now delivers on the commitments in the national broadband plan and tries to focus on getting free broadband for children from all backgrounds, both urban and rural.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#X00400","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the Minister of State to the House today.  There are a couple of points I want to raise with him.  The first is the broadband connections that has been raised by colleagues in the House.  In County Kildare, we have five at present, at Bigstone community hall, Crookstown education centre, Lullymore nature park and Rathmore National School and St. David's National School.  These are very good and they are well used.  The query I have is on whether that is the end of it.  I have been trying to seek more information on this.<\/p> <p>The conversation about remote working has been mentioned.  A number of rural communities have asked me that question.  I pay tribute to the broadband officers in each local authority.  The one in Kildare has been particularly good to me every time I have had a query on these connections but I need to know whether that is the end of it.  I brought it up previously at the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands of which I am a member.  Obviously, I want to inform those rural communities that such a broadband connection is an option for them.  As I said, in those five locations they have worked well but there are other rural areas in south Kildare that could benefit from this.<\/p> <p>The conversation has rightly turned in the past number of days to remote working.  These locations can assist that.  Many people want to have the option, notwithstanding what the Government announced yesterday, to continue to work remotely.  In some of the locations I deal with, it is just not possible to continue working remotely.  One of the reasons the Government gave yesterday was about Internet quality.  That is obviously a problem for so many people where they want to work remotely but it is simply not possible.  The query for the Minister of State is on where we can go with that and on what can happen.<\/p> <p>I must mention a couple of areas.  In the Kilkea-Castledermot area, with which the Acting Chairperson will be familiar, people cannot get a mobile phone connection, never mind a broadband connection.  I have raised this at the committee to which I referred earlier when NBI was in with us.  It does not provide the peace of mind other Senators talked about here today.  It does not provide peace of mind to them that when they go on to the NBI website they are told that it is due in 2023 or 2024.  One of the biggest problems I have had - I raised this with the NBI officials when they were in on the day - is that when people see the erection of signs stating that the area is being surveyed and broadband is on the way, everybody gets excited about it but suddenly after the week of the survey, the vans have gone out of the area and that is it.  There is no follow-up.  I asked NBI to provide follow-up and to inform the people, as other Senators said today, that this is a process that has to be followed.  There should be follow-up from the company.  NBI should put up a sign after it leaves telling people about it.  It should be going house-to-house in that area because they are there for a week.  I have seen the vans.  It brings great excitement and then, as a couple of Senators mentioned, it is raised with us in terms of what happens next.  That is a significant issue and I raise it again today.<\/p> <p>The blueways, which the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, his party and the Government have rolled out and which we have welcomed, are great.  We need hot spots along those blueways for a number of reasons - obviously, for the tourists who will trail along them but, more importantly, for security.  We have seen what has happened in the past number of weeks.  We need to know that everybody is safe along those blueways.  A couple of hot spots along those blueways would be very welcome.  It is something NBI and the Government should consider.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#X00500","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I am not the first to say that broadband is a basic utility in this day and age but, unfortunately, rural communities and some communities in north County Dublin are still waiting for connections.  Yesterday, much attention was focused on the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s proposals on the so-called \"right to ask to work from home\" or, as my colleague, Deputy Louise O&rsquo;Reilly, more accurately called it, \"a charter for employers to say \"No\"\".  The question of rights aside, the sad fact is that many workers are not even in a position to ask to work from home because the Internet connection is so poor.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Broadband infrastructure is of critical strategic importance not least for the fight against climate change.  If we are to achieve the emissions reductions in transport that are essential, a decent broadband network is a prerequisite.  <br\/><br\/>The figures from NBI do not inspire confidence.  It was reported in the <i>Business Post<\/i>last November that there were only 3,000 connections by third party sellers.  We are waiting with bated breath to see the January connection figures.  There was a target of 60,000 homes and business premises to be passed by the broadband scheme.It will be very telling for the effectiveness of the acceleration plans and catch-up on Covid delays.  We are expecting a plan for that around March, although we accept it will not kick in until 2023 and beyond.  We also expected the seven-year programme to be accelerated into a five-year programme, with all this laid out contractually in and around March.  The fact that we will not make a reduced target is incredibly worrying, especially in combination with the reports from the<i>Business Post<\/i>and others, which have put into the public domain the serious questions that remain about the financial and corporate arrangements.<br\/><br\/>There are several operational problems faced currently such as the problems of Eir-NBI duplication and the fact that NBI is dependent on capacity within Eir, Enet and, to a lesser degree, ESB.  There were difficulties in crossing lands owned by CIE, although those are largely dealt with.  There were difficulties dealing with local authorities and TII.  There were planning permission for poles and road opening licence delays and even issues with tree trimming.  Updated section 254 guidelines have streamlined dealing with local authorities but there are still problems.  NBI has said there is a requirement for dedicated planning and engineering resources in each local authority, particularly to deliver on any possible acceleration.  The best case solution would be a planning permission system similar to the system on the north of the island.<br\/><br\/>On transparency, it is interesting to note the information NBI has made available online in that it is detailed and seems accurate from initial readings.  However, it was only published on its website after it was reported in the media, therefore, any claims it is making about how it illustrates its commitment to transparency ring a little hollow. <br\/><br\/>There are also questions regarding NBI's contract.  The Department was warned continuously that the procurement process for this contract was flawed.  It was warned by the then Sinn F&eacute;in communications spokesperson, Deputy Stanley, by external firms, by procurement experts at University Limerick, and even by the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Robert Watt.<br\/><br\/>Commitments were given in the previous D&aacute;il that if the company was behind schedule, the State would have ways of protecting itself in the form of penalties.  Yet we learned last year that there are no penalties in the contract and there would be only delays to payment, which is hardly a penalty at all.  We learned from the Committee on Public Accounts that the company can review and revise the targets.  This crazy situation is coming after a litany of other overspends and poor management of Government contracts by Fine Gael.<br\/><br\/>I highlighted on the Order of Business just this morning the findings of the European Court of Auditors report, which highlighted the failure of the Irish State to avail of EU retrofitting funding.  Again, that was under the remit of a Fine Gael Minister.  We can see Fine Gael is very poor for major contracts.  It is supposed to be the party of prudence yet we have massive delays and overruns across a variety of public projects.  The children&rsquo;s hospital is 500% over budget.  Capital expenditure is set to increase over the coming years as a result of the revised national development plan, therefore, it is imperative as taxpayers we get good value for money under this Government.  To that end, my colleague, Deputy Farrell, has introduced a Bill to regulate publicly procured capital works.  If we are serious about getting value for money from the projects such as the national broadband plan and the ones outlined in the national development plan, there needs to be greater regulation of public procurement spending on capital projects.  Deputy Farrell&rsquo;s Bill is a first step on the road to better value from capital expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#X00600","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, for coming to the House to take this matter.<\/p><p>I am very disappointed to read the Minister, Deputy Ryan&rsquo;s national broadband plan update and to see that a few counties have been left behind on this update, Donegal being one of them.  A former Minister, Pat Rabbitte, announced the national broadband plan ten years ago this August.  When announcing it, he described the national broadband plan as the rural electrification of the 21st century.  Now, a decade later, most of rural Ireland has been left behind in this roll-out.  I have been contacted by many people in Donegal regarding this. <\/p><p>Working from home and remote learning have highlighted these broadband issues and many families in the county have become very frustrated at the lack of a stable Internet connection.  Many of these families have told me they were informed they have serious connection issues but they will not be getting fibre broadband until 2025 or 2026.  It should not be so<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> stressful or take so long to get access to a necessary service.  This is completely unacceptable. <\/font><\/p><p>Those of us who live in rural Ireland know what a difference it would make to families and others to have proper broadband connection.  Why are the most rural, disconnected and forgotten areas of Ireland not being prioritised?  Rural Ireland should be prioritised in this roll-out given that this area had the weakest Internet connection from the beginning.  Every other county has already seen the start of broadband roll-out but Donegal will not see it until the second half of this year.  Why is that?  This is a form of enforced inequality and it is not good enough.  My colleague, Deputy Pringle, has been calling on the Minister for years to ensure that Donegal is not left behind in the broadband roll-out.  I join his call.  This has gone on for too long and there needs to be some accountability.  <\/p><p>We can see the impact the digital divide is having on people&rsquo;s ability to access work, health services and education.  I have been discussing the digital divide for a long time both in this House and at the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  Rural schools are located in areas where broadband is unstable and it is difficult to teach online and to even teach children in the classroom who do not have access to broadband.  Some vulnerable students have also had to fight to access online learning or have not been able to access it at all during school closures.  This creates a further digital divide.  The reality is that <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">students who have access to the best digital resources will do better and have better outcomes.  As my colleague, Senator Ruane, said last week, for many students across the country, having a laptop and broadband are a luxury.  Many students lost out on<\/font>education due to the lack of adequate<b><\/b>learning supports and access to online learning just because they live in rural Ireland.  We cannot create further inequality and division in this country.  It has to end now. <\/p><p>As many Senators have said, we must also examine the cost of broadband roll-out.  There is a small road, Crumlin Road, in Ardara where I live and there is no Internet connection in that area.  Many areas of the country will not see the roll-out of broadband until at least the end of the year and for Donegal the beginning of the roll-out will not be seen until half-way through the year.  That is very disheartening for people.  The T&aacute;naiste announced yesterday that people have the right to request to work from home.  How can we expect people from Donegal, the forgotten county yet again, to be left behind?  It impacts on people and children's lives in terms of having equal opportunities to be successful and to be able to work from home, but many of them do not have that.  I urge that we address that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#Y00200","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I have no doubt about his commitment to this massive project.  The sentiment expressed by everybody is that we must speed up this roll-out as quickly as possible.

I accept the Government is ramping up this project.  I understand it is an area of constant debate at Cabinet meetings, etc.  The figures are not that bad, but we need to move much faster.  We have had many situations with Covid.  People are working from home.  In future, whatever arrangements happen between employers and employees, we will have a mixed bag of people possibly working two days from home and three days from the office, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  In my own area of County Roscommon and parts of County Galway I know very well, there is not a week where I do not meet people who are now working from home whose broadband connections just are not there.  They may have a private connection.  They do not always work, although sometimes they do.  If one is out in an area of rural Ireland that is not hugely populated, a commercial firm will not be worried about getting broadband to somebody at the end of the road.  That is why the National Broadband Ireland and Government plan needs to be ramped up.<br\/><br\/>As of 7 January, 290,000 premises have been surveyed.  The Minister of State mentioned that surveys are under way.  More than 154,000 premises have been constructed or are under construction across all counties.  It is nice to see Roscommon, Galway, Leitrim and other places in the midlands and west covered, and that is important.  It is important we can continue to talk about rural regeneration and the rural regeneration and development fund.  There is great work going on, including in towns in my own county such as Strokestown, Ballaghaderreen and Boyle, and others all over the place.  They are getting money to draw up significant plans to re-establish life in their towns.  We all want to put that life back into our towns.  The piece of the jigsaw that we need is broadband.  Sometimes people will say there is a house in the area for sale and ask what it is like.  The next question is whether it has broadband.  It is becoming like electricity was in the past.  It is needed and will be needed by everybody.  We all agree with the Town Centre First approach.  We need to build the best facilities in our towns.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge this is a European problem, not just an Irish problem.  I have been reading about problems in Germany, England and parts of France with broadband.  We also have to accept that some built-up urban areas have difficulties too.  Overall, there are challenges.  Broadband is a crucial issue.  It is also crucial with regard to the Housing for All policy.  We need to use every avenue we can to support and promote what the Government is doing.  We need to ramp up the roll-out.  There is no doubt that it is happening, but there needs to be a greater emphasis on getting this to rural areas, especially going back to changed work practices after Covid.  I am sure the Minister of State will acknowledge that makes it all the more important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#Y00300","speaker":"1674","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, and the Secretary General of the Department.  I was a Minister of State in that Department for a period of time and was involved with some of the work to deliver broadband and the work National Broadband Ireland is now undertaking.  It has had a long, difficult gestation, but the contract has been signed, funding has been committed, and work is ongoing.  I certainly know other projects can make announcements at different stages and people will say they will not believe it until they see the machines and the diggers.  That is part of the issue here.  I have always assured people that somebody has to be first to be connected and, unfortunately, somebody has to be last, when connecting every house in the country.  It was the same for electrification.  The Black Valley in Kerry was the last place to be electrified.  A place in Ireland will be the last to be connected, but the important point is that all places will be connected.<\/p> <p>The work that is going on, such as surveying, is evident in certain areas.  It then has to go through the stages of design, build and connection.  Some areas are connected, including my own area on the outskirts of Galway city, Bushypark, Barna and parts of Moycullen.  When everybody hears that someone in the next townland has got it, they might be in a different grouping or phase, so it takes some explaining.  The maps are there and they are evidence.  We have to bring people with it, to see that areas are being connected.  It is starting.  It is not completing all of one county.  It is not starting in Dublin and working its way out.  It is starting in every province, in every county, and it is evident from the maps where there is a start point and where there will be a concluding point.  I appreciate there will be a delay of a few years until all areas are connected.  If we can expedite it through investment or such, that would be welcome.  This is a positive story.

I went on public media to promote it when many parties were doing their best to talk it down, to say it was a waste of money, that it was inappropriate and that it was too expensive.  These people are now saying it is not being rolled out fast enough.  An awful lot of work has been done, we have boots on the ground, and the roll-out is happening.  That has to be acknowledged.  The amount of work the Department and officials have done has to be acknowledged in this Chamber too.  This is a really good news story.

The biggest problem we will have in five years is that the people of rural Ireland will not have broadband of the same speed.  That will be the biggest problem in ten years too.  We have been talking to people living in urban areas who have said their neighbour three miles down the road has much faster broadband than their own.  That will be the real issue.  The problem with this proposal is that it is going to be too successful, and because it will be too successful, urban Ireland will look for a service at the same speed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#Z00300","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>It has already been mentioned that the importance of broadband will be compared to water infrastructure, electrification and roads.  When prioritised, broadband infrastructure is now maybe as important as road infrastructure, because if we can work from home, we do not need the road to take us to work.  It has critical importance.  Over the last two years of the Covid pandemic, we have identified broadband as a significant need in future, because it allowed a significant proportion of our workforce to work from home.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pat Casey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2431\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2431&amp;amp;pid=PatCasey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As we, the legislators, begin to discuss legislating for working from home, it is critical that nobody is left behind and that inequality does not exist because a person does not have broadband and cannot avail of working from home.<\/p><p>In the previous D&aacute;il, I participated in a number of broadband debates.  I think we can draw a line under that and say that whether we agree or disagree on whatever we did in regard to the roll-out of broadband, we all got a sense of relief in 2019 when, at long last, the contract was signed and we could start delivering this much-needed infrastructure.  Senator Dooley and a number of others mentioned that people do not care and that they just want to know when they are going to be connected.  They do not want to know that the box in the village is broadband but, sorry, they are still connected to the exchange, or when we roll out to the 300,000 homes through Eir, they are not within 50 m of that connection and, therefore, do not qualify.  All of these complexities are just adding to the frustration.<\/p><p>In my community, I can give the exact example of that with regard to our community centre and national school, where the broadband pole was on the footpath outside the premises, yet they could not get connected.  That gave the previous Government the example of what was needed.  In fairness, the Government came down to St. Kevin's National School and Brockagh Resource Centre in Laragh to launch the national broadband plan.  That was a hugely positive day.<\/p><p>The appointment of NBI was another step in the right direction but there is a level of frustration.  People have said NBI is great at communicating but, sometimes, the news it is giving is not so great.  I come from a rural area and have an understanding of the need for this at home and in business, and my own business was lucky to be one of those 300,000 premises that were able to connect to broadband.  I registered with NBI in 2020, when people could put in their Eircode and get updates on it.  The road outside my house now seems to be an interchange for NBI vans, given there are that many of them going up and down in the last 18 months.  I was saying &ldquo;It is getting nearer&rdquo;, and we then saw the poles going in and the cables coming up to the poles.  Then, in December 2021, I got an email with the update to the effect that my broadband connection will happen in December 2023, and I just said, &ldquo;My God, is it that far away?&rdquo;<\/p><p>The intention of NBI is good.  It wants to roll out broadband.  Where are the obstacles in this regard?  Let us park Covid for a minute.  Everybody had to deal with Covid, so let us not use that.  How is the infrastructure relationship with Eir working and how successful is that?  What is the bureaucracy behind that?  Is it working and is NBI getting access to the equipment it needs?  When it gets to that equipment, what condition is it in with regard to poles, ducting, cables or space within that?  How much of a delay is there?  On another aspect, there are still some blockages in the bureaucracy in regard to local authorities.  Is that holding it up?  NBI needs to get the finger out a bit more and start delivering, and not hide behind excuses.<\/p><p>I will conclude with positive news.  It was an honour to welcome the Minister of State on his visit to Brockagh Resource Centre in my community.  At the centre, he met the principal of St. Kevin's National School.  Brockagh Resource Centre availed of one of the BCPs and it proved to be critical during the pandemic.  The principal of the school informed the Minister of State that without that connection, the parents would not have been able to pull into the car park to download the work their children were doing.  I thank the Minister of State for that intervention in our community.  This is critical for the whole country moving forward.  We need to remove whatever obstacles are there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#Z00400","speaker":"1640","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Senator Maria Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#AA00200","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I hear with frustration the Independents in my county talking about the slow roll-out of broadband.  We would not have even finished the tender process if we did what they suggested a number of years ago.  This infrastructure will benefit this society for years to come and it will be remembered like electricity is remembered.<\/p> <p>This is a huge opportunity for regional rural towns like Cahir, Clonmel and Tipperary town.  There are many people who live in those towns who drive to Cork, Limerick and Waterford to work.  In the past two years, that has not happened as much because they have been working from home because of Covid.  We do not see the cars parked up on the roads just before they get to the motorways to travel to work because that has not been happening.  That situation should continue.  We need to increase the pace of this and make sure the opportunities are there for rural towns to prosper on the back of broadband.  The knock-on effect this can give to towns like Cahir, Tipperary, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir is unbelievable in terms of the indirect support it can give a town and the options it gives people to live in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>It is also a massive opportunity for Dublin.  My colleague, Councillor Anna Grainger, is very passionate about and supportive of broadband for rural areas because it gives opportunities for people who live in Dublin but want to live in rural Ireland.  There are many people who, through the pandemic, have chosen to move to Cork or Galway but still work for a company in Dublin.  There are people I know who want to come home to my village, Grange, which is a tiny village, but work for companies in Dublin.  They can do that if they have broadband.  What this does is it opens up the housing market and three or four bedroom family homes for people who are looking to live in Dublin.  There is a massive knock-on effect for Dublin, not just rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#AA00400","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for attending to discuss this all-important issue.  Covid taught us the importance of working from home and how important broadband is in that regard.  Many of us have discussed the lack of availability in rural Ireland but it also affects parts of urban Ireland where the connectivity is very poor.  There are streets where there is a very strong connection but there are houses in between where there is a lack of connection.  I know of two areas of Limerick like this, and I was recently talking to somebody in Cork who has had 64 different communications with their broadband provider.  They are living right in the heart of the city and it is still not sorted.  At one stage, there were five people working from the one house off the one connection, so it was pretty poor.<\/p> <p>The Government made the right decision on the roll-out, which is progressing.  As Senator Dooley noted, sometimes one size does not fit all  Perhaps there needs to be a bit more engagement in certain areas.  Overall, however, the experience has been positive.<\/p> <p>I am delighted to see the schools being included because so many schools had a poor connection.  As we know, connectivity and technology is used so much in education but, for a long time, despite so many iPads and different machines being operated in schools, the connectivity was very poor.<\/p> <p>The delay is a concern, particularly in light of working from home.  On the legislation that is coming out with regard to working from home, it is very important that we get it right.

It is important to point out that we cannot underestimate the decision that was taken by my party in government, Fine Gael, a number of years ago with regard to broadband.  It was a very positive decision against much opposition at the time.  It is clear through Covid-19, in particular, that it was the right decision to make.  We are all delighted that was done and that the infrastructural work that needed to be done to ensure every house has broadband available to it started earlier.<\/p><p>As I said, Covid-19 showed how dependent we are and how elderly people who would never have been <i>au fait<\/i>with IT used that service while they were isolated at home.  I must admit that while some of the infrastructure is in place, it is still not as good as it should be.  I live 50 m from the local exchange and my connection at home still drops at times despite the fact that I live so close to it.<\/p><p>I want to take this opportunity to thank the broadband officer in my local authority with whom I worked while I was a member of Longford County Council, Ms Christine Collins, and the IT team of Mr. Danny Lynch and Ms Maggie Donovan, in particular, for the work they did.  They grasped this by appointing the broadband officer.  I also think we were one of the first counties in the country to have an officer in place.  We have rolled out the broadband connection points across the entire county.  We have nine community centres, GAA clubs and local national schools.  We have broadband points at all our libraries.  All these were used during Covid-19.  I thank all those organisations that worked with the local authority to put those provisions in place.<\/p><p>I printed out a list earlier with regard to people getting broadband in my own county.  I spoke to one customer who six months ago was supposed to have broadband in quarter 4 of 2022.  Now when this person puts in their Eircode postcode, they are informed they will have it between January 2023 and December 2024.  That is a 24-month gap as to when this person will get broadband.  To be quite honest, that is not good enough from a customer point of view.  I ask that NBI gives definite details and times for when people will actually get that service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#BB00100","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Broadband absolutely is one of the biggest issues on which I am contacted and it is all about delivery and timings.  The Minister of State heard today that people do not care about the background.  They just want their broadband.  It is incredibly frustrating when they were given a timeline.<\/p> <p>Here is an example from rural Dublin.  We tend to forget that there are also rural areas of Dublin that do not have broadband.  It is actually more difficult to secure funding for things like hubs in rural Dublin than it would be in other areas.  There are 13,429 premises in Dublin in the intervention area.  One of them is the Westmanstown-Strawberry Beds-Porterstown area of Dublin 15.  When we contacted NBI in March 2021, it said the connection date was April 2022 to June 2022.  In July when I proactively followed up, concerned about timelines, I was assured it was the same timings.  Then, in September 2021, we found out that it was going to be delayed until between March 2023 and May 2023.<\/p> <p>I hear the Minister of State about the 5,400 premises that have been connected and how 1,300 of those were in December 2021 alone.  Can this be sped up?  Can our roll-out of broadband be increased to come back from those timelines?  That is one year in which people made plans expecting that it was coming shortly.  They made decisions about working from home, invested in offices at home to make this long term and then found out that it has been pushed back by a year.  I hear what the Minister of State is saying about mobilising contractors and difficulties with key personnel.  He has heard it here today, however.  This is one of the top issues about which I get contacted.  We need to put everything we can into delivery and not delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#BB00200","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I will share time with Senator Paddy Burke.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, today and thank him for his very detailed update.  It was extremely detailed in terms of going through the thousands of different homes that will be connected.  It is crucial because for the likes of County Roscommon, for example, which Senator Eugene Murphy will also know, we are talking about 19,000 to 20,000 homes.  That is almost 50% of homes in the intervention area.  We are talking about 50% of homes in a county.<\/p> <p>The roll-out has to be accelerated.  Can the Minister of State speak a little bit about how NBI is going to be putting extra supports in place to help roll this out?  I acknowledge that he has mentioned local authorities but for many of our local authorities such as Galway County Council, which is the second-lowest funded council in the country, support needs to be given to the councils to allow them to rapidly review and deliver the permits required for them to engage in different areas.<\/p> <p>I very much welcome the broadband connection points, particularly when we are looking at remote working.  We have some in planning for Mountbellew, Galway's Living Bog and telehealth centre near the mart in Mountbellew.  We also have some connected in Kiltoon and Cam in County Roscommon, and Glenamaddy Enterprise and Training Hub and Clonberne Enterprise Centre in County Galway.  It is really important that we are seeing these happen.  The first premises in County Galway to be connected was in Ballinasloe, which was a priority area.  Ballinasloe was seen as a priority within the county.  I know this was allocated to a number of regions so we are very grateful to see that work is happening.<\/p> <p>I also acknowledge the partnerships that NBI is running to support and promote the roll-out and to encourage people to engage with digitalisation, particularly in our farming networks.  We have seen people go online for marts all through last year and the year before.  It is wonderful to see it.  I see this partnership now with Macra na Feirme, working with students on the business and technology award as part of an annual agricultural challenges day where they are all going to be putting in entries on the technologies they want to deploy on their farms and why.  Those are the people who are leading, for God's sake.  They are the ones with all the apps that have come out.  They are all Irish innovators in farming and agriculture and we are helping to support them do that through NBI through the roll-out of the national broadband plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#BB00300","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Dolan for sharing time with me.  I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the national broadband plan.<\/p><p>I must say, I think it was great foresight on the part of the previous Government to start the campaign and the roll-out of rural broadband.  One would have to ask the question now of where we would be and where we would be going if some decision was not made a that particular time when we see the vast advances that have been made in online technology over the past two years in particular since the pandemic took place.<\/p><p>It is amazing, though, that everybody right around the country has the same story, one after another.  Mine is no different either.  I come from the fairly large town of Castlebar, which is a county town.  The main street and main shopping area of the town is the worst part with the result that businesses have to move from the centre of the town to the industrial estates to get proper broadband because the speeds there are better.  Something will have to be done fairly fast about it.<\/p><p>A number of very successful businesses have started up online in the last number of years such as Vaughan Shoes, Stauntons Pharmacy and our local newspaper, the <i>Connaught Telegraph<\/i>.  They all operate online and are at a huge disadvantage because of the speeds at the moment.  The quicker they can get this in place, the better for their businesses.  They are not competing on a level playing pitch at the moment.  They are competing with businesses that are living on the information highway while they are on the byroads.  That is the way it is.  The Minister of State will have to keep a closer eye on the roll-out.

When the decision was made on this project, support for it was not unanimous support and concerns were articulated by certain people.  It is welcome and lovely to hear everyone now saying we should get on with it because everyone wants broadband all around the country.  Covid has shown us how important high-speed connection is for all the new advantages and improvements in life we have.  It is needed for the delivery of services.  I acknowledge that and wish continued success to the programme.<\/p> <p>Having said that, I will speak about a flaw in the programme and ask the Minister of State for help.  My office is in Skerries which is in County Dublin.  The vast majority of the county was part of the commercial part of the roll-out of the plan.  When the plan was initiated, it included a guarantee that anyone who was not provided high-speed broadband by the commercial operators would be taken up by NBI.  It might have taken a while but there was a guarantee that everyone would get the high-speed broadband we all so desperately require and soon.<\/p> <p>I am in the unfortunate position of saying to the Minister of State that a number of people on my road in Skerries do not have broadband.  The commercial operators are not going to do it.  That is fine but we have engaged with NBI and it will not provide them with broadband either.  We have gone back and forth and said it must be wrong.  We are not wrong.  There are gaps in both aspects of the delivery where neither the NBI nor the commercial operators will fulfil the contract on behalf of the State to provide it.<\/p> <p>I have done a wider trawl than just Church Street and Strand Street in Skerries and I found that a significant number of houses, not at the end of country lanes or the forks in roads but in our urban areas, where the broadband connection is not good enough to be able to make the connection, either by commercial operators or NBI.  These will not be part of the overall contract that is necessary for us to be able to live in the meta world very soon.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State ensure a national review and audit of all of those houses are done?  Will he meet NBI to find out what the State needs to do to ensure that people who live in Dublin, less than 15 km from the epicentre of the country, cannot get access to high-speed broadband?  What will the State do to provide that?<\/p> <p>Otherwise, this is a successful roll-out of a national infrastructure which I hope will bring benefits to every single household, town, community, school, GAA club and all the online businesses which have sprung up in the last couple of years because premises have been closed.  We have got used to shopping online, visiting our doctor online and availing of all these wonderful new advantages we have.  We have the confidence to do so.  However, some people are being left behind.  They do not have a date in 2023 or 2024 but no date.  We need to do a national review and come up with a response to how we will give those people the infrastructure they need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#CC00100","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I echo many of Senator Paddy Burke's comments on the previous Government's foresight in proceeding with the national broadband plan roll-out.  There are always reasons not to do things but a point comes when a decision has to be made to proceed.  That said, as other colleagues noted, there is frustrations with the slowness of the roll-out in areas throughout the country.  The Minister of State will have a sense of that.<\/p> <p>In my home county of Waterford, 15,084 premises are due to be connected through the national broadband plan with an investment of &euro;59 million.  However, there is significant frustration with the speed of the roll-out.  For example, I received an email from someone last September.  The person wrote that they would love to get a reason for the continued delays in the national broadband roll-out in Waterford.  They said that they had been informed ten months earlier that they would be connected by August.  The website was subsequently updated to advise that it would be February to April 2022 but when they checked again, they were informed it would be August to October 2022.  That is one example of dates being pushed out.<\/p> <p>I have had a similar experience to that of Senator Doherty where areas that are perceived to be covered by the other commercial providers are not in the intervention area and are not being considered.  Those people do not have broadband and they need to be included if they are not served by the existing players.<\/p> <p>I will raise a matter that is not one for the Minister of State.  I received a lovely email from the PR company that works for National Broadband Ireland during the week.  It said that more than 6,300 premises in Waterford had been surveyed.  It said that crews had started initial work on the buildout in townlands across Waterford including Kilmacow, Mullinavat, Ballyfacey, Glenmore, Ballycourdra, Kilmeaden and Mooncoin.  Only one of those areas is in Waterford and all the rest are in Kilkenny, so there is clearly an issue there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#CC00200","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I assure the House I will not get involved in the Kilkenny-Waterford battle.  We have enough problems of our own in Clare.  Decisions were made and decisions are made for various reasons.  One that was made in the mid-1990s - the decision to privatise Eircom - was a fundamental mistake.  If that had not happened, we would have the infrastructure to provide high-speed broadband to every home in the country.  However, it did happen.<\/p> <p>The decision made in 2017-2018 by the previous Government to sign the national broadband plan for &euro;3 billion, I think, was roundly criticised by people and unfairly because it was the right decision.  As time has gone on, and with Covid and people working remotely, I think we would all agree that &euro;3 billion was value for money for providing broadband to every home in the country.  Every home in the country deserves high-speed broadband, just as every home deserves water and electricity.  That is how important it is.<\/p> <p>There are operational difficulties with areas where commercial providers are supposed to provide services but do not or are not in a position to do so for one reason or another.  In that scenario, it behoves the State to provide a broadband service.  I have no doubt the Minister of State is committed to delivering this but a review of the national broadband contract would be worthwhile because there are operational difficulties which need to be addressed.  Explanations are needed for why certain homes are not getting connected.  There is one particular group of houses in Ballyvaughan in County Clare that are not getting broadband.  Eir is not providing it and the householders cannot get broadband.  I would like an explanation for that.  Maybe the Minister of State could check that out on my behalf because I am not getting answers and nor are the people who are living in that particular group of houses.<\/p> <p>Broadband is fundamental to balanced regional development.  It facilitates working from home, equips people to reduce their carbon footprint and have a healthier work-life balance, creates a healthier environment and gives people more time to spend with their families and in their communities rather than travelling.  Once we all accept the principle that broadband has the same importance as water and electricity, it is up to us as a Government and society to deliver it and make it happen.  I wish the Minister of State well in that pursuit.  I know that those are the goals to which he is also committed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#CC00300","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for all of their contributions.  I listened carefully to them and they are all valuable.<\/p> <p>The national broadband plan is not like other national broadband plans around Europe that I have come across.  I have spoken to other ministries who are trying to do something similar to what we are doing and our plan is different in two basic ways.  The first is that we are trying to bring fibre to 100% of premises, that is, to every single home, farm and business.  When I said that to other ministries I was told that they were not going to do that and they were going to do wireless as the other method is too expensive.  Then I asked how much they were spending and, typically, &euro;2,000 per home is what was being budgeted whereas we have budgeted &euro;5,000.  In terms of what we are trying to do, the scale and ambition is much larger but the future-proofing is much stronger.  As my background is in communications technologies, I know that one should not rely on a wireless connection.  I mean that it is great as a back-up but having a cable or a wire means one is set up for the future.  It is good to have a duct or a pole to bring a cable into one's home, which will initially connect at 0.5 Mbps.  One can easily upgrade to 20 times that speed with minimal intervention.  If it is a 25-year project then we will provide a functioning broadband over 25 years to 1 million people.  The sum involved is a very large amount of money but when the project will span 25 years and will reach 1 million people, then it is value for money.  <\/p> <p>A number of Senators have pointed out that the case for this project has got stronger since the contract was first negotiated.  Initially, people debated whether the project was too much or necessary but now everybody can see that broadband is like running water.  It is a necessary utility and it is the basic thing that one needs in order to be able to work.<\/p> <p>Senator Garvey discussed the fact that for a long time, people wondered how could they bring jobs to rural Ireland and villages, and should a college or training place be set up.  This project brings a job because it brings somebody with a job into a village.  He or she can work in the village, revitalise it and make the village visibly more vibrant.  Also, the technology improves quality of life.  As a number of Senators have pointed out, a long commute and a very frequent long commute is closely linked with a poor quality of life and becoming increasingly more tired.  To be able to escape having to do that commute every single day, Monday to Friday, is a great benefit.  The recent announcement about the right to request to work from home, have a framework and then be able to bring that request to the Workplace Relations Commission, if necessary, to have a change of culture and a basic framework whereby it is expected that everybody will be able to work from home, if possible with the type of job one does, and that links in very closely with this.<\/p> <p>I am really optimistic despite the setbacks over the start of the first year.  I have been involved in many roll-out projects of different types and I am used to the idea that at the start, there is a valley of doom and that people lose faith before people begin to ramp up.  The Senators will have seen for themselves the negativity that was associated, at the start of last year, with the vaccination roll-out and then the great pick up in pace.  Not many people felt optimistic this time last year but people get it together.<\/p> <p>There was an historical discussion about the contract.  For example, there was a question as whether it was a good contract and should it have been done in a different way.  The contract is a contract.  It is a signed contract and is before my time.  I have adopted it and now it is my job to make sure that it is executed, that everybody complies with its contents, that it is done on time and that all of its terms are met.  That is the contract we have on both sides.  We have a team of people monitoring that.  We have outside consultants who are lawyers, accountants and so on.  We also have our own staff who are here and are excellent.  They monitor it all of the time and making sure that it gets delivered on.<\/p> <p>It is a seven-year contract and will run from 2020 to the end of 2026.  It will take seven years to deliver the service to 540,000 homes and if we can do that faster then we will.  We will try to find any way that we can to accelerate delivery but for a start, we are behind at the moment and we need to get back on track.  That is our initial focus.<\/p> <p>Senator Keogan talked about the fact that only 5,400 homes have been connected when the original goal was 540,000 premises.  There is a difference between the number of homes that have taken up the service and those that have it available.  There are 55,000 households where one can order or preorder it but over 5,000 homes have been connected so far.<\/p> <p>The objective is to make the service available to everybody but our target is not on uptake.  The uptake has been faster than expected.  Ultimately, everybody is going to need to have fast broadband and I expect that we will have a very high rate of uptake.  Also, the commercial providers have all told me that they are getting much higher uptake than they expected.<\/p> <p>There has been a change in mindset about this, as Senators will know.  I am sure that they will have heard that from their constituents.  People feel that it is not enough to have fibre coming to one's cabinet.  People want the fibre to go into their homes because, invariably, there are two parents working, somebody is in college and people want entertainment and everything else.  People really want high-quality broadband and view it as something valuable.  I think that the price that has been set, at &euro;35 a month, is absolutely worthwhile.<\/p> <p>There was a question about the roles of NBI and Eir and how they fit together.  NBI has won the contract.  NBI is the organisation that will deliver this service but its supplier is Eir and Eir has to prepare the poles that the fibre is strung along.  In other cases, the fibre is not strung along poles but goes into ducts underground, which Eir must provide.  Eir rents the ducts and poles to NBI over a period of 25 years.  There is no direct relationship between the State and Eir in that regard but Eir is a key supplier and the project cannot work without its co-operation.<\/p> <p>There was a question about the information being given to customers and a claim that sometimes, it is not good enough.  When I started off in this role one would be told on the website that the service would arrive in the next 18 months, and after that one was told that it would be some time in the future.  I said that the website should tell people what it thinks it is going to be.  Tell people that it is going to be 2025 and, if it changes, take people's email address at the time and update them all of the time.  We want to provide people with as much information as possible.  If one inputs one's Eircode on the website one will be told to the nearest year when the service will be delivered and that allows people to plan.  If people cannot work from their location, they need a back-up and they need something else to fill in for that time, then people will know.<\/p> <p>Information can always be improved and I am keen on anything that will improve information.  I hope that all of the Senators have received emails with very detailed updates about everything that is happening with the project.  We are very open to providing any information sought by the Senators.  Mr. Fergal Mulligan is the civil servant who is in charge of the project and he is here in this room along with the assistant secretary, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in, who is seated behind me.  They will arrange one-to-one meetings with any Member who wants to discuss broadband, make suggestions or identify problems.  The NBI has met Senators and Deputies who wanted to meet them.  I encourage Senators to get that information.  I have been all around the country.  I have visited as many counties as I could and I will continue to do that just to make sure that I am keeping it real, that I know what is actually happening and that I meet people who are getting connected.  I see what happens on the ground.<\/p> <p>How do we make the scheme run faster and what are the problems?  As I alluded to at the start, NBI is doing this work but its key supplier is Eir and they must have a good working relationship.  I have attended the last two NBI board meetings.  I have facilitated a recent meeting between NBI and Eir.  I know that they are constantly in contact.  Eir has a new chief executive and I look forward to meeting him when he is appointed.  There will be continuing engagement between them and a lot of work will go into that.<\/p> <p>There have been questions about the local authorities granting consent.  They must supply section 254 permissions in order to put in a new pole, ducts and so on.  Work is being done to make sure that this process runs more smoothly.  There is a mobile phone and broadband task force that had historically been set up but had lapsed.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has reconvened that meeting.  That brings together into one room the Ministers, the local authority leads and the contractors who are doing the work just to make sure that problems are smoothed out.  Most counties are working very well at this stage but there is still some improvement to be obtained.<\/p> <p>A number of councillors have referred to the benefit that can come in the form of inclusion.  Every primary school and every DEIS school are going to be connected to broadband by the end of this year and that work has been accelerated.  Connectivity is absolutely vital.  Connection to broadband changes the whole dynamic of rural Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ossian Smyth:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The faster I can do that, the better.  I understand completely the necessity of doing that.  <\/p><p>Some Senators also referred to the fact that we could arrive at a point where if we have delivered 100% fibre broadband to rural Ireland, there would be people in urban areas whose quality of service would not be as good.  There are black spots in certain areas.  Senator Doherty referred to that.  Everybody is entitled to a good service.  What is the basic level of service?  Senator Keogan mentioned this.  There is a universal service obligation for phone services.  The basic level of service for Internet connection is extremely low and dates back to dial-up times.  We need a universal service obligation.  At the moment, we are pointing to 30 Mb as being the basis but we are bringing in a new national digital strategy - probably next week - that will have a much higher target.  There are European targets overall.  We must head towards being a gigabit country with everybody connected and everybody with that right.  I thank Senators for all their input.  I am very happy to hear anything directly from them.  If any Senator wishes to contact me or my office, I will respond.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#DD00100","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1643193000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.21 p.m. and resumed at 3.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Final Report on Impacts of Brexit of Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union: Statements","time":1643193000,"counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#FF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I thank the chair, Senator Chambers, and the other members of the Seanad Special Select Committee  on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union for their excellent final report.  I was struck by the wide and diverse range of contributors from government, Northern Ireland, business, academia and civil society that fed into the committee's deliberations.  Listening to those varied voices has ensured the committee captured the wide impact of Brexit on our society more generally as well as on the economy and politics.<\/p> <p>The committee's report notes that many witnesses referred to the importance of eliminating uncertainty around the implementation of the protocol.  This is the same sentiment that underpins the Commission's approach to the current discussions with the UK Government.  The Commission's proposals on customs, sanitary and phytosanitary or SPS, medicines and enhanced representation aim to deliver much-needed predictability and stability for Northern Ireland, allowing it the time and space to build prosperity.<\/p> <p>I will return to the report's recommendations shortly but as I was in Brussels earlier this week, I thought Senators might appreciate a short update on the current protocol discussions.  Since I last spoke to them about Brexit, we have seen the resignation of David Frost and the appointment of Foreign Secretary Liz Truss as the UK's Brexit lead.  I have had the opportunity to speak to Liz Truss several times since she became Foreign Secretary.  We spoke by phone shortly after she took up her role as the UK's Brexit lead and we met in person in early January to discuss the protocol.  I also remain in close contact with Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi.  We met in Brussels earlier this week following his most recent meeting with Liz Truss the same day.  The constructive atmosphere of the latest EU-UK engagements and Foreign Secretary Truss's stated focus on reaching a deal are both welcome.  Likewise, the continuation of intensified technical talks this week and agreement to hold a meeting of the joint committee next month are positive developments.  <\/p> <p>However, following the generous package of measures put forward by the European Commission, we need to see the UK Government meaningfully demonstrate its willingness to come to a deal on the key issues.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the six years I have been involved in Brexit, I have rarely been one to invoke deadlines or cliff edges.  However, I firmly believe that reaching an agreed approach on the protocol ahead of the forthcoming elections in Northern Ireland could help reduce tensions during what will be a challenging and polarising period for communities there.<\/p><p>Furthermore, reaching an agreed approach on the protocol would be an important factor in opening a new chapter in a forward-looking EU-UK partnership.  The EU-UK relationship underpinned by trust and shared goals will be key in addressing a range of shared global challenges.  The EU has made clear that it is ready to find flexible ways to implement the protocol.  However, to do so it needs a partner willing to work within the parameters of the protocol, not one seeking to renegotiate a deal that is only two years old.  Renegotiation is not necessary in order to solve legitimate challenges experienced by people and businesses in Northern Ireland.  This is a position upon which the EU is fully united.<\/p><p>I will continue to meet with political, business and community leaders from Northern Ireland and listen to their concerns.  However, it is clear that Northern Ireland is seeing the benefits of the protocol in jobs and investment announcements.  Businesses recognise the opportunities presented by the protocol and the unique position of having free and full access to both the EU Single Market and the rest of the UK internal market.<\/p><p>Turning back to the committee's report, I concur with the view set out in the report's foreword.  Given the very close relationship between Ireland and the UK, the impacts of Brexit will continue to \"be felt by citizens and businesses for some years and it will take some time to realise the full impact of this change\".  Given these longer-term impacts, the report's focus is particularly timely as we enter the second year since the end of the transition period phase and the coming into force of the EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement.<\/p><p>The themes and recommendations included in this report make clear the degree to which Brexit has impacted across all Departments and businesses.  Changes in areas such as education and healthcare are having a very real and practical impact on citizens' lives on this island.  The importance of the committee's work lies in considering practical solutions that will assist those negatively impacted.<\/p><p>I do not have time in my opening remarks to address all the issues raised, so I might just touch on a few.  From the outset, we have been clear that our response to Brexit would require a whole-of-government effort.  Our work has been guided by the need to mitigate these impacts and to provide support and resources to those services, businesses and individuals who have to deal with Brexit-related changes on a daily basis.  Initial difficulties in adjusting to the new trading environment have largely settled as business and the State working together have done a remarkable job in adjusting to new checks and controls on imports from Great Britain.<\/p><p>The State agencies in our ports and airports are actively working together to streamline processes and automate inter-agency communications in order to reduce the burden on traders.  This is done while also ensuring that we continue to meet our EU obligations.  The agencies continue to listen to the needs of operators.  For example, in response to a specific trader request, an interface has been developed that allows a trader's customs system to speak directly to Revenue's ro-ro system, thereby removing some of the manual work involved a lot earlier.<\/p><p>Irish businesses will face another wave of Brexit-related changes in 2022, as we see the introduction of UK customs and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, controls and checks.  This will particularly impact on the agrifood sector.  There is a lot of work under way to try to ensure that it is ready.  The Government will continue to provide support and information to help businesses and the transport sector to prepare for these changes.  The Government is also investing substantially in the additional State capacity needed to meet the export certification requirements that will apply for food businesses.<\/p><p>The committee has correctly emphasised the importance of continuing to develop our port infrastructure.  I am pleased to note the Government announcement in December of a multimillion euro investment in a state-of-the-art border control post in Rosslare Europort.<\/p><p>Another key area considered by the committee was healthcare.  The committee's report recognises the importance of the cross-border healthcare directive.  The Government moved quickly to address concerns over the directive post-Brexit, with the establishment of a Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme on an administrative basis.  I assure Senators that placing this scheme on a legislative footing remains our priority.<\/p><p>We have also seen positive progress on medicines, following the publication of the Commission's comprehensive legislative package in December.  This proposal will ensure that people across the island will continue to have access to the medicines they need.  I also hope that this solution on medicines can also act as a catalyst for making further progress on other protocol-related matters in the weeks ahead.  It is certainly proof of the Commission's willingness to try to solve problems and show flexibility.  In this same spirit, the EU is also proposing an unprecedented role for Northern Ireland's political representatives and stakeholders in the protocol, ensuring that the voices of people in the North are consistently heard.<\/p><p>I again wish to recognise the very important work undertaken by Senator Chambers and the committee in pulling together the many strands of Brexit and their impact on our citizens, businesses and the Government.  I am happy to address any specific issues that Senators wish to raise and I look forward to hearing from colleagues as the debate progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#FF00200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643193000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

There was a fear that we would have a hard border and that the Good Friday Agreement would be in peril.  There was also a fear of a return to violence in the country and east-west tariffs and customs.  It was a very bleak scenario.  It is a great tribute to the Government, the Minister and the diplomatic services, and to all of us in our own roles, in that when we went abroad, we all did our piece and worked one to one and bilaterally as much as we could.<\/p> <p>However, it was a particular achievement of the Government and the diplomatic service that we got to the current point.  While we are now fixated on the protocol, we should recognise what has been achieved.  It is significant that we have succeeded in having the common trade agreement, removing tariffs and customs between the EU and the UK, and also putting in place the protocol which allows for smooth east-west trade and allows goods from Northern Ireland into the UK smoothly and without any tariffs or interruptions.  That is a significant achievement.  The protocol is central to preserving the Good Friday Agreement and the livelihoods of people right across Northern Ireland.  We often talk about the protocol as a theoretical or abstract construct, almost as something legalistic, but there is a reality here in that without the protocol there would have been significant unemployment in the Border area including in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012600002#GG00400","speaker":"1692"}]
