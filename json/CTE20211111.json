The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  I ask members and all in attendance to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19.  I strongly advise that one vacant seat be left between those attending the meeting physically, that hand sanitisers be used and that appropriate social distancing be maintained during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn, except when speaking.  I ask people to co-operate with these measures.<\/p> <p>  Members participating remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from the Department of Transport to examine the appropriation account for Vote 31, chapter 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's accounts re expenditure on night vision imaging technology and training for search and rescue and the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report 113 on procurement of vehicles by the Irish Coast Guard.  The 2020 motor tax account is also on the agenda, and other areas of interest to the committee include expenditure on MetroLink, DART, BusConnects, and the all-Ireland strategic rail review.  After lunch we will consider correspondence and other business of the committee.<\/p> <p>  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department of Transport: Mr. Ken Spratt, Secretary General; Ms Deirdre O&rsquo;Keeffe, assistant secretary; Mr. Fintan Towey, assistant secretary; Mr. Eugene Clonan, acting director, Irish Coast Guard; Mr. Garret Doocey, principal officer; and Mr. Dominic Mullaney, principal adviser.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Ms Niamh Callaghan, principal officer, Transport Vote section, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  Everyone is welcome.  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up background noise or feedback and, as usual, I remind all those attending to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off. <\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references speakers may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the precincts of Leinster House is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside Leinster House's precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as those physically present.  Witnesses have already been advised of this and may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time that he or she contributes.<\/p> <p>  I call the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#A00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636623000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The appropriation account for Vote 31 records gross expenditure of &euro;2.7 billion in 2020.  This represented an increase of 17.4% compared to expenditure in 2019.  The expenditure is divided into three expenditure programmes: civil aviation; land transport; and maritime transport and safety.  The majority of the expenditure in 2020 was under programme B, land transport, which accounted for 95% of the gross spending amount.  This comprised mainly investment in roads and on road safety and regulation, and current and capital spending on public transport.  As I proposed previously, given the imbalance in programme size, it may be timely for the Department, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to consider splitting up programme B in future.<\/p> <p>  In 2020, the Department provided substantial funding to several public bodies operating under its aegis.  These include: Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII; the National Transport Authority, NTA; the Road Safety Authority, RSA; the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS; and some other smaller bodies.  The Department also oversees several commercial State bodies, such as the CI&Eacute; group, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA and the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA. <\/p> <p>  Receipts into the Transport Vote are modest, with appropriations-in-aid in 2020 amounting to &euro;17.8 million.  There was a substantial underspend on the Vote for 2020, of just under &euro;386 million.  Much of this related to the impact of Covid-19 on normal schemes and projects, but underspending also occurred because additional financial provision made for Covid-19 was not required on the scale originally envisaged.<\/p> <p>  With agreement from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;151.5 million in unspent capital allocations was carried over for spending in 2021.  This related mainly to capital spending shortfalls under the subheads for: airports; regional and local roads stimulus; heavy rail safety and development; public transport infrastructure; cycling and walking; and greenways.  The remainder of the surplus for the year, &euro;234.4 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account.   <\/p> <p>  Members may wish to note that the statement on internal financial controls discloses non-compliant procurement by the Department of &euro;1.1 million worth of goods and services.<\/p> <p>  In addition to its Vote-funded activities, the Department of Transport has responsibility for the motor tax collection system.  Receipts of motor tax are accounted for in a special departmental account, separate from the Vote, and are transferred directly to the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  The 2020 motor tax account prepared by the Department records receipts of &euro;939 million.  This was down 2.5% on the 2019 level.   <\/p> <p>  I also issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the motor tax account 2020.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Coast Guard, ICG, is organisationally part of the Department of Transport, and its expenditure is directly charged on the Vote.  I have presented reports on two matters relating to the operations of the Coast Guard, arising from audit work on the 2019 and 2020 appropriation accounts.  One report relates to the helicopter search and rescue, SAR, service, which is contracted out to private sector providers, at an annual cost of around &euro;60 million.  The other report relates to procurement for the cliff rescue service, which is provided substantially by volunteer service members.<\/p> <p>  As I outline in chapter 5 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2020, the Department paid &euro;4.305 million to the search and rescue service provider in 2013 to fund an upgrade of the five search and rescue helicopters then in use to equip them with night vision technology.  In addition, in November 2015, the Department bought 24 sets of night vision goggles for &euro;527,000.  In November 2018, the Department made an initial payment of &euro;1.714 million for the provision of training in the use of the night vision technology.  That training commenced in November 2019 and it is still ongoing.  As at June 2021, only one of the four Coast Guard search and rescue bases had been approved to operate the technology and to provide a night-vision enabled service.  It will be some time before the other three search and rescue bases are operating in the same way.<\/p><p>On the basis that significant payments were made as long ago as 2013, and that the planned capability has not yet been delivered across the service, I am not persuaded that good value for money has been achieved from this expenditure.<\/p><p> In the special report, I deal with the procurement of vehicles by the Irish Coast Guard for use by the cliff rescue teams.  The Department signed a contract in November 2015 for the supply and fit-out of a number of vans to carry crew members and equipment.  Between 2016 and 2020, the Department purchased 18 vans, costing almost &euro;1.4 million, under this contract.  The average all-in cost was around &euro;76,500 per vehicle.<\/p><p> The examination found that the vehicle requirements had not been adequately set out in advance of the procurement process.  There were also major gaps in the Department&rsquo;s records of the tendering process, in particular in relation to the evaluation of bids.  As a result, we found there is no reasonable basis to conclude that the Department conducted a fair and impartial procurement process for the vehicles.<\/p><p> This report makes four recommendations aimed at strengthening the Department&rsquo;s procurement procedures for the future.  These are that a strategic plan for equipment requirements be developed; that all procurements of equipment should involve technical and user input at the planning stage; that all significant procurements be based on a formal assessment of operational needs; and that the Department carry out regular reviews of its procurement procedures and processes.  I am glad to report that the recommendations have been accepted by the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

The tourism and sport functions were transferred out of it, and its remit is now focused solely on transport.  Three programmes remained - civil aviation; land transport; and maritime transport and safety.  The onset of the Covid-19 crisis in March 2020, along with the transfer of functions, necessitated the publication of a further set of Revised Estimates in 2020.  The appropriation account for 2020 reflects this set of Estimates.  The Department&rsquo;s net allocation in the further Revised Estimates for 2020 was, to round, &euro;3.0285 billion, comprising &euro;1.981 billion in capital and &euro;1.047 billion current expenditure.<br\/><br\/>The allocation of capital was primarily directed towards the core capital programme, with an additional allocation of &euro;113.25 million for the July stimulus.  Current expenditure supported existing services, with a substantial in-year increase of &euro;492.55 million in funding compared to the start-of-the-year position to address pressures caused by the Covid-19 crisis with &euro;2 million related to July stimulus funding.  As it transpired, not all of the emergency funding was required in 2020, which was a significant contributory factor in the surrender to the Exchequer of &euro;176 million in current expenditure funds at the year&rsquo;s end.<br\/><br\/>I would like the committee to note that, taking on board the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General at the Public Accounts hearing in May 2021, concerning the splitting of the land transport programme in the interests of transparency and better reporting, I can confirm that this has now been completed for 2022, creating three new programmes: programme A &ndash; sustainable mobility, covering active travel and greenways; programme B &ndash; sustainable mobility, covering public transport; and programme C &ndash; road networks and road safety.<br\/><br\/>The high-level goal for aviation in 2020 was to &ldquo;maximise air transport connectivity with a safe, competitive, cost-effective and sustainable aviation sector&rdquo;<i>.  <\/i>The programme was allocated &euro;41.865 million in current expenditure and &euro;10.7 million in capital in the aviation sector.  This financed public service obligations for the regional airports, as well as capital investment in aviation safety and security projects.  The programme included &euro;15 million in contingency to support the travellers&rsquo; protection fund.  This fund, administered by the Commission for Aviation Regulation, is in place to meet any legal obligations arising regarding customers requiring repatriation or reimbursement in the event of a travel or tour operator failure.<br\/><br\/>For land transport, our goal in 2020 was to &ldquo;service the needs of society and the economy through safe, sustainable and competitive transport networks and services.&rdquo;. <i><\/i>In this regard, we are responsible for the corporate governance of the two leading planning and investment agencies, namely Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Transport Authority.  A sum of &euro;1.963 billion in capital was allocated to progress the core capital programme and also to provide additional Covid relief measures and a near-term economic stimulus.  A sum of &euro;917.062 million was allocated in current expenditure, primarily to support PSO-funded services.  Of this allocation, &euro;460 million was related to emergency PSO funding for non-commercial and commercial transport services.  <br\/><br\/>Major construction developments in 2020 included the commencement of construction of the national train control centre, the Ballyvourney&ndash;Macroom development on the N22, the Dunkettle interchange, the opening of the N25 New Ross bypass in Wexford, and the completion of the N7 Naas road-widening project in Kildare.  In addition, the development of the Dublin megaprojects preliminary business cases continued, along with construction of key national roads, the N5 from Westport to Turlough, the N56 from Dungloe to Glenties, and the N4 from Collooney to Castlebaldwin, despite severe disruption caused by the Covid-19 crisis.<br\/><br\/>Prior to the onset of Covid-19, public transport bus and rail services had effectively reached capacity.  Year-on-year increases in fare revenue meant that PSO funding requirements were relatively stable.  Public health measures introduced in March 2020 led to public transport capacity limits of 25% of normal capacity.  Mid-year forecasts from the National Transport Authority, NTA, in a situation of a high degree of uncertainty, indicated that an additional &euro;460 million may be required in subvention to address the shortfall.  A portion of this funding was also utilised to fund a series of short-term contracts to support commercial public transport operators, which were also severely impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.<br\/><br\/>Under the maritime programme, our 2020 goal was to &ldquo;facilitate safe and sustainable maritime transport and the delivery of emergency management services&rdquo;.<i><\/i>Of the &euro;110.667 million comprising the current allocation to the maritime sector, &euro;76.877 million supported Coast Guard services.  Of the latter, &euro;62.515 million was allocated to the Coast Guard search and rescue service delivered by CHC.  A budget allocation of &euro;5.659 million was invested by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, which is responsible for maintaining marine navigation systems in Irish waters.  In addition, &euro;15 million was allocated as contingency to support certain key commercial ferry services as a result of financial stresses caused by the impact of Covid-19 and related public health measures.  A sum of &euro;6.42 million in capital was allocated to support investment in Coast Guard building and assets and in the Commissioners of Irish Lights.<br\/><br\/>I note the committee&rsquo;s interest in discussing a number of specific projects today, including BusConnects, DART+ and MetroLink.  I expect the preliminary business cases for the three Dublin megaprojects to go to the Government shortly.  I also note the committee&rsquo;s interest in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report into the procurement of Coast Guard vehicles.  On the latter, I share the Comptroller and Auditor&rsquo;s concern as to its findings.  Prior to publication of the report, or even to its genesis, the Department had been in the process of strengthening its corporate governance in the area of procurement.  This has involved aligning the Department&rsquo;s procurement activities with Office of Government Procurement guidance on procurement.  Since the end of 2019, a procurement officer has been in place within the Department and has provided valuable support in ensuring that new procurements are conducted in accordance with all legal and administrative arrangements to ensure that the correct processes are followed.<br\/><br\/>The Department has strengthened its analytical tools in procurement analysis and will be further strengthening the corporate monitoring of procurement activity in 2022 and beyond, as we move towards multi-annual procurement planning and forecasting.  The rising number of 40\/02 declarations in the accounts in the past three years is a direct result of the monitoring, compliance, awareness and education frameworks we are implementing and are continuing to build on, as we seek to ensure that the smallest procurements are treated with the same rigour, thoroughness and attention to detail as larger procurements.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Spratt"},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The lead speaker from the committee today is Deputy Dillon, who has 15 minutes.

First, there is the funding that TII provides for national roads, which ultimately comes from the Department but which is managed by TII in conjunction with the councils.  Second, there is the funding for regional and local roads.  This is administered directly by the Department and issued by the Minister every year.  Approximately 90% of the funding for regional and local roads is dedicated to protection and renewal whereas the split for TII-funded roads, including national roads, in 2020 was quite different.  Perhaps half of this money went on protection and renewal while the other half went on new works.  Decisions on projects are made in conjunction with the Department when a national development plan is being drawn up and major projects are being looked at.  As time goes on, projects are prioritised as they go through the various stages of the public spending code.  If other factors need to be taken into account, such as access to a port or a location being on a Trans-European Transport Network, TEN-T, route, which are core European routes, certain commitments may be made.  Such commitments have been made in respect of Foynes and Ringaskiddy.  Those roads have to be done by 2030.  These factors are all taken into account.

Councils put their own resources into local roads.  It is not only Exchequer money that goes into them.  The problem is that a council that puts very little of its own resources into its roads will have roads in worse condition than a council that puts a lot in and we would therefore essentially be penalising the counties that have provided funding themselves because, if allocations were to be based on condition, the next time a condition survey is done, these councils would do less well.  Councils who did not spend the money effectively would also be rewarded for doing so.  We have therefore come to the conclusion that the fairest way to make allocations is to do so based on road length.  Because there is a backlog, all of the councils need these moneys.  There is no danger that we are giving them too much.  That is essentially how it is done.

It was revised as a result of some pretty bad experiences with some pretty big capital projects.  We have a number of decision gates, starting with decision gate 0, a strategic assessment report.  We would then move into the preliminary business case, which is subject to an external review.  We then move to full cost-benefit analysis in order to proceed to tender, and again that is subject to an external review.  Only then would we go with another second full cost-benefit analysis prior to the awarding of contract.<\/p> <p>  That is important in ensuring that when we are spending billions of euro of taxpayers' money in this case, we get our decisions right.  This public spending code and process guards against cost escalation.  It is really important that we go through those processes and find ourselves explaining our approach on this side of procurements rather than on the other side of procurements, when we could be in much trickier positions after public spending on capital projects go wrong.  This code is really important and it has been welcomed by Secretaries General and Government officials.  It guards against cost escalation by ensuring we have really high standards when it comes to business cases.  It also ensures we have persistent challenge throughout projects and independent and rigorous challenge right throughout projects.<\/p> <p>  There is a really strong focus in the public spending code on governance and delivery.  Therefore, we are able to emphasise front-end decision making and really get the cost estimation and benefit projection right.  We are able to get delivery schedules right.  This is why I am emphasising the point.  The delivery schedule and procurement strategy are really important.  If we get cost estimations, benefit projections, delivery schedule and the procurement strategy right, we will not have implementation difficulties or requests for extra tens or hundreds of millions of euro or even billions of euro.  Ultimately, we will not have failure.  It is really important for me to set that out.<\/p> <p>  On the scheduling, we are still in the early stages for MetroLink.  We are at the preliminary business case stage.  That has been received by us and we are reviewing it, as required under the public spending code.

Other than that, we have no other dates.  I repeat the question.  Perhaps there is a reluctance to be tied down to dates.  Perhaps there are no dates at all.  However, it is important that those dates are made public, so that we can keep track of delays.  I refer back to the 2018 statements which announced the former Metro North.  They were clear.  They said that 2018 was the date for the emerging preferred routed; 2019 was the date for the railway order; 2020 was the date for the granting of the railway order; 2021 was the date for construction to commence; 2027 was the date by which the metro was to be in operation.

However, we have learned from projects that have gone badly wrong that if one gets the delivery schedule wrong, they will ultimately come back looking for extra time and more money.  Potentially projects could fail.  We have some significant examples of that occurring where inaccurate delivery schedules were given.

It speaks to the Deputy's own points that he raised generally in his contribution on the frustrations around the timeline.  It also speaks to Mr. Spratt&rsquo;s points around what the public spending code and the revised public spending code are seeking to guard against.  There were huge, phenomenal responses to both of the emerging preparatory consultation back in 2018 and 2019.  They raised complex issues about design, local community engagement, etc.  They required a considerable amount of time to reflect upon and revise for the design and route at that time.  They changed considerably, as we are all aware, from the emerging preferred route to the preferred route.  Clearly, in retrospect, those dates were not feasible.  They were missed, if the Deputy wants to put it that way.<\/p> <p>  Details in the case of the revised public spending code rose in December 2019, as Mr. Spratt introduced and spoke about.  That seeks through its decision gate mechanism to ensure that we get a lot better, again as Mr. Spratt mentioned, about ensuring that we are making the right calls at the right time.  The timings are fundamental.  The Deputy acknowledged that when he said they were hugely significant.  Decision gate 1 is imminent.  That will allow the project to move into the planning system.  That will be a massive step forward for this project.  Once it is in the planning system, there is no fixed date around the time that it needs to come out of the planning system.  It will need to get past decision gate 3 at the end of that approval to proceed.  At that decision gate, that will be the time we go to Government and set out the exact details, such as what we think budgetary envelope for the project will be at that particular time, taking into account the changes that may be required in the planning process, the delivery schedule, and also the benefits realisation.  At that point, then, measurement will start about whether we are on track or off track in the construction phase.  <\/p> <p>  Clearly, now, the real focus on a departmental level is to complete a review of the preliminary business case.  At a project level, there are still outstanding issues.  This is a huge, massive, complex project.  It is likely the largest ever public investment project in the history of the State.  There are still issues at a project level about closing out the necessary planning and environmental documentation to allow them to be ready to enter the planning system.  There is, therefore, a massive emphasis and focus on a departmental level and at an agency level to get this through decision gate 1 and into the planning system.

It would be vital, if at all possible, that we would hear from it on this issue.<\/p> <p>  I will be brief.  As is usual on a Thursday there are sometimes conflicting diary requirements.  I want to seek reassurances in respect of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report 113 on procurement to vehicles by the Irish Coast Guard, that there is a clear matching up between the four recommendations that are aimed at strengthening.  I am quoting from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report that they are aimed, &ldquo;at strengthening the Department&rsquo;s procurement procedures for the future&rdquo;.  Can we be assured of the following for each of the recommendations for the strategic plan for equipment requirement: that all procurements of equipment should involve technical and user input at the planning stage; that all significant procurements should be based on formal assessment of operational needs; and that the Department would carry out regular reviews of its procurement procedures and processes?  I want a short reassurance from the Secretary General that that is all now under way.  The Secretary General states that the Department has strengthened its analytical tools for procurement analysis.  I remain to be assured that we have a robust and fit-for-purpose system.  Can the Secretary General give us those assurances?  That is my first question.<\/p> <p>  I will ask three questions specifically and then I will take my leave.  The second question is about national secondary routes.<\/p><p> Major construction projects begun in 2020 are under way.  I believe strongly that there is a need for a policy intervention by the Department in respect of those national secondary routes that are in a deplorable state, such as the N73, in such a way that would ensure that TII, funds projects like that relating to the Mallow to Mitchelstown road.  The latter is, arguably, one of the worst national secondary routes in the country, even though it is a vital artery for commercial and domestic traffic in the north Cork area and a vital route between Kerry and Dublin.  I continue to make the case for funding for this road.  I ask that the N73 project remain on the agenda, and I make no bones about raising the matter at this forum.<\/p><p> On the Leap card, the Secretary General informed us that \"Year-on-year increases in fare revenue meant that PSO funding requirements were relatively stable.\"  I am seeking to expand Leap card services in my county of Cork, specifically on routes between Mallow and Cork, where there a massive number of commuters on a daily basis and where there is still not a Leap card service, even though it could be argued that it is a viable route.  I can travel from Bray to Pearse Station using a Leap card, but I cannot go from Mallow to Cork.  There is an inequality between services on the eastern seaboard and those in the regions.  I ask that, as a policy, the Department looks at the roll-out of Leap card services for the towns that service big cities, such as Cork.  It is vitally important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#E01600","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636623000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I can give Deputy Sherlock that assurance in a word, \"Yes\".  If he does not mind, I will expand a little on that.  I accept that our procurement processes were in need of tightening.  There is no doubt about that.  As I mentioned in the appropriation account, the Department carried out a procurement gap analysis in 2019.  We identified several recommendations for enhancements around procurement.  That report included a comprehensive suite of recommendations covering the appointment and functions of a procurement officer, in addition to corporate governance matters, measuring and monitoring compliance, communications, training requirements and corporate governance of agencies as regards procurement.  Deputy Sherlock will be delighted to hear that we appointed a procurement officer in 2020, as was recommended.  Enhanced corporate governance, and improved measuring and monitoring of compliance and training, are being implemented.<\/p> <p>  As a relatively new Secretary General, this is something I am very focused on.  I expect that we will learn some lessons from much of our seeking out, and the 100% review, where we now look at every procurement.  I expect we will find some things when we do that review but, once we are through all of that, we will be a lot more fit for purpose and a lot cleaner than we are at the moment.  A lot of very good work has been done over the past 18 months to two years.  There is more work to be done, but we are making very good improvements in that area.<\/p> <p>  On national secondary routes, the state of the N73 and the need for it to be improved, we have processes around prioritisation for new roads and for protection and renewal, which includes safety works and minor projects.  For new roads, the prioritisation processes include TII and NTA recommendations.  We also look at Government objectives under the national planning framework and the national development plan, current Department priorities, levels of congestion, the possibility of releasing space in towns for active travel, projects that improve access to public transport facilities and the general rationale set out in our national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI, which is our transport investment strategy.  That has a number of priorities, including a mobile hierarchy and investment hierarchy.<\/p> <p>  I know the Deputy is specifically interested in protection and renewal.  For protection and renewal, and any minor projects, we monitor those problems the Deputy and others have highlighted at our quarterly monitoring meeting with TII.  If there are serious issues that need to be addressed, we try to raise them at that meeting.  At the periodic meeting of the TII board - it may be quarterly or more often than that - it is decided what funding will be provided.  The Deputy mentioned the N73.  We will look at it, as he asked, and we will see where it fits in the greater scheme of things.<\/p> <p>  On the Leap card, we are very keen to encourage modal shift with our decarbonisation agenda.  That is not just in the cities, but in regional and rural areas.  Due to our ambition regarding decarbonisation, we have a big job of work to do in shifting people out of cars and onto public transport.  We have plans to increase our current public service obligation funding for regional and rural bus services.  It is something we will be very focused on over the next couple of years.  I accept the point the Deputy made regarding the Leap card.  It is something we have to sort out.  We have to make it easier for people to use public transport services, not only by making the services available but by having them available when people want them, having more services and also having ease-of-use of those services.  The greater and wider use of Leap cards throughout the country is something I am very mindful of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Spratt"},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome.

I am thankful for it.  It is good to have the Secretary General, Mr. Spratt, before the committee.  The Department he is in charge of and controls an astronomical budget in terms of the capital projects it is working on.  I have worked closely with him as a member of the Joint Committee on Transport.  We have, in recent days, seen project delays raise their ugly heads again.  As a young parliamentarian, I am anxious to see progress being made on future development and trying to help to diversify our transport infrastructure in Ireland and install a more climate friendly transport infrastructure in both urban and rural areas.  I am very concerned, to be straight with Mr. Spratt, because the amount of time it takes to build projects in Ireland is not right.  Something is amiss.  Public confidence is important for all of us elected representatives and Members of the Oireachtas.  We represent our constituencies.  When I talk to ordinary members of the public on the ground, they have lost all confidence in the Department for Transport's ability to build major infrastructural projects.  Things like the metro have not helped.  That is an issue the Department needs to tackle urgently.  I am not trying to throw anyone under a bus but that is the reality of how the people of Ireland view the progress that is being made in the Department of Transport.  We are facing an unprecedented emergency for our climate.  We must get more people onto public transport.  We urgently need the development of public transport infrastructure and the fact that we are now in 2021 without an underground metro system in our capital city, a primate city which has more than 1 million living in it, is completely and utterly unacceptable.  That is not the direct responsibility of the witnesses before the committee today.  Many of their predecessors had a role to play in that absence, as had other elected officials.  It is important for me to set the context for some of my questions.<\/p><p>Surely one of the witnesses is in a position to answer this question.

We as civil servants have to comply with the law of the land and public procurement rules.  We have to appear before Oireachtas committees, including this one, and give them assurances that we have done our best to maximise value for money.  We have a public spending code, which was introduced as a result of major capital projects going wrong.

Therefore, the tender document went out with provision of the service as the thing and, as an option, with NVIS.  Why are we going for NVIS?  The benefit of night vision capability for the Coast Guard is that it enhances operational effectiveness and safety.  That is why we are seeking NVIS.  We looked at implementing NVIS on a phased basis, based on the tender proposal to put it in after the service was started.  We did that and, in 2013, we modified the helicopters.  Each of those helicopters cost in the region of &euro;40 million to &euro;45 million.  For each to be modified cost just under &euro;1 million.

In 2011, the Government decided not to proceed with what was then Metro North.  That was the end of that project.  In 2015, an analysis was conducted.  The Fingal\/North Dublin Transport Study was published.  It concluded that there is a need for a metro solution in the north Dublin and Fingal area.  That analysis fed into the greater Dublin area transport strategy, which was published in 2016, which reiterated that there was a need for a metro.  It also concluded that there was a need for a metro on the south side of the city along the Luas green line.  That project became MetroLink.  Since 2018, expenditure on that project has been classed as MetroLink.  Since then, as the exchanges with Deputy McAuliffe earlier indicated, there was the emerging preferred route consultation.  There was substantial public response to that, including from public representatives and local communities.  There was a further public consultation on the preferred route and changes were made between those two consultation periods in response to the issues raised by public representatives and local communities.<\/p> <p>  Since the conclusion of the preferred route public consultation, that project has been brought forward for much more detailed planning, design and environmental preparation for the planning application.  I apologise if the Deputy heard this earlier.  The focus in the Department is to complete our review of the preliminary business case.  That case was submitted to us this year for the first time.  We are awaiting a revised draft.  We will then complete our review with the ambition to allow our Minister to bring it to Government as soon as possible.

As a result, the first base is up and running in Sligo.  Personnel at the remaining bases are still in training.  To get to the next step, which is SAR approval, CHC needs approval under manuals and training schedules.

As they know, this is the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is all about value for money for us.  I want to point out to Mr. Spratt that I sat in on a meeting of the Committee on Transport and Communications for my colleague last week.  Representatives from TII and the NTA were before the committee.  I suggested to Nigel O'Neill of TII that there is an issue with toll barriers because we pay in excess of &euro;600 million per year for exceeding nitrogen oxide, NOx, emissions above what is allowed under EU rules.  I was astounded to hear Mr. O'Neill respond that the barriers at Dublin Port Tunnel are there for traffic management and control.  I advised him that I have been all over Europe and many parts of the world and that I have never seen a toll barrier used to control traffic in a tunnel.  I ask that this be revised.  I am sure Mr. O'Neill has gone back and had a conversation about it.  I calculate that it is costing the transport industry &euro;92 million per year for toll barriers in this country.  That is what it is costing to stop and expend a litre of fuel and that is just in money.  I do not have the measure of what it is costing in lung health and health issues that NOx emissions contribute to but I am sure the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, does.  I would like the Department to come back to the committee and let us know what it is going to do about the situation and what actions it will take because the EPA has provided a report which states that we are exceeding our NOx emissions and that those emissions are primarily caused by transport.  That is primarily what we are being fined for and these are the targets we are setting.  I am not aware of anything the Department has provided to the sector as an incentive to be cleaner and greener.  I ask the Department to submit that information.<\/p><p>Peter Walsh from TII also appeared before the Committee on Transport and Communications.  There is a major issue at Rosslare Europort.  Mr. Spratt will be aware that there has been a 400% increase in traffic there because of Brexit.  The Government has spent &euro;11 million, through the Office of Public Works, OPW, providing a state-of-the-art facility for our regulatory agencies, facilities that one could only have dreamed of years ago.  I am not sure what the acreage is but it is substantial.  It is empty all of the time while our hauliers have drivers <i>in situ<\/i>in lay-bys trying to comply with tachograph rules and trying to find somewhere to park if the ship is late, which happens with the weather at this time of year.  The biggest sufferance is for the residents.  They have refrigerated vehicles running outside their doors because these trucks have nowhere to park.  We have spent &euro;11 million on a yard that is at least 85% empty.  I propose that it needs to be adapted to accommodate the traffic which the NTA and TII are responsible for accommodating.<\/p><p>Nothing has been done.  I invited Mr. Walsh to come Rosslare to meet the local county councillors and garda&iacute; and put a traffic management plan in place.  There is a serious road safety issue.  We should not waste the taxpayers money; rather, we should utilise it to the best of our ability.  There is no need for more facilities.  At most we might need to erect a fence but I do not even see the need for that.  We have customs agents in control in the facility itself.  The facilities are there for the drivers when they have to go through the regulation process, including toilet facilities.  We need to start to think with the taxpayer in mind and I ask that Mr. Spratt would take charge of that because Mr. Walsh was not forthcoming about travelling down to meet the elected representatives in Rosslare, myself included, who are tasked with looking after the area.<\/p><p>I have written to both last week and I will send on the correspondence.<\/p><p> The other point I would like to mention is that the funding granted for regional airports was &euro;90 million.  What funding is available to Waterford Airport and the south east from that funding?<\/p><p> Waterford Airport is also home to the Coast Guard Sikorsky rescue helicopter R117.  Given the increase in traffic at Rosslare Europort, it now takes on a whole new level of importance given that it is based in that area and in light of the amount of time a helicopter might need to travel as a result of the increased capacity of direct routes from Rosslare to France.  Mr. Clonan, in particular, might let me know if he agrees with that.  There must be a special place for this service now in Waterford Airport.  I visited there during the recess and I am very concerned on two levels.  The helicopter is housed at the behest of Waterford Regional Airport.  The Coast Guard is basically renting a hangar to house the helicopter.  I accept An Bord Plean&aacute;la has not decided on the application.  Funding was committed by the Department for an extension of the runway, but if the airport is closed, will the commitment still hold?  How much is the funding?  Could the witnesses assure the people in the south-east region, and those who traverse the high seas, that there will be no interference or diminution of the Coast Guard service in the south-east region at Waterford Airport?

This is insane.  This happened on the N11 where we spent more than &euro;2 million on planning for the 33 km that is left to be made a motorway.  This cycle must be broken.  A decision must be made on how we are accountable for taxpayers' money.  On top of that, I am being told that an airport of regional importance that houses the Coast Guard is not viable for the south-east region of more than 600,000 people.  If it is different, I hope Mr. Spratt will write to me and tell me that is the case.  The population is now on the rise due to the increase in traffic at Rosslare Europort.

I wish to focus in on the Coast Guard with Mr. Clonan.  I note from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that 18, I think, vehicles were purchased.  There were issues with procurement but I have heard what the Secretary General has said in that regard on reform around procurement, which is welcome.  An issue I raised last May, of which Mr. Clonan might be aware, was one brought to my attention by members and volunteers from the Coast Guard about the use of the vehicles.  He gave me a response at the time saying there are rules around the use of those vehicles.  However, what I was saying at the time was that if members were allowed bring them to their homes it could increase response times.  The reports I had at the time were members were leaving their home, going to the base, collecting the vehicle and then going to the scene.  Mr. Clonan said correctly that not all members had to go to base.  They could leave the vehicles at home.  Has there been any progress on that?  Given my limited time, he might send a note on that if he cannot come back to me immediately after this.<\/p> <p>  My second question is for Mr. Spratt and concerns an area of great interest to me, namely, planning for major incidents, be they regional or national and relating to rail, road, sea or air.  How frequently are the emergency services and other agencies engaged in training in these areas?  I mention also co-ordination between local authorities.  I am aware of one local authority where its disaster communications centre needs to be relocated from its main building.  The officials cannot hypothesise about various incidents but given the potential scale of one of these incidents, how prepared are we as a State to deal with such incidents?

On a national level, I have a very significant problem with TII's annual allocations.  In terms of grant allocations for 2021 for national road budgets, page three of the documentation indicates that &euro;484,256,450 is the gross allocation for national road maintenance.  The document provides an individual breakdown for projects that will be receiving funding which is excellent in that it enables public representatives to explain to their constituents what is happening in their constituencies.  One of these projects, the N73, happens to fall into my constituency in Cork East and I raised it with Mr. Walsh of the TII at a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications last week.  I have a very significant problem.  A  sum of &euro;86.99 million was allocated to Cork County Council, of which &euro;1.5 million was allocated in the 2021 budget to progress upgrade works on the N73 near Kildorrery between Mallow and Mitchelstown but when we hit September, the funding disappeared.  I want to know where it is gone and I want to know why the &euro;1.5 million is not available.  These are questions I asked last week but having looked back at the clip, I did not really get the certainty I want.  Perhaps the witnesses could correspond with me on this after the meeting but if they can answer me now, all the better.  I want to know why the &euro;1.5 million of the annual funding for Cork County Council of &euro;86.99 million for national road maintenance in 2021 is not available.  Why was Cork County Council told it cannot progress after TII, as the agency under the remit of the Department of Transport, told it to advance the process as far as tendering?<\/p> <p>  This is completely unacceptable.  We cannot have State agencies providing funding budgets and then not carrying out the work.  It does not give us clarity and makes us, as elected representatives irrespective of party, particularly those of us who are in government, look bad.  I do not blame people for giving out.  This is something that needs to be fine tuned.  I am aware that the funding has been allocated for next year but it still must be approved by the board of TII, which is expected to happen in the second week of December.  Before that happens, I want the Secretary General and the relevant official in his Department, whether that be a principal officer or an assistant secretary in charge of roads funding, to have a word with TII about this because it is completely unacceptable.  This has to be fine tuned.  We cannot have a situation where we are telling local authorities to advance national road plans and then not funding them at the final minute.

Much of that traffic comes down the N80 from the west through Mountmellick.  In fact, it passes within 150 yd of my house, along a new road, and that is welcome.  The town of Mountmellick was promised that a bypass inner relief road would be built in 2004 or 2005.  The proposals that were put forward would have meant it cutting through the car park of a business and community facilities and it was rejected because of that.  A feasibility study has been conducted by the county council in conjunction with the Department, which cost in the region of &euro;100,000, and it has set out a route for the bypass.<\/p> <p>  Will the Department revert to the committee on efforts to advance that project?  It is of strategic importance.  There is a T-junction in the centre of the town and articulated trucks have to cross to the far side of the road to get around it.  It is dangerous and it chokes up the town centre.  It would shorten journeys if the inner relief road were built, although it would involve a crossing of the River Owenass.  I have not seen any progress in recent years but the feasibility study has been completed.  It is not mentioned in the national development plan or any funding stream.  Will the Department revert to me on whether there are plans to advance it over the next three or four years?<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for joining us and the staff at the Department and the Irish Coast Guard for their work in preparing for the meeting.

This response arises from an enquiry we made following consideration of a previous item of correspondence from the T&aacute;naiste on this issue.  The committee requested clarity as to the specific analysis that has been undertaken in respect of growing energy demand due to data centre investments.  The Secretary General states such analysis has been undertaken by bodies responsible for the management and regulation of our electricity market, namely, EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, and provides hyperlinks to those analyses.  Also provided is the Government statement on the role of data centres in Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise strategy.

Detailed information is provided in regard to the contractual provisions regarding inflation.  Essentially, the new children&rsquo;s hospital construction contract permits the contractor to recover the cost of tender inflation in excess of 4%, and this provision came into effect in August 2019.  The inflation payment from the State to the main contractor, including VAT, for the period August to December 2019 was &euro;1.6 million, and a further &euro;1.5 million was paid out for the period of January to December 2020.<\/p><p> On the lessons learned from the planning phase of the project in terms of the procurement process, the contract and related controls, the chief officer states that the form of contract used was the standard Office of Government Procurement public works contract for employer design, with some elements of the works contract modified to meet the two-stage procurement requirements of the project.  He also states that the process was overseen by a third party.  The chief officer goes on to state that, in regard to lessons learned from the procurement process and the public works contract, the PwC report sets out two recommendations regarding future large capital projects for which Government Departments are responsible.  No information is provided on whether the procurement process used was, in hindsight, the most appropriate to deliver value for money for the State, or whether any lessons have been learned from a project for which the costs have significantly escalated, and one for which, despite the best efforts of this committee, we do not know the final cost or date of completion.<\/p><p> This has been flagged by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Imelda Munster, and by myself.

We need to look for more up-to-date information, up to the end of 2021, in regard to inflation and projected inflation.  We know that 4% is the threshold and there is a problem once it goes beyond that.  Has forecasting been undertaken in the context of further rises in inflation and are there projections for 2022?  One of the reasons this has overrun in time is because the contractor did not provide sufficient staff on the site, and it was done on a month-by-month basis in the early stages and deadlines were missed.  That is something we addressed when the hospital board were in here and it is acknowledged that it was a problem.  Can we ask them about the number of staff or the number of people who are actually on-site, and if the targets are still being missed or whether that has improved?  The longer this goes on, the bigger the risk in regard to inflation, particularly now that we are in a time of increased inflation, in particular construction inflation.  Can we seek an update on the contractor claims?  Members might recall that some of them were at a mediation stage.  We also need to know if the moratorium on the High Court actions is still in place.  Those would be my main asks in regard to what we should go back and seek.<\/p> <p>  It is incredibly difficult to deal with this when we have not been given the report that was done in that we are trying to anticipate things without having the firm ground of responding to the findings in that report.

With regard to the contract, it is set out that, to date, 135 of 170 contractor design packages have been approved, and that information is given under the list of design changes.  A figure was mentioned at one stage of up to 700 potentially, as I recall, and a figure of 400 was given for those they were supposed to be working through.  What I want to analyse from that is where the discrepancy is between the figures we were given here by the board, when they were in last year, and the figures that are there now.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the project, it is said the procurement process for the contract commenced in 2015 and the form of contract used was a standard Office of Government Procurement public works contract for employer design, with some elements of the work contract modified to meet a two-stage procurement process.  That does not tell us an awful lot.  It is a long-winded description but it does not tell us exactly how that works.  It states the evaluation of the tender submission was carried out using the most economically advantageous tender criteria in line with the Office of Government Procurement's capital works framework and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board&rsquo;s tender evaluation procedures.  It was to be overseen by an independent third party and, presumably, they brought in a consultancy firm to oversee that.  We need more information about the two-stage nature of that contract.  It is obviously one of the things that allowed for the potential for a huge price increase in terms of the overall cost.  We should ask them about point 3 in their letter, which caught my eye yesterday when I was reading it.  While they give a long-winded description, it does not really tell us anything and it is just a form of words.  They should explain why that is.  In addition, this two-stage procurement process is left very much open-ended in terms of price for the second stage.  Where has that model been used before?<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Murphy said, we are left second-guessing much of this because we do not have the report and we do not have the timeline.  In the absence of clear information, it would appear the second phase was left very much open-ended in terms of cost and the price increases that could happen.

I note that today EUROSTAT has indicated that Irish price inflation is set to breach 5% for the first time since the financial crash.  Obviously, that is having a big impact on many things but it could also have a big impact on the Exchequer in regard to this project, which is already seeing the inflated costs which we have dealt with in detail.  It is crucial that we get a breakdown from the Department on whether there will be a significant increase in cost as a result of that inflation rate.

The very least we would want to do is learn some lessons from the mistakes of the past.  The Chair has made a point about the two-stage process.  This was really where a large amount of the extra expenditure arose.  We were told if it went out to tender again it would just delay it.  It was not feasible to do the two phases and have a proper tendering process on the second phase.  This type of information is very important for understanding what can go wrong and where we can keep an eye on other very large-scale projects.  I accept there is a new spending code but process is important.  Part of the reason I asked about the number of staff on the site is that in a scenario where there is construction inflation, it could be way beyond 5%.  The longer this goes on, the more the contractor can gain from it in theory.  It is very important that we are given information on exactly how it is progressing.

Some of the letters that went out to which Deputy Carthy referred indicated that the Statute of Limitations would apply and that the investigation could terminate without conclusion due to the Statute of Limitations.  I share the concern about answering questions.  A question of mine was disallowed on 9 November?  I asked the Minister for Justice had she directed the ombudsman commission in the context of examination of Garda practice, policy and procedure, to examine the memorandum of understanding that exists between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to information sharing and if she was satisfied that it was functioning as intended.  I was told that the Minister has no responsibility in that regard.  I find it hard to accept that is the case because the Minister can intervene for a review.  The Minister talks to the Garda Commissioner all the time.  She must have a relationship with GSOC too.  I do not hold with the idea that the Minister can be totally removed.  It is quite difficult to figure this out.  You cannot blame an organisation if it does not have the resources to do the job.  We saw that in a freedom of information request that Mr. Ken Foxe followed up on relating to the provision of members of the Garda for some of the investigations.  It took a long time for the required Garda members to be provided to GSOC to conduct investigations.  The last thing anyone wants is to get to where so much time and energy has been put into something and then it does not proceed because they do not have the resources and they run into an issue with the Statute of Limitations.  There is a range of concerns around what exactly that &euro;300,000 allows to happen.  We need to go back on that.  Does it address the current industrial relations issues?  Where do those industrial relations issues reside?  Are they in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I am not sure to whom that question should be addressed.  Those are questions that are worth pursuing and there may be others after we get a response.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#BB01300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Will Deputy Carthy propose the areas that committee shall seek information on in its correspondence?

It might be useful to review that before the committee writes to the Department or to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the claims and breakdown of those.  I have the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appropriation account opened here.  They divide the claims numbers between claims by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and employees of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the one hand, and civil claims by members of the public.

It is not only about care, however, it is also the cost of living and so on.  If, for example, a large sum is paid out today and the person passes away in 12 months, two years or three years, that money then has been paid by the State.  The question is whether or not we should be looking at a system, such as in other countries, whereby an assessment is made of needs of the person and there would be an annual payment as opposed to a lump sum payment.  Should Ireland be looking at that system?

No amount would ever be compensation for the person who might have been and his or her resultant quality of life had that accident not happened.<\/p><p> One of the ways of dealing with this matter more cost efficiently was to be the open disclosure process as opposed to a protracted legal approach.  Interestingly, the State Claims Agency told us that the pandemic had changed the situation significantly, in that there was a greater likelihood that people would pursue mediated settlements as opposed to court settlements.  Individual solicitors were giving that advice because going through the courts had grown more difficult.  As such, it appears that it is at the level of solicitors as opposed to the agency that there is movement.  The agency said that it had encouraged that.  The figures seem to suggest that, but it was at the level of the legal profession that movement was slower.<\/p><p> If there is a speedier and less legalistic resolution, it has the benefit of cutting costs on the legal side.

Following consideration of previous correspondence on this matter from the Department, namely, No. 718, the committee requested details of the checks and balances in place within the Department over value for money auditing of each line of expenditure in respect of liquidation fees, including a breakdown of fees and clarification as to whether fees would continue to increase the longer the process went on.  The Secretary General states that there has been a high level of oversight by the Department since the process commenced in 2013, including procedures to monitor and oversee the costs and fees incurred in the liquidation, regular formal meetings between senior officials from the shareholding and financial advisory division and the special liquidators, and frequent communication between the shareholding and financial advisory division and special liquidators across a range of issues as they arise.<\/p><p>The Department also sets out the reports that the special liquidators routinely supply and states that in 2019 the Department commissioned an independent review of similar liquidations globally, which provided it with an independent analysis of other liquidations of a similar scale, allowing comparisons and benchmarking with the IBRC special liquidation, particularly in regard to costs.  The findings of that report are set out in the correspondence. <\/p><p> The Secretary General goes on to note that as stated in the latest progress report the timeframe for the final wind-up of IBRC has been extended to 2024.  This is attributed to the impact of the pandemic and delays in court proceedings.  The impact of the pandemic on asset values and the need to ensure the optimal timing for asset sales are also noted.   In regard to costs, over the remaining timeline of the liquidation, the special liquidators have forecasted total further fees of between &euro;26 million and &euro;33 million.

The Department has very usefully outlined the potential losses in asset value if the assets were to be disposed of by the end of this year, next year, 2023 and 2024 and the additional holding costs that would incur.  On the holding costs above original projections, these are set out for 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 as &euro;2 million, &euro;7 million, &euro;18 million and &euro;26.5 million, respectively.  I would like clarity on the discrepancy in that regard.  According to the Department, the holding cost for 2022 would be &euro;5 million more than the cost for 2021.  The difference between 2022 and 2023 is &euro;11 million and between 2023 and 2024, it is &euro;8.5 million.  There does not appear to be any logical fix in how much each year of delay would cost.<\/p> <p>  Unless somebody can tell me otherwise, I presume that when we are talking about asset realisation, we are, for the most part, talking about properties.  It appears to be an almost a gamble strategy to suggest that the difference in assets value at the end of this year, taking into account how high property prices are currently, will be less than what it will be at the end of 2024.  If anything, it would be hoped that the market might have cooled in the meantime, but the Department is expecting that the value of these properties will increase to the value of &euro;189 million.  That is a fairly big statement.  It is the basis on which the Department has agreed to spend an additional &euro;26.5 million in holding costs.  I would like further clarification from the Department as to how, and on what basis, it is assuming these asset values will increase to that level.  <\/p> <p>  It was stated that the many of the remaining assets are in the hospitality, office and retail sectors and that it will not come as a surprise that the special liquidators have advised that the assets value were significantly negatively impacted by Covid-19.  That may be the case, but some would argue that that has been almost completely reversed.  The property pages show the price of property, depending on where it is located, is at an all-time high.  It would be useful if the Department could set out for us the basis on which it expects such a large increase in asset value over the specified timeframe that merits the expenditure of almost &euro;30 million extra in holding costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#FF00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Every one of us wants the State to end up with the maximum return.  The criticism of some of the early sales in regard to NAMA was that many of us felt it was a fire sale in that properties were sold when the market as at rock bottom as opposed to when we had a rising market.  In being critical of that, we equally need to argue that we need to get the maximum here.  It is a balancing act in terms of the cost and the rising cost of the liquidation and what can be realised from what remains.  We do not have enough information to make that assessment.  We have some generalities in regard to what is yet to be disposed of.  It might be useful to get some sort of a quantum as to what is within each category such that we have a better idea.  We need to also know what the net return is.  I accept these can only be forecasts.  This is the biggest liquidation in the history of the State.  It is hoped we will never again have another as big as it.  The criticism in recent years has been around the level of oversight.  The Department has oversight in this regard.  There is no committee of oversight, which was something that a former members of this committee constantly raised the need for in order that we could keep an eye on this process.  A bit more information is needed regarding the various scenarios, including what is to be disposed of and the quantum in each of the categories yet to be disposed of.

I am joined by colleagues from the Department with responsibility for international protection issues, Ms Carol Baxter, assistant secretary, and Ms Paula Quinn, principal officer.  Ms Una Ni Dhubhghaill, principal officer, is also supporting us today.  I am conscious that the committee has already held four meetings this year on the issue of direct provision, involving the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children, and a number of other experts in the area.  I will try not to duplicate what they have dealt with in their respective contributions.  I will focus instead on the work we are currently engaging in to end direct provision and establish a new international protection support service.<\/p> <p>  I know the committee will be familiar with the main elements and overall approach of the White Paper on this issue which the Government published last February.  I will not repeat many of the details of the White Paper&rsquo;s contents, but I hope it will be helpful if I outline the process we in the Department have put in place to advance its implementation as soon as possible and to summarise the progress made so far.  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions that members may have.<\/p> <p>  For completeness, I would note that our Department is responsible for providing accommodation and supports to applicants for international protection and for implementing the changes to these as promised in the White Paper, but that responsibility for processing applications, processing times and other aspects of processing asylum claims remains with the Department of Justice and the International Protection Appeals Tribunal.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware that responsibility for matters relating to international protection accommodation and services was transferred to our Department from the Department of Justice in October 2020.  We have taken on these new functions with enthusiasm and a sense of determination to get things done.  We have an ambitious agenda of change ahead of us, and we are keen to make the changes that will bring real improvements in the quality of life of those in the international protection system.  Of course there are very clear legal obligations in this area.  Ireland is obliged to provide accommodation and supports to persons seeking international protection, but in addition to the provisions of law, our Department is strongly committed to making much-needed changes to the conditions of people coming to our shores in these circumstances.<\/p> <p>  The shortcomings of the current system of so-called direct provision have been widely recognised and the programme for Government has pledged to replace it with a new system centred on a not-for-profit approach underpinned by the principles of human rights and the integration of applicants into Irish society from the point of arrival in Ireland.  Under the White Paper there will be a particular focus on children&rsquo;s rights and on ensuring dignity, privacy and respect for all applicants and their families.  The White Paper also contains a commitment to phase out the use of congregated settings by the end of December 2024 when the new system is scheduled to be fully rolled out.<\/p> <p>  The committee will recall that the new model outlined in the White Paper is based on a two-phase approach to accommodating applicants for international protection.  In phase one, the applicant will be accommodated in a reception and integration centre for up to four months.  We will seek to encourage integration from day one and to place people on the most successful pathway possible towards an independent life in Ireland, should their application prove successful.<\/p><p> Accommodation in reception and integration centres will be own-door for families and own-room for single people, with specific tailoring for people with identified vulnerabilities.  Comprehensive information about the international protection process will be made available to all applicants and will include information on Legal Aid Board services, health services, education supports, childcare and employment activation.  This information will be translated into the most common languages spoken by applicants, and an intensive orientation and English language programme will be provided.  In phase two our emphasis will be on fostering an independent life within the community.  All accommodation for families will be own-door, self-contained houses or apartments to provide privacy, agency and independence.  Single people will be housed in either own-door or own-room accommodation.  Homes will be located in cities and towns across every county in the country and supports will be put in place to help encourage integration.  Vulnerable applicants will have additional supports provided to them by NGOs contracted by the Department.  In order to support independent living applicants will be provided with income support payments funded by the Department, including child support payments.  All accommodation units will be managed by independent not-for-profit organisations operating on behalf of the State.<\/p><p> In both phases there will be an emphasis on child welfare and child protection.  Children and young people&rsquo;s services committees, CYPSCs, will ensure there is a specific focus on the needs of children, young people and their families in international protection accommodation settings, with the input of Tusla in key areas such as prevention, partnership and family support and educational support services.  Parenting supports and child development services will be made available to applicant families to support child development during the application process for international protection, and childcare will be provided to enable parents to attend English language classes.  <\/p><p> Phase two supports will be co-ordinated at the local level by inter-agency working groups which will be established in each county and chaired by the local authority.  The working groups will also include representatives of relevant organisations such as the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the local education and training board.  The inter-agency working group will also provide a framework for notifying public authorities and community structures when the Department is deciding to build, acquire or lease phase two accommodation in a particular area, in line with the national allocation key that has been agreed between the Department and the County and City Management Association, CCMA.<\/p><p> It is clear that implementing this new accommodation model and its accompanying supports will require a whole-of-government approach, and this was noted in the White Paper.  With this in mind we have a transition team in the Department that is preparing a detailed implementation plan for the new system.  We are working closely with all relevant stakeholders on different aspects of the plan.  In particular, we are working closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Housing Agency and the local authorities on developing the new accommodation model and on acquiring suitable premises.  We are also working in collaboration with housing experts to prepare advice on the optimal ownership model for the accommodation, as well as on a funding model to enable approved housing bodies and other not-for-profit organisations to act as our delivery partners for the accommodation and supports element of the new system.  <\/p><p> A total of &euro;28.1 million has been allocated to the Department in 2022 for the implementation of the new model of accommodation.  This breaks down between &euro;12.5 million in capital expenditure and &euro;15.6 million in current expenditure.  With this allocation the transition team will be focused on a range of areas.  These will include, by way of example, acquisition of phase two accommodation with a focus on turnkey properties and properties that require upgrading or renovations; rolling out a rent-a-room scheme and the sourcing of private tenancies; a funding scheme for approved housing bodies so that they can begin to bring properties on stream and provide a pipeline for phase two accommodation; starting the transition of international protection applicants out of IPAS accommodation and into accommodation in the community; starting the funding to local authorities to co-ordinate integration at local level; beginning the commissioning of NGOs to provide supports, particularly for vulnerable applicants; initiating the roll-out of applicant-based supports at a local level, including income supports and childcare; rolling out a community integration fund which will support community integration initiatives and deliver benefits for local communities; rolling out employment outreach supports, and launching a national consultation and information process to brief communities about the implementation of the White Paper.<\/p><p> In order to monitor the implementation of the new system, a programme board to oversee the transition to the new international protection support service has been established.  As Secretary General of the Department, I chair this board which includes representatives with lived experience of international protection, NGOs, UNHCR, independent experts in housing and change management and relevant Departments.  The programme board has already had three meetings and its next meeting is scheduled for 18 November.  To date the board has considered a number of important issues, including a draft implementation plan, the income support payments that will be given to applicants and the ownership model for any new accommodation that will be acquired.  In the coming months the board will be asked to review papers on the integration supports that will be offered to applicants and a draft policy for moving those who are currently in the direct provision system into phase two accommodation as it comes on stream.  In addition I am pleased to say that a three-person external advisory group which will provide independent oversight of the reform process contained in the White Paper, has been recently appointed by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman.  Its members are: Dr. Catherine Day, former Secretary General of the European Commission who was chair of the advisory group that formed a key input to the White Paper; Dr. David Donoghue, a retired diplomat and former ambassador to the United Nations who cofacilitated the development of the UN-sponsored global approach to refugees and migrants; and Dr. Lorcan Sirr, a housing policy expert and lecturer in TU Dublin.  This group has had its own initial meeting and I had a valuable initial discussion with it last week.  The Government will be kept informed of the progress of these reforms through the Minister, and the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality will also review progress. <\/p><p> In outlining our plans for major reform, I am conscious of the need still to support the existing system of direct provision even as we plan to end it.  Current residents have the right to expect a quality service, and we must ensure that it is functioning to meet their needs during the transition period.  With this in mind we have recently introduced a number of initiatives aimed at promoting the well-being of residents.  A new dedicated IPAS customer services team is working to strengthen the existing resident complaints system and to take a more proactive approach to dealing with residents' issues, actively engaging with residents through regular resident feedback clinics.  We have also established a resident welfare team.  This is a new multidisciplinary team that focuses on residents with more complex issues, including those with physical and mental health issues and persons identified through the IPAS vulnerability assessment process as having special reception needs.  Officials from Tusla, the HSE&rsquo;s social inclusion team and the Department of Education support this team.  Additional social workers are currently being recruited to provide further support to the team.  These teams have been going to considerable lengths over the past year to deliver improvements to the current system, and we will continue our efforts to promote a service based on quality, human rights and dignity of all those seeking international protection.<\/p><p> To conclude, we have a very ambitious programme of reform ahead of us, with an equally ambitious deadline of the end of 2024 to have the new system in place.  There is a strong commitment and enthusiasm in our Department, and we will work closely with all of the key agencies in a way that will make a real difference to the lives of people applying for international protection in Ireland.  I thank members and we would be happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  This is an issue which many of us have taken an interest in over the last number of years.  I have many questions and, hopefully, I can stay on for the second round of questions as well.  My first question is about the establishment of these reception and integration centres and the stipulation that ideally people will be kept there for four months.  I assume that is while their applications are being processed.  Reading Dr. Lynch's statement, the total budget allocated for the Department for 2022 is &euro;28.1 million.  The concern I have is how to bridge that gap between how we think people will stay in this accommodation for four months and the budget, as welcome as it is, of &euro;28.1 million which probably will not scratch the surface in providing accommodation for those applicants who are subsequently successful.  How realistic is that ambition to deliver this accommodation given that &euro;28.1 million would not scratch the surface in terms of providing the number of properties that are probably required?<\/p><p> The second question is linked to that.  It is evident we are in the middle of a housing crisis at the moment.  Could the Secretary General comment on making that ambition a reality?<\/p><p> I wish to clarify two other points and I will give the remaining time to the Secretary General.  The Secretary General said in his submission that income support payments will be provided.  Can he clarify what he means?  We know of the very small amount of money asylum seekers receive each week at present.  It is hardly an amount on which they could sustain themselves if they were in their own turnkey property.  Can the Secretary General clarify what income support payments will be provided?  Will it change from the current system?<\/p><p> My final point relates to child welfare and the process of inspections or lack thereof in the system.  Dr. Muldoon was before this committee some months ago and his report was fairly damning in that regard.  Could the Secretary General give us an update on the number of inspections that have happened since then because there were concerns that inspections were not taking place?  Does he have any detail on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#B00200","speaker":"1521","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>In terms of what Deputy O'Sullivan was inquiry about under a number of headings, I will take them in order.  On the reception and integration centres, the initial work on that will start as soon as possible.  There will be six of them in all, with 330 people per centre.  We are conscious of the need to plan and organise those as quickly as possible and we are working on that as one of our top priorities in terms of identifying locations and putting them in place.  That is a key part of what we will be doing.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the budget of &euro;28.1 million, &euro;12.5 million of that is capital and the balance is non-capital.  It is important to say that we regard that as a starting point.  We have an agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that in the event we require further funding during 2022, it will be forthcoming.  I do not believe a shortage of budget in 2022 or in subsequent years will be an obstacle for us.  I am satisfied the money we have for 2022 is a very good start and we will plan on that basis.<\/p> <p>  It is important to say we will be using both capital and non-capital money for these purposes.  For example, part of the accommodation will be done on the basis of capital expenditure and partly on the basis of non-capital expenditure.  We will be able to use non-capital expenditure for the urban renewal provisions and for a number of others.  The reception and integration centres will involve capital expenditure.  I am reasonably satisfied we can make a very good start on that during the course of 2022 and the budget will not be an issue as such.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the housing crisis issue the Deputy raised, certainly we are very conscious that we are attempting to provide additional accommodation which we regard as very important during what is a significant housing crisis.  However, not in any way to diminish what we are trying to do, we are conscious that we are catering for a relatively modest number of people.  At any one time we want to provide for 3,500 people working their way through the system.  Relative to the total number looking for accommodation, this is small.  I am not in any way diminishing the challenge that faces us but we are a relatively small component of a much larger issue to do with the housing crisis.  That is a good thing in terms of being able to move ahead.<\/p> <p>  With regard to income support payments, a very important point raised by the Deputy was the fact that when you move to phase two, you will no longer benefit from the in-kind and direct benefits given to people in phase one.  Clearly we will take full account of that.  The income support approach we are designing will be based on a payment that takes account of the fact that people are now living in the community and have to organise themselves accordingly.  We are probably looking at the supplementary welfare allowance or an equivalent rate of payment for phase two applicants once they leave phase one.  That takes account of the fact that they will be living in the community and will have a much more significant expenditure profile and cost of living than in phase one.<\/p> <p>  With regard to child welfare and inspections, we place a huge emphasis on that.  We have been concerned to ensure they are done properly.  We have done inspections in the current year and will continue doing those into next year.  At the moment, we have an arrangement where an external company does two inspections and then our International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, does the other one, so that is three.  The other good thing that will start in the near future is the HIQA approach which will start with monitoring and then move to inspections of our facilities.  That will be a very important step forward and will be seen as an independent, external monitoring of what we are doing.<\/p> <p>  In regard to inspections in the current year, if memory serves me correctly, although I will check with colleagues, we have done 55 inspections of facilities so far this year, of which 12 were done by IPAS and the other 43 by an external company.  We hope to meet our full target by the end of the year, and we are conscious of doing so, in order that we will meet the requirement or target we have set ourselves to ensure we at least three visits of each centre per year.  I hope that covers each of the points raised by Deputy O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their time and the statement.  I have a few questions, and I might leave some of them to the second round depending on my own availability.  When we last spoke with the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, about this, his office had dealt with a number of complaints and a number of issues had arisen particularly in light of the pandemic.  I recognise the work done on the White Paper but I also acknowledge the challenges that Covid-19 presented not only for the Department but for the service users and providers.  In that vein, I welcome the reforms around the complaint procedures the Secretary General, Dr. Lynch, outlined.  It is very welcome and it is timely.  Some might argue it is overdue but it is there now and that is important.<\/p> <p>  On Dr. Lynch's last comment on the 55 inspections, were they unannounced inspections or pre-arranged?  What is the breakdown?  If you want to have three inspections per year, is there a breakdown between notified and unannounced inspections?<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the White Paper and phase one.  I am wondering about those reception and integration centres.  Is there a likelihood that the existing ones will be redeveloped or are there going to be new ones because some of them are not fit for purpose?  Dr. Lynch might elaborate on that.<\/p> <p>  My second question for now, although I will come back in with others, is in regard to what Dr. Lynch said applicants receiving income support but only when they move into phase two.  For those in phase one, what are the income supports?  A number of years ago we had a reception centre in Dun Laoghaire for unaccompanied minors.  Obviously there was a big challenge in terms of their well-being and safety but equally there were constant challenges for them from a financial perspective.  What happens to families and individuals who are received under phase one of the proposed new reforms?

We have put in place a central processing and reporting of complaints mechanism.  We have also worked on an internal set of review meetings and discussions in relation to complaints, with a helpdesk in place as well.<\/p> <p>  We have placed a good deal of emphasis on dealing with people's complaints, be it in relation to the pandemic or other issues that they have.  We are also developing and scoping a consumer consultation group from our customer base in IPAS to try to seek input, observations and suggestions as to how we might develop that for future.  We have placed a good deal of emphasis on that in terms of complaints.<\/p> <p>  I can confirm that the inspections were all unannounced.  That is the way we do our business.  It is important that we would do it that way so that we ensure that we are seeing the centre as it genuinely is.<\/p> <p>  On the reception and integration centres, we are looking at different options at the moment.  I do not want to be too specific because decisions have not been made as yet, but certainly we are looking at the scope for locating some of those centres on existing sites.  They will be new build as opposed to the existing facilities.  We are also obviously looking at developing new centres in other parts of the country but one of them will be in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  On income support, there is already a system of income support in phase one.

It plans to train more staff to be decision-makers, to be able to conduct reviews and to carry out reports and to complete reports.  As I mentioned, it is streamlining its application process to try to expedite applications.  It has been hugely conscious, as have we, of the unfortunate backlogs that have built up, particularly over Covid, but indeed before that.  It is very concerned to make sure that we can develop a system that gives people responses within reasonable periods of time.  Its objective is to have a first decision, a decision of first instance, within six months, and a final decision within the subsequent six months.

We are very conscious of the stress that they have been through, that they may have mental health issues and that they may well have other needs.  They are likely to be vulnerable people and they do not come here for nothing.  As the Deputy said, they do not come here for holiday.  We completely agree and we want to treat them with absolute respect and dignity and to provide them with the best possible service we can to help integrate them into the community.  We talk about integration from day one, which is something on which we place a significant emphasis in the White Paper.<\/p> <p>  On the services available, when people arrive, one of the first things each person will be offered is a vulnerability assessment.  These vulnerability assessments have been taking place for all new arrivals since February of this year.  They are an important initial component of the service we provide to them.  We then, as appropriate, link people who have mental health needs to mental health services, including engaging with a number of mental health organisations.  We also link with the HSE and with health teams.  It is not simply a case of seeking to accommodate people in a particular place when they arrive and leaving it at that.  We place a great emphasis on what their needs are, be they mental, physical or otherwise.  We then try to agree with  them the best supports we possibly can provide and to provide those services as best we can.  That very much includes mental health services.<\/p> <p>  I could not agree more in regard to people's willingness to work.  The emphasis must be on their ability and willingness to work because we all know they are very interested in working, and in the great majority of cases, they can do so.  As the Deputy said, many of them are well qualified.  One of the good things that has happened in regard to the right to work, or the work permit, is that the timescale has been reduced from nine months to six months.  They can seek work after that and we will support them in terms of training and access to employment after six months within the international protection system.

I agree it is an ambitious programme and it is important to embrace that.  My view of it is that while it is ambitious, if we set ourselves a much longer timetable, the danger is that it would simply take that longer period of time to achieve.  Therefore, we have set ourselves something that is very challenging indeed.  I do not think we are being utterly unrealistic, but we are challenging ourselves.  We are taking what we have described as a multi-strand approach to the accommodation, so we are not putting all our eggs in one basket, so to speak.  We are talking about housing and apartments, we are talking about existing buildings, we are talking about rent-a-room, we are talking about private tenancies where these are required and so on.  We are not attempting to do this all through the one single means.<\/p> <p>  We are developing the implementation plan at the moment and we would hope to publish an implementation plan next year.<\/p><p>That will be very much a live and an iterative document.  It will change and we will update it as we go.  Our current version of it is very much in draft form so we deliberately have not published it.  However, we do have a web page where we keep people up to date with what is happening so far and the progress we have made.  The implementation plan will be quite a detailed document and we would hope to publish that next year.<\/p><p> In terms of realism and achieving what we are setting out to achieve, there are a couple of other points I would like to make.  We are using a project management approach, which is based on specifics of what you will do, when you will do it, how you will do it, the components that you need, the deadlines that you need to set and so on.  Another thing we are doing to be sure to be realistic about this is we are drawing on existing expertise in the area.  For example, the Housing Agency has been hugely helpful and supportive to us already.  We are working with the local authorities and with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, we have got a very strong programme board, as I mentioned earlier, and we are taking a phased approach.  It is a very ambitious programme, but one that is doable, although obviously challenging.<\/p><p> In terms of year-by-year progress, we have achieved much of what we set out to achieve this year so far.  For example, on the funding side, we have secured funding and a deeper commitment to give us additional capital expenditure should we require it in the current year.  We have managed to reduce the number of emergency centres, which I mentioned earlier.  The vulnerability assessments are in place.  We have also put a residential welfare team in place, which was of the things we were anxious to do in the current year.  We have a customer service team in place, and I mentioned earlier we were scoping out a customer consultation group.  The programme board is up and running and doing very good work.  It is giving us very good advice and information.  We talked briefly about the external advisory group.  The transition team is up and running.  We have national standards against which HIQA will be monitoring.  They have been in place since 1 January.  That is just a quick summary of the sort of things we have put in place so far this year.<\/p><p> Of course, I do not underestimate the number of things that have to be done in subsequent years.  There is much to be done, but we have made good progress this year.  I see this year and the early part of next year as very much developmental and very much in the context of planning and being ready to put bricks and mortar in place thereafter.

The Secretary General said it would include representatives of Departments, agencies, NGOs, a person who has transitioned through the direct provision system, which is very welcomed, and relevant experts.  There is also a programme board which is chaired by the Secretary General and there is a separate external advisory group.  Will the Secretary General go through that again?  I am looking at the structures and I made notes as the Secretary General spoke.  We have two programme boards, one from the Secretary General's Department and one from the Department of Justice.  We have a co-ordination committee, we have an International Protection Support Services, IPSS, transition team, we have an external advisory group, we have the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality and we have a risk committee.  I understand that it is complex but I hope we have tried to simplify it.  If that is the aim, it scares me that there are so many different oversight committees.  I hope for the Secretary General's sake that he is not sitting on each one of those.  For myself and other committee members, would the Secretary General run through that again so we can see how they all fit in with each other?<\/p> <p>  As we know, stakeholders can be very broad.  Who are we hoping will fill the roles on these very important committees and oversight groups?  Speaking of people who have already transitioned though the system, as it were, I would like to hear the voices of current service users, be they adults or minors.  The only way we can really and truly learn is from those who are experiencing it.  That is not to detract from those who have gone through it, but by the time this is implemented, the system will have hopefully radically changed.<\/p> <p>  On the programme boards, what integration and co-operation will there be between the two Departments?  It scares me to have two programme boards in two different Departments.  I am worried about duplication or things falling through the gaps.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the Ombudsman, Mr. Tyndall's appearance at this committee, one of the big concerns highlighted was in respect of individuals who currently look to stay where they are being told they have to move, move school, move the whole family to another part of the country and without any regard for their feeling about it.  How is that going to change with the full implementation of the White Paper?  What can we expect from the perspective of those who want to relocate?<\/p> <p>  I refer to respecting people's cultural and religious ethos.  The Secretary General mentioned a new customer service phone line, which is wonderful.  I am wondering about the languages skills of those agents.  The Secretary General mentioned literature being distributed.  How broad is that?<\/p> <p>  The issue of unaccompanied minors is sadly a huge one, which could potentially get worse over the next few years.  What specifically are we going to do to improve the reception and the greeting those individuals get, given the fear they faced getting here in the first place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#F00700","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and I will try to deal with those questions.  He raised a very important question on the overall governance of the system.  I agree that at first glance it may look very complex, and I take the point about the different groups.  We have tried to streamline it and to make it as straightforward as we possibly can.  For completeness, we have included all the different components.  However, the major one in the first instance is the Minister and this Department in terms of taking responsibility for trying to pull all of this together.<\/p> <p>  On the programme board, we regard this as a particularly important component of the total.  We then have the external advisory group.  I will say a little bit about both of those.  The other programme board in the Department of Justice is dealing specifically with the processing issues and how to improve those and at how to deal with the issues in the White Paper that deal with its part of the agenda.  Even though it may look complicated, we can pull together the rest fairly successfully within our Department and through bilateral engagements with the other Department as well.  We have a very good working relationship with the Department of Justice.<\/p><p>For example, my colleague, Ms Carol Baxter, from our Department, sits on its programme board and we have a colleague in the Department of Justice who sits on our programme board, so there are good interlinkages between the two Departments.  The programme board has a former resident of the direct provision system who is making a significant contribution to it.  In terms of other stakeholders, these include the Departments, such as the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Health, Justice as well as our Department.  There is also the Irish Refugee Council, the Children's Rights Alliance, the UN High Commissioner, the Housing Agency, somebody with a health and social care background and an expert in programme management.  That board is functioning very well so far and gives us advice and strong information and links us with organisations with which we would otherwise not have a strong contact.  It also deals with monitoring, which is helpful to us.  <\/p><p> In regard to the external advisory group I mentioned, I would describe that as having an external, critical friend.  I used that term when I met the group last week and it liked it as it says we are not looking for a group that will pat us on the head or tell us we are doing a fine job.  We are looking for an external group that looks in critically and objectively and identifies what is going right, what is going wrong, why is it going wrong, why are things being delayed, what things could we do differently and what other approaches could we take and asks whether we have thought about X, Y and Z.  Those on the external advisory group are experts in their respective fields.  We will probably engage with them informally and bilaterally as well as every other way.<\/p><p> The other components described in the governance note we submitted as part of the briefing are all important, although I will not go into them now.  Each has its job to do and they are pulled together by the Department as a whole.  We have a co-ordination committee in the Department.  Pulling the whole thing together is the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality.  We will ensure that we are not simply going from one committee or one group to the next.  That is no way to do business and it would not help us to make progress.  However having people from these different organisations and agencies on a specific group gives us a contact point and a liaison point with them.  At the end of the note we circulated we identify many implementation partners ranging from Departments to the education and training boards to Tusla, the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities, the Housing Agency and so on.  It is a complex project about which there is no doubt.  We try to streamline the delivery of it as much as possible but I assure the committee that there is good co-operation between the different levels.<\/p><p> In regard to the other questions about moving to other parts of the country and the experience of some people in direct provision who were asked to move elsewhere, we will place a great emphasis on consultation and ensure people are consulted fully and we will try to the greatest extent possible to meet their needs and concerns in terms of what part of the country they will be in.  There will be no question of simply uprooting people from one part of the country and moving them to another.  We will place a good deal of emphasis on that.<\/p><p> In regard to language skills, our materials are translated and are available in a number of different languages - obviously in the languages most used by those involved - and we will continue to place emphasis on that so that communication is good.  Another important element of that is at orientation stage, we provide an offer of intensive English language courses for residents joining us for the first time to help them learn English as soon as possible.  That hopefully will improve their level of communication and integration to the system.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I thank the Secretary General.

The Secretary General mentioned he will start funding local authorities to co-ordinate integration at local level.  Apart from the housing side of things, are local authorities expected to do more in terms of integration?  If so, can the Secretary General clarify what we are looking at there?<\/p> <p>  The second point is on the commissioning of NGOs to provide supports particularly for vulnerable applicants.  \"Commissioning\" is the word I want clarity on there.

They will become involved in co-ordinating local provision of such things as health services, education and social services.  One of the important elements that we want to put in place, and which is already in place in some areas, is that of inter-agency working groups which will be chaired by local authorities.  They will include the education and training boards, the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others at local level.  We will have an inter-agency group that meets the needs of individuals at local level and that operates at local level.  The local authorities will play a particularly important role in regard to that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about NGOs.  They will be existing NGOs.  We are not particularly proposing the establishment of a further NGO for these purposes.  We have a very good working relationship with a number of NGOs which do very important work, including the Peter McVerry Trust, Depaul and others which provide very important services, understand the system on the ground very well and have provided very strong and important supports for people in the direct provision system.  We hope to be able to build on that.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the community integration fund, there is a fund of &euro;500,000 available for next year.  We are working on the criteria for that at the moment.  We hope to have that in place early in 2022.  These are important components of local delivery and we would stress the importance of locally based delivery and meeting people's needs at local level, while having an important co-ordination function at national level to ensure that everybody's experience is broadly the same and positive.  We will lay a good deal of emphasis on trying to do things at local level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I thank the Secretary General.

However, as I mentioned earlier in the meeting, the first priority is to move away from the congregated settings.  Some of the more recently provided direct provision centres are of a much higher quality and we are happier with those than the ones that were in place at an earlier stage but we are anxious to move away from the current system to the one described in the White Paper which is very much based on own-door accommodation and accommodation that properly meets the needs of individuals.<\/p><p> People are already entitled to free legal assistance at the beginning of their process.  We are conscious that is not perfect by any means and I understand the Department of Justice is reviewing the legal aid and the arrangements for legal aid.

As I said earlier, I was contacted about three quarters of an hour before this meeting.  The Secretary General's opening statement mentions that current residents have a right to expect quality service and we must ensure that it is functioning to meet their needs during the transition period.  I do not doubt that.  I was horrified to receive reports about people in two direct provision centres being fed out of plastic bags.  Meat and other food was being put into plastic bags and Styrofoam boxes.  In one of the centres, the residents were told to eat in their rooms because there was not room in the dining area for them.  I received these reports about two different centres.  I quickly checked before I came in and one of the centres received &euro;11 million in funding last year.  I have no doubt that the Department is not treating people like that, but some of these centres' health and safety is out the window if these reports are true.  That kind of treatment of any person or people is inhumane.  Deputy Buckley spoke about the countries and situations people have come from.  To think that some centres, which are making massive amounts of money, would treat any human being like that is disgraceful.  Will the Secretary General comment on that if he can?  Was he aware of that?<\/p> <p>  I was made aware of another death in a centre in the west of Ireland over the weekend.  The venue is unknown, or I have not been told where it is.  Apparently, this is the second such death in the last couple of weeks.  I was horrified to hear that.  Criticism has been laid at feet of the Government over the lack of transparency around deaths in direct provision centres.  Previously, records were released each year on the number and nature of deaths of people seeking international protection.  However, the Department of Justice stopped providing those details two years ago.  Why was that change made?  Why is the public no longer being made aware of the causes of deaths of people in direct provision centres?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#H00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":414,"content":"<p>The issues the Chair raised go to the heart of the humanity of the system and we place a huge emphasis on getting these issues right.  The suggestion that people would be treated inappropriately or inhumanely would be absolutely anathema to what we are about.  We are certainly aware of the reports the Chair referred to.  We investigated the report of food being offered in plastic bags or plastic containers very carefully and we found no evidence of it at all.  I would stress that if any resident has a complaint of any sort relating to that or anything else, he or she has the absolute right to make a complaint and I strongly encourage him or her to do so.  However, in that particular instance, we found no evidence.  We reviewed video footage and discussed the matter locally with the centre provider and we were not in a position to find any evidence.<\/p> <p>  I am not familiar with the other issue about people being told to eat in their rooms.  I know there was an issue at one stage in relation to Covid practises and Covid-related restrictions where it was necessary for residents to take certain precautions, but no more than the rest of us would have.  However, if there are specific issues that residents or others want to raise about unsatisfactory or inappropriate practises in individual direct provision centres, we will be more than happy to investigate those.<\/p> <p>  On the deaths, I do not want to comment on individual cases.  Where a death occurs, we provide significant support to family members and other residents in the facility.  We have a particular reporting policy and we published a new policy earlier this year, which has been in place since June 2021.  In it, we specify numbers of deaths and circumstances.  However, we have to be very careful to respect the privacy of individuals and their families.  Therefore, we are very careful about how we deal with individual cases and how we respond to queries about them.  However, we publish details of them.  It is important to acknowledge that the cause of death and the fact of the death need to be confirmed through the normal channels, through the coroner and so on, if that is required, rather than through our system.  We wait until those appropriate provisions have been observed before recording them formally in the information that we publish.  We publish information on deaths in direct provision but we lay a particular emphasis on the supports that we offer to the family of the deceased first and to other affected residents in the facility.  This is very much part of basic humanity and it is something that we place a great emphasis on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I understand the Secretary General cannot speak about individual cases and I would not expect it.

I place the blame solely on those who own the centres.  If found guilty, the centres should be closed down as soon as possible.

There are well-developed structures in place for making those complaints and there is absolutely no question of them being in any way negatively affected as a result of having made a complaint.  It is very important that we get that message across.  I hope the complaint system that we now have in place and the fact that we have a resident welfare team and a customer service team in place helps get across the message that we are open to hearing people's complaints.  We would far prefer to hear people's complaints and try to deal with them, rather than hearing about them subsequently or perhaps people feeling that they have to go elsewhere.

We are going back to more than 400 years ago when King James I bequeathed something in Youghal.  We cannot even develop a marina there, believe it or not.  We are still backing that today.<\/p> <p>  I looked at the two cases here and I remember the case of Mr. Barrett which was before the last committee meeting.  There was substantial information in it.  Even in the midst of a Covid pandemic - the dogs in the street would know this - there is photographic evidence showing that there was development on the estuary between 31 August and 28 October.  It is from a greenfield site to what looks like the base of another jetty.  I do not know if members can see that.  Certainly, if this is ongoing, and these two petitioners in particular have mentioned it, I very strongly welcome the recommendations from the committee on this.

I certainly support that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#J01000","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Thank you Deputy Buckley.  I support your call there.  To correct you, I think it was Mr. Jamie Forde Kelly's petition that was before the previous committee, and not Mr. Barrett's.  This has been going on since the last Government was in office and, as you said, concerns were raised that work is still going on.  Despite the work the secretariat and others have put into this, I find it very disingenuous of Westmeath County Council that it has not even responded to the committee.<\/p><p>It will have to answer for the likes of that as well when it comes in.

The updated recommendation as of 19 November 2021 is that, first, permission be sought for Mrs. Koster to borrow the response of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications for comment and, second, that this petition be raised with Department of Education as the petitioner specifically mentioned schools in her response.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Our fourth petition is P000019\/21, submitted by Mr. Cormac McKay, on banning all fossil fuel and hybrid vehicles advertising on all Irish media.

Agreed.  <\/p> <p>  Our fifth and sixth petitions are P000034\/21 and P000037\/21 propose that foreign-trained doctors conduct the pre-registration examination system, PRES, 3 exam or give an exemption.
