The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  I ask members and all in attendance to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19.  I strongly advise that one vacant seat be left between those attending the meeting physically, that hand sanitisers be used and that appropriate social distancing be maintained during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn, except when speaking.  I ask people to co-operate with these measures.<\/p> <p>  Members participating remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from the Department of Transport to examine the appropriation account for Vote 31, chapter 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's accounts re expenditure on night vision imaging technology and training for search and rescue and the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report 113 on procurement of vehicles by the Irish Coast Guard.  The 2020 motor tax account is also on the agenda, and other areas of interest to the committee include expenditure on MetroLink, DART, BusConnects, and the all-Ireland strategic rail review.  After lunch we will consider correspondence and other business of the committee.<\/p> <p>  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department of Transport: Mr. Ken Spratt, Secretary General; Ms Deirdre O&rsquo;Keeffe, assistant secretary; Mr. Fintan Towey, assistant secretary; Mr. Eugene Clonan, acting director, Irish Coast Guard; Mr. Garret Doocey, principal officer; and Mr. Dominic Mullaney, principal adviser.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Ms Niamh Callaghan, principal officer, Transport Vote section, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  Everyone is welcome.  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up background noise or feedback and, as usual, I remind all those attending to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off. <\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references speakers may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the precincts of Leinster House is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside Leinster House's precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as those physically present.  Witnesses have already been advised of this and may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time that he or she contributes.<\/p> <p>  I call the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#A00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636623000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The appropriation account for Vote 31 records gross expenditure of &euro;2.7 billion in 2020.  This represented an increase of 17.4% compared to expenditure in 2019.  The expenditure is divided into three expenditure programmes: civil aviation; land transport; and maritime transport and safety.  The majority of the expenditure in 2020 was under programme B, land transport, which accounted for 95% of the gross spending amount.  This comprised mainly investment in roads and on road safety and regulation, and current and capital spending on public transport.  As I proposed previously, given the imbalance in programme size, it may be timely for the Department, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to consider splitting up programme B in future.<\/p> <p>  In 2020, the Department provided substantial funding to several public bodies operating under its aegis.  These include: Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII; the National Transport Authority, NTA; the Road Safety Authority, RSA; the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS; and some other smaller bodies.  The Department also oversees several commercial State bodies, such as the CI&Eacute; group, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA and the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA. <\/p> <p>  Receipts into the Transport Vote are modest, with appropriations-in-aid in 2020 amounting to &euro;17.8 million.  There was a substantial underspend on the Vote for 2020, of just under &euro;386 million.  Much of this related to the impact of Covid-19 on normal schemes and projects, but underspending also occurred because additional financial provision made for Covid-19 was not required on the scale originally envisaged.<\/p> <p>  With agreement from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;151.5 million in unspent capital allocations was carried over for spending in 2021.  This related mainly to capital spending shortfalls under the subheads for: airports; regional and local roads stimulus; heavy rail safety and development; public transport infrastructure; cycling and walking; and greenways.  The remainder of the surplus for the year, &euro;234.4 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account.   <\/p> <p>  Members may wish to note that the statement on internal financial controls discloses non-compliant procurement by the Department of &euro;1.1 million worth of goods and services.<\/p> <p>  In addition to its Vote-funded activities, the Department of Transport has responsibility for the motor tax collection system.  Receipts of motor tax are accounted for in a special departmental account, separate from the Vote, and are transferred directly to the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  The 2020 motor tax account prepared by the Department records receipts of &euro;939 million.  This was down 2.5% on the 2019 level.   <\/p> <p>  I also issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the motor tax account 2020.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Coast Guard, ICG, is organisationally part of the Department of Transport, and its expenditure is directly charged on the Vote.  I have presented reports on two matters relating to the operations of the Coast Guard, arising from audit work on the 2019 and 2020 appropriation accounts.  One report relates to the helicopter search and rescue, SAR, service, which is contracted out to private sector providers, at an annual cost of around &euro;60 million.  The other report relates to procurement for the cliff rescue service, which is provided substantially by volunteer service members.<\/p> <p>  As I outline in chapter 5 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2020, the Department paid &euro;4.305 million to the search and rescue service provider in 2013 to fund an upgrade of the five search and rescue helicopters then in use to equip them with night vision technology.  In addition, in November 2015, the Department bought 24 sets of night vision goggles for &euro;527,000.  In November 2018, the Department made an initial payment of &euro;1.714 million for the provision of training in the use of the night vision technology.  That training commenced in November 2019 and it is still ongoing.  As at June 2021, only one of the four Coast Guard search and rescue bases had been approved to operate the technology and to provide a night-vision enabled service.  It will be some time before the other three search and rescue bases are operating in the same way.<\/p><p>On the basis that significant payments were made as long ago as 2013, and that the planned capability has not yet been delivered across the service, I am not persuaded that good value for money has been achieved from this expenditure.<\/p><p> In the special report, I deal with the procurement of vehicles by the Irish Coast Guard for use by the cliff rescue teams.  The Department signed a contract in November 2015 for the supply and fit-out of a number of vans to carry crew members and equipment.  Between 2016 and 2020, the Department purchased 18 vans, costing almost &euro;1.4 million, under this contract.  The average all-in cost was around &euro;76,500 per vehicle.<\/p><p> The examination found that the vehicle requirements had not been adequately set out in advance of the procurement process.  There were also major gaps in the Department&rsquo;s records of the tendering process, in particular in relation to the evaluation of bids.  As a result, we found there is no reasonable basis to conclude that the Department conducted a fair and impartial procurement process for the vehicles.<\/p><p> This report makes four recommendations aimed at strengthening the Department&rsquo;s procurement procedures for the future.  These are that a strategic plan for equipment requirements be developed; that all procurements of equipment should involve technical and user input at the planning stage; that all significant procurements be based on a formal assessment of operational needs; and that the Department carry out regular reviews of its procurement procedures and processes.  I am glad to report that the recommendations have been accepted by the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

The tourism and sport functions were transferred out of it, and its remit is now focused solely on transport.  Three programmes remained - civil aviation; land transport; and maritime transport and safety.  The onset of the Covid-19 crisis in March 2020, along with the transfer of functions, necessitated the publication of a further set of Revised Estimates in 2020.  The appropriation account for 2020 reflects this set of Estimates.  The Department&rsquo;s net allocation in the further Revised Estimates for 2020 was, to round, &euro;3.0285 billion, comprising &euro;1.981 billion in capital and &euro;1.047 billion current expenditure.<br\/><br\/>The allocation of capital was primarily directed towards the core capital programme, with an additional allocation of &euro;113.25 million for the July stimulus.  Current expenditure supported existing services, with a substantial in-year increase of &euro;492.55 million in funding compared to the start-of-the-year position to address pressures caused by the Covid-19 crisis with &euro;2 million related to July stimulus funding.  As it transpired, not all of the emergency funding was required in 2020, which was a significant contributory factor in the surrender to the Exchequer of &euro;176 million in current expenditure funds at the year&rsquo;s end.<br\/><br\/>I would like the committee to note that, taking on board the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General at the Public Accounts hearing in May 2021, concerning the splitting of the land transport programme in the interests of transparency and better reporting, I can confirm that this has now been completed for 2022, creating three new programmes: programme A &ndash; sustainable mobility, covering active travel and greenways; programme B &ndash; sustainable mobility, covering public transport; and programme C &ndash; road networks and road safety.<br\/><br\/>The high-level goal for aviation in 2020 was to &ldquo;maximise air transport connectivity with a safe, competitive, cost-effective and sustainable aviation sector&rdquo;<i>.  <\/i>The programme was allocated &euro;41.865 million in current expenditure and &euro;10.7 million in capital in the aviation sector.  This financed public service obligations for the regional airports, as well as capital investment in aviation safety and security projects.  The programme included &euro;15 million in contingency to support the travellers&rsquo; protection fund.  This fund, administered by the Commission for Aviation Regulation, is in place to meet any legal obligations arising regarding customers requiring repatriation or reimbursement in the event of a travel or tour operator failure.<br\/><br\/>For land transport, our goal in 2020 was to &ldquo;service the needs of society and the economy through safe, sustainable and competitive transport networks and services.&rdquo;. <i><\/i>In this regard, we are responsible for the corporate governance of the two leading planning and investment agencies, namely Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Transport Authority.  A sum of &euro;1.963 billion in capital was allocated to progress the core capital programme and also to provide additional Covid relief measures and a near-term economic stimulus.  A sum of &euro;917.062 million was allocated in current expenditure, primarily to support PSO-funded services.  Of this allocation, &euro;460 million was related to emergency PSO funding for non-commercial and commercial transport services.  <br\/><br\/>Major construction developments in 2020 included the commencement of construction of the national train control centre, the Ballyvourney&ndash;Macroom development on the N22, the Dunkettle interchange, the opening of the N25 New Ross bypass in Wexford, and the completion of the N7 Naas road-widening project in Kildare.  In addition, the development of the Dublin megaprojects preliminary business cases continued, along with construction of key national roads, the N5 from Westport to Turlough, the N56 from Dungloe to Glenties, and the N4 from Collooney to Castlebaldwin, despite severe disruption caused by the Covid-19 crisis.<br\/><br\/>Prior to the onset of Covid-19, public transport bus and rail services had effectively reached capacity.  Year-on-year increases in fare revenue meant that PSO funding requirements were relatively stable.  Public health measures introduced in March 2020 led to public transport capacity limits of 25% of normal capacity.  Mid-year forecasts from the National Transport Authority, NTA, in a situation of a high degree of uncertainty, indicated that an additional &euro;460 million may be required in subvention to address the shortfall.  A portion of this funding was also utilised to fund a series of short-term contracts to support commercial public transport operators, which were also severely impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.<br\/><br\/>Under the maritime programme, our 2020 goal was to &ldquo;facilitate safe and sustainable maritime transport and the delivery of emergency management services&rdquo;.<i><\/i>Of the &euro;110.667 million comprising the current allocation to the maritime sector, &euro;76.877 million supported Coast Guard services.  Of the latter, &euro;62.515 million was allocated to the Coast Guard search and rescue service delivered by CHC.  A budget allocation of &euro;5.659 million was invested by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, which is responsible for maintaining marine navigation systems in Irish waters.  In addition, &euro;15 million was allocated as contingency to support certain key commercial ferry services as a result of financial stresses caused by the impact of Covid-19 and related public health measures.  A sum of &euro;6.42 million in capital was allocated to support investment in Coast Guard building and assets and in the Commissioners of Irish Lights.<br\/><br\/>I note the committee&rsquo;s interest in discussing a number of specific projects today, including BusConnects, DART+ and MetroLink.  I expect the preliminary business cases for the three Dublin megaprojects to go to the Government shortly.  I also note the committee&rsquo;s interest in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report into the procurement of Coast Guard vehicles.  On the latter, I share the Comptroller and Auditor&rsquo;s concern as to its findings.  Prior to publication of the report, or even to its genesis, the Department had been in the process of strengthening its corporate governance in the area of procurement.  This has involved aligning the Department&rsquo;s procurement activities with Office of Government Procurement guidance on procurement.  Since the end of 2019, a procurement officer has been in place within the Department and has provided valuable support in ensuring that new procurements are conducted in accordance with all legal and administrative arrangements to ensure that the correct processes are followed.<br\/><br\/>The Department has strengthened its analytical tools in procurement analysis and will be further strengthening the corporate monitoring of procurement activity in 2022 and beyond, as we move towards multi-annual procurement planning and forecasting.  The rising number of 40\/02 declarations in the accounts in the past three years is a direct result of the monitoring, compliance, awareness and education frameworks we are implementing and are continuing to build on, as we seek to ensure that the smallest procurements are treated with the same rigour, thoroughness and attention to detail as larger procurements.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Spratt"},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The lead speaker from the committee today is Deputy Dillon, who has 15 minutes.

First, there is the funding that TII provides for national roads, which ultimately comes from the Department but which is managed by TII in conjunction with the councils.  Second, there is the funding for regional and local roads.  This is administered directly by the Department and issued by the Minister every year.  Approximately 90% of the funding for regional and local roads is dedicated to protection and renewal whereas the split for TII-funded roads, including national roads, in 2020 was quite different.  Perhaps half of this money went on protection and renewal while the other half went on new works.  Decisions on projects are made in conjunction with the Department when a national development plan is being drawn up and major projects are being looked at.  As time goes on, projects are prioritised as they go through the various stages of the public spending code.  If other factors need to be taken into account, such as access to a port or a location being on a Trans-European Transport Network, TEN-T, route, which are core European routes, certain commitments may be made.  Such commitments have been made in respect of Foynes and Ringaskiddy.  Those roads have to be done by 2030.  These factors are all taken into account.

Councils put their own resources into local roads.  It is not only Exchequer money that goes into them.  The problem is that a council that puts very little of its own resources into its roads will have roads in worse condition than a council that puts a lot in and we would therefore essentially be penalising the counties that have provided funding themselves because, if allocations were to be based on condition, the next time a condition survey is done, these councils would do less well.  Councils who did not spend the money effectively would also be rewarded for doing so.  We have therefore come to the conclusion that the fairest way to make allocations is to do so based on road length.  Because there is a backlog, all of the councils need these moneys.  There is no danger that we are giving them too much.  That is essentially how it is done.

It was revised as a result of some pretty bad experiences with some pretty big capital projects.  We have a number of decision gates, starting with decision gate 0, a strategic assessment report.  We would then move into the preliminary business case, which is subject to an external review.  We then move to full cost-benefit analysis in order to proceed to tender, and again that is subject to an external review.  Only then would we go with another second full cost-benefit analysis prior to the awarding of contract.<\/p> <p>  That is important in ensuring that when we are spending billions of euro of taxpayers' money in this case, we get our decisions right.  This public spending code and process guards against cost escalation.  It is really important that we go through those processes and find ourselves explaining our approach on this side of procurements rather than on the other side of procurements, when we could be in much trickier positions after public spending on capital projects go wrong.  This code is really important and it has been welcomed by Secretaries General and Government officials.  It guards against cost escalation by ensuring we have really high standards when it comes to business cases.  It also ensures we have persistent challenge throughout projects and independent and rigorous challenge right throughout projects.<\/p> <p>  There is a really strong focus in the public spending code on governance and delivery.  Therefore, we are able to emphasise front-end decision making and really get the cost estimation and benefit projection right.  We are able to get delivery schedules right.  This is why I am emphasising the point.  The delivery schedule and procurement strategy are really important.  If we get cost estimations, benefit projections, delivery schedule and the procurement strategy right, we will not have implementation difficulties or requests for extra tens or hundreds of millions of euro or even billions of euro.  Ultimately, we will not have failure.  It is really important for me to set that out.<\/p> <p>  On the scheduling, we are still in the early stages for MetroLink.  We are at the preliminary business case stage.  That has been received by us and we are reviewing it, as required under the public spending code.

Other than that, we have no other dates.  I repeat the question.  Perhaps there is a reluctance to be tied down to dates.  Perhaps there are no dates at all.  However, it is important that those dates are made public, so that we can keep track of delays.  I refer back to the 2018 statements which announced the former Metro North.  They were clear.  They said that 2018 was the date for the emerging preferred routed; 2019 was the date for the railway order; 2020 was the date for the granting of the railway order; 2021 was the date for construction to commence; 2027 was the date by which the metro was to be in operation.

However, we have learned from projects that have gone badly wrong that if one gets the delivery schedule wrong, they will ultimately come back looking for extra time and more money.  Potentially projects could fail.  We have some significant examples of that occurring where inaccurate delivery schedules were given.

It speaks to the Deputy's own points that he raised generally in his contribution on the frustrations around the timeline.  It also speaks to Mr. Spratt&rsquo;s points around what the public spending code and the revised public spending code are seeking to guard against.  There were huge, phenomenal responses to both of the emerging preparatory consultation back in 2018 and 2019.  They raised complex issues about design, local community engagement, etc.  They required a considerable amount of time to reflect upon and revise for the design and route at that time.  They changed considerably, as we are all aware, from the emerging preferred route to the preferred route.  Clearly, in retrospect, those dates were not feasible.  They were missed, if the Deputy wants to put it that way.<\/p> <p>  Details in the case of the revised public spending code rose in December 2019, as Mr. Spratt introduced and spoke about.  That seeks through its decision gate mechanism to ensure that we get a lot better, again as Mr. Spratt mentioned, about ensuring that we are making the right calls at the right time.  The timings are fundamental.  The Deputy acknowledged that when he said they were hugely significant.  Decision gate 1 is imminent.  That will allow the project to move into the planning system.  That will be a massive step forward for this project.  Once it is in the planning system, there is no fixed date around the time that it needs to come out of the planning system.  It will need to get past decision gate 3 at the end of that approval to proceed.  At that decision gate, that will be the time we go to Government and set out the exact details, such as what we think budgetary envelope for the project will be at that particular time, taking into account the changes that may be required in the planning process, the delivery schedule, and also the benefits realisation.  At that point, then, measurement will start about whether we are on track or off track in the construction phase.  <\/p> <p>  Clearly, now, the real focus on a departmental level is to complete a review of the preliminary business case.  At a project level, there are still outstanding issues.  This is a huge, massive, complex project.  It is likely the largest ever public investment project in the history of the State.  There are still issues at a project level about closing out the necessary planning and environmental documentation to allow them to be ready to enter the planning system.  There is, therefore, a massive emphasis and focus on a departmental level and at an agency level to get this through decision gate 1 and into the planning system.

It would be vital, if at all possible, that we would hear from it on this issue.<\/p> <p>  I will be brief.  As is usual on a Thursday there are sometimes conflicting diary requirements.  I want to seek reassurances in respect of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report 113 on procurement to vehicles by the Irish Coast Guard, that there is a clear matching up between the four recommendations that are aimed at strengthening.  I am quoting from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report that they are aimed, &ldquo;at strengthening the Department&rsquo;s procurement procedures for the future&rdquo;.  Can we be assured of the following for each of the recommendations for the strategic plan for equipment requirement: that all procurements of equipment should involve technical and user input at the planning stage; that all significant procurements should be based on formal assessment of operational needs; and that the Department would carry out regular reviews of its procurement procedures and processes?  I want a short reassurance from the Secretary General that that is all now under way.  The Secretary General states that the Department has strengthened its analytical tools for procurement analysis.  I remain to be assured that we have a robust and fit-for-purpose system.  Can the Secretary General give us those assurances?  That is my first question.<\/p> <p>  I will ask three questions specifically and then I will take my leave.  The second question is about national secondary routes.<\/p><p> Major construction projects begun in 2020 are under way.  I believe strongly that there is a need for a policy intervention by the Department in respect of those national secondary routes that are in a deplorable state, such as the N73, in such a way that would ensure that TII, funds projects like that relating to the Mallow to Mitchelstown road.  The latter is, arguably, one of the worst national secondary routes in the country, even though it is a vital artery for commercial and domestic traffic in the north Cork area and a vital route between Kerry and Dublin.  I continue to make the case for funding for this road.  I ask that the N73 project remain on the agenda, and I make no bones about raising the matter at this forum.<\/p><p> On the Leap card, the Secretary General informed us that \"Year-on-year increases in fare revenue meant that PSO funding requirements were relatively stable.\"  I am seeking to expand Leap card services in my county of Cork, specifically on routes between Mallow and Cork, where there a massive number of commuters on a daily basis and where there is still not a Leap card service, even though it could be argued that it is a viable route.  I can travel from Bray to Pearse Station using a Leap card, but I cannot go from Mallow to Cork.  There is an inequality between services on the eastern seaboard and those in the regions.  I ask that, as a policy, the Department looks at the roll-out of Leap card services for the towns that service big cities, such as Cork.  It is vitally important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#E01600","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636623000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I can give Deputy Sherlock that assurance in a word, \"Yes\".  If he does not mind, I will expand a little on that.  I accept that our procurement processes were in need of tightening.  There is no doubt about that.  As I mentioned in the appropriation account, the Department carried out a procurement gap analysis in 2019.  We identified several recommendations for enhancements around procurement.  That report included a comprehensive suite of recommendations covering the appointment and functions of a procurement officer, in addition to corporate governance matters, measuring and monitoring compliance, communications, training requirements and corporate governance of agencies as regards procurement.  Deputy Sherlock will be delighted to hear that we appointed a procurement officer in 2020, as was recommended.  Enhanced corporate governance, and improved measuring and monitoring of compliance and training, are being implemented.<\/p> <p>  As a relatively new Secretary General, this is something I am very focused on.  I expect that we will learn some lessons from much of our seeking out, and the 100% review, where we now look at every procurement.  I expect we will find some things when we do that review but, once we are through all of that, we will be a lot more fit for purpose and a lot cleaner than we are at the moment.  A lot of very good work has been done over the past 18 months to two years.  There is more work to be done, but we are making very good improvements in that area.<\/p> <p>  On national secondary routes, the state of the N73 and the need for it to be improved, we have processes around prioritisation for new roads and for protection and renewal, which includes safety works and minor projects.  For new roads, the prioritisation processes include TII and NTA recommendations.  We also look at Government objectives under the national planning framework and the national development plan, current Department priorities, levels of congestion, the possibility of releasing space in towns for active travel, projects that improve access to public transport facilities and the general rationale set out in our national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI, which is our transport investment strategy.  That has a number of priorities, including a mobile hierarchy and investment hierarchy.<\/p> <p>  I know the Deputy is specifically interested in protection and renewal.  For protection and renewal, and any minor projects, we monitor those problems the Deputy and others have highlighted at our quarterly monitoring meeting with TII.  If there are serious issues that need to be addressed, we try to raise them at that meeting.  At the periodic meeting of the TII board - it may be quarterly or more often than that - it is decided what funding will be provided.  The Deputy mentioned the N73.  We will look at it, as he asked, and we will see where it fits in the greater scheme of things.<\/p> <p>  On the Leap card, we are very keen to encourage modal shift with our decarbonisation agenda.  That is not just in the cities, but in regional and rural areas.  Due to our ambition regarding decarbonisation, we have a big job of work to do in shifting people out of cars and onto public transport.  We have plans to increase our current public service obligation funding for regional and rural bus services.  It is something we will be very focused on over the next couple of years.  I accept the point the Deputy made regarding the Leap card.  It is something we have to sort out.  We have to make it easier for people to use public transport services, not only by making the services available but by having them available when people want them, having more services and also having ease-of-use of those services.  The greater and wider use of Leap cards throughout the country is something I am very mindful of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Spratt"},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome.

I am thankful for it.  It is good to have the Secretary General, Mr. Spratt, before the committee.  The Department he is in charge of and controls an astronomical budget in terms of the capital projects it is working on.  I have worked closely with him as a member of the Joint Committee on Transport.  We have, in recent days, seen project delays raise their ugly heads again.  As a young parliamentarian, I am anxious to see progress being made on future development and trying to help to diversify our transport infrastructure in Ireland and install a more climate friendly transport infrastructure in both urban and rural areas.  I am very concerned, to be straight with Mr. Spratt, because the amount of time it takes to build projects in Ireland is not right.  Something is amiss.  Public confidence is important for all of us elected representatives and Members of the Oireachtas.  We represent our constituencies.  When I talk to ordinary members of the public on the ground, they have lost all confidence in the Department for Transport's ability to build major infrastructural projects.  Things like the metro have not helped.  That is an issue the Department needs to tackle urgently.  I am not trying to throw anyone under a bus but that is the reality of how the people of Ireland view the progress that is being made in the Department of Transport.  We are facing an unprecedented emergency for our climate.  We must get more people onto public transport.  We urgently need the development of public transport infrastructure and the fact that we are now in 2021 without an underground metro system in our capital city, a primate city which has more than 1 million living in it, is completely and utterly unacceptable.  That is not the direct responsibility of the witnesses before the committee today.  Many of their predecessors had a role to play in that absence, as had other elected officials.  It is important for me to set the context for some of my questions.<\/p><p>Surely one of the witnesses is in a position to answer this question.

We as civil servants have to comply with the law of the land and public procurement rules.  We have to appear before Oireachtas committees, including this one, and give them assurances that we have done our best to maximise value for money.  We have a public spending code, which was introduced as a result of major capital projects going wrong.

Therefore, the tender document went out with provision of the service as the thing and, as an option, with NVIS.  Why are we going for NVIS?  The benefit of night vision capability for the Coast Guard is that it enhances operational effectiveness and safety.  That is why we are seeking NVIS.  We looked at implementing NVIS on a phased basis, based on the tender proposal to put it in after the service was started.  We did that and, in 2013, we modified the helicopters.  Each of those helicopters cost in the region of &euro;40 million to &euro;45 million.  For each to be modified cost just under &euro;1 million.

In 2011, the Government decided not to proceed with what was then Metro North.  That was the end of that project.  In 2015, an analysis was conducted.  The Fingal\/North Dublin Transport Study was published.  It concluded that there is a need for a metro solution in the north Dublin and Fingal area.  That analysis fed into the greater Dublin area transport strategy, which was published in 2016, which reiterated that there was a need for a metro.  It also concluded that there was a need for a metro on the south side of the city along the Luas green line.  That project became MetroLink.  Since 2018, expenditure on that project has been classed as MetroLink.  Since then, as the exchanges with Deputy McAuliffe earlier indicated, there was the emerging preferred route consultation.  There was substantial public response to that, including from public representatives and local communities.  There was a further public consultation on the preferred route and changes were made between those two consultation periods in response to the issues raised by public representatives and local communities.<\/p> <p>  Since the conclusion of the preferred route public consultation, that project has been brought forward for much more detailed planning, design and environmental preparation for the planning application.  I apologise if the Deputy heard this earlier.  The focus in the Department is to complete our review of the preliminary business case.  That case was submitted to us this year for the first time.  We are awaiting a revised draft.  We will then complete our review with the ambition to allow our Minister to bring it to Government as soon as possible.

As a result, the first base is up and running in Sligo.  Personnel at the remaining bases are still in training.  To get to the next step, which is SAR approval, CHC needs approval under manuals and training schedules.

As they know, this is the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is all about value for money for us.  I want to point out to Mr. Spratt that I sat in on a meeting of the Committee on Transport and Communications for my colleague last week.  Representatives from TII and the NTA were before the committee.  I suggested to Nigel O'Neill of TII that there is an issue with toll barriers because we pay in excess of &euro;600 million per year for exceeding nitrogen oxide, NOx, emissions above what is allowed under EU rules.  I was astounded to hear Mr. O'Neill respond that the barriers at Dublin Port Tunnel are there for traffic management and control.  I advised him that I have been all over Europe and many parts of the world and that I have never seen a toll barrier used to control traffic in a tunnel.  I ask that this be revised.  I am sure Mr. O'Neill has gone back and had a conversation about it.  I calculate that it is costing the transport industry &euro;92 million per year for toll barriers in this country.  That is what it is costing to stop and expend a litre of fuel and that is just in money.  I do not have the measure of what it is costing in lung health and health issues that NOx emissions contribute to but I am sure the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, does.  I would like the Department to come back to the committee and let us know what it is going to do about the situation and what actions it will take because the EPA has provided a report which states that we are exceeding our NOx emissions and that those emissions are primarily caused by transport.  That is primarily what we are being fined for and these are the targets we are setting.  I am not aware of anything the Department has provided to the sector as an incentive to be cleaner and greener.  I ask the Department to submit that information.<\/p><p>Peter Walsh from TII also appeared before the Committee on Transport and Communications.  There is a major issue at Rosslare Europort.  Mr. Spratt will be aware that there has been a 400% increase in traffic there because of Brexit.  The Government has spent &euro;11 million, through the Office of Public Works, OPW, providing a state-of-the-art facility for our regulatory agencies, facilities that one could only have dreamed of years ago.  I am not sure what the acreage is but it is substantial.  It is empty all of the time while our hauliers have drivers <i>in situ<\/i>in lay-bys trying to comply with tachograph rules and trying to find somewhere to park if the ship is late, which happens with the weather at this time of year.  The biggest sufferance is for the residents.  They have refrigerated vehicles running outside their doors because these trucks have nowhere to park.  We have spent &euro;11 million on a yard that is at least 85% empty.  I propose that it needs to be adapted to accommodate the traffic which the NTA and TII are responsible for accommodating.<\/p><p>Nothing has been done.  I invited Mr. Walsh to come Rosslare to meet the local county councillors and garda&iacute; and put a traffic management plan in place.  There is a serious road safety issue.  We should not waste the taxpayers money; rather, we should utilise it to the best of our ability.  There is no need for more facilities.  At most we might need to erect a fence but I do not even see the need for that.  We have customs agents in control in the facility itself.  The facilities are there for the drivers when they have to go through the regulation process, including toilet facilities.  We need to start to think with the taxpayer in mind and I ask that Mr. Spratt would take charge of that because Mr. Walsh was not forthcoming about travelling down to meet the elected representatives in Rosslare, myself included, who are tasked with looking after the area.<\/p><p>I have written to both last week and I will send on the correspondence.<\/p><p> The other point I would like to mention is that the funding granted for regional airports was &euro;90 million.  What funding is available to Waterford Airport and the south east from that funding?<\/p><p> Waterford Airport is also home to the Coast Guard Sikorsky rescue helicopter R117.  Given the increase in traffic at Rosslare Europort, it now takes on a whole new level of importance given that it is based in that area and in light of the amount of time a helicopter might need to travel as a result of the increased capacity of direct routes from Rosslare to France.  Mr. Clonan, in particular, might let me know if he agrees with that.  There must be a special place for this service now in Waterford Airport.  I visited there during the recess and I am very concerned on two levels.  The helicopter is housed at the behest of Waterford Regional Airport.  The Coast Guard is basically renting a hangar to house the helicopter.  I accept An Bord Plean&aacute;la has not decided on the application.  Funding was committed by the Department for an extension of the runway, but if the airport is closed, will the commitment still hold?  How much is the funding?  Could the witnesses assure the people in the south-east region, and those who traverse the high seas, that there will be no interference or diminution of the Coast Guard service in the south-east region at Waterford Airport?

This is insane.  This happened on the N11 where we spent more than &euro;2 million on planning for the 33 km that is left to be made a motorway.  This cycle must be broken.  A decision must be made on how we are accountable for taxpayers' money.  On top of that, I am being told that an airport of regional importance that houses the Coast Guard is not viable for the south-east region of more than 600,000 people.  If it is different, I hope Mr. Spratt will write to me and tell me that is the case.  The population is now on the rise due to the increase in traffic at Rosslare Europort.

I wish to focus in on the Coast Guard with Mr. Clonan.  I note from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that 18, I think, vehicles were purchased.  There were issues with procurement but I have heard what the Secretary General has said in that regard on reform around procurement, which is welcome.  An issue I raised last May, of which Mr. Clonan might be aware, was one brought to my attention by members and volunteers from the Coast Guard about the use of the vehicles.  He gave me a response at the time saying there are rules around the use of those vehicles.  However, what I was saying at the time was that if members were allowed bring them to their homes it could increase response times.  The reports I had at the time were members were leaving their home, going to the base, collecting the vehicle and then going to the scene.  Mr. Clonan said correctly that not all members had to go to base.  They could leave the vehicles at home.  Has there been any progress on that?  Given my limited time, he might send a note on that if he cannot come back to me immediately after this.<\/p> <p>  My second question is for Mr. Spratt and concerns an area of great interest to me, namely, planning for major incidents, be they regional or national and relating to rail, road, sea or air.  How frequently are the emergency services and other agencies engaged in training in these areas?  I mention also co-ordination between local authorities.  I am aware of one local authority where its disaster communications centre needs to be relocated from its main building.  The officials cannot hypothesise about various incidents but given the potential scale of one of these incidents, how prepared are we as a State to deal with such incidents?

On a national level, I have a very significant problem with TII's annual allocations.  In terms of grant allocations for 2021 for national road budgets, page three of the documentation indicates that &euro;484,256,450 is the gross allocation for national road maintenance.  The document provides an individual breakdown for projects that will be receiving funding which is excellent in that it enables public representatives to explain to their constituents what is happening in their constituencies.  One of these projects, the N73, happens to fall into my constituency in Cork East and I raised it with Mr. Walsh of the TII at a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications last week.  I have a very significant problem.  A  sum of &euro;86.99 million was allocated to Cork County Council, of which &euro;1.5 million was allocated in the 2021 budget to progress upgrade works on the N73 near Kildorrery between Mallow and Mitchelstown but when we hit September, the funding disappeared.  I want to know where it is gone and I want to know why the &euro;1.5 million is not available.  These are questions I asked last week but having looked back at the clip, I did not really get the certainty I want.  Perhaps the witnesses could correspond with me on this after the meeting but if they can answer me now, all the better.  I want to know why the &euro;1.5 million of the annual funding for Cork County Council of &euro;86.99 million for national road maintenance in 2021 is not available.  Why was Cork County Council told it cannot progress after TII, as the agency under the remit of the Department of Transport, told it to advance the process as far as tendering?<\/p> <p>  This is completely unacceptable.  We cannot have State agencies providing funding budgets and then not carrying out the work.  It does not give us clarity and makes us, as elected representatives irrespective of party, particularly those of us who are in government, look bad.  I do not blame people for giving out.  This is something that needs to be fine tuned.  I am aware that the funding has been allocated for next year but it still must be approved by the board of TII, which is expected to happen in the second week of December.  Before that happens, I want the Secretary General and the relevant official in his Department, whether that be a principal officer or an assistant secretary in charge of roads funding, to have a word with TII about this because it is completely unacceptable.  This has to be fine tuned.  We cannot have a situation where we are telling local authorities to advance national road plans and then not funding them at the final minute.

Much of that traffic comes down the N80 from the west through Mountmellick.  In fact, it passes within 150 yd of my house, along a new road, and that is welcome.  The town of Mountmellick was promised that a bypass inner relief road would be built in 2004 or 2005.  The proposals that were put forward would have meant it cutting through the car park of a business and community facilities and it was rejected because of that.  A feasibility study has been conducted by the county council in conjunction with the Department, which cost in the region of &euro;100,000, and it has set out a route for the bypass.<\/p> <p>  Will the Department revert to the committee on efforts to advance that project?  It is of strategic importance.  There is a T-junction in the centre of the town and articulated trucks have to cross to the far side of the road to get around it.  It is dangerous and it chokes up the town centre.  It would shorten journeys if the inner relief road were built, although it would involve a crossing of the River Owenass.  I have not seen any progress in recent years but the feasibility study has been completed.  It is not mentioned in the national development plan or any funding stream.  Will the Department revert to me on whether there are plans to advance it over the next three or four years?<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for joining us and the staff at the Department and the Irish Coast Guard for their work in preparing for the meeting.

This response arises from an enquiry we made following consideration of a previous item of correspondence from the T&aacute;naiste on this issue.  The committee requested clarity as to the specific analysis that has been undertaken in respect of growing energy demand due to data centre investments.  The Secretary General states such analysis has been undertaken by bodies responsible for the management and regulation of our electricity market, namely, EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, and provides hyperlinks to those analyses.  Also provided is the Government statement on the role of data centres in Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise strategy.

Detailed information is provided in regard to the contractual provisions regarding inflation.  Essentially, the new children&rsquo;s hospital construction contract permits the contractor to recover the cost of tender inflation in excess of 4%, and this provision came into effect in August 2019.  The inflation payment from the State to the main contractor, including VAT, for the period August to December 2019 was &euro;1.6 million, and a further &euro;1.5 million was paid out for the period of January to December 2020.<\/p><p> On the lessons learned from the planning phase of the project in terms of the procurement process, the contract and related controls, the chief officer states that the form of contract used was the standard Office of Government Procurement public works contract for employer design, with some elements of the works contract modified to meet the two-stage procurement requirements of the project.  He also states that the process was overseen by a third party.  The chief officer goes on to state that, in regard to lessons learned from the procurement process and the public works contract, the PwC report sets out two recommendations regarding future large capital projects for which Government Departments are responsible.  No information is provided on whether the procurement process used was, in hindsight, the most appropriate to deliver value for money for the State, or whether any lessons have been learned from a project for which the costs have significantly escalated, and one for which, despite the best efforts of this committee, we do not know the final cost or date of completion.<\/p><p> This has been flagged by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Imelda Munster, and by myself.

We need to look for more up-to-date information, up to the end of 2021, in regard to inflation and projected inflation.  We know that 4% is the threshold and there is a problem once it goes beyond that.  Has forecasting been undertaken in the context of further rises in inflation and are there projections for 2022?  One of the reasons this has overrun in time is because the contractor did not provide sufficient staff on the site, and it was done on a month-by-month basis in the early stages and deadlines were missed.  That is something we addressed when the hospital board were in here and it is acknowledged that it was a problem.  Can we ask them about the number of staff or the number of people who are actually on-site, and if the targets are still being missed or whether that has improved?  The longer this goes on, the bigger the risk in regard to inflation, particularly now that we are in a time of increased inflation, in particular construction inflation.  Can we seek an update on the contractor claims?  Members might recall that some of them were at a mediation stage.  We also need to know if the moratorium on the High Court actions is still in place.  Those would be my main asks in regard to what we should go back and seek.<\/p> <p>  It is incredibly difficult to deal with this when we have not been given the report that was done in that we are trying to anticipate things without having the firm ground of responding to the findings in that report.

With regard to the contract, it is set out that, to date, 135 of 170 contractor design packages have been approved, and that information is given under the list of design changes.  A figure was mentioned at one stage of up to 700 potentially, as I recall, and a figure of 400 was given for those they were supposed to be working through.  What I want to analyse from that is where the discrepancy is between the figures we were given here by the board, when they were in last year, and the figures that are there now.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the project, it is said the procurement process for the contract commenced in 2015 and the form of contract used was a standard Office of Government Procurement public works contract for employer design, with some elements of the work contract modified to meet a two-stage procurement process.  That does not tell us an awful lot.  It is a long-winded description but it does not tell us exactly how that works.  It states the evaluation of the tender submission was carried out using the most economically advantageous tender criteria in line with the Office of Government Procurement's capital works framework and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board&rsquo;s tender evaluation procedures.  It was to be overseen by an independent third party and, presumably, they brought in a consultancy firm to oversee that.  We need more information about the two-stage nature of that contract.  It is obviously one of the things that allowed for the potential for a huge price increase in terms of the overall cost.  We should ask them about point 3 in their letter, which caught my eye yesterday when I was reading it.  While they give a long-winded description, it does not really tell us anything and it is just a form of words.  They should explain why that is.  In addition, this two-stage procurement process is left very much open-ended in terms of price for the second stage.  Where has that model been used before?<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Murphy said, we are left second-guessing much of this because we do not have the report and we do not have the timeline.  In the absence of clear information, it would appear the second phase was left very much open-ended in terms of cost and the price increases that could happen.

I note that today EUROSTAT has indicated that Irish price inflation is set to breach 5% for the first time since the financial crash.  Obviously, that is having a big impact on many things but it could also have a big impact on the Exchequer in regard to this project, which is already seeing the inflated costs which we have dealt with in detail.  It is crucial that we get a breakdown from the Department on whether there will be a significant increase in cost as a result of that inflation rate.

The very least we would want to do is learn some lessons from the mistakes of the past.  The Chair has made a point about the two-stage process.  This was really where a large amount of the extra expenditure arose.  We were told if it went out to tender again it would just delay it.  It was not feasible to do the two phases and have a proper tendering process on the second phase.  This type of information is very important for understanding what can go wrong and where we can keep an eye on other very large-scale projects.  I accept there is a new spending code but process is important.  Part of the reason I asked about the number of staff on the site is that in a scenario where there is construction inflation, it could be way beyond 5%.  The longer this goes on, the more the contractor can gain from it in theory.  It is very important that we are given information on exactly how it is progressing.

Some of the letters that went out to which Deputy Carthy referred indicated that the Statute of Limitations would apply and that the investigation could terminate without conclusion due to the Statute of Limitations.  I share the concern about answering questions.  A question of mine was disallowed on 9 November?  I asked the Minister for Justice had she directed the ombudsman commission in the context of examination of Garda practice, policy and procedure, to examine the memorandum of understanding that exists between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to information sharing and if she was satisfied that it was functioning as intended.  I was told that the Minister has no responsibility in that regard.  I find it hard to accept that is the case because the Minister can intervene for a review.  The Minister talks to the Garda Commissioner all the time.  She must have a relationship with GSOC too.  I do not hold with the idea that the Minister can be totally removed.  It is quite difficult to figure this out.  You cannot blame an organisation if it does not have the resources to do the job.  We saw that in a freedom of information request that Mr. Ken Foxe followed up on relating to the provision of members of the Garda for some of the investigations.  It took a long time for the required Garda members to be provided to GSOC to conduct investigations.  The last thing anyone wants is to get to where so much time and energy has been put into something and then it does not proceed because they do not have the resources and they run into an issue with the Statute of Limitations.  There is a range of concerns around what exactly that &euro;300,000 allows to happen.  We need to go back on that.  Does it address the current industrial relations issues?  Where do those industrial relations issues reside?  Are they in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I am not sure to whom that question should be addressed.  Those are questions that are worth pursuing and there may be others after we get a response.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#BB01300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Will Deputy Carthy propose the areas that committee shall seek information on in its correspondence?

It might be useful to review that before the committee writes to the Department or to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the claims and breakdown of those.  I have the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appropriation account opened here.  They divide the claims numbers between claims by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and employees of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the one hand, and civil claims by members of the public.

It is not only about care, however, it is also the cost of living and so on.  If, for example, a large sum is paid out today and the person passes away in 12 months, two years or three years, that money then has been paid by the State.  The question is whether or not we should be looking at a system, such as in other countries, whereby an assessment is made of needs of the person and there would be an annual payment as opposed to a lump sum payment.  Should Ireland be looking at that system?

No amount would ever be compensation for the person who might have been and his or her resultant quality of life had that accident not happened.<\/p><p> One of the ways of dealing with this matter more cost efficiently was to be the open disclosure process as opposed to a protracted legal approach.  Interestingly, the State Claims Agency told us that the pandemic had changed the situation significantly, in that there was a greater likelihood that people would pursue mediated settlements as opposed to court settlements.  Individual solicitors were giving that advice because going through the courts had grown more difficult.  As such, it appears that it is at the level of solicitors as opposed to the agency that there is movement.  The agency said that it had encouraged that.  The figures seem to suggest that, but it was at the level of the legal profession that movement was slower.<\/p><p> If there is a speedier and less legalistic resolution, it has the benefit of cutting costs on the legal side.

Following consideration of previous correspondence on this matter from the Department, namely, No. 718, the committee requested details of the checks and balances in place within the Department over value for money auditing of each line of expenditure in respect of liquidation fees, including a breakdown of fees and clarification as to whether fees would continue to increase the longer the process went on.  The Secretary General states that there has been a high level of oversight by the Department since the process commenced in 2013, including procedures to monitor and oversee the costs and fees incurred in the liquidation, regular formal meetings between senior officials from the shareholding and financial advisory division and the special liquidators, and frequent communication between the shareholding and financial advisory division and special liquidators across a range of issues as they arise.<\/p><p>The Department also sets out the reports that the special liquidators routinely supply and states that in 2019 the Department commissioned an independent review of similar liquidations globally, which provided it with an independent analysis of other liquidations of a similar scale, allowing comparisons and benchmarking with the IBRC special liquidation, particularly in regard to costs.  The findings of that report are set out in the correspondence. <\/p><p> The Secretary General goes on to note that as stated in the latest progress report the timeframe for the final wind-up of IBRC has been extended to 2024.  This is attributed to the impact of the pandemic and delays in court proceedings.  The impact of the pandemic on asset values and the need to ensure the optimal timing for asset sales are also noted.   In regard to costs, over the remaining timeline of the liquidation, the special liquidators have forecasted total further fees of between &euro;26 million and &euro;33 million.

The Department has very usefully outlined the potential losses in asset value if the assets were to be disposed of by the end of this year, next year, 2023 and 2024 and the additional holding costs that would incur.  On the holding costs above original projections, these are set out for 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 as &euro;2 million, &euro;7 million, &euro;18 million and &euro;26.5 million, respectively.  I would like clarity on the discrepancy in that regard.  According to the Department, the holding cost for 2022 would be &euro;5 million more than the cost for 2021.  The difference between 2022 and 2023 is &euro;11 million and between 2023 and 2024, it is &euro;8.5 million.  There does not appear to be any logical fix in how much each year of delay would cost.<\/p> <p>  Unless somebody can tell me otherwise, I presume that when we are talking about asset realisation, we are, for the most part, talking about properties.  It appears to be an almost a gamble strategy to suggest that the difference in assets value at the end of this year, taking into account how high property prices are currently, will be less than what it will be at the end of 2024.  If anything, it would be hoped that the market might have cooled in the meantime, but the Department is expecting that the value of these properties will increase to the value of &euro;189 million.  That is a fairly big statement.  It is the basis on which the Department has agreed to spend an additional &euro;26.5 million in holding costs.  I would like further clarification from the Department as to how, and on what basis, it is assuming these asset values will increase to that level.  <\/p> <p>  It was stated that the many of the remaining assets are in the hospitality, office and retail sectors and that it will not come as a surprise that the special liquidators have advised that the assets value were significantly negatively impacted by Covid-19.  That may be the case, but some would argue that that has been almost completely reversed.  The property pages show the price of property, depending on where it is located, is at an all-time high.  It would be useful if the Department could set out for us the basis on which it expects such a large increase in asset value over the specified timeframe that merits the expenditure of almost &euro;30 million extra in holding costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#FF00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Every one of us wants the State to end up with the maximum return.  The criticism of some of the early sales in regard to NAMA was that many of us felt it was a fire sale in that properties were sold when the market as at rock bottom as opposed to when we had a rising market.  In being critical of that, we equally need to argue that we need to get the maximum here.  It is a balancing act in terms of the cost and the rising cost of the liquidation and what can be realised from what remains.  We do not have enough information to make that assessment.  We have some generalities in regard to what is yet to be disposed of.  It might be useful to get some sort of a quantum as to what is within each category such that we have a better idea.  We need to also know what the net return is.  I accept these can only be forecasts.  This is the biggest liquidation in the history of the State.  It is hoped we will never again have another as big as it.  The criticism in recent years has been around the level of oversight.  The Department has oversight in this regard.  There is no committee of oversight, which was something that a former members of this committee constantly raised the need for in order that we could keep an eye on this process.  A bit more information is needed regarding the various scenarios, including what is to be disposed of and the quantum in each of the categories yet to be disposed of.  Without that information, we are only guessing at where the values might rise or be static.  We need to get that information in the first instance.  The net estimated return is the type of information that would be of value to us as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#FF00300","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>We will request that information, along with the clarification sought by Deputy Carthy on the increase in asset value.<\/p><p>No. 870B is<b><\/b>from Mr. Ken Spratt, Secretary General, Department of Transport, dated 05 November 2021 providing information requested by the committee regarding detailed notes of expenditure.
