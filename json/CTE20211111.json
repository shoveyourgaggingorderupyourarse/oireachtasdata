The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  I ask members and all in attendance to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19.  I strongly advise that one vacant seat be left between those attending the meeting physically, that hand sanitisers be used and that appropriate social distancing be maintained during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn, except when speaking.  I ask people to co-operate with these measures.<\/p> <p>  Members participating remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from the Department of Transport to examine the appropriation account for Vote 31, chapter 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's accounts re expenditure on night vision imaging technology and training for search and rescue and the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report 113 on procurement of vehicles by the Irish Coast Guard.  The 2020 motor tax account is also on the agenda, and other areas of interest to the committee include expenditure on MetroLink, DART, BusConnects, and the all-Ireland strategic rail review.  After lunch we will consider correspondence and other business of the committee.<\/p> <p>  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department of Transport: Mr. Ken Spratt, Secretary General; Ms Deirdre O&rsquo;Keeffe, assistant secretary; Mr. Fintan Towey, assistant secretary; Mr. Eugene Clonan, acting director, Irish Coast Guard; Mr. Garret Doocey, principal officer; and Mr. Dominic Mullaney, principal adviser.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Ms Niamh Callaghan, principal officer, Transport Vote section, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  Everyone is welcome.  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up background noise or feedback and, as usual, I remind all those attending to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off. <\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references speakers may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the precincts of Leinster House is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside Leinster House's precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as those physically present.  Witnesses have already been advised of this and may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time that he or she contributes.<\/p> <p>  I call the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#A00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636623000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The appropriation account for Vote 31 records gross expenditure of &euro;2.7 billion in 2020.  This represented an increase of 17.4% compared to expenditure in 2019.  The expenditure is divided into three expenditure programmes: civil aviation; land transport; and maritime transport and safety.  The majority of the expenditure in 2020 was under programme B, land transport, which accounted for 95% of the gross spending amount.  This comprised mainly investment in roads and on road safety and regulation, and current and capital spending on public transport.  As I proposed previously, given the imbalance in programme size, it may be timely for the Department, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to consider splitting up programme B in future.<\/p> <p>  In 2020, the Department provided substantial funding to several public bodies operating under its aegis.  These include: Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII; the National Transport Authority, NTA; the Road Safety Authority, RSA; the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS; and some other smaller bodies.  The Department also oversees several commercial State bodies, such as the CI&Eacute; group, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA and the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA. <\/p> <p>  Receipts into the Transport Vote are modest, with appropriations-in-aid in 2020 amounting to &euro;17.8 million.  There was a substantial underspend on the Vote for 2020, of just under &euro;386 million.  Much of this related to the impact of Covid-19 on normal schemes and projects, but underspending also occurred because additional financial provision made for Covid-19 was not required on the scale originally envisaged.<\/p> <p>  With agreement from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;151.5 million in unspent capital allocations was carried over for spending in 2021.  This related mainly to capital spending shortfalls under the subheads for: airports; regional and local roads stimulus; heavy rail safety and development; public transport infrastructure; cycling and walking; and greenways.  The remainder of the surplus for the year, &euro;234.4 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account.   <\/p> <p>  Members may wish to note that the statement on internal financial controls discloses non-compliant procurement by the Department of &euro;1.1 million worth of goods and services.<\/p> <p>  In addition to its Vote-funded activities, the Department of Transport has responsibility for the motor tax collection system.  Receipts of motor tax are accounted for in a special departmental account, separate from the Vote, and are transferred directly to the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  The 2020 motor tax account prepared by the Department records receipts of &euro;939 million.  This was down 2.5% on the 2019 level.   <\/p> <p>  I also issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the motor tax account 2020.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Coast Guard, ICG, is organisationally part of the Department of Transport, and its expenditure is directly charged on the Vote.  I have presented reports on two matters relating to the operations of the Coast Guard, arising from audit work on the 2019 and 2020 appropriation accounts.  One report relates to the helicopter search and rescue, SAR, service, which is contracted out to private sector providers, at an annual cost of around &euro;60 million.  The other report relates to procurement for the cliff rescue service, which is provided substantially by volunteer service members.<\/p> <p>  As I outline in chapter 5 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2020, the Department paid &euro;4.305 million to the search and rescue service provider in 2013 to fund an upgrade of the five search and rescue helicopters then in use to equip them with night vision technology.  In addition, in November 2015, the Department bought 24 sets of night vision goggles for &euro;527,000.  In November 2018, the Department made an initial payment of &euro;1.714 million for the provision of training in the use of the night vision technology.  That training commenced in November 2019 and it is still ongoing.  As at June 2021, only one of the four Coast Guard search and rescue bases had been approved to operate the technology and to provide a night-vision enabled service.  It will be some time before the other three search and rescue bases are operating in the same way.<\/p><p>On the basis that significant payments were made as long ago as 2013, and that the planned capability has not yet been delivered across the service, I am not persuaded that good value for money has been achieved from this expenditure.<\/p><p> In the special report, I deal with the procurement of vehicles by the Irish Coast Guard for use by the cliff rescue teams.  The Department signed a contract in November 2015 for the supply and fit-out of a number of vans to carry crew members and equipment.  Between 2016 and 2020, the Department purchased 18 vans, costing almost &euro;1.4 million, under this contract.  The average all-in cost was around &euro;76,500 per vehicle.<\/p><p> The examination found that the vehicle requirements had not been adequately set out in advance of the procurement process.  There were also major gaps in the Department&rsquo;s records of the tendering process, in particular in relation to the evaluation of bids.  As a result, we found there is no reasonable basis to conclude that the Department conducted a fair and impartial procurement process for the vehicles.<\/p><p> This report makes four recommendations aimed at strengthening the Department&rsquo;s procurement procedures for the future.  These are that a strategic plan for equipment requirements be developed; that all procurements of equipment should involve technical and user input at the planning stage; that all significant procurements be based on a formal assessment of operational needs; and that the Department carry out regular reviews of its procurement procedures and processes.  I am glad to report that the recommendations have been accepted by the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

The tourism and sport functions were transferred out of it, and its remit is now focused solely on transport.  Three programmes remained - civil aviation; land transport; and maritime transport and safety.  The onset of the Covid-19 crisis in March 2020, along with the transfer of functions, necessitated the publication of a further set of Revised Estimates in 2020.  The appropriation account for 2020 reflects this set of Estimates.  The Department&rsquo;s net allocation in the further Revised Estimates for 2020 was, to round, &euro;3.0285 billion, comprising &euro;1.981 billion in capital and &euro;1.047 billion current expenditure.<br\/><br\/>The allocation of capital was primarily directed towards the core capital programme, with an additional allocation of &euro;113.25 million for the July stimulus.  Current expenditure supported existing services, with a substantial in-year increase of &euro;492.55 million in funding compared to the start-of-the-year position to address pressures caused by the Covid-19 crisis with &euro;2 million related to July stimulus funding.  As it transpired, not all of the emergency funding was required in 2020, which was a significant contributory factor in the surrender to the Exchequer of &euro;176 million in current expenditure funds at the year&rsquo;s end.<br\/><br\/>I would like the committee to note that, taking on board the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General at the Public Accounts hearing in May 2021, concerning the splitting of the land transport programme in the interests of transparency and better reporting, I can confirm that this has now been completed for 2022, creating three new programmes: programme A &ndash; sustainable mobility, covering active travel and greenways; programme B &ndash; sustainable mobility, covering public transport; and programme C &ndash; road networks and road safety.<br\/><br\/>The high-level goal for aviation in 2020 was to &ldquo;maximise air transport connectivity with a safe, competitive, cost-effective and sustainable aviation sector&rdquo;<i>.  <\/i>The programme was allocated &euro;41.865 million in current expenditure and &euro;10.7 million in capital in the aviation sector.  This financed public service obligations for the regional airports, as well as capital investment in aviation safety and security projects.  The programme included &euro;15 million in contingency to support the travellers&rsquo; protection fund.  This fund, administered by the Commission for Aviation Regulation, is in place to meet any legal obligations arising regarding customers requiring repatriation or reimbursement in the event of a travel or tour operator failure.<br\/><br\/>For land transport, our goal in 2020 was to &ldquo;service the needs of society and the economy through safe, sustainable and competitive transport networks and services.&rdquo;. <i><\/i>In this regard, we are responsible for the corporate governance of the two leading planning and investment agencies, namely Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Transport Authority.  A sum of &euro;1.963 billion in capital was allocated to progress the core capital programme and also to provide additional Covid relief measures and a near-term economic stimulus.  A sum of &euro;917.062 million was allocated in current expenditure, primarily to support PSO-funded services.  Of this allocation, &euro;460 million was related to emergency PSO funding for non-commercial and commercial transport services.  <br\/><br\/>Major construction developments in 2020 included the commencement of construction of the national train control centre, the Ballyvourney&ndash;Macroom development on the N22, the Dunkettle interchange, the opening of the N25 New Ross bypass in Wexford, and the completion of the N7 Naas road-widening project in Kildare.  In addition, the development of the Dublin megaprojects preliminary business cases continued, along with construction of key national roads, the N5 from Westport to Turlough, the N56 from Dungloe to Glenties, and the N4 from Collooney to Castlebaldwin, despite severe disruption caused by the Covid-19 crisis.<br\/><br\/>Prior to the onset of Covid-19, public transport bus and rail services had effectively reached capacity.  Year-on-year increases in fare revenue meant that PSO funding requirements were relatively stable.  Public health measures introduced in March 2020 led to public transport capacity limits of 25% of normal capacity.  Mid-year forecasts from the National Transport Authority, NTA, in a situation of a high degree of uncertainty, indicated that an additional &euro;460 million may be required in subvention to address the shortfall.  A portion of this funding was also utilised to fund a series of short-term contracts to support commercial public transport operators, which were also severely impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.<br\/><br\/>Under the maritime programme, our 2020 goal was to &ldquo;facilitate safe and sustainable maritime transport and the delivery of emergency management services&rdquo;.<i><\/i>Of the &euro;110.667 million comprising the current allocation to the maritime sector, &euro;76.877 million supported Coast Guard services.  Of the latter, &euro;62.515 million was allocated to the Coast Guard search and rescue service delivered by CHC.  A budget allocation of &euro;5.659 million was invested by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, which is responsible for maintaining marine navigation systems in Irish waters.  In addition, &euro;15 million was allocated as contingency to support certain key commercial ferry services as a result of financial stresses caused by the impact of Covid-19 and related public health measures.  A sum of &euro;6.42 million in capital was allocated to support investment in Coast Guard building and assets and in the Commissioners of Irish Lights.<br\/><br\/>I note the committee&rsquo;s interest in discussing a number of specific projects today, including BusConnects, DART+ and MetroLink.  I expect the preliminary business cases for the three Dublin megaprojects to go to the Government shortly.  I also note the committee&rsquo;s interest in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report into the procurement of Coast Guard vehicles.  On the latter, I share the Comptroller and Auditor&rsquo;s concern as to its findings.  Prior to publication of the report, or even to its genesis, the Department had been in the process of strengthening its corporate governance in the area of procurement.  This has involved aligning the Department&rsquo;s procurement activities with Office of Government Procurement guidance on procurement.  Since the end of 2019, a procurement officer has been in place within the Department and has provided valuable support in ensuring that new procurements are conducted in accordance with all legal and administrative arrangements to ensure that the correct processes are followed.<br\/><br\/>The Department has strengthened its analytical tools in procurement analysis and will be further strengthening the corporate monitoring of procurement activity in 2022 and beyond, as we move towards multi-annual procurement planning and forecasting.  The rising number of 40\/02 declarations in the accounts in the past three years is a direct result of the monitoring, compliance, awareness and education frameworks we are implementing and are continuing to build on, as we seek to ensure that the smallest procurements are treated with the same rigour, thoroughness and attention to detail as larger procurements.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Spratt"},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The lead speaker from the committee today is Deputy Dillon, who has 15 minutes.

First, there is the funding that TII provides for national roads, which ultimately comes from the Department but which is managed by TII in conjunction with the councils.  Second, there is the funding for regional and local roads.  This is administered directly by the Department and issued by the Minister every year.  Approximately 90% of the funding for regional and local roads is dedicated to protection and renewal whereas the split for TII-funded roads, including national roads, in 2020 was quite different.  Perhaps half of this money went on protection and renewal while the other half went on new works.  Decisions on projects are made in conjunction with the Department when a national development plan is being drawn up and major projects are being looked at.  As time goes on, projects are prioritised as they go through the various stages of the public spending code.  If other factors need to be taken into account, such as access to a port or a location being on a Trans-European Transport Network, TEN-T, route, which are core European routes, certain commitments may be made.  Such commitments have been made in respect of Foynes and Ringaskiddy.  Those roads have to be done by 2030.  These factors are all taken into account.

Councils put their own resources into local roads.  It is not only Exchequer money that goes into them.  The problem is that a council that puts very little of its own resources into its roads will have roads in worse condition than a council that puts a lot in and we would therefore essentially be penalising the counties that have provided funding themselves because, if allocations were to be based on condition, the next time a condition survey is done, these councils would do less well.  Councils who did not spend the money effectively would also be rewarded for doing so.  We have therefore come to the conclusion that the fairest way to make allocations is to do so based on road length.  Because there is a backlog, all of the councils need these moneys.  There is no danger that we are giving them too much.  That is essentially how it is done.

It was revised as a result of some pretty bad experiences with some pretty big capital projects.  We have a number of decision gates, starting with decision gate 0, a strategic assessment report.  We would then move into the preliminary business case, which is subject to an external review.  We then move to full cost-benefit analysis in order to proceed to tender, and again that is subject to an external review.  Only then would we go with another second full cost-benefit analysis prior to the awarding of contract.<\/p> <p>  That is important in ensuring that when we are spending billions of euro of taxpayers' money in this case, we get our decisions right.  This public spending code and process guards against cost escalation.  It is really important that we go through those processes and find ourselves explaining our approach on this side of procurements rather than on the other side of procurements, when we could be in much trickier positions after public spending on capital projects go wrong.  This code is really important and it has been welcomed by Secretaries General and Government officials.  It guards against cost escalation by ensuring we have really high standards when it comes to business cases.  It also ensures we have persistent challenge throughout projects and independent and rigorous challenge right throughout projects.<\/p> <p>  There is a really strong focus in the public spending code on governance and delivery.  Therefore, we are able to emphasise front-end decision making and really get the cost estimation and benefit projection right.  We are able to get delivery schedules right.  This is why I am emphasising the point.  The delivery schedule and procurement strategy are really important.  If we get cost estimations, benefit projections, delivery schedule and the procurement strategy right, we will not have implementation difficulties or requests for extra tens or hundreds of millions of euro or even billions of euro.  Ultimately, we will not have failure.  It is really important for me to set that out.<\/p> <p>  On the scheduling, we are still in the early stages for MetroLink.  We are at the preliminary business case stage.  That has been received by us and we are reviewing it, as required under the public spending code.

Other than that, we have no other dates.  I repeat the question.  Perhaps there is a reluctance to be tied down to dates.  Perhaps there are no dates at all.  However, it is important that those dates are made public, so that we can keep track of delays.  I refer back to the 2018 statements which announced the former Metro North.  They were clear.  They said that 2018 was the date for the emerging preferred routed; 2019 was the date for the railway order; 2020 was the date for the granting of the railway order; 2021 was the date for construction to commence; 2027 was the date by which the metro was to be in operation.

However, we have learned from projects that have gone badly wrong that if one gets the delivery schedule wrong, they will ultimately come back looking for extra time and more money.  Potentially projects could fail.  We have some significant examples of that occurring where inaccurate delivery schedules were given.

It speaks to the Deputy's own points that he raised generally in his contribution on the frustrations around the timeline.  It also speaks to Mr. Spratt&rsquo;s points around what the public spending code and the revised public spending code are seeking to guard against.  There were huge, phenomenal responses to both of the emerging preparatory consultation back in 2018 and 2019.  They raised complex issues about design, local community engagement, etc.  They required a considerable amount of time to reflect upon and revise for the design and route at that time.  They changed considerably, as we are all aware, from the emerging preferred route to the preferred route.  Clearly, in retrospect, those dates were not feasible.  They were missed, if the Deputy wants to put it that way.<\/p> <p>  Details in the case of the revised public spending code rose in December 2019, as Mr. Spratt introduced and spoke about.  That seeks through its decision gate mechanism to ensure that we get a lot better, again as Mr. Spratt mentioned, about ensuring that we are making the right calls at the right time.  The timings are fundamental.  The Deputy acknowledged that when he said they were hugely significant.  Decision gate 1 is imminent.  That will allow the project to move into the planning system.  That will be a massive step forward for this project.  Once it is in the planning system, there is no fixed date around the time that it needs to come out of the planning system.  It will need to get past decision gate 3 at the end of that approval to proceed.  At that decision gate, that will be the time we go to Government and set out the exact details, such as what we think budgetary envelope for the project will be at that particular time, taking into account the changes that may be required in the planning process, the delivery schedule, and also the benefits realisation.  At that point, then, measurement will start about whether we are on track or off track in the construction phase.  <\/p> <p>  Clearly, now, the real focus on a departmental level is to complete a review of the preliminary business case.  At a project level, there are still outstanding issues.  This is a huge, massive, complex project.  It is likely the largest ever public investment project in the history of the State.  There are still issues at a project level about closing out the necessary planning and environmental documentation to allow them to be ready to enter the planning system.  There is, therefore, a massive emphasis and focus on a departmental level and at an agency level to get this through decision gate 1 and into the planning system.

It would be vital, if at all possible, that we would hear from it on this issue.<\/p> <p>  I will be brief.  As is usual on a Thursday there are sometimes conflicting diary requirements.  I want to seek reassurances in respect of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report 113 on procurement to vehicles by the Irish Coast Guard, that there is a clear matching up between the four recommendations that are aimed at strengthening.  I am quoting from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report that they are aimed, &ldquo;at strengthening the Department&rsquo;s procurement procedures for the future&rdquo;.  Can we be assured of the following for each of the recommendations for the strategic plan for equipment requirement: that all procurements of equipment should involve technical and user input at the planning stage; that all significant procurements should be based on formal assessment of operational needs; and that the Department would carry out regular reviews of its procurement procedures and processes?  I want a short reassurance from the Secretary General that that is all now under way.  The Secretary General states that the Department has strengthened its analytical tools for procurement analysis.  I remain to be assured that we have a robust and fit-for-purpose system.  Can the Secretary General give us those assurances?  That is my first question.<\/p> <p>  I will ask three questions specifically and then I will take my leave.  The second question is about national secondary routes.<\/p><p> Major construction projects begun in 2020 are under way.  I believe strongly that there is a need for a policy intervention by the Department in respect of those national secondary routes that are in a deplorable state, such as the N73, in such a way that would ensure that TII, funds projects like that relating to the Mallow to Mitchelstown road.  The latter is, arguably, one of the worst national secondary routes in the country, even though it is a vital artery for commercial and domestic traffic in the north Cork area and a vital route between Kerry and Dublin.  I continue to make the case for funding for this road.  I ask that the N73 project remain on the agenda, and I make no bones about raising the matter at this forum.<\/p><p> On the Leap card, the Secretary General informed us that \"Year-on-year increases in fare revenue meant that PSO funding requirements were relatively stable.\"  I am seeking to expand Leap card services in my county of Cork, specifically on routes between Mallow and Cork, where there a massive number of commuters on a daily basis and where there is still not a Leap card service, even though it could be argued that it is a viable route.  I can travel from Bray to Pearse Station using a Leap card, but I cannot go from Mallow to Cork.  There is an inequality between services on the eastern seaboard and those in the regions.  I ask that, as a policy, the Department looks at the roll-out of Leap card services for the towns that service big cities, such as Cork.  It is vitally important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#E01600","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636623000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I can give Deputy Sherlock that assurance in a word, \"Yes\".  If he does not mind, I will expand a little on that.  I accept that our procurement processes were in need of tightening.  There is no doubt about that.  As I mentioned in the appropriation account, the Department carried out a procurement gap analysis in 2019.  We identified several recommendations for enhancements around procurement.  That report included a comprehensive suite of recommendations covering the appointment and functions of a procurement officer, in addition to corporate governance matters, measuring and monitoring compliance, communications, training requirements and corporate governance of agencies as regards procurement.  Deputy Sherlock will be delighted to hear that we appointed a procurement officer in 2020, as was recommended.  Enhanced corporate governance, and improved measuring and monitoring of compliance and training, are being implemented.<\/p> <p>  As a relatively new Secretary General, this is something I am very focused on.  I expect that we will learn some lessons from much of our seeking out, and the 100% review, where we now look at every procurement.  I expect we will find some things when we do that review but, once we are through all of that, we will be a lot more fit for purpose and a lot cleaner than we are at the moment.  A lot of very good work has been done over the past 18 months to two years.  There is more work to be done, but we are making very good improvements in that area.<\/p> <p>  On national secondary routes, the state of the N73 and the need for it to be improved, we have processes around prioritisation for new roads and for protection and renewal, which includes safety works and minor projects.  For new roads, the prioritisation processes include TII and NTA recommendations.  We also look at Government objectives under the national planning framework and the national development plan, current Department priorities, levels of congestion, the possibility of releasing space in towns for active travel, projects that improve access to public transport facilities and the general rationale set out in our national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI, which is our transport investment strategy.  That has a number of priorities, including a mobile hierarchy and investment hierarchy.<\/p> <p>  I know the Deputy is specifically interested in protection and renewal.  For protection and renewal, and any minor projects, we monitor those problems the Deputy and others have highlighted at our quarterly monitoring meeting with TII.  If there are serious issues that need to be addressed, we try to raise them at that meeting.  At the periodic meeting of the TII board - it may be quarterly or more often than that - it is decided what funding will be provided.  The Deputy mentioned the N73.  We will look at it, as he asked, and we will see where it fits in the greater scheme of things.<\/p> <p>  On the Leap card, we are very keen to encourage modal shift with our decarbonisation agenda.  That is not just in the cities, but in regional and rural areas.  Due to our ambition regarding decarbonisation, we have a big job of work to do in shifting people out of cars and onto public transport.  We have plans to increase our current public service obligation funding for regional and rural bus services.  It is something we will be very focused on over the next couple of years.  I accept the point the Deputy made regarding the Leap card.  It is something we have to sort out.  We have to make it easier for people to use public transport services, not only by making the services available but by having them available when people want them, having more services and also having ease-of-use of those services.  The greater and wider use of Leap cards throughout the country is something I am very mindful of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Spratt"},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome.

I am thankful for it.  It is good to have the Secretary General, Mr. Spratt, before the committee.  The Department he is in charge of and controls an astronomical budget in terms of the capital projects it is working on.  I have worked closely with him as a member of the Joint Committee on Transport.  We have, in recent days, seen project delays raise their ugly heads again.  As a young parliamentarian, I am anxious to see progress being made on future development and trying to help to diversify our transport infrastructure in Ireland and install a more climate friendly transport infrastructure in both urban and rural areas.  I am very concerned, to be straight with Mr. Spratt, because the amount of time it takes to build projects in Ireland is not right.  Something is amiss.  Public confidence is important for all of us elected representatives and Members of the Oireachtas.  We represent our constituencies.  When I talk to ordinary members of the public on the ground, they have lost all confidence in the Department for Transport's ability to build major infrastructural projects.  Things like the metro have not helped.  That is an issue the Department needs to tackle urgently.  I am not trying to throw anyone under a bus but that is the reality of how the people of Ireland view the progress that is being made in the Department of Transport.  We are facing an unprecedented emergency for our climate.  We must get more people onto public transport.  We urgently need the development of public transport infrastructure and the fact that we are now in 2021 without an underground metro system in our capital city, a primate city which has more than 1 million living in it, is completely and utterly unacceptable.  That is not the direct responsibility of the witnesses before the committee today.  Many of their predecessors had a role to play in that absence, as had other elected officials.  It is important for me to set the context for some of my questions.<\/p><p>Surely one of the witnesses is in a position to answer this question.

We as civil servants have to comply with the law of the land and public procurement rules.  We have to appear before Oireachtas committees, including this one, and give them assurances that we have done our best to maximise value for money.  We have a public spending code, which was introduced as a result of major capital projects going wrong.

Therefore, the tender document went out with provision of the service as the thing and, as an option, with NVIS.  Why are we going for NVIS?  The benefit of night vision capability for the Coast Guard is that it enhances operational effectiveness and safety.  That is why we are seeking NVIS.  We looked at implementing NVIS on a phased basis, based on the tender proposal to put it in after the service was started.  We did that and, in 2013, we modified the helicopters.  Each of those helicopters cost in the region of &euro;40 million to &euro;45 million.  For each to be modified cost just under &euro;1 million.

In 2011, the Government decided not to proceed with what was then Metro North.  That was the end of that project.  In 2015, an analysis was conducted.  The Fingal\/North Dublin Transport Study was published.  It concluded that there is a need for a metro solution in the north Dublin and Fingal area.  That analysis fed into the greater Dublin area transport strategy, which was published in 2016, which reiterated that there was a need for a metro.  It also concluded that there was a need for a metro on the south side of the city along the Luas green line.  That project became MetroLink.  Since 2018, expenditure on that project has been classed as MetroLink.  Since then, as the exchanges with Deputy McAuliffe earlier indicated, there was the emerging preferred route consultation.  There was substantial public response to that, including from public representatives and local communities.  There was a further public consultation on the preferred route and changes were made between those two consultation periods in response to the issues raised by public representatives and local communities.<\/p> <p>  Since the conclusion of the preferred route public consultation, that project has been brought forward for much more detailed planning, design and environmental preparation for the planning application.  I apologise if the Deputy heard this earlier.  The focus in the Department is to complete our review of the preliminary business case.  That case was submitted to us this year for the first time.  We are awaiting a revised draft.  We will then complete our review with the ambition to allow our Minister to bring it to Government as soon as possible.

As a result, the first base is up and running in Sligo.  Personnel at the remaining bases are still in training.  To get to the next step, which is SAR approval, CHC needs approval under manuals and training schedules.

As they know, this is the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is all about value for money for us.  I want to point out to Mr. Spratt that I sat in on a meeting of the Committee on Transport and Communications for my colleague last week.  Representatives from TII and the NTA were before the committee.  I suggested to Nigel O'Neill of TII that there is an issue with toll barriers because we pay in excess of &euro;600 million per year for exceeding nitrogen oxide, NOx, emissions above what is allowed under EU rules.  I was astounded to hear Mr. O'Neill respond that the barriers at Dublin Port Tunnel are there for traffic management and control.  I advised him that I have been all over Europe and many parts of the world and that I have never seen a toll barrier used to control traffic in a tunnel.  I ask that this be revised.  I am sure Mr. O'Neill has gone back and had a conversation about it.  I calculate that it is costing the transport industry &euro;92 million per year for toll barriers in this country.  That is what it is costing to stop and expend a litre of fuel and that is just in money.  I do not have the measure of what it is costing in lung health and health issues that NOx emissions contribute to but I am sure the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, does.  I would like the Department to come back to the committee and let us know what it is going to do about the situation and what actions it will take because the EPA has provided a report which states that we are exceeding our NOx emissions and that those emissions are primarily caused by transport.  That is primarily what we are being fined for and these are the targets we are setting.  I am not aware of anything the Department has provided to the sector as an incentive to be cleaner and greener.  I ask the Department to submit that information.<\/p><p>Peter Walsh from TII also appeared before the Committee on Transport and Communications.  There is a major issue at Rosslare Europort.  Mr. Spratt will be aware that there has been a 400% increase in traffic there because of Brexit.  The Government has spent &euro;11 million, through the Office of Public Works, OPW, providing a state-of-the-art facility for our regulatory agencies, facilities that one could only have dreamed of years ago.  I am not sure what the acreage is but it is substantial.  It is empty all of the time while our hauliers have drivers <i>in situ<\/i>in lay-bys trying to comply with tachograph rules and trying to find somewhere to park if the ship is late, which happens with the weather at this time of year.  The biggest sufferance is for the residents.  They have refrigerated vehicles running outside their doors because these trucks have nowhere to park.  We have spent &euro;11 million on a yard that is at least 85% empty.  I propose that it needs to be adapted to accommodate the traffic which the NTA and TII are responsible for accommodating.<\/p><p>Nothing has been done.  I invited Mr. Walsh to come Rosslare to meet the local county councillors and garda&iacute; and put a traffic management plan in place.  There is a serious road safety issue.  We should not waste the taxpayers money; rather, we should utilise it to the best of our ability.  There is no need for more facilities.  At most we might need to erect a fence but I do not even see the need for that.  We have customs agents in control in the facility itself.  The facilities are there for the drivers when they have to go through the regulation process, including toilet facilities.  We need to start to think with the taxpayer in mind and I ask that Mr. Spratt would take charge of that because Mr. Walsh was not forthcoming about travelling down to meet the elected representatives in Rosslare, myself included, who are tasked with looking after the area.<\/p><p>I have written to both last week and I will send on the correspondence.<\/p><p> The other point I would like to mention is that the funding granted for regional airports was &euro;90 million.  What funding is available to Waterford Airport and the south east from that funding?<\/p><p> Waterford Airport is also home to the Coast Guard Sikorsky rescue helicopter R117.  Given the increase in traffic at Rosslare Europort, it now takes on a whole new level of importance given that it is based in that area and in light of the amount of time a helicopter might need to travel as a result of the increased capacity of direct routes from Rosslare to France.  Mr. Clonan, in particular, might let me know if he agrees with that.  There must be a special place for this service now in Waterford Airport.  I visited there during the recess and I am very concerned on two levels.  The helicopter is housed at the behest of Waterford Regional Airport.  The Coast Guard is basically renting a hangar to house the helicopter.  I accept An Bord Plean&aacute;la has not decided on the application.  Funding was committed by the Department for an extension of the runway, but if the airport is closed, will the commitment still hold?  How much is the funding?  Could the witnesses assure the people in the south-east region, and those who traverse the high seas, that there will be no interference or diminution of the Coast Guard service in the south-east region at Waterford Airport?

This is insane.  This happened on the N11 where we spent more than &euro;2 million on planning for the 33 km that is left to be made a motorway.  This cycle must be broken.  A decision must be made on how we are accountable for taxpayers' money.  On top of that, I am being told that an airport of regional importance that houses the Coast Guard is not viable for the south-east region of more than 600,000 people.  If it is different, I hope Mr. Spratt will write to me and tell me that is the case.  The population is now on the rise due to the increase in traffic at Rosslare Europort.

I wish to focus in on the Coast Guard with Mr. Clonan.  I note from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that 18, I think, vehicles were purchased.  There were issues with procurement but I have heard what the Secretary General has said in that regard on reform around procurement, which is welcome.  An issue I raised last May, of which Mr. Clonan might be aware, was one brought to my attention by members and volunteers from the Coast Guard about the use of the vehicles.  He gave me a response at the time saying there are rules around the use of those vehicles.  However, what I was saying at the time was that if members were allowed bring them to their homes it could increase response times.  The reports I had at the time were members were leaving their home, going to the base, collecting the vehicle and then going to the scene.  Mr. Clonan said correctly that not all members had to go to base.  They could leave the vehicles at home.  Has there been any progress on that?  Given my limited time, he might send a note on that if he cannot come back to me immediately after this.<\/p> <p>  My second question is for Mr. Spratt and concerns an area of great interest to me, namely, planning for major incidents, be they regional or national and relating to rail, road, sea or air.  How frequently are the emergency services and other agencies engaged in training in these areas?  I mention also co-ordination between local authorities.  I am aware of one local authority where its disaster communications centre needs to be relocated from its main building.  The officials cannot hypothesise about various incidents but given the potential scale of one of these incidents, how prepared are we as a State to deal with such incidents?

On a national level, I have a very significant problem with TII's annual allocations.  In terms of grant allocations for 2021 for national road budgets, page three of the documentation indicates that &euro;484,256,450 is the gross allocation for national road maintenance.  The document provides an individual breakdown for projects that will be receiving funding which is excellent in that it enables public representatives to explain to their constituents what is happening in their constituencies.  One of these projects, the N73, happens to fall into my constituency in Cork East and I raised it with Mr. Walsh of the TII at a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications last week.  I have a very significant problem.  A  sum of &euro;86.99 million was allocated to Cork County Council, of which &euro;1.5 million was allocated in the 2021 budget to progress upgrade works on the N73 near Kildorrery between Mallow and Mitchelstown but when we hit September, the funding disappeared.  I want to know where it is gone and I want to know why the &euro;1.5 million is not available.  These are questions I asked last week but having looked back at the clip, I did not really get the certainty I want.  Perhaps the witnesses could correspond with me on this after the meeting but if they can answer me now, all the better.  I want to know why the &euro;1.5 million of the annual funding for Cork County Council of &euro;86.99 million for national road maintenance in 2021 is not available.  Why was Cork County Council told it cannot progress after TII, as the agency under the remit of the Department of Transport, told it to advance the process as far as tendering?<\/p> <p>  This is completely unacceptable.  We cannot have State agencies providing funding budgets and then not carrying out the work.  It does not give us clarity and makes us, as elected representatives irrespective of party, particularly those of us who are in government, look bad.  I do not blame people for giving out.  This is something that needs to be fine tuned.  I am aware that the funding has been allocated for next year but it still must be approved by the board of TII, which is expected to happen in the second week of December.  Before that happens, I want the Secretary General and the relevant official in his Department, whether that be a principal officer or an assistant secretary in charge of roads funding, to have a word with TII about this because it is completely unacceptable.  This has to be fine tuned.  We cannot have a situation where we are telling local authorities to advance national road plans and then not funding them at the final minute.

Much of that traffic comes down the N80 from the west through Mountmellick.  In fact, it passes within 150 yd of my house, along a new road, and that is welcome.  The town of Mountmellick was promised that a bypass inner relief road would be built in 2004 or 2005.  The proposals that were put forward would have meant it cutting through the car park of a business and community facilities and it was rejected because of that.  A feasibility study has been conducted by the county council in conjunction with the Department, which cost in the region of &euro;100,000, and it has set out a route for the bypass.<\/p> <p>  Will the Department revert to the committee on efforts to advance that project?  It is of strategic importance.  There is a T-junction in the centre of the town and articulated trucks have to cross to the far side of the road to get around it.  It is dangerous and it chokes up the town centre.  It would shorten journeys if the inner relief road were built, although it would involve a crossing of the River Owenass.  I have not seen any progress in recent years but the feasibility study has been completed.  It is not mentioned in the national development plan or any funding stream.  Will the Department revert to me on whether there are plans to advance it over the next three or four years?<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for joining us and the staff at the Department and the Irish Coast Guard for their work in preparing for the meeting.

This response arises from an enquiry we made following consideration of a previous item of correspondence from the T&aacute;naiste on this issue.  The committee requested clarity as to the specific analysis that has been undertaken in respect of growing energy demand due to data centre investments.  The Secretary General states such analysis has been undertaken by bodies responsible for the management and regulation of our electricity market, namely, EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, and provides hyperlinks to those analyses.  Also provided is the Government statement on the role of data centres in Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise strategy.

Detailed information is provided in regard to the contractual provisions regarding inflation.  Essentially, the new children&rsquo;s hospital construction contract permits the contractor to recover the cost of tender inflation in excess of 4%, and this provision came into effect in August 2019.  The inflation payment from the State to the main contractor, including VAT, for the period August to December 2019 was &euro;1.6 million, and a further &euro;1.5 million was paid out for the period of January to December 2020.<\/p><p> On the lessons learned from the planning phase of the project in terms of the procurement process, the contract and related controls, the chief officer states that the form of contract used was the standard Office of Government Procurement public works contract for employer design, with some elements of the works contract modified to meet the two-stage procurement requirements of the project.  He also states that the process was overseen by a third party.  The chief officer goes on to state that, in regard to lessons learned from the procurement process and the public works contract, the PwC report sets out two recommendations regarding future large capital projects for which Government Departments are responsible.  No information is provided on whether the procurement process used was, in hindsight, the most appropriate to deliver value for money for the State, or whether any lessons have been learned from a project for which the costs have significantly escalated, and one for which, despite the best efforts of this committee, we do not know the final cost or date of completion.<\/p><p> This has been flagged by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Imelda Munster, and by myself.

We need to look for more up-to-date information, up to the end of 2021, in regard to inflation and projected inflation.  We know that 4% is the threshold and there is a problem once it goes beyond that.  Has forecasting been undertaken in the context of further rises in inflation and are there projections for 2022?  One of the reasons this has overrun in time is because the contractor did not provide sufficient staff on the site, and it was done on a month-by-month basis in the early stages and deadlines were missed.  That is something we addressed when the hospital board were in here and it is acknowledged that it was a problem.  Can we ask them about the number of staff or the number of people who are actually on-site, and if the targets are still being missed or whether that has improved?  The longer this goes on, the bigger the risk in regard to inflation, particularly now that we are in a time of increased inflation, in particular construction inflation.  Can we seek an update on the contractor claims?  Members might recall that some of them were at a mediation stage.  We also need to know if the moratorium on the High Court actions is still in place.  Those would be my main asks in regard to what we should go back and seek.<\/p> <p>  It is incredibly difficult to deal with this when we have not been given the report that was done in that we are trying to anticipate things without having the firm ground of responding to the findings in that report.

With regard to the contract, it is set out that, to date, 135 of 170 contractor design packages have been approved, and that information is given under the list of design changes.  A figure was mentioned at one stage of up to 700 potentially, as I recall, and a figure of 400 was given for those they were supposed to be working through.  What I want to analyse from that is where the discrepancy is between the figures we were given here by the board, when they were in last year, and the figures that are there now.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the project, it is said the procurement process for the contract commenced in 2015 and the form of contract used was a standard Office of Government Procurement public works contract for employer design, with some elements of the work contract modified to meet a two-stage procurement process.  That does not tell us an awful lot.  It is a long-winded description but it does not tell us exactly how that works.  It states the evaluation of the tender submission was carried out using the most economically advantageous tender criteria in line with the Office of Government Procurement's capital works framework and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board&rsquo;s tender evaluation procedures.  It was to be overseen by an independent third party and, presumably, they brought in a consultancy firm to oversee that.  We need more information about the two-stage nature of that contract.  It is obviously one of the things that allowed for the potential for a huge price increase in terms of the overall cost.  We should ask them about point 3 in their letter, which caught my eye yesterday when I was reading it.  While they give a long-winded description, it does not really tell us anything and it is just a form of words.  They should explain why that is.  In addition, this two-stage procurement process is left very much open-ended in terms of price for the second stage.  Where has that model been used before?<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Murphy said, we are left second-guessing much of this because we do not have the report and we do not have the timeline.  In the absence of clear information, it would appear the second phase was left very much open-ended in terms of cost and the price increases that could happen.

I note that today EUROSTAT has indicated that Irish price inflation is set to breach 5% for the first time since the financial crash.  Obviously, that is having a big impact on many things but it could also have a big impact on the Exchequer in regard to this project, which is already seeing the inflated costs which we have dealt with in detail.  It is crucial that we get a breakdown from the Department on whether there will be a significant increase in cost as a result of that inflation rate.

The very least we would want to do is learn some lessons from the mistakes of the past.  The Chair has made a point about the two-stage process.  This was really where a large amount of the extra expenditure arose.  We were told if it went out to tender again it would just delay it.  It was not feasible to do the two phases and have a proper tendering process on the second phase.  This type of information is very important for understanding what can go wrong and where we can keep an eye on other very large-scale projects.  I accept there is a new spending code but process is important.  Part of the reason I asked about the number of staff on the site is that in a scenario where there is construction inflation, it could be way beyond 5%.  The longer this goes on, the more the contractor can gain from it in theory.  It is very important that we are given information on exactly how it is progressing.

Some of the letters that went out to which Deputy Carthy referred indicated that the Statute of Limitations would apply and that the investigation could terminate without conclusion due to the Statute of Limitations.  I share the concern about answering questions.  A question of mine was disallowed on 9 November?  I asked the Minister for Justice had she directed the ombudsman commission in the context of examination of Garda practice, policy and procedure, to examine the memorandum of understanding that exists between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to information sharing and if she was satisfied that it was functioning as intended.  I was told that the Minister has no responsibility in that regard.  I find it hard to accept that is the case because the Minister can intervene for a review.  The Minister talks to the Garda Commissioner all the time.  She must have a relationship with GSOC too.  I do not hold with the idea that the Minister can be totally removed.  It is quite difficult to figure this out.  You cannot blame an organisation if it does not have the resources to do the job.  We saw that in a freedom of information request that Mr. Ken Foxe followed up on relating to the provision of members of the Garda for some of the investigations.  It took a long time for the required Garda members to be provided to GSOC to conduct investigations.  The last thing anyone wants is to get to where so much time and energy has been put into something and then it does not proceed because they do not have the resources and they run into an issue with the Statute of Limitations.  There is a range of concerns around what exactly that &euro;300,000 allows to happen.  We need to go back on that.  Does it address the current industrial relations issues?  Where do those industrial relations issues reside?  Are they in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I am not sure to whom that question should be addressed.  Those are questions that are worth pursuing and there may be others after we get a response.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#BB01300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Will Deputy Carthy propose the areas that committee shall seek information on in its correspondence?

It might be useful to review that before the committee writes to the Department or to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the claims and breakdown of those.  I have the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appropriation account opened here.  They divide the claims numbers between claims by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and employees of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the one hand, and civil claims by members of the public.

It is not only about care, however, it is also the cost of living and so on.  If, for example, a large sum is paid out today and the person passes away in 12 months, two years or three years, that money then has been paid by the State.  The question is whether or not we should be looking at a system, such as in other countries, whereby an assessment is made of needs of the person and there would be an annual payment as opposed to a lump sum payment.  Should Ireland be looking at that system?

No amount would ever be compensation for the person who might have been and his or her resultant quality of life had that accident not happened.<\/p><p> One of the ways of dealing with this matter more cost efficiently was to be the open disclosure process as opposed to a protracted legal approach.  Interestingly, the State Claims Agency told us that the pandemic had changed the situation significantly, in that there was a greater likelihood that people would pursue mediated settlements as opposed to court settlements.  Individual solicitors were giving that advice because going through the courts had grown more difficult.  As such, it appears that it is at the level of solicitors as opposed to the agency that there is movement.  The agency said that it had encouraged that.  The figures seem to suggest that, but it was at the level of the legal profession that movement was slower.<\/p><p> If there is a speedier and less legalistic resolution, it has the benefit of cutting costs on the legal side.

Following consideration of previous correspondence on this matter from the Department, namely, No. 718, the committee requested details of the checks and balances in place within the Department over value for money auditing of each line of expenditure in respect of liquidation fees, including a breakdown of fees and clarification as to whether fees would continue to increase the longer the process went on.  The Secretary General states that there has been a high level of oversight by the Department since the process commenced in 2013, including procedures to monitor and oversee the costs and fees incurred in the liquidation, regular formal meetings between senior officials from the shareholding and financial advisory division and the special liquidators, and frequent communication between the shareholding and financial advisory division and special liquidators across a range of issues as they arise.<\/p><p>The Department also sets out the reports that the special liquidators routinely supply and states that in 2019 the Department commissioned an independent review of similar liquidations globally, which provided it with an independent analysis of other liquidations of a similar scale, allowing comparisons and benchmarking with the IBRC special liquidation, particularly in regard to costs.  The findings of that report are set out in the correspondence. <\/p><p> The Secretary General goes on to note that as stated in the latest progress report the timeframe for the final wind-up of IBRC has been extended to 2024.  This is attributed to the impact of the pandemic and delays in court proceedings.  The impact of the pandemic on asset values and the need to ensure the optimal timing for asset sales are also noted.   In regard to costs, over the remaining timeline of the liquidation, the special liquidators have forecasted total further fees of between &euro;26 million and &euro;33 million.

The Department has very usefully outlined the potential losses in asset value if the assets were to be disposed of by the end of this year, next year, 2023 and 2024 and the additional holding costs that would incur.  On the holding costs above original projections, these are set out for 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 as &euro;2 million, &euro;7 million, &euro;18 million and &euro;26.5 million, respectively.  I would like clarity on the discrepancy in that regard.  According to the Department, the holding cost for 2022 would be &euro;5 million more than the cost for 2021.  The difference between 2022 and 2023 is &euro;11 million and between 2023 and 2024, it is &euro;8.5 million.  There does not appear to be any logical fix in how much each year of delay would cost.<\/p> <p>  Unless somebody can tell me otherwise, I presume that when we are talking about asset realisation, we are, for the most part, talking about properties.  It appears to be an almost a gamble strategy to suggest that the difference in assets value at the end of this year, taking into account how high property prices are currently, will be less than what it will be at the end of 2024.  If anything, it would be hoped that the market might have cooled in the meantime, but the Department is expecting that the value of these properties will increase to the value of &euro;189 million.  That is a fairly big statement.  It is the basis on which the Department has agreed to spend an additional &euro;26.5 million in holding costs.  I would like further clarification from the Department as to how, and on what basis, it is assuming these asset values will increase to that level.  <\/p> <p>  It was stated that the many of the remaining assets are in the hospitality, office and retail sectors and that it will not come as a surprise that the special liquidators have advised that the assets value were significantly negatively impacted by Covid-19.  That may be the case, but some would argue that that has been almost completely reversed.  The property pages show the price of property, depending on where it is located, is at an all-time high.  It would be useful if the Department could set out for us the basis on which it expects such a large increase in asset value over the specified timeframe that merits the expenditure of almost &euro;30 million extra in holding costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111100002#FF00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1636623000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Every one of us wants the State to end up with the maximum return.  The criticism of some of the early sales in regard to NAMA was that many of us felt it was a fire sale in that properties were sold when the market as at rock bottom as opposed to when we had a rising market.  In being critical of that, we equally need to argue that we need to get the maximum here.  It is a balancing act in terms of the cost and the rising cost of the liquidation and what can be realised from what remains.  We do not have enough information to make that assessment.  We have some generalities in regard to what is yet to be disposed of.  It might be useful to get some sort of a quantum as to what is within each category such that we have a better idea.  We need to also know what the net return is.  I accept these can only be forecasts.  This is the biggest liquidation in the history of the State.  It is hoped we will never again have another as big as it.  The criticism in recent years has been around the level of oversight.  The Department has oversight in this regard.  There is no committee of oversight, which was something that a former members of this committee constantly raised the need for in order that we could keep an eye on this process.  A bit more information is needed regarding the various scenarios, including what is to be disposed of and the quantum in each of the categories yet to be disposed of.

I am joined by colleagues from the Department with responsibility for international protection issues, Ms Carol Baxter, assistant secretary, and Ms Paula Quinn, principal officer.  Ms Una Ni Dhubhghaill, principal officer, is also supporting us today.  I am conscious that the committee has already held four meetings this year on the issue of direct provision, involving the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children, and a number of other experts in the area.  I will try not to duplicate what they have dealt with in their respective contributions.  I will focus instead on the work we are currently engaging in to end direct provision and establish a new international protection support service.<\/p> <p>  I know the committee will be familiar with the main elements and overall approach of the White Paper on this issue which the Government published last February.  I will not repeat many of the details of the White Paper&rsquo;s contents, but I hope it will be helpful if I outline the process we in the Department have put in place to advance its implementation as soon as possible and to summarise the progress made so far.  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions that members may have.<\/p> <p>  For completeness, I would note that our Department is responsible for providing accommodation and supports to applicants for international protection and for implementing the changes to these as promised in the White Paper, but that responsibility for processing applications, processing times and other aspects of processing asylum claims remains with the Department of Justice and the International Protection Appeals Tribunal.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware that responsibility for matters relating to international protection accommodation and services was transferred to our Department from the Department of Justice in October 2020.  We have taken on these new functions with enthusiasm and a sense of determination to get things done.  We have an ambitious agenda of change ahead of us, and we are keen to make the changes that will bring real improvements in the quality of life of those in the international protection system.  Of course there are very clear legal obligations in this area.  Ireland is obliged to provide accommodation and supports to persons seeking international protection, but in addition to the provisions of law, our Department is strongly committed to making much-needed changes to the conditions of people coming to our shores in these circumstances.<\/p> <p>  The shortcomings of the current system of so-called direct provision have been widely recognised and the programme for Government has pledged to replace it with a new system centred on a not-for-profit approach underpinned by the principles of human rights and the integration of applicants into Irish society from the point of arrival in Ireland.  Under the White Paper there will be a particular focus on children&rsquo;s rights and on ensuring dignity, privacy and respect for all applicants and their families.  The White Paper also contains a commitment to phase out the use of congregated settings by the end of December 2024 when the new system is scheduled to be fully rolled out.<\/p> <p>  The committee will recall that the new model outlined in the White Paper is based on a two-phase approach to accommodating applicants for international protection.  In phase one, the applicant will be accommodated in a reception and integration centre for up to four months.  We will seek to encourage integration from day one and to place people on the most successful pathway possible towards an independent life in Ireland, should their application prove successful.<\/p><p> Accommodation in reception and integration centres will be own-door for families and own-room for single people, with specific tailoring for people with identified vulnerabilities.  Comprehensive information about the international protection process will be made available to all applicants and will include information on Legal Aid Board services, health services, education supports, childcare and employment activation.  This information will be translated into the most common languages spoken by applicants, and an intensive orientation and English language programme will be provided.  In phase two our emphasis will be on fostering an independent life within the community.  All accommodation for families will be own-door, self-contained houses or apartments to provide privacy, agency and independence.  Single people will be housed in either own-door or own-room accommodation.  Homes will be located in cities and towns across every county in the country and supports will be put in place to help encourage integration.  Vulnerable applicants will have additional supports provided to them by NGOs contracted by the Department.  In order to support independent living applicants will be provided with income support payments funded by the Department, including child support payments.  All accommodation units will be managed by independent not-for-profit organisations operating on behalf of the State.<\/p><p> In both phases there will be an emphasis on child welfare and child protection.  Children and young people&rsquo;s services committees, CYPSCs, will ensure there is a specific focus on the needs of children, young people and their families in international protection accommodation settings, with the input of Tusla in key areas such as prevention, partnership and family support and educational support services.  Parenting supports and child development services will be made available to applicant families to support child development during the application process for international protection, and childcare will be provided to enable parents to attend English language classes.  <\/p><p> Phase two supports will be co-ordinated at the local level by inter-agency working groups which will be established in each county and chaired by the local authority.  The working groups will also include representatives of relevant organisations such as the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the local education and training board.  The inter-agency working group will also provide a framework for notifying public authorities and community structures when the Department is deciding to build, acquire or lease phase two accommodation in a particular area, in line with the national allocation key that has been agreed between the Department and the County and City Management Association, CCMA.<\/p><p> It is clear that implementing this new accommodation model and its accompanying supports will require a whole-of-government approach, and this was noted in the White Paper.  With this in mind we have a transition team in the Department that is preparing a detailed implementation plan for the new system.  We are working closely with all relevant stakeholders on different aspects of the plan.  In particular, we are working closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Housing Agency and the local authorities on developing the new accommodation model and on acquiring suitable premises.  We are also working in collaboration with housing experts to prepare advice on the optimal ownership model for the accommodation, as well as on a funding model to enable approved housing bodies and other not-for-profit organisations to act as our delivery partners for the accommodation and supports element of the new system.  <\/p><p> A total of &euro;28.1 million has been allocated to the Department in 2022 for the implementation of the new model of accommodation.  This breaks down between &euro;12.5 million in capital expenditure and &euro;15.6 million in current expenditure.  With this allocation the transition team will be focused on a range of areas.  These will include, by way of example, acquisition of phase two accommodation with a focus on turnkey properties and properties that require upgrading or renovations; rolling out a rent-a-room scheme and the sourcing of private tenancies; a funding scheme for approved housing bodies so that they can begin to bring properties on stream and provide a pipeline for phase two accommodation; starting the transition of international protection applicants out of IPAS accommodation and into accommodation in the community; starting the funding to local authorities to co-ordinate integration at local level; beginning the commissioning of NGOs to provide supports, particularly for vulnerable applicants; initiating the roll-out of applicant-based supports at a local level, including income supports and childcare; rolling out a community integration fund which will support community integration initiatives and deliver benefits for local communities; rolling out employment outreach supports, and launching a national consultation and information process to brief communities about the implementation of the White Paper.<\/p><p> In order to monitor the implementation of the new system, a programme board to oversee the transition to the new international protection support service has been established.  As Secretary General of the Department, I chair this board which includes representatives with lived experience of international protection, NGOs, UNHCR, independent experts in housing and change management and relevant Departments.  The programme board has already had three meetings and its next meeting is scheduled for 18 November.  To date the board has considered a number of important issues, including a draft implementation plan, the income support payments that will be given to applicants and the ownership model for any new accommodation that will be acquired.  In the coming months the board will be asked to review papers on the integration supports that will be offered to applicants and a draft policy for moving those who are currently in the direct provision system into phase two accommodation as it comes on stream.  In addition I am pleased to say that a three-person external advisory group which will provide independent oversight of the reform process contained in the White Paper, has been recently appointed by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman.  Its members are: Dr. Catherine Day, former Secretary General of the European Commission who was chair of the advisory group that formed a key input to the White Paper; Dr. David Donoghue, a retired diplomat and former ambassador to the United Nations who cofacilitated the development of the UN-sponsored global approach to refugees and migrants; and Dr. Lorcan Sirr, a housing policy expert and lecturer in TU Dublin.  This group has had its own initial meeting and I had a valuable initial discussion with it last week.  The Government will be kept informed of the progress of these reforms through the Minister, and the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality will also review progress. <\/p><p> In outlining our plans for major reform, I am conscious of the need still to support the existing system of direct provision even as we plan to end it.  Current residents have the right to expect a quality service, and we must ensure that it is functioning to meet their needs during the transition period.  With this in mind we have recently introduced a number of initiatives aimed at promoting the well-being of residents.  A new dedicated IPAS customer services team is working to strengthen the existing resident complaints system and to take a more proactive approach to dealing with residents' issues, actively engaging with residents through regular resident feedback clinics.  We have also established a resident welfare team.  This is a new multidisciplinary team that focuses on residents with more complex issues, including those with physical and mental health issues and persons identified through the IPAS vulnerability assessment process as having special reception needs.  Officials from Tusla, the HSE&rsquo;s social inclusion team and the Department of Education support this team.  Additional social workers are currently being recruited to provide further support to the team.  These teams have been going to considerable lengths over the past year to deliver improvements to the current system, and we will continue our efforts to promote a service based on quality, human rights and dignity of all those seeking international protection.<\/p><p> To conclude, we have a very ambitious programme of reform ahead of us, with an equally ambitious deadline of the end of 2024 to have the new system in place.  There is a strong commitment and enthusiasm in our Department, and we will work closely with all of the key agencies in a way that will make a real difference to the lives of people applying for international protection in Ireland.  I thank members and we would be happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  This is an issue which many of us have taken an interest in over the last number of years.  I have many questions and, hopefully, I can stay on for the second round of questions as well.  My first question is about the establishment of these reception and integration centres and the stipulation that ideally people will be kept there for four months.  I assume that is while their applications are being processed.  Reading Dr. Lynch's statement, the total budget allocated for the Department for 2022 is &euro;28.1 million.  The concern I have is how to bridge that gap between how we think people will stay in this accommodation for four months and the budget, as welcome as it is, of &euro;28.1 million which probably will not scratch the surface in providing accommodation for those applicants who are subsequently successful.  How realistic is that ambition to deliver this accommodation given that &euro;28.1 million would not scratch the surface in terms of providing the number of properties that are probably required?<\/p><p> The second question is linked to that.  It is evident we are in the middle of a housing crisis at the moment.  Could the Secretary General comment on making that ambition a reality?<\/p><p> I wish to clarify two other points and I will give the remaining time to the Secretary General.  The Secretary General said in his submission that income support payments will be provided.  Can he clarify what he means?  We know of the very small amount of money asylum seekers receive each week at present.  It is hardly an amount on which they could sustain themselves if they were in their own turnkey property.  Can the Secretary General clarify what income support payments will be provided?  Will it change from the current system?<\/p><p> My final point relates to child welfare and the process of inspections or lack thereof in the system.  Dr. Muldoon was before this committee some months ago and his report was fairly damning in that regard.  Could the Secretary General give us an update on the number of inspections that have happened since then because there were concerns that inspections were not taking place?  Does he have any detail on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#B00200","speaker":"1521","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>In terms of what Deputy O'Sullivan was inquiry about under a number of headings, I will take them in order.  On the reception and integration centres, the initial work on that will start as soon as possible.  There will be six of them in all, with 330 people per centre.  We are conscious of the need to plan and organise those as quickly as possible and we are working on that as one of our top priorities in terms of identifying locations and putting them in place.  That is a key part of what we will be doing.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the budget of &euro;28.1 million, &euro;12.5 million of that is capital and the balance is non-capital.  It is important to say that we regard that as a starting point.  We have an agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that in the event we require further funding during 2022, it will be forthcoming.  I do not believe a shortage of budget in 2022 or in subsequent years will be an obstacle for us.  I am satisfied the money we have for 2022 is a very good start and we will plan on that basis.<\/p> <p>  It is important to say we will be using both capital and non-capital money for these purposes.  For example, part of the accommodation will be done on the basis of capital expenditure and partly on the basis of non-capital expenditure.  We will be able to use non-capital expenditure for the urban renewal provisions and for a number of others.  The reception and integration centres will involve capital expenditure.  I am reasonably satisfied we can make a very good start on that during the course of 2022 and the budget will not be an issue as such.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the housing crisis issue the Deputy raised, certainly we are very conscious that we are attempting to provide additional accommodation which we regard as very important during what is a significant housing crisis.  However, not in any way to diminish what we are trying to do, we are conscious that we are catering for a relatively modest number of people.  At any one time we want to provide for 3,500 people working their way through the system.  Relative to the total number looking for accommodation, this is small.  I am not in any way diminishing the challenge that faces us but we are a relatively small component of a much larger issue to do with the housing crisis.  That is a good thing in terms of being able to move ahead.<\/p> <p>  With regard to income support payments, a very important point raised by the Deputy was the fact that when you move to phase two, you will no longer benefit from the in-kind and direct benefits given to people in phase one.  Clearly we will take full account of that.  The income support approach we are designing will be based on a payment that takes account of the fact that people are now living in the community and have to organise themselves accordingly.  We are probably looking at the supplementary welfare allowance or an equivalent rate of payment for phase two applicants once they leave phase one.  That takes account of the fact that they will be living in the community and will have a much more significant expenditure profile and cost of living than in phase one.<\/p> <p>  With regard to child welfare and inspections, we place a huge emphasis on that.  We have been concerned to ensure they are done properly.  We have done inspections in the current year and will continue doing those into next year.  At the moment, we have an arrangement where an external company does two inspections and then our International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, does the other one, so that is three.  The other good thing that will start in the near future is the HIQA approach which will start with monitoring and then move to inspections of our facilities.  That will be a very important step forward and will be seen as an independent, external monitoring of what we are doing.<\/p> <p>  In regard to inspections in the current year, if memory serves me correctly, although I will check with colleagues, we have done 55 inspections of facilities so far this year, of which 12 were done by IPAS and the other 43 by an external company.  We hope to meet our full target by the end of the year, and we are conscious of doing so, in order that we will meet the requirement or target we have set ourselves to ensure we at least three visits of each centre per year.  I hope that covers each of the points raised by Deputy O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their time and the statement.  I have a few questions, and I might leave some of them to the second round depending on my own availability.  When we last spoke with the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, about this, his office had dealt with a number of complaints and a number of issues had arisen particularly in light of the pandemic.  I recognise the work done on the White Paper but I also acknowledge the challenges that Covid-19 presented not only for the Department but for the service users and providers.  In that vein, I welcome the reforms around the complaint procedures the Secretary General, Dr. Lynch, outlined.  It is very welcome and it is timely.  Some might argue it is overdue but it is there now and that is important.<\/p> <p>  On Dr. Lynch's last comment on the 55 inspections, were they unannounced inspections or pre-arranged?  What is the breakdown?  If you want to have three inspections per year, is there a breakdown between notified and unannounced inspections?<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the White Paper and phase one.  I am wondering about those reception and integration centres.  Is there a likelihood that the existing ones will be redeveloped or are there going to be new ones because some of them are not fit for purpose?  Dr. Lynch might elaborate on that.<\/p> <p>  My second question for now, although I will come back in with others, is in regard to what Dr. Lynch said applicants receiving income support but only when they move into phase two.  For those in phase one, what are the income supports?  A number of years ago we had a reception centre in Dun Laoghaire for unaccompanied minors.  Obviously there was a big challenge in terms of their well-being and safety but equally there were constant challenges for them from a financial perspective.  What happens to families and individuals who are received under phase one of the proposed new reforms?

We have put in place a central processing and reporting of complaints mechanism.  We have also worked on an internal set of review meetings and discussions in relation to complaints, with a helpdesk in place as well.<\/p> <p>  We have placed a good deal of emphasis on dealing with people's complaints, be it in relation to the pandemic or other issues that they have.  We are also developing and scoping a consumer consultation group from our customer base in IPAS to try to seek input, observations and suggestions as to how we might develop that for future.  We have placed a good deal of emphasis on that in terms of complaints.<\/p> <p>  I can confirm that the inspections were all unannounced.  That is the way we do our business.  It is important that we would do it that way so that we ensure that we are seeing the centre as it genuinely is.<\/p> <p>  On the reception and integration centres, we are looking at different options at the moment.  I do not want to be too specific because decisions have not been made as yet, but certainly we are looking at the scope for locating some of those centres on existing sites.  They will be new build as opposed to the existing facilities.  We are also obviously looking at developing new centres in other parts of the country but one of them will be in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  On income support, there is already a system of income support in phase one.

It plans to train more staff to be decision-makers, to be able to conduct reviews and to carry out reports and to complete reports.  As I mentioned, it is streamlining its application process to try to expedite applications.  It has been hugely conscious, as have we, of the unfortunate backlogs that have built up, particularly over Covid, but indeed before that.  It is very concerned to make sure that we can develop a system that gives people responses within reasonable periods of time.  Its objective is to have a first decision, a decision of first instance, within six months, and a final decision within the subsequent six months.

We are very conscious of the stress that they have been through, that they may have mental health issues and that they may well have other needs.  They are likely to be vulnerable people and they do not come here for nothing.  As the Deputy said, they do not come here for holiday.  We completely agree and we want to treat them with absolute respect and dignity and to provide them with the best possible service we can to help integrate them into the community.  We talk about integration from day one, which is something on which we place a significant emphasis in the White Paper.<\/p> <p>  On the services available, when people arrive, one of the first things each person will be offered is a vulnerability assessment.  These vulnerability assessments have been taking place for all new arrivals since February of this year.  They are an important initial component of the service we provide to them.  We then, as appropriate, link people who have mental health needs to mental health services, including engaging with a number of mental health organisations.  We also link with the HSE and with health teams.  It is not simply a case of seeking to accommodate people in a particular place when they arrive and leaving it at that.  We place a great emphasis on what their needs are, be they mental, physical or otherwise.  We then try to agree with  them the best supports we possibly can provide and to provide those services as best we can.  That very much includes mental health services.<\/p> <p>  I could not agree more in regard to people's willingness to work.  The emphasis must be on their ability and willingness to work because we all know they are very interested in working, and in the great majority of cases, they can do so.  As the Deputy said, many of them are well qualified.  One of the good things that has happened in regard to the right to work, or the work permit, is that the timescale has been reduced from nine months to six months.  They can seek work after that and we will support them in terms of training and access to employment after six months within the international protection system.

I agree it is an ambitious programme and it is important to embrace that.  My view of it is that while it is ambitious, if we set ourselves a much longer timetable, the danger is that it would simply take that longer period of time to achieve.  Therefore, we have set ourselves something that is very challenging indeed.  I do not think we are being utterly unrealistic, but we are challenging ourselves.  We are taking what we have described as a multi-strand approach to the accommodation, so we are not putting all our eggs in one basket, so to speak.  We are talking about housing and apartments, we are talking about existing buildings, we are talking about rent-a-room, we are talking about private tenancies where these are required and so on.  We are not attempting to do this all through the one single means.<\/p> <p>  We are developing the implementation plan at the moment and we would hope to publish an implementation plan next year.<\/p><p>That will be very much a live and an iterative document.  It will change and we will update it as we go.  Our current version of it is very much in draft form so we deliberately have not published it.  However, we do have a web page where we keep people up to date with what is happening so far and the progress we have made.  The implementation plan will be quite a detailed document and we would hope to publish that next year.<\/p><p> In terms of realism and achieving what we are setting out to achieve, there are a couple of other points I would like to make.  We are using a project management approach, which is based on specifics of what you will do, when you will do it, how you will do it, the components that you need, the deadlines that you need to set and so on.  Another thing we are doing to be sure to be realistic about this is we are drawing on existing expertise in the area.  For example, the Housing Agency has been hugely helpful and supportive to us already.  We are working with the local authorities and with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, we have got a very strong programme board, as I mentioned earlier, and we are taking a phased approach.  It is a very ambitious programme, but one that is doable, although obviously challenging.<\/p><p> In terms of year-by-year progress, we have achieved much of what we set out to achieve this year so far.  For example, on the funding side, we have secured funding and a deeper commitment to give us additional capital expenditure should we require it in the current year.  We have managed to reduce the number of emergency centres, which I mentioned earlier.  The vulnerability assessments are in place.  We have also put a residential welfare team in place, which was of the things we were anxious to do in the current year.  We have a customer service team in place, and I mentioned earlier we were scoping out a customer consultation group.  The programme board is up and running and doing very good work.  It is giving us very good advice and information.  We talked briefly about the external advisory group.  The transition team is up and running.  We have national standards against which HIQA will be monitoring.  They have been in place since 1 January.  That is just a quick summary of the sort of things we have put in place so far this year.<\/p><p> Of course, I do not underestimate the number of things that have to be done in subsequent years.  There is much to be done, but we have made good progress this year.  I see this year and the early part of next year as very much developmental and very much in the context of planning and being ready to put bricks and mortar in place thereafter.

The Secretary General said it would include representatives of Departments, agencies, NGOs, a person who has transitioned through the direct provision system, which is very welcomed, and relevant experts.  There is also a programme board which is chaired by the Secretary General and there is a separate external advisory group.  Will the Secretary General go through that again?  I am looking at the structures and I made notes as the Secretary General spoke.  We have two programme boards, one from the Secretary General's Department and one from the Department of Justice.  We have a co-ordination committee, we have an International Protection Support Services, IPSS, transition team, we have an external advisory group, we have the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality and we have a risk committee.  I understand that it is complex but I hope we have tried to simplify it.  If that is the aim, it scares me that there are so many different oversight committees.  I hope for the Secretary General's sake that he is not sitting on each one of those.  For myself and other committee members, would the Secretary General run through that again so we can see how they all fit in with each other?<\/p> <p>  As we know, stakeholders can be very broad.  Who are we hoping will fill the roles on these very important committees and oversight groups?  Speaking of people who have already transitioned though the system, as it were, I would like to hear the voices of current service users, be they adults or minors.  The only way we can really and truly learn is from those who are experiencing it.  That is not to detract from those who have gone through it, but by the time this is implemented, the system will have hopefully radically changed.<\/p> <p>  On the programme boards, what integration and co-operation will there be between the two Departments?  It scares me to have two programme boards in two different Departments.  I am worried about duplication or things falling through the gaps.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the Ombudsman, Mr. Tyndall's appearance at this committee, one of the big concerns highlighted was in respect of individuals who currently look to stay where they are being told they have to move, move school, move the whole family to another part of the country and without any regard for their feeling about it.  How is that going to change with the full implementation of the White Paper?  What can we expect from the perspective of those who want to relocate?<\/p> <p>  I refer to respecting people's cultural and religious ethos.  The Secretary General mentioned a new customer service phone line, which is wonderful.  I am wondering about the languages skills of those agents.  The Secretary General mentioned literature being distributed.  How broad is that?<\/p> <p>  The issue of unaccompanied minors is sadly a huge one, which could potentially get worse over the next few years.  What specifically are we going to do to improve the reception and the greeting those individuals get, given the fear they faced getting here in the first place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#F00700","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and I will try to deal with those questions.  He raised a very important question on the overall governance of the system.  I agree that at first glance it may look very complex, and I take the point about the different groups.  We have tried to streamline it and to make it as straightforward as we possibly can.  For completeness, we have included all the different components.  However, the major one in the first instance is the Minister and this Department in terms of taking responsibility for trying to pull all of this together.<\/p> <p>  On the programme board, we regard this as a particularly important component of the total.  We then have the external advisory group.  I will say a little bit about both of those.  The other programme board in the Department of Justice is dealing specifically with the processing issues and how to improve those and at how to deal with the issues in the White Paper that deal with its part of the agenda.  Even though it may look complicated, we can pull together the rest fairly successfully within our Department and through bilateral engagements with the other Department as well.  We have a very good working relationship with the Department of Justice.<\/p><p>For example, my colleague, Ms Carol Baxter, from our Department, sits on its programme board and we have a colleague in the Department of Justice who sits on our programme board, so there are good interlinkages between the two Departments.  The programme board has a former resident of the direct provision system who is making a significant contribution to it.  In terms of other stakeholders, these include the Departments, such as the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Health, Justice as well as our Department.  There is also the Irish Refugee Council, the Children's Rights Alliance, the UN High Commissioner, the Housing Agency, somebody with a health and social care background and an expert in programme management.  That board is functioning very well so far and gives us advice and strong information and links us with organisations with which we would otherwise not have a strong contact.  It also deals with monitoring, which is helpful to us.  <\/p><p> In regard to the external advisory group I mentioned, I would describe that as having an external, critical friend.  I used that term when I met the group last week and it liked it as it says we are not looking for a group that will pat us on the head or tell us we are doing a fine job.  We are looking for an external group that looks in critically and objectively and identifies what is going right, what is going wrong, why is it going wrong, why are things being delayed, what things could we do differently and what other approaches could we take and asks whether we have thought about X, Y and Z.  Those on the external advisory group are experts in their respective fields.  We will probably engage with them informally and bilaterally as well as every other way.<\/p><p> The other components described in the governance note we submitted as part of the briefing are all important, although I will not go into them now.  Each has its job to do and they are pulled together by the Department as a whole.  We have a co-ordination committee in the Department.  Pulling the whole thing together is the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality.  We will ensure that we are not simply going from one committee or one group to the next.  That is no way to do business and it would not help us to make progress.  However having people from these different organisations and agencies on a specific group gives us a contact point and a liaison point with them.  At the end of the note we circulated we identify many implementation partners ranging from Departments to the education and training boards to Tusla, the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities, the Housing Agency and so on.  It is a complex project about which there is no doubt.  We try to streamline the delivery of it as much as possible but I assure the committee that there is good co-operation between the different levels.<\/p><p> In regard to the other questions about moving to other parts of the country and the experience of some people in direct provision who were asked to move elsewhere, we will place a great emphasis on consultation and ensure people are consulted fully and we will try to the greatest extent possible to meet their needs and concerns in terms of what part of the country they will be in.  There will be no question of simply uprooting people from one part of the country and moving them to another.  We will place a good deal of emphasis on that.<\/p><p> In regard to language skills, our materials are translated and are available in a number of different languages - obviously in the languages most used by those involved - and we will continue to place emphasis on that so that communication is good.  Another important element of that is at orientation stage, we provide an offer of intensive English language courses for residents joining us for the first time to help them learn English as soon as possible.  That hopefully will improve their level of communication and integration to the system.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I thank the Secretary General.

The Secretary General mentioned he will start funding local authorities to co-ordinate integration at local level.  Apart from the housing side of things, are local authorities expected to do more in terms of integration?  If so, can the Secretary General clarify what we are looking at there?<\/p> <p>  The second point is on the commissioning of NGOs to provide supports particularly for vulnerable applicants.  \"Commissioning\" is the word I want clarity on there.

They will become involved in co-ordinating local provision of such things as health services, education and social services.  One of the important elements that we want to put in place, and which is already in place in some areas, is that of inter-agency working groups which will be chaired by local authorities.  They will include the education and training boards, the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others at local level.  We will have an inter-agency group that meets the needs of individuals at local level and that operates at local level.  The local authorities will play a particularly important role in regard to that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about NGOs.  They will be existing NGOs.  We are not particularly proposing the establishment of a further NGO for these purposes.  We have a very good working relationship with a number of NGOs which do very important work, including the Peter McVerry Trust, Depaul and others which provide very important services, understand the system on the ground very well and have provided very strong and important supports for people in the direct provision system.  We hope to be able to build on that.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the community integration fund, there is a fund of &euro;500,000 available for next year.  We are working on the criteria for that at the moment.  We hope to have that in place early in 2022.  These are important components of local delivery and we would stress the importance of locally based delivery and meeting people's needs at local level, while having an important co-ordination function at national level to ensure that everybody's experience is broadly the same and positive.  We will lay a good deal of emphasis on trying to do things at local level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I thank the Secretary General.

However, as I mentioned earlier in the meeting, the first priority is to move away from the congregated settings.  Some of the more recently provided direct provision centres are of a much higher quality and we are happier with those than the ones that were in place at an earlier stage but we are anxious to move away from the current system to the one described in the White Paper which is very much based on own-door accommodation and accommodation that properly meets the needs of individuals.<\/p><p> People are already entitled to free legal assistance at the beginning of their process.  We are conscious that is not perfect by any means and I understand the Department of Justice is reviewing the legal aid and the arrangements for legal aid.

As I said earlier, I was contacted about three quarters of an hour before this meeting.  The Secretary General's opening statement mentions that current residents have a right to expect quality service and we must ensure that it is functioning to meet their needs during the transition period.  I do not doubt that.  I was horrified to receive reports about people in two direct provision centres being fed out of plastic bags.  Meat and other food was being put into plastic bags and Styrofoam boxes.  In one of the centres, the residents were told to eat in their rooms because there was not room in the dining area for them.  I received these reports about two different centres.  I quickly checked before I came in and one of the centres received &euro;11 million in funding last year.  I have no doubt that the Department is not treating people like that, but some of these centres' health and safety is out the window if these reports are true.  That kind of treatment of any person or people is inhumane.  Deputy Buckley spoke about the countries and situations people have come from.  To think that some centres, which are making massive amounts of money, would treat any human being like that is disgraceful.  Will the Secretary General comment on that if he can?  Was he aware of that?<\/p> <p>  I was made aware of another death in a centre in the west of Ireland over the weekend.  The venue is unknown, or I have not been told where it is.  Apparently, this is the second such death in the last couple of weeks.  I was horrified to hear that.  Criticism has been laid at feet of the Government over the lack of transparency around deaths in direct provision centres.  Previously, records were released each year on the number and nature of deaths of people seeking international protection.  However, the Department of Justice stopped providing those details two years ago.  Why was that change made?  Why is the public no longer being made aware of the causes of deaths of people in direct provision centres?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#H00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":414,"content":"<p>The issues the Chair raised go to the heart of the humanity of the system and we place a huge emphasis on getting these issues right.  The suggestion that people would be treated inappropriately or inhumanely would be absolutely anathema to what we are about.  We are certainly aware of the reports the Chair referred to.  We investigated the report of food being offered in plastic bags or plastic containers very carefully and we found no evidence of it at all.  I would stress that if any resident has a complaint of any sort relating to that or anything else, he or she has the absolute right to make a complaint and I strongly encourage him or her to do so.  However, in that particular instance, we found no evidence.  We reviewed video footage and discussed the matter locally with the centre provider and we were not in a position to find any evidence.<\/p> <p>  I am not familiar with the other issue about people being told to eat in their rooms.  I know there was an issue at one stage in relation to Covid practises and Covid-related restrictions where it was necessary for residents to take certain precautions, but no more than the rest of us would have.  However, if there are specific issues that residents or others want to raise about unsatisfactory or inappropriate practises in individual direct provision centres, we will be more than happy to investigate those.<\/p> <p>  On the deaths, I do not want to comment on individual cases.  Where a death occurs, we provide significant support to family members and other residents in the facility.  We have a particular reporting policy and we published a new policy earlier this year, which has been in place since June 2021.  In it, we specify numbers of deaths and circumstances.  However, we have to be very careful to respect the privacy of individuals and their families.  Therefore, we are very careful about how we deal with individual cases and how we respond to queries about them.  However, we publish details of them.  It is important to acknowledge that the cause of death and the fact of the death need to be confirmed through the normal channels, through the coroner and so on, if that is required, rather than through our system.  We wait until those appropriate provisions have been observed before recording them formally in the information that we publish.  We publish information on deaths in direct provision but we lay a particular emphasis on the supports that we offer to the family of the deceased first and to other affected residents in the facility.  This is very much part of basic humanity and it is something that we place a great emphasis on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021111100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I understand the Secretary General cannot speak about individual cases and I would not expect it.

I place the blame solely on those who own the centres.  If found guilty, the centres should be closed down as soon as possible.

There are well-developed structures in place for making those complaints and there is absolutely no question of them being in any way negatively affected as a result of having made a complaint.  It is very important that we get that message across.  I hope the complaint system that we now have in place and the fact that we have a resident welfare team and a customer service team in place helps get across the message that we are open to hearing people's complaints.  We would far prefer to hear people's complaints and try to deal with them, rather than hearing about them subsequently or perhaps people feeling that they have to go elsewhere.

We are going back to more than 400 years ago when King James I bequeathed something in Youghal.  We cannot even develop a marina there, believe it or not.  We are still backing that today.<\/p> <p>  I looked at the two cases here and I remember the case of Mr. Barrett which was before the last committee meeting.  There was substantial information in it.  Even in the midst of a Covid pandemic - the dogs in the street would know this - there is photographic evidence showing that there was development on the estuary between 31 August and 28 October.  It is from a greenfield site to what looks like the base of another jetty.  I do not know if members can see that.  Certainly, if this is ongoing, and these two petitioners in particular have mentioned it, I very strongly welcome the recommendations from the committee on this.

We have all seen the advertising campaign &ldquo;When stroke strikes, act F.A.S.T.&rdquo;, but why is it that we must act fast?  When a person has a stroke, brain cells are destroyed.  Therefore, it can affect them physically, cognitively and emotionally.  Some people are left unable to move limbs or have balance or co-ordination issues, while other people&rsquo;s ability to swallow may be impacted or lost.  Some stroke survivors are left with damage to their brain which leads to issues with communication, a personality change, an inability to process information properly or a drastic alteration in their thinking skills.  Stroke affects everybody differently and no two recoveries are the same.<\/p> <p>  I went from being an active, independent 33-year-old to someone who woke up in ICU, could not hold a spoon to feed herself and was not able to string a few words together to form a coherent sentence, and I am one of the lucky ones.  I could not understand why people did not know what I was saying as I did not realise that what I was thinking in my head was not coming out of my mouth.  The care and support I received in hospital was amazing.  Many stroke survivors are discharged into the care of a rehabilitation centre or perhaps a nursing home to continue their recovery.  Some of us are discharged home, which in theory sounds amazing.  However, in the ten days I spent in St James&rsquo;s Hospital, I came in contact with doctors, consultants, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, a dietician, radiographers, an occupational therapist, stroke and epilepsy nurses and the list goes on.  I went from being surrounded by medical professionals 24-7 in hospital to nothing.  Not one medical expert came to our house following my discharge.  At this time there were a huge number of everyday tasks that I could not do for myself.   There were no follow-up services for me once I was discharged.  There was no one to check on me.<\/p> <p>  The first time I needed to wash myself, I stood in front of the shower for a full five minutes trying to figure out how to turn it on.  I only had to press one button but I had no idea what to do.  I had to negotiate a social welfare system that is complicated at the best of times.  It is worse when I could not even retain one sentence's worth of information.   I had to relearn how to make simple food like toast or a cup of tea.  I had to figure out how to tie my shoe laces.  I had to work out how I was supposed to get my medication.  These are simple everyday tasks but for people with brain injuries every little thing is difficult, confusing and exceptionally tiring.<\/p> <p>  Of course, my family and friends rowed in as best they could but where was the public health nurse?  Where was any community home care team checking in on me?  Why was no carer set up to see us through the first few weeks to help with the huge adjustment to be made when a stroke survivor returns home?  Where was the counsellor to talk through this life-changing event with me?  Where was the speech and language therapist to help me improve and adapt to my communication difficulties?  Where was the physiotherapist to get me moving?  Where was the phone call to remind me that I had a hospital appointment and to see if I could make it to hospital given that I was no longer able to drive. <\/p> <p>  I was put on a waiting list to be assessed by the National Rehabilitation Hospital and in the interim I had appointments with my neurological consultants.  Only for a fantastic GP, I had nobody else looking out for me.  It took from August 2019 until February 2020 to get an appointment with the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  Typically, stroke survivors make the greatest improvement in the first few months following their stroke; it was five and a half months before I was even assessed.  I am not blaming anyone.  It is clear that our health service is understaffed, under-resourced and underfunded.  <\/p> <p>  I am not alone in my story.  In my Irish Heart Foundation young stroke survivors group there is a woman who has yet to receive any follow-up 14 months after her stroke.  A gentleman who had four further strokes and has now lost movement in his right side was refused an electric wheelchair as he made three attempts to end his life.  Ironically, the reason he attempted to end his life was because he had received no support and was confined to his bed.  The consequence of this was the very reason he was refused an electric wheelchair.  After unsuccessful lobbying of politicians and the health board for several years, he eventually raised enough funds to buy his own wheelchair.  I am relieved to report it arrived a few weeks back and his new lease of life is indescribable.  As another member put it: &ldquo;Once you leave the hospital you are just left to figure it out by yourself.  It&rsquo;s impossible to access more services unless you have deep pockets&rdquo;. <\/p> <p>  I was affected neurologically.  I can have trouble communicating, remembering words, and remembering the meanings of words.  I find it very difficult to organise myself.  I have issues with my memory and find it hard to read and retain pieces of information anymore.  It is incredibly hard for me to multitask.  Silly things like when I am walking down the street and it starts to rain, I have to stop to zip up my coat as I cannot walk and zip it up.  I still have trouble putting keys in locks.<\/p> <p>  I am a primary school teacher by profession.  Although it has been two years, I am still not recovered enough to return to work full-time.  I am in a catch-22 situation where I could possibly return one or two mornings a week and slowly build back up to full-time, but the Department of Education will not accommodate me.  There are a huge number of stroke survivors whose work places cannot, or will not, adapt sufficiently to allow them to return to work.  These are people who could be back in work, paying taxes and moving forward in their lives, who have the right to return to work, but are not being given sufficient support and opportunity to do so. <\/p> <p>  Fourteen months after my stroke I discovered the Life After Stroke Irish Heart Foundation Facebook page and everything changed for me.  In my young stroke survivors support group there are people my age and younger who I can relate to.  We can do exercise classes online daily and can join activities such as music, bingo or quizzes.  Classes are run to promote brain activity through poetry, art and cooking.  Talks are given by professionals on fatigue, the importance of diet and exercise, mindfulness, adapting to our new lives, etc.  I have been able to speak to a counsellor.  I have access to a stroke nurse.  I can call my stroke co-ordinator at any time and families of stroke survivors also have support.  The Irish Heart Foundation stroke check-in service provides practical supports and assists stroke survivors living as well as possible at home.  Why can something similar not be run by the HSE?  Why are these types of services not a given for all stroke survivors upon discharge from hospital? <\/p> <p>  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste don deis a chaint inniu. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Bardon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear to discuss stroke, Ireland&rsquo;s third biggest killer disease and our biggest cause of acquired disability.  In her statement, Ms Bardon outlined a sense of abandonment that is unfortunately replicated every day among thousands of stroke survivors countrywide.  At a time of intense personal crisis, many people are confronted with a therapy wasteland after being discharged from hospital, often resulting in disability that is avoidably severe and prolonged.<\/p> <p>   Approximately 7,500 people have a stroke here each year and up to 70%, which is over 5,000 people, will be discharged with a disability.  That number will soar in the years ahead with a predicted increase in stroke incidence up to 12,000 by 2030.  During the last decade there has been a dramatic improvement in acute stroke care, despite residual under-investment and major staffing shortages.  The death rate has fallen by over 25% and permanent severe disability has been substantially reduced.  More people than ever are returning home after stroke but there has been no corresponding investment in community rehabilitation and life after stroke services that enable survivors to make the best possible recovery.  This is clearly at odds with the commitment in the UNCRPD to full participation of people with disabilities in public, economic and social life, all the more so because the chronic deficits that exist cannot be blamed on prohibitive cost.  There is no shortage of spending on stroke in the State.  The problem is how these resources are spent.  Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, research for the Irish Heart Foundation found State expenditure of up to &euro;414 million on nursing home accommodation for stroke survivors, but just &euro;7 million on community rehabilitation services that can enable people to remain living at home.<\/p><p>In effect, the health system starves recovery services of resources, waiting until after it can help people maximise their recovery and then spending vast amounts on institutional care that is often inappropriate, particularly for younger stroke survivors.<\/p><p> Much of what is needed to start eliminating deficits in hospital services can be delivered through the implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s first national stroke strategy, which remains unpublished four years after being requested by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  Among many important developments, it will tackle shocking hospital service gaps such as just 4% of patients currently receiving a psychological assessment after their brain attack and one in 20 getting early supported discharge services, which have been proven to reduce disability and overall health service costs simultaneously.<\/p><p> However, we also need a plan that focuses on the post-discharge deficits highlighted so eloquently by Ms Bardon.  Perhaps the best illustration of the lack of priority in this area is that the health authorities have never attempted to quantify how many stroke survivors there are in the State.  The figure of 30,000 that it has used comes from an estimate based on international studies that are a quarter of a century old.  Studies by the Institute of Public Health and UK comparisons suggest the real figure is approximately 90,000 people.  This raises two questions - how can the needs of stroke survivors be met when they remain unknown, and is there any intention to ever meet these needs?<\/p><p> Meanwhile, survivors are forced to navigate community services that, if they exist at all, have been developed in a fragmented and often age-specific way, discriminating against older survivors in some areas and younger ones in others.  This makes accessing appropriate services even more difficult.  Research carried out by the Irish Heart Foundation found particularly stark deficits facing younger survivors.  For example, almost half of them either paid privately for physiotherapy or did not receive a service.  However, the hidden impacts of stroke provided the biggest difficulties.  Of the respondents, 95% suffered anxiety, 75% were depressed and 72% felt isolated, with no help available.  Meanwhile, 71% did not get the counselling they needed and although 88% were in work before their stroke, just 36% were working when surveyed.  The Irish Heart Foundations is addressing these deficits as best we can through a range of life-after-stroke services, including face-to-face support groups that are beginning to reopen post pandemic, a dedicated younger survivor network that Ms Bardon mentioned and a national phone support service assisting survivors to make the transition home.  We also run specialised programmes, including counselling, fatigue management, emotional well-being and peer-to-peer phone support.  Just a fraction of service costs are covered by statutory funding, however, which threatens their sustainability.<\/p><p> We remain a long way from meeting our obligations to stroke survivors as set out in the UN convention.  Crucial first steps include publication and full implementation of the national stroke strategy, research to establish the number of stroke survivors in Ireland and a comprehensive assessment of their service and support needs, and development of a pathway covering the entirety of life after stroke.  For people such as Fiona, the model of care lasts a few weeks and then it is effectively abandoned even though the person has to live with the effects of his or her stroke for decades afterwards in many cases.  This pathway must include a right to a discharge plan and services available in the community as and when they are required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Macey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss acquired brain injuries.  I listened to the remarks of Ms Bardon and I could raise many of the same issues she did.  The same issues are arising for people with acquired brain injury on discharge from hospital.  I am starting at the end, in a way, because of the way things are evolving.  I recently found a letter that I wrote many years ago regarding the lack of brain injury services and it is as relevant today as it was back then.  Not a lot has changed and that is very disappointing, given that Ireland has ratified the UNCRPD.  There has been no improvement in services to align with the various articles of the convention.<\/p> <p>  There are approximately 800,00 people in Ireland with a neuro-disability or condition.  These figures include people with people who have had a stroke.  There are 120,000 people living with disability following an acquired brain injury and 98,000 people sustain a brain injury annually, ranging from mild brain injury through to very traumatic and serious brain injury.  In addition, there are 40,000 people with epilepsy.  Many of these conditions can coexist, that is, many people with acquired brain injury have a dual diagnosis and need several different types of clinical and rehabilitational services.<\/p> <p>  There is a lack of structure from acute hospital services through specialist rehabilitation and there are no step-down facilities, community services or supports in place.  In 2011, the national strategy and policy for provision of neuro-rehabilitational services in Ireland implementation framework 2019-21 was published.  Ten years on, there is very little to show for it.  There has been no roll-out of community neuro-rehabilitation services and teams as envisaged and planned.  There are a few pockets of services provided by Acquired Brain Injury Ireland and Headway Ireland, but these are limited to a few geographical areas and there is no implementation of the strategy as envisaged.  It is fragmented and sparse.  There is nothing resembling the national clinical programme for neurology model of care published by the national neurology programme working group and the clinical advisory group for the national clinical programme for neurology.<\/p> <p>  There are long waiting lists for neurological beds in Beaumont Hospital and, despite a complete rebuild of the National Rehabilitation Hospital, there was no net increase in capacity, particularly for people with brain injury.  There is a long waiting list for rehabilitation and many people with acquired brain injury do not get a bed at all but are left at home for families to cope with, as Ms Bardon just outlined, or to cope by themselves, depending on their circumstances, as best they can.  We are back to a situation like that which existed back in 1988.  I will speak about my personal experiences later.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the HSE national clinical programme for epilepsy model of care document that was launched in January 2017, nearly five years ago, has not been implemented, not even in part.  Indeed, the services for people with epilepsy have deteriorated.  In fact, according to a report by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland in March 2021, there are 22,000 people on a waiting list to see a neurologist, an increase of 40% in the past five years.  That is seriously under-resourced and many people are becoming seriously disabled or dying as a result.  Ms Bardon touched on that issue.  The recommended number of neurologists for epilepsy is 35 but the actual number is 22.  That is epilepsy alone.  The waiting times have lengthened, especially in the past two years.<\/p> <p>  There are no provisions for transport or community integration for people with acquired brain injury.  There were three different types of transport schemes to help people with transport but I understand that at this time all three have been withdrawn, with nothing to replace them.  Many seriously disabled people are unable to access public transport even if it is available.  It can be an expensive trip to a Dublin hospital, especially given the cost of fuel and parking and so on.  There is no support or provision for any of this and many people cannot get outside their homes unless they have a car and a person to drive it.  I do not know whether anyone present watched the recent \"Prime Time\" television programme on wards of court, which had quite a lot of content on disability and brain injury.  These people cannot afford to do these things on disability allowance or any other meagre allowance.  The disability allowance does not equate with the cost of living.  All present will be aware that the cost of living with a disability is an added financial burden as people must fund many services and items from their own pocket.<\/p><p>The cost of heating their homes has escalated to an extraordinary degree.  Something will have to happen or people will end up sick, in hospital or in nursing homes.<br\/><br\/>Increases in funding for disability services have been announced in recent budgets and from time to time.  That will take time to filter down, and we are still playing catch-up with figures pre-2008, when services fell through the floor.  We know that from what is happening in the public sector, across the board, in hospitals and so on.  That affected disability services to an extraordinary degree.  I have been witness to that because I was there at the coalface each and every time all those changes happened.  We do not seem to see the budgetary increases filtering down to actual changes to or improvements in services.<br\/><br\/>Our eldest son was involved in a road traffic accident in 1988 and suffered a catastrophic brain injury as a passenger in a car.  He was on life support for many weeks in Beaumont Hospital and, later, underwent rehabilitation in the National Rehabilitation Hospital after a lengthy wait and a stressful time trying to get a bed there.  It is the same now.  That is very serious because that was 1988.  There is no follow-up for patients who are discharged, and families or individuals living on their own are left to cope.  It depends on their circumstances; that is where the outcomes change.  Some families have a lot of support and others do not.  It depends very much on the families concerned.  We spent hours travelling to various hospitals where doctors threatened discharge, and eventually there was discharge.  At that time, as would be the case now, there was no follow-up and no service at all.  My son did well with the rehabilitation on offer at the time, but it was not specifically brain injury rehabilitation.  He was eventually allowed home for weekends.  He was prematurely discharged then and there was no planning, no support and no services.  He was not fit to be discharged and needed further rehabilitation, but that was not available.<br\/><br\/>We were expected to care for our son in our own home without any help whatsoever.  The impact of all that on the family was profound because our son had no insight into his difficulties, having a brain injury.  I was working at the time, and when I tried to get help I was told it was my responsibility to stay at home and take care of him.  We spent endless hours trying to find out more about brain injury and how we could help him.  Back in 1988, that was difficult because we had no access to the Internet or information at the touch of a button, as we do now.<br\/><br\/>Eventually we found rehabilitation services in the UK.  We got there after quite a long fight.  In the meantime, the Office of Wards of Court was involved.  I will not go into that here, but it is a limiting factor as regards what a person with a disability can do.  We had to fight a battle with the services here to get a referral to the UK, and we had to fight a battle to get our son his own funding to take him to the UK.  There was absolutely no physical or financial help for us to do any of that.  It was an absolutely terrible time.<br\/><br\/>Then, when our son eventually benefited from the services in the UK, the recommendation, after nearly two and a half years, was that he return to live semi-independently here with support for a trial period, with a view that that would continue.  Of course, there were no more services here at that point than there had been earlier, so he still had no services and we were left scrambling around for physiotherapy and other support to help him.  He had been involved with a number of projects that had some support when he lived in Dublin but they did not work out very well because there was a lack of coherence and a lack of structure.  It was very <i>ad hoc<\/i>and falling apart because there was no one co-ordinating it all.<br\/><br\/>He developed epilepsy and, with the acquired brain injury, that became a really difficult time.  It exacerbated the difficulties he was experiencing as a person with a brain injury.  Over the years, when he returned back home to live semi-independently in his own home, we tried to get services for him.  There was a constant battle over the 1990s and 2000s, and we still had to go back and forth to the UK many times for services which we could not get here or which were of such poor quality here that we ended up going to the UK for them anyway.<br\/><br\/>Chris's father and I, in our 70s now, have been providing support and care for all those years.  When we reached 70 we thought something had to change and we had a lot of meetings and confrontations with the HSE - and I do say &quot;confrontations&quot; because the meetings were contentious.  The HSE officials were saying, &quot;No, you cannot have&quot;, and we were saying, &quot;He needs&quot;.  We were constantly explaining what our son needed and they were telling us what they were giving us.  I was saying, &quot;I do not need anything.  My son has these needs.  This is the assessment and these are his needs.&quot;  Eventually, we got enough services to allow him to continue living in his own home.  That is working quite well for him and for us, and for that, to anyone who might hear this, we are extremely grateful to those involved who managed to make that happen, despite all the odds being stacked against us.<br\/><br\/>There is no comprehensive shared protocol involving all the different disciplines now involved.  That means gaps and confusion.  You have a physio or an occupational therapist with the HSE, an acquired brain injury service doing another thing, another service provider doing home support, the clinical end and the GP.  You see all these moving parts and you have no one person with all the information in any one place.  It becomes extremely frustrating and difficult and, for us, to step back from this and allow it to progress as it should is impossible because it keeps coming back to me as it seems like I am the reservoir of all information for everything and everybody.  There is insufficient physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychology services, and appropriate brain injury services are not available in every area.  Even what is available is not often suitable to a person who may be, like our son, 30 years post injury.  The services are very much geared towards people who are newly injured.  There is a very different type of service need in that regard, and there is a lack of recognition and probably a lack of service funding - I do not know - to separate out those services and provide different types of services for different categories of people with acquired brain injury.  There is no day service and no centre to hold the service all together.<br\/><br\/>Our son's life lacks meaning and purpose.  It seems like all our work still was not enough to get our son and others like him the services that are recommended and needed.  There are no stand-alone specific brain injury services, despite all the reports and recommendations that have been made and accepted.  They are included in the overall disability services.  There are insufficient physiotherapists, occupational therapists, neuropsychologists and other clinical staff.  There is no one to replace them when they go on leave, which may be for an extended period, during which the person is left high and dry, without any service, or a reduction in an already meagre service.  At one stage a whole year went by when our son did not have any physiotherapy input.  That would have a hugely detrimental impact on him and he would be regressing.  It is a constant battle to keep the services and to keep going.  The situation since the advent of Covid has been very difficult, with a lot of services and face-to-face meetings with clinicians.  Case reviews have been held via online forums and there are continuous gaps.  You have to look for everything.  Protocols that were in place in respect of spasticity, for example, appear no longer to apply.  The rules change without explanation.<br\/><br\/>I wish to raise an issue as an aside, if I may.  There is a big problem with online forums.  Everybody now assumes that everybody is online and can do Zoom meetings or whatever else.  The software the committee uses is not Zoom, but members know what I am saying.  It is an online forum.  I cannot state this strongly enough.  I do not have this problem, thank goodness, but many people my age and people with brain injury are not able to access these forums, and not alone that, but in a lot of areas - we see this in the newspapers every day - there is no broadband.  You need up-to-date equipment to be able to access these forums.  You cannot access them on a ten-year-old computer.  It probably will not be able to do it.  It is therefore not feasible for everybody to do this.  I just wanted to place that before the committee as an aside, but it is across the board, I think, very important for everybody.<br\/><br\/>That is my piece.  I thank the committee and the Chairman for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Farrell and our two other witnesses.

I have a general habit on Thursdays of going to the Seanad after these meetings and calling it out.  To be fair, the Leader, Senator Regina Doherty, has facilitated us thus far in giving an opportunity to discuss the cost of disability.  A debate is scheduled on that in the coming weeks.  There are things we are hoping to action.  My colleagues here who are also in the Seanad are very good at coming in and articulating this.<\/p><p> As Ms Farrell spoke last, I will begin with her.  Where to begin?  It is appalling that while she is such a fantastic advocate for her son, and clearly determined and able to advocate and fight tooth and nail for him, there are families who do not have a Mary Farrell.  I find that quite frightening.  We should not have a situation where it depends on the capacity and ability of family members to determine the quality of life of an individual where there have been life-changing incidents such as these.<\/p><p> Clearly, a medical model is operating whereby, in the immediate aftermath of whatever has occurred, there is some sort of a minimum threshold that says \"You are fine now, off you go\", and people are left in their own.  I gleaned this also from Ms Bardon's experience, and the experiences of others that the witnesses have recounted.  That is not okay.  This is all foreseeable and it is very annoying.  If a multidisciplinary team was pulled together, somebody could probably sit down and draw a spider diagram of everything that are going to be needed, put together a package and figure out a co-ordination system.  I do not have a medical background but I imagine that anyone with any sort of administrative ability would be able to foresee and pull together the competencies, and be able to have a bespoke plan such as that produced by the Irish Heart Foundation.  I fail to understand how this has not happened and how it is all so disjointed.<\/p><p> I am very grateful that we hear from people such as the witnesses who are willing to come forward and so generously share their own stories.  It is a vulnerable and difficult thing to do, but it is also enraging and empowering for people like me to be able to refer to people such as Ms Barton and Ms Farrell.  I can say that they have come into the committee and this is what they have said, and ask what we are going to do about it with a sense of anger and outrage on their behalf.<\/p><p> I will come to the specifics.  I agree about the issues relating to digital poverty and accessibility.  We seem to be moving to a presumption that everybody has access and ability.  We heard from a witness some weeks ago regarding an injury who talked about the inability of people to use the digital platform.  We need to examine that as well as everything else.<\/p><p> Earlier this week, I watched the wardship documentary on \"Prime Time\".  It was outrageous.  My question is on that and the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  Does that Act make any difference for Ms Farrell and her son and if not, why not?  We could have a to-do list coming out of that.  If so, how can we enhance that?<\/p><p> Ms Bardon related her story.  I will come back to her employment in a moment.  I would first like to come back to the gentleman in her group who was refused an electric wheelchair.  That suggests that the criteria for qualification are askew.  It should be about what he needs, but somebody is adding in other qualifying criteria that assess something else beyond where it should be.  What are Ms Bardon's views on that?  When a person demonstrates the need, that is it and it should be automatic.  No other aspects should be factored in.<\/p><p> I am not ignoring everything that was said but I am anxious about Ms Bardon getting back to work.  By profession I am an employment and privacy lawyer.  I would look at this through that lens and I would ask why Ms Bardon is not being given reasonable accommodation and why all of that is not happening.  Is it to do with Covid-19, or is Covid being used as an excuse?  I am interested in that.  I am confident that her situation is not unique.  If there is a systemic issue that is not facilitating reasonable accommodation, then we need to call it out and name it.<\/p><p> The Irish Heart Foundation is extraordinary and fantastic.  I will say what the witnesses do not, which is that only 3% of its funding comes from the State, while 90% of it comes from fundraising.  The foundation is amazing.  I have family members who have benefited from its support.  Its work is extraordinary.  If we could take the Irish Heart Foundation model and turn it into how the HSE should do the business, we would be doing very well if we could only get a little bit of it.  I congratulate the witnesses and I thank them most sincerely.<\/p><p> What reasons have been given for the stroke strategy not being published?  Why commission something and then not act on it?  It seems extraordinary.  Were there flaws in the process of putting it together?<\/p><p> I apologise for taking so much time, I could do with having all the witnesses on my own for a while to understand this.  I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#D00300","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":448,"content":"<p>The gentleman I spoke of was just one of the main examples I used because I was scrolling back through our WhatsApp group when I was writing my speech.  He was the one that stood out most.  What seems to happen is, as Ms Farrell has said, a person might get something initially and then when the person applies for it a year or two later and it is denied on different grounds.  My understanding of his situation is that because he attempted to end his life, they felt that if he got a wheelchair it would give him more of an opportunity to try it again.  This man was bed bound and could not leave his house.  He could not go to see his grandchildren.  This is why he became so depressed and that is why he wanted to end his life.  It does not make any sense to me.  Over and over again so many people in our WhatsApp group are saying the exact same thing: \"We do not get the funding or we must pay for things ourselves.\"  This is fine if a person has the money.  If, however, a person does not have the money then he or she cannot do  it.  For example, when I presented with the stroke I had had a seizure and broke my left shoulder.  Because my stroke was on the left-hand side of my brain it was my right side that was affected.  One could say that luckily it balanced itself out somewhat.  I was discharged from hospital and I was not able to go to the gym to do classes and so on, things I would normally have been able to do.  I got myself a personal trainer recommended by my normal physiotherapist.  I had to pay for this myself as there has been no funding for that.  Money that I have been saving for years for a deposit for a mortgage is now being put into my physical needs.  On top of that there is counselling.  I previously attended a counsellor for other issues.  As soon as this happened I realised that I would definitely need to go for counselling again.  This has also come from the money I had saved towards my future.  It is &euro;60 per session.  I do not have that kind of money to squander away but my mental health is especially important.<\/p><p>If I do not use this money towards me getting better now, it might mean that I do not have a future.  This is a massive thing because I was lucky in that I had been bullied, you could say, by my aunt into getting salary protection when I became a teacher.  This salary protection means that I, thankfully, still have 70% of my wage coming in.  If I did not have salary protection, I would be getting long-term illness or disability, or whatever it is called at the moment.  I have effectively been pensioned off which means I am getting &euro;50 a fortnight because it is based on the amount of service.  Therefore, in total I would be getting less than &euro;1,000 a month.  I live in Dublin, I rent in Dublin, I have expenses, I have bills, I have to buy food and so on.  Aside from that, I have my personal training and my counselling.  That costs another &euro;400 per month, which is a lot.  At the moment I am getting 70% of my wage, but money is still very tight.  Things are expensive.  I have car and medical insurance to pay.  There are so many other things to pay for, and it is coming up to Christmas.  Due to Covid, you cannot go on holidays but these are things I would have taken for granted before.  I cannot get my hair and my nails done.  I cannot do any of those things anymore because I do not have the money.  These are things that are unforeseen.<\/p><p> I am fine now because I have worked so hard physically, but what happens if I have a transient ischemic attack, TIA, in a few years' time?  What happens if I go back to work and I realise I am not able for it and I need more speech and language therapy?  I am then put on a list and I might not be seen for two years.  Why is it not the case that if I realise I cannot do something that I am not assessed within six weeks?  When I got out of hospital, I was put on a community speech and language list, although I am not really sure what the programme was.  It has been two years and four months since my stroke and I have not heard from them yet.  That service does not exist to me.  Perhaps the lady went on maternity leave and took extended maternity leave.  I have not yet received that phone call and I do not know why I have not.<\/p><p> When I was with my consultant, he told me that I was well able to talk and hold a conversation for ten minutes so he was going to take me off the list for the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  Just because I can have a ten minute conversation does not mean I can do anything.  It is little things.  I can have normal conversations, but I cannot read.  I have not been able to read a book or a novel since.  I read since I was a child and would have read three books a month.  Since then I have read the guts of two books.  One of them was from the What a Complete Aisling book series.  It was not a book that I had to concentrate on and read every single detail.  This is the kind of place where the speech and language therapist might come in.<\/p><p> I cannot speak on behalf of people with physical disabilities because I was really lucky in that I recovered physically.  I did not have very much weakness on my right-hand side and because I had broken my left shoulder, it kind of balanced itself out.  I am not the best person to talk about physically difficulties because I do not have that general experience.  However, I chatted to other people and one of them was said that it was the tiny things that you cannot do.  For example, I woke up this morning when my alarm was going off and I rolled over and turned it off.  If you cannot turn over in the bed, you cannot turn the alarm clock off yourself.  You cannot get out of bed by yourself.  You cannot walk to the toilet and you cannot sit on the toilet.  You cannot wash your hands by yourself.  The gentleman described to me standing and trying to wash his face.  His dominant side was affected, so he is now using, let us say, his left hand.  He said he was washing everywhere but his face and that by the time his hand got to his face, there was no more water.  That is just the first few minutes of the day, and that kind of thing happens all day long.<\/p><p> There are the little things.  As I mentioned earlier, what you are trying to say in your head cannot actually come out of your mouth.  You do not realise that what you thought you said does not match up exactly with what is coming out of your mouth.  You are watching people, you are looking at their reaction and you are trying to watch their body language.  You realise that something has gone wrong but you are not quite sure why it has gone wrong.  It is with those learning processes over time that you see you have not done something right.  You are then trying to hide your deficits.  However, in doing so, you are nearly fooling yourself into the fact that you are getting better when you are not.  You are just better able to hide what is wrong with you.<\/p><p> I was asked about work.  Since I am a teacher, I was told I had to start back on two or three full days a week and then build up to five full days within the space of a term.  My neurological team has said I am not allowed to do that and that I have to start with one morning a week, then two mornings a week, then three mornings a week, and build back up that way.  However, the work policy around that states that I have to start back at two full days and work up to five full days.<\/p><p> I have gotten on to my union and to the Department of Education directly.  There seems to be no give on that.  When I asked the reason for that, I was told it was that substitute teachers are paid on a daily basis and not on a half-day basis.  It will not let me do one day a week while the substitute does four day.  It said that is not possible.<\/p><p> Another frustration for me is that if I return to work two days a week, I will only get two sevenths of my wage because it states there are seven days in a week.  We do not work seven days a week; we work five days a week.  It does not make any sense why I would only get two sevenths of my wages if I am working two days of the week.<\/p><p> If I decide my working days are Tuesday and Thursday, to give myself Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday to recover before working again, the weekend is still counted as sick leave.  I have exhausted all of my sick leave because if you are out on a Friday and a Monday, the Saturday and Sunday are counted as sick leave as well.  If you get sick the last day of the school term before the summer and you are sick the first day of the school term in September, all of the summer is counted as sick leave.<\/p><p> I had applied for a career break to go to Dubai.  That was the week I got sick, so I did not get on the airplane, thankfully.  I was told I would not have survived if I had gotten on the airplane.  I applied for sick leave straight away.  I was told I was on a career break so tough luck.  I did not get my sick leave until a year after.  Again, thankfully, salary protection stepped in there for me, so I was okay in that regard.<\/p><p> Obviously, there are other people in my situation as well.  When I asked the National Rehabilitation Hospital how we were supposed to get around this, it said there are so many teachers who come through the door that it is impossible.  It said it was going to have to see if it could build up my rehab days somewhere else.  There was one other thing I was trying to think of but it is gone out of my head.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Bardon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":450,"content":"<p>Mr. Macey, would you like to speak?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#F00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

Some &euro;50 million for new clinical strategies was announced in the budget, and stroke was not even mentioned.  That is something that we are used to.<\/p> <p>  The strategy itself is not a full strategy.  It was deliberately curtailed to increase its chances of getting funded.  It concentrates on acute service areas.  It will save lives and reduce disability and it will help people who have not had their stroke yet.  However, it will not do that much for people like Ms Bardon, who are living with the effects of stroke in the community.  That needs its own strategy.<\/p> <p>  Since we are at such a basic level, what we need to do first is count the number of people who have had a stroke or are living with the effects of stroke, before we can work out what they need.

We are talking about part 6 of the UN convention, the changes and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.  All of that is under review.  The amendments to the legislation have not been completed yet.  There are a lot of concerns, and different groups and different categories of people will have different issues.  We hope this is good news for everybody going forward from June.  The commencement of the DSS will be in June of next year.  That is good news for the people coming in, as they will no longer have to go through the Office of Wards of Court system.<\/p> <p>  Those who are currently in the system will transfer or discharge, and they will have to go through a court hearing in which they will be discharged into the new system.  It is not clear yet how many might eventually go through.  Some might be discharged.  There are different levels of support, so it will depend on what category of support they go into.  That will have to be decided in individual cases.<\/p> <p>   There is a huge focus now on the DSS when we raise any issues as wards of court.  We are in the wardship system.  Anyone who saw the \"RTE Investigates\" programme knows what I am talking about.  I hope anyone who has not seen it will get the opportunity to look at it.  It clearly shows many of the difficulties, which are only a sample or fraction of difficulties that exist in the wardship system.<\/p> <p>  We have been at this for more than 30 years, so you can imagine I have gone many a round with many people.  Faces change, but the problems remain the same.  We have gone a different route than many people.  For those who do not know, there are many restrictions on wards of court.  They cannot leave the country without permission so they cannot go on holidays abroad without permission.  They cannot make financial decisions, decisions about medical procedures, decisions about healthcare and decisions about all sorts of other issues.<\/p> <p>  Financial decisions is one part of it.  A person may be made a ward of court, often as a result of an acquired a brain injury in an accident.  The person is awarded compensation but that award will not be paid out until he or she is made a ward of court because that is part of it.  Senator Seery Kearney will understand that because of her background.  This is the process and even if you object to it, eventually the time will come when that is what will happen.  <\/p> <p>  We know of a couple of cases where people objected and were in the courts for a couple years.  They were deprived of the funding they needed to help the disabled person.  At the same time, they were trying to get out of the system and get the funding set up differently, such as a trust fund or something like that.  However, that is not possible.<\/p> <p>  Many people who are in wardship do not really meet the criteria for wardship.  One man on the \"RTE Investigates\" programme stated clearly that he had a brain injury but that it did not mean he was incapable of making decisions.  Many people like our son, that man and others in wardship would not meet the criteria for wardship if it was a test.  I have not tested it because the bottom line is that someone like our son needs protection and he needs his funds protected.  He needs a system there to support and protect him.  I cannot say that the wards of court system has supported or protected our son.  Members heard me discuss going to the UK for rehabilitation.  They would not believe the difficulties and the obstacles put in front of us in allowing us to do that.  From that day forward, we decided that this was not something we were going to let rule our lives.  We were going to fight it, when necessary to do something, but just jog along and do our own thing.  That is why our son lives in his own home and not with us.  We live quite nearby and we are able to support him.  Yet at the same time, he has that level of independence.  His dependence has grown with his disabilities, and that is partly due to the fact the services have not been.  You need maintenance for someone with an acquired brain injury.  People will say he has had rehabilitation but they do not understand that this is a lifetime effort.  You have to have maintenance, you have got to do physiotherapy and your exercises, you have to have your splinting and you have to have all the other additional services that go with that.<\/p> <p>  I refer back to the DSS because of the difficulties we have now.  When we have a parliamentary question asked, it is directed to the DSS.  We are told this is the solution and not to bother it because that is old hat.  This is the message we are getting, that is, that this is all old hat.  The DSS tells us this is the panacea and this is the solution to our problems and that it does not know what more we want.<\/p> <p>  There are many problems in wardship, and some of them will be addressed on leaving the wardship system.  There are outstanding issues that will have to be addressed, perhaps at a forum.  We have already discovered through various Oireachtas committees, reports and a D&aacute;il debate, that the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have authority to oversee these funds.  There is no oversight of this.  Despite these people being under the protection of the State, there is no oversight.  The State has no oversight.  We are told that this is a matter for the courts and that it is obliging us by giving us information but it has nothing to do with it.  The committees and everybody else have said it has nothing to do with them and to move on.<\/p> <p>  There are people who are financially compromised.  Elderly people, like ourselves, are providing the backup to allow these wards to continue living in their own homes and their properties.  What will happen when we are no longer able to do that?  These funds are missing, although \"missing\" is not the correct word.  Wards can no longer enjoy the funds that they should have.  This has to be addressed and the Oireachtas will have to find a method, a mechanism, a forum or a way of doing this.  We are adamant about this.  It is not going away.<\/p> <p>  Both Ministers said that this going to be fine and wonderful.  It will be wonderful in many cases and it will help enormously.  A three-year period is provided for in the legislation for the transition of wards from the wards of court system to the DSS.  During that time, many people are going to be in wardship.  DSS will commence in June of next year, and then there will be an additional three years.  Some people could be in wardship for two to three years.  As Ms Sarah Lennon from Sage Advocacy said, many people will die before they ever get out of the system.  There is a lot here but we will not cover it here.  It needs a separate forum for debate.  People's voices need to be heard on this.  That is all I can say about it.

Acquired disabilities are often overlooked and not discussed enough.  We know now that disabilities as a result of accident or illness make up a considerable percentage of people with disabilities, and it is a number that increases with age.  I have questions for each of the witnesses, if there is time.<\/p><p>If not, a written response would be great.  The first question is for Ms Farrell.  She highlighted the incredible barriers she faced and the continuing need to fight for services that most people would consider entirely reasonable and necessary.  One striking feature in her ordeal is the ongoing lack of co-ordination and poor communication within the HSE, which results in little or no therapies and many waiting lists.  Other witnesses have spoken about similar experiences.  Is it time for people such as Mr. Macey to be assigned a single advocate or case worker who can help co-ordinate everything and do the heavy lifting in arranging care, appointments and the like?  Second, can she elaborate on the impact of the lack of access to home care support or to personal assistant services and how increased access could improve the life of her son so he can enjoy life like everyone else?  Third, she described how there are no appropriate day or resource services for people with neurological disabilities.  Could she expand on this and on how access to appropriate day services could improve her son's life?<\/p><p> Ms Bardon described the massive difference between the care she received in hospital, with access to multidisciplinary teams and constant interventions, and absolutely nothing at home.  That cliff face of a lack of care is unbelievable.  I do not know how it is allowed to happen.  Again, it is a situation where there is an absence of joined-up thinking and a person-centred approach in the HSE.  It is truly shocking.  Can she elaborate on the difference that early interventions and supports at home would have made to her and her recovery?  Second, the unwillingness of the Department of Education to permit her to work part time and build up slowly to full-time is also disgraceful.  The Department has written to the committee outlining its commitment to the UNCRPD but we see the reality here.  Can Ms Bardon elaborate on how it could support her in returning to work?  She also highlighted the importance of online support groups as conduits of information and assistance.  That is also a common theme among people with disabilities and their families who appear before the committee.  They only learn about services and schemes and ways of accessing them through others.  She rightly called on the HSE to run these types of services.  Will she elaborate on that?<\/p><p> Finally, I have a brief question for Mr. Macey.  He mentioned that there is a predicted increase in strokes.  Will he elaborate on why this is the case?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#G00600","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>That is very interesting.  I will start with the management and one person taking responsibility for the co-ordination and management of the person's services or case.  Interestingly, where our son lives, which is not where I live even though it is quite near, there is an ABI case manager, which is quite extraordinary.  There is also a care manager.  The ABI case manager is the stand-alone service and because it is around the ABI services that meet our son's needs it is difficult to see the role that the manager plays, but there is some connection there because there is some training with carers in acquired brain injury.  There are online training sessions every month for a period of perhaps six weeks or something like that.  That happens.  It is like a little stand-alone piece.<\/p> <p>  The ABI case manager is involved in, and comes to, the case review, but the manager does not have an overall remit.  Then there is a care manager.  I will bring in the home support here because, as I said, we struggled doing this ourselves and we struggled with a little bit of support.  Gradually, when we were no longer able to provide the level of support needed, our son was provided with a package of care after a long, tedious process.  There is a care manager, a state registered nurse, SRN, who is responsible for the medical end and overseeing that area.  There is that piece, yet there is no bringing this together in one place.  The only time we get to discuss it in one place is if we have a review.  As I said, we have had the online reviews, which are a little unsatisfactory.  It is difficult for everyone and to get people to the table.  I would prefer if a physiotherapist was out doing physiotherapy with a patient instead of spending time doing an hour-long meeting with our son.  I understand that, but the physiotherapist might send in a report and so forth.  However, it is difficult to get everyone together.<\/p> <p>  There is no single person.  There are data protection issues and there is patient-client confidentiality, for example, liaising with Beaumont Hospital and then with the GP.  There are all these pieces and they are all moving around, but there is no one person who can do that.  It is not possible for a person, given the restrictions in all those areas, to get terribly involved and find out all the information the person needs to know.  I often find myself back in the fray again because we have the legal responsibility in decision-making.  Does the Deputy understand that?  If it comes down to changing medications or epilepsy medications, for example, we would know because of our background.  People working with our son now would not know all of what we know and the difficulties he has had with particular medications or issues in the past.  The information we have sits there and one could not possibly put it on paper.  Nobody would have the time to even read it.  There is no way of managing that, whereby one person can do all of that given all those restrictions.  That covers the home support and the area of the case manager, the case manager's role and how difficult it is.<\/p> <p>  The other question was about day services.  There has never been, and I do not know when it will ever happen, a day service that is geared to people with acquired brain injury and the area of acquired disability.  It is badly needed because it would provide structure and a centre of focus where people, perhaps the case managers, could meet and talk to other people.  There could be an opportunity to do more and our son's life would be greatly improved.  In a centre like that there could be physiotherapy and occupational therapy.  There was an attempt to do that before 2008.  There was a centre that had physical and sensory disability services.  It was a wide range and not specifically for ABI, but it had physiotherapy and OT during the week.  However, that was then brought back into clinical services in the HSE and the services went pear-shaped after 2008.  That never recovered.  It was never restored to what it had been previously.  A day service could incorporate many of these, but it is just not there.  I referred to the reports and the national rehabilitation strategy.  Where on earth is it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":462,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first question was about the care I received in hospital versus nothing and highlighting the lack of care when one is discharged from hospital.  First, we did not quite realise what was wrong with me.  When you are in hospital people use medical terms and you are not fully with it either, which is another issue.  When you are discharged you think, \"Oh, I must be better; this is fine\".  You are discharged home into an environment you are familiar with but might not really remember how to use.  Basically, you have to relearn an awful lot of things.  When you are discharged you think that the reason for being discharged is that you are better.  It is probably a lot to do with the lack of funding, beds and the like but it is also, I imagine, that the hospital has got the person's medication under control and there is not that much more it is possible to do in hospital versus somebody who is coming in from a road traffic accident or is to have an operation and needs the bed more.<\/p> <p>  Nobody in the nursing community or whatever it is knew that I had been discharged.  I do not understand why there is no social worker or overall community team that would get a notification from the hospital saying, \"Fiona is 33 years old and has been discharged with a stroke.  Can you call to the house in three days' time and see how she is getting on and what needs to be done?\".<\/p><p>I was discharged into my mum's care.  My mother has no medical background and she has her own medical issues.  She did not realise what needed to be done and she was still getting over the trauma of having found me having a seizure on the floor.  She was dealing with all of that and then sitting beside me for the next ten days in hospital and the worry of having to get over that.  On discharge, the only real guidance that she was given was how to use the pen so that if I was to have another seizure it would stop me having a seizure.  That was it.  There was no recognition that perhaps she might not be able to do this, along with all those other little things.  People working in the medical field are used to dealing with these issues every day and can forget that once a person leaves the hospital he or she are lost.  Yes, medical staff will say to give them a call any time, but then you ask yourself if it is a stupid question or perhaps they are so busy I might be bothering them.  A person does not want to take up the time of nursing staff.<\/p><p> I believe that everyone should get assessed when they leave hospital.  They do a physical assessment and a speech and language assessment.  For example, they made me walk up a set of stairs, and checked that I could swallow and so on.  It was three months later, however, when I was beginning to get better that I realised that while I thought I was 100% I was completely doolally in that I was not making any sense, but in my head I was making sense.  It shows how it can be six months later, as a person gets better, the deficits come out a little bit more.  The person has dealt with the stuff that has come up straightaway such as not remembering how to have a cup of tea, and then he or she must relearn how to boil the kettle and remember where the cups are.  As we go from relearning to things becoming automatic again, other things can start to show up as issues.  For instance, my inability to read would not have shown up for a long time because I was so tired having to do all of the normal things such as getting dressed and getting showered, brushing my teeth, and going for a five-minute walk.  This all took so long out of my day that I was exhausted, so I did not know that I could not read.  Those kinds of things might not show up initially.  Ms Farrell also mentioned it earlier.  For her situation with her son, things crop up over the years.  People need to have check ins every now and again.  I am aware that in an ideal world it would be great for everyone to get checked up every six month.  It is highly unlikely but something has to be put in place.  The things that are cropping up for me now are completely different from what I needed initially.  I am still with the National Rehabilitation Hospital, which is good.  As Ms Farrell said, I might go in and do a course for six weeks and then be let off again for a few months until they might call me back in again.  I did a course on what happens when a person has a brain injury, how the person is learning how to redo stuff and about the neurons are finding different pathways.  Another course was helping me with my organisational skills.  Back in April I also did a course on reading and how, when I am reading, to make a spider diagram of the main characters to include information such as this person works as a teacher, and the mum is called whatever and the sister is called whatever, so that if I want to know what the person is called I could look at the diagram to get a quick reminder and then continue with the story.  It is about trying to put those things into practice.<\/p><p> If I am ready to go back to work, they must figure out my deficits to get me back to work and what needs to be put in place for that.  Those places cannot really do everything for everybody.  Ms Farrell also mentioned other charities such as Acquired Brain Injury Ireland, Headway, but each organisation may have its own niche and a person may have to go to different places.  As was said earlier, we do not know about this until we find Facebook pages or get onto these groups.  I did not realise that the Irish Heart Foundation dealt with heart and stroke.  Why would I?  There had been no strokes in our family and it had never been an event before.  None of us would have known.  We would have known more about the Irish Cancer Society than the Irish Heart Foundation.  I typed the word \"stroke\" into Facebook and this came up.  I thought it was amazing.  I logged on and typed in words, and found all of these people who, while they do not have the exact same injury, had the exact same experiences where they had been pushed aside and they had not known what to do.  It was little things.  I had been able to get my driver's licence back a year after.  Because I had a seizure it had been taken from me.  People must go through the Irish Wheelchair Association to get assessed and then through the doctor or the consultant.  Then, a few weeks later someone will come up online and ask \"How do I go about getting my driver's licence back?\"  I was able to tell them.  This kind of information is not given to people.  I do not understand it.  If I am being discharged from a ward and surrounded by stroke patients, why can someone not say: \"The Irish Heart Foundation does this; Headway does this; Acquired Brain Injury Ireland does this; this person will be a social worker; we are going to get a carer for you for two mornings a week for the next six weeks; and the carer will see if you need physio, or whatever it is.\"  It does not make sense to me why people are not given leaflets or information.  It is overwhelming.  It should be the case that we are told that someone would call in a week's time when the person has settled and perhaps figured out what he or she needs, and be able to go things then.  Another lady pointed out to me that if you can speak they think you are fine.  Being able to speak and being able to live and fend for yourself are all very different things.<\/p><p> The Senator also asked about my returning to work.  My school is a very big school with 600 or 700 pupils.  To me that would be overwhelming, with so much noise and coming and going all of the time.  Ideally I would love to go to a smaller school but my permanency is with my school, so I have to go back to my school.  That will be a big thing for me.  When we were in college and in our first teaching practice we are brought out.  I have had many teaching practice students in my classroom and for their first time out they would come out to me.  I would teach in front of them for one week and then they would come up and teach three lessons per day.  That would be brilliant for me because I would be able to go in and be reminded of how to teach.  I would then be able to take over a lesson or two per day.  It would not have to be the case that I am in straight away and in charge and responsible.  It is 35 students and there is no point pretending that we do not have 35 students in our classes because we do.  The responsibility of that would be a bit too much for me at the beginning.  If there was a lead teacher and I just had to deliver the class and do the assessments and teach, and if there was also a backup there for me, it would be good.<\/p><p> Learning support and resource teaching, and teaching English as an additional language, are all special education teachers that have grouped together recently.  If one is a special education teacher one can co-teach or take smaller groups out to do more individualised learning.  That would be more ideal.  With year groups that I have taught already, because I have had to relearn so much, I have my plans done and my resources made for year groups that I have taught.  It would be a lot easier for me to teach in a year group I have had the experience of teaching.<\/p><p> Some schools are entitled to half a teacher because of children with special educational needs, where perhaps more students are entitled to half a teacher, or a teacher for two and half days per week.  This kind of situation would be ideal for me where I would not have to go in for a full day, or perhaps I might go in for five mornings or one full day and one half day.  There just does not seem to be any wriggle room.  It makes no sense to me because there is a massive shortage of teachers at the moment.  There is also a massive subbing crisis.  Teachers from Ireland are teaching in Dubai and are getting way better pay, and there are teachers who are retired coming back into sub.  It is just a mess at the moment but that is a different issue.<\/p><p> In saying that, for me to get back to teaching one or two days a week it would have a massive impact on my illness benefit, and it would also have an impact on my salary protection.  They say that if I am able to work then they do not need to pay me anymore.  They do not see the bigger picture that I am only able to work one or two days a week.  I still need to live and I still have bills to pay.  It would be silly of me to agree to work for one or two days a week knowing that all of that would be taken away from me.<\/p><p> The last question was about the type of services we need and I believe I touched on those already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Bardon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":464,"content":"<p>We will take Mr. Macey and then Ms Farrell if she too would like to come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#J00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Just to pick up on one point Ms Bardon made about the cliff face in terms of going back into the community after hospital discharge.  As members well know, the HSE has a plan for everything, but stroke survivors are not entitled to a discharge plan on leaving hospital.  In the UK, that is part of the entitlement for stroke survivors.  There is a six-month follow-up and then an annual appointment after that.  We need something like that.  We also need clear information on the services that are available and what is not available to stroke survivors.  I know one man who spent 12 months looking for services.  He was relieved at the end of that time when he found out that there was nothing available because he said he felt stupid that he was not able to find what was out there.<\/p> <p>  I was asked the reason the number of strokes will increase so rapidly.  That is really down to age demographics.  The median age for stroke in Ireland is 74, and we are going to have a lot more 74 year olds.  Also, one in four of all strokes is among people of working age.  We are concerned that this group is growing as well for unexplained reasons.  It is not fully clear, but that is a huge area of unmet needs in terms of stroke services in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Macey"},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome to the meeting this morning.  It has been very educational.  I met with Headway and the Neurological Association of Ireland previously and they highlighted many of the issues, but it is good to hear the personalised real-life stories and the practical difficulties for people.  To be honest, it is overwhelming to be confronted with those stories.  I cannot imagine what it is like to be in that position.  I thank the witnesses for coming here and for their honesty and advocacy this morning.  We learn so much at these committees.  It is of benefit to have the notes and submissions from the witnesses.  We now have a very powerful tool to advocate on behalf of the witnesses and to use their words.  I thank them for that because it is very important.<\/p> <p>  I do not have too many questions as many of them have been answered already.  The witnesses highlighted the blockages, barriers and lack of uniformity.  Mr. Macey referred to a man who was glad there were no services because it made him feel better that it was not his fault he had been unable to find a service.  It is a sad indictment of the system that the man felt it was his failure that he could not find any services.  That is sad and upsetting.  There is no one there to look after the individual.  The service is fragmented.  There is Headway and the National Rehabilitation Centre and the Irish Heart Foundation.  I met with Kathryn in the Irish Heart Foundation a few times.  These organisations are wonderful, but we are missing a critical database of stroke victims and the link in terms of making the stroke strategy a reality.  The strategy is probably more than likely out of date at this stage.  Even if it is published, there will be gaps because there will be changes in the meantime.<\/p> <p>  If she does not mind me personalising it, how does that make the Ms Bardon feel?  She referred to the blockages in her school.  She would be such a valuable resource to any school or place of employment, given her experience as a teacher and with this issue.  She is the type of person that I would love my children to be taught by because she has an understanding and empathy towards difference and of individuals in a family.  We are missing out as parents and as a State on having people like her teach our children.  How does that make her feel?  How does it impact on her recovery?  Ms Bardon is fighting to recover.  Ms Farrell's son is also fighting to recover and to continue his recovery.  As Ms Bardon says, it is not just a case of saying a person is discharged and they are fine as they are at home.  We are talking about a lifetime.  How does that make her feel to be constantly othered and boxed off?  I am sorry because I am a little emotional listening to the witnesses.  I feel that we have let them down so much.  How do the gaps in the service impact on recovery?  I presume there is an incredible lack of mental health support to empower Ms Bardon to recover to her best self.  I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#K00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I forgot to say the last time that I am incredibly lucky that I have a family around me that is able to help me and to step in where I cannot do things.  What about all the people who cannot read or write or research the resources that are available?  What about the people who do not know how to complete forms or where to access services?  These are the kind of things that are impossible without a support network.  Coming home from hospital, a support co-ordinator is supposed to call to the home, but such people will not be able to get those kinds of services.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the blockages to employment, I am fighting so much to get better, and I feel every single time I get two steps forward there is a setback.  You have to fight to get physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.  Then Covid came.  It took me until February to get my speech and language and occupational therapy and then Covid came and there was nothing available.  There was no Zoom back then.  They were all scrambling to try to find everything and we were all on our own yet again.  I thought, oh my God, I have been fighting for the past six months to try to get something and now it has all been taken away from me.  It is frustration after frustration after frustration.  It is unbelievable.<\/p> <p>  I have made an exceptional recovery.  I have put hours of work into my speech, reading and crosswords, all the kind of things that help.  When I talk to other stroke survivors, everyone wants to get better.  It is not that everyone wants to get better to go off to Disneyland and pretend nothing has happened, everyone wants to get better because they want to get back to their normal life.  We are not asking for massive things, we are asking to be back to the way we were, to be back to normality.  Blockages are being put in place.  It is kind of like, I put so much work and effort to get back to where I am now and you are now preventing me from moving forward.  You are preventing me from getting back to what I have trained for.  I went back to college at night time to become a teacher.  I was working all day.  I was doing college at night-time and at weekends.  I did not become a teacher until I was 26 and then it took four to five years to become permanent.  I worked for two or three years at my school and then I got sick.  I was told I am not well enough to go back to work.  I am at the point where I have something to give.  As Senator McGreehan says, now that I have had this brain injury, I have way more understanding of the struggles of the children and I can relate to them.  <\/p> <p>  I do not understand why you are telling me I am not good enough to be a teacher any more.<\/p><p>You are telling me that I am not good enough to try.  If it is the case that I go in and after four weeks, it is too much for me and I cannot be a teacher anymore that is fine.  However, at least that is a decision that I can make for myself.  I can experience it and decide it is too much for me and then I can see what I can do instead.  It may be that I can mentor teachers coming in or that I can for the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  I want to stay in education but it might be the case that I cannot still be a teacher.  That is another massive change that I have to overcome emotionally.  The lack of mental health services is just appalling.  I said this earlier, but I am spending money that I had earmarked for my house, a house that I cannot afford because it is so expensive.  My savings are going down and down because I have to pay for mental health services myself and I have to pay for my personal training and so on myself.  There are little things.  In a normal gym class the trainer might say to do 30 sit ups, press ups and push ups and run a lap around the room.  If I do the 30 sit ups I might say what is next.  Then I do the 30 press ups and say what is next.  I am getting better all that but I am not fully recovered.  You do get better over time and you are building up on those kinds of things but you just need the little bit of extra support.  Anyone who has had a stroke, that I have spoken to at least, is not asking for, say, coffee machines that nobody else can afford.  They are asking for handrails to be put into their house so that they can go to the toilet by themselves or for mental health resources so that we can overcome this massive thing.  We have not done anything wrong, we just unfortunately had strokes and we want our lives to go back to as normal as they can be.  Yes, life throws things at you.  Everyone cannot get everything that they want at the end of the day and that is fine but then we are told that we cannot do things.  Why can we not have services put in place so that we can instead?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Bardon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Many of the issues that Ms Bardon raised are equally relevant to people with brain injury.  I am struck by the experience of a relative in the UK.  This was a young woman working in the Open University who had a brain bleed, which is the same thing.  I am thinking of the support she had to enable her to cope, get services and to get what she needed to enable her to gradually return to work part time.  The different types of work and so on comes into play and it may be easier in some jobs and responsibilities to gradually ease in than others.  I cannot help comparing her experiences with Ms Bardon's and how good it was.  The outcome speaks for itself in that she went back to work, and did so full time and made a very good recovery apart from her eye.<\/p> <p>  On advocacy, Fiona is a wonderful self-advocate and advocate on behalf of any others.  It is wonderful to see people who experience these problems speaking on them, as we saw on television the other night.  That was great.  I was so pleased to see people who were themselves brain injured able to speak out and say, \"This is my experience.  This is what happened to me\", because although people with a mild acquired brain injury may be able to do quite a bit, they never see the bigger picture.  It focused on what they would need which would be very different to what a person with a very severe brain injury would need.  The whole area of advocacy is very difficult.  Despite all the different things that I have done in the past 30 odd years, my primary role has been as an advocate for our son.  I am thinking of the time this takes.  I have a room stacked up with files and box files.  I moved some to the shed.  I am afraid to throw out stuff because I never know how far back I will have to go to find something that is relevant and said, \"Oh yes but you have said this, and this is what was going to happen.\"  We go back and forth all the time.  You are a constant advocate.  You do not know when it is or is not going to end and who will take up the mantle when you are no longer able to do that.  And not everyone has family to do that.  Our situation is not the same as that of everybody else.  I do feel for people who are on their own, struggling for this who are not able to get any information or be provided with proper discharge summaries and information.  That is the same for ABI as with strokes or any catastrophic injuries.  The person and the families do not feel as though they are getting anything by right.  We return to the UN convention again.  You do not feel as though you are getting anything by right; you are begging.  You feel as though you have the begging bowl out, looking for something and that you are really very lucky if you get it.  But you are not looking for something extraordinary; you just want this person to recover the extent that they are able to live their best lives and that the family can benefit from that.  If the person has a better quality of life, then so too does the family.  For parents in this situation, their income and everything changes.  The dynamics of the family change.  Someone has to be there and take responsibility, to go to meetings, reviews and follow-ups.  I have been doing this all my life.  You come home from work and then you are doing the other job.  You would have to leave work to go and do something related to all of this.  It should be a right.  These people should have this by right.  It should be easier to access these services but it is not.  The scattered and fragmented nature of services around the country with one organisation doing a bit here and another doing a little bit there, is another issue when you are living in the wrong area.  From my experiences and from talking to people, I know there are pockets of the country where, never mind broadband, they are not able to get therapists or anything.  They cannot access any services.  The provision of services around the country is appalling.  The further someone lives from Dublin the more difficult it gets.  <\/p> <p>  That goes back to the issue of transport, which I raised earlier.  That is something that the committee needs to take on board.  It comes into the cost of living with a disability.   Ms Bardon touched on how that impacted on her at a personal level.  From our son's perspective, it is awarded on the basis that a certain income will be returned annually so all the plans are based on that.  Things change over the years.  The needs of the person change.  You find yourself in a situation where there is no money and the person is dependent on a disability allowance.  This goes back to wards of court matters, which I do not want to get into.  It is very difficult when you are straddling two horses.  One impacts on the other.  You would not be involved in the system if you did not have the brain injury.  Back and forth you go.  The cost of living with a disability now is huge.  As Ms Bardon has found to her cost, there are many services that even if you had a medical card or all the money in the world, you cannot buy.  I cannot go out and buy the services our son needs because they are neuro-based in a hospital where they provide services, both ABI and epilepsy.  You tell me where is the neuro centre?  We are fortunate that we are within travelling distance at approximately an hour.  There are people living in counties Kerry, Clare, Leitrim and all sorts of other places.  I meet them at the hospital and they have been travelling since 6 a.m. or something to get to these services.  Even then, they may not see a consultant.  They may see a junior doctor or someone else.  They feel that they have travelled all that journey for nothing.  It is very different since Covid but in regular times, they could be waiting there for two hours.  In that time they have to get food, pay for travel, pay for car parking even if they have a disability.  Just going to the hospital is a costly experience.  They may be attending clinics regularly where there are different types of clinics for allied services for spasticity and other matters.<\/p><p>A person may not just be attending one clinic; it may be a matter of attending different clinics for different things.  Some things have been done online more recently, such as psychology input, which has worked well.  However, some things cannot be done online and people have to be there physically, which is quite difficult at the moment.<\/p><p> I will give an example of the cost of living with a disability.  I forget the details so I am open to correction on this, but a person with a medical card is entitled to four chiropody appointments in the year.  Someone who has a deformity of the foot due to spasticity, depending on the circumstances, might need to be seen every five or six weeks.  It generally works out at ten visits per year.  A person cannot straddle the two services.  They cannot pay the HSE person to keep going to them and they cannot switch back and forth between the public and private so they end up paying privately for all those appointments.  That is just one example but there are many different things they have to pay out for and the cost of disability is not factored in.  I do not know how but something has to happen for people who are long-term disabled who do not have any possibility of returning to work.  Some people received a settlement expecting it to carry them through for their lifetime, but that is no longer the case.  These things will have to be dealt with at some level.  They will have to be managed because it is so unfair on the person and it affects the quality of life they had and expected to have.  Things like holidays, a weekend away or going to a concert are all gone now because they no longer have the income for it.  If someone has a carer and needs the carer to travel with them, that is a double cost every time.  Going out for a meal, a coffee or whatever is a double expense.  If the person is in Beaumont Hospital with their carer and they pay &euro;5 or for a coffee and a snack, they are actually paying &euro;10.  The committee will see what I mean about it all doubling up.  Sometimes people might need two people assisting them, depending on what they might be doing, so that can be a treble cost.  It is very expensive.  People must have their services as a right rather than feeling they are looking for something extraordinary or charity.  It is only very basic stuff that they need in order to get on with their lives as best they can. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I will make two quick points.  On the mental health aspect, there are 3.8 psychology posts in the country for stroke patients in hospitals.  That is for 7,500 strokes a year.  There is virtually nothing in the community.  We provide a bit of counselling and other organisations such as Headway Ireland and ABI Ireland do great work as well but there is very little provided.  This is a brain attack we are talking about and it needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  We did some research with the RCSI on returning to work after stroke.  One of the things we found was that employers want to help but they just do not know how.  They do not know what to do and they do not understand the nature of the stroke on employees.  Fatigue is a huge issue post stroke.  It hits people like a brick wall and people tell say you just do not know what real fatigue is until you experience a hit at that level.  Often people return to work not knowing that this is going to hit them really hard when they do and employers do not understand.  They sometimes think people are swinging the lead when they are actually really struggling.  We have done some case work on that and key worker programmes, where there is a liaison person between the person returning to work and the employer, can be helpful.  That can straighten out a lot of things.  There have been some pilot programmes over the years that have not been subsequently funded.  The system knows what to do, it just has not done anything about it or invested in this area.  We can see the loss of talent that comes with that and that is clear with Ms Bardon, for example.  She can make a significant and important contribution to children's education and she is not getting the chance, at a time the Department of Education is looking for people and needs people.  There are people there and they are not being accommodated. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Macey"},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their presentations.  It is ironic that this morning the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, issued a statement on Ireland submitting its milestone first report under the UNCRPD.  Lots of things are noted in the report about what is happening and there are also one or two notes on further progress that is required in law, policy and practice to give effect to the convention.  I was just reading it there while listening to some of the issues the witnesses raised at a level that affects their lives.  For instance, the stroke strategy has not been published and I have tabled a question to the Minister for Health this week asking when the strategy will be launched and published.  More important, strategies are kind of a deflection for doing anything because a strategy sets out a plan but we never see the implementation plan or the finance to go with it.  That is why oftentimes a strategy is called for, launched and put in place but it takes years and that means a number more years where money is not being spent.  It is important that we call this out for what it is.  If the strategy is to be published it needs to be published with the budgetary strength to give it effect and make sure it is implemented.<\/p> <p>  Going back to what Ms Farrell said about the experiences with her son, there is one thing that hits me.  I come from a background in construction and when I get a set of plans the first thing I do is set out a programme on how to bring together all the different strands to make sure the building is it built.  I start with the foundations and work up and get it completed and hand it over.  Everybody knows what their job is.  They are also reporting to one person, similar to a project manager, so everybody knows what is going on in the project.  Within our health services and patient care I come across this issue more and more, whereby there is no central domain with all the information on a patient that everybody feeds into.  It is a system that needs to be changed.  How many people miss out because somebody did not know something or somebody came home from hospital after a stroke and nobody visited them and they did not know where to go for help after that?  It is as if the day they leave the hospital the hospital thinks that is its job done and it is up to somebody else to take over from there.  However, nobody takes over and, therefore, it is creating this huge frustration.  It is a time-consuming and mentally challenging position for everybody in the family to try to deal with the person who has the disability.  I have come across the same thing with people who have had strokes.  They are initially treated in hospital or whatever and then they are signed out and told they can go home to their families and somebody else will take care of that.  We have seen a lot of it and both Ms Bardon and Ms Farrell have articulated what they have been living through from their own point of view.<\/p><p>Ms Farrell has been at this for a long time and I am sure she sometimes gets tired of explaining it.  My first question is for her in particular.  Has she seen improvements, or did we regress because of austerity and fail to pick up the pieces since?  Where does she think we are now compared with when she started out?  It might be a tough question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#M00300","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>No, it is not.  I was recently going through files looking for something and I found a letter I wrote back when I started out, almost 30 years ago.  It is as relevant now as it was then.  There are bits and pieces, pockets of services, that were not there previously.  Headway, for example, which is based in Dublin, provides just a small number of day services.  It is resourced for a certain number of hours per day and for certain categories of people.  Not everybody fits in to it.  It is about the people fitting in to the programme rather than the programme fitting the people.  All this is still going on.  People are told to go to Headway because it provides services for people with a brain injury.<\/p> <p>  The same is true of ABI Ireland.  It has been seeking additional funding for case managers and that links in with the national rehabilitation strategy.  The Deputy talked about implementation, but the implementation plan was published and we are still no further because Covid happened in the middle of it all.  That is not an excuse or even a reason, given the strategy was published in 2011.  ABI Ireland operates in pockets of services that were initiated locally, perhaps by a family or a few families coming together who said they needed to get something up and running.  There might then be some goodwill at the HSE and the service will be brought in.  It is never a matter of the HSE coming in and saying it will deliver something.  It is always a family or a number of families in an area who get together and drive this through the HSE.  It comes from the bottom up rather than being a national strategy from the top down, whereby we would know what everybody gets and needs, with different strands for different categories of injured people, a discharge summary, somebody to pick up the case when the person goes out into the community and an ABI case manager who will co-ordinate the other services that are needed and manage the person's case.  That is not happening but it should be.<\/p> <p>  It is frustrating when I talk to people who have been discharged from hospital without any follow-up, most likely prematurely, given our experiences in the UK.  It is still the case here that if someone can walk and talk, he or she is considered to have been rehabilitated in respect of a brain injury, but the real damage is underneath and does not come to the fore, as Ms Bardon said.  It is only when the person goes home, having suffered a brain injury and stroke, and becomes aware of all the things he or she has to relearn that he or she had been able to do theretofore, not to mention work and so on.  Even actions such as making a cup of tea or brushing teeth have to be relearned and no supports are in place to do that.  It is very difficult and challenging.<\/p> <p>  The problems are the same as ever.  More people are living after an acquired brain injury and, as a country, we spend a lot of money on saving their lives.  There is a scarcity of beds in Beaumont Hospital and no additional beds have been provided.  The National Rehabilitation Hospital has not been given any additional capacity either, even though the entire place was rebuilt.  As an example of the waiting lists in Beaumont, our son needed to go there some years ago for a review of medications.  His epilepsy medication was causing problems such as falls and so on.  He had packed his bag and was waiting to go.  He was told it could be some time that week but he did not know and it went on and on.  A person with a brain injury does not understand.  The frustrations build and stress is caused.  I had to appear on television.  Do members think I wanted to do that?  Do they think I wanted to attend this meeting?  I did not.  None of us wants to be here doing this.  It is awful that we have to go out and speak in public about our private lives.  It is appalling.  I appeared on the six o'clock news on television and told the world at large I wanted a bed in hospital for my son, which in any civilised country he would be entitled to.  That evening, suddenly, he got a bed.<\/p> <p>  That speaks to what we have had to put up with and, based on what I am hearing on the ground, it is no different today.  That is a serious indictment of the health services in this country in general, and the example I outlined related to neurological services.  People from throughout the country vie for a bed in the national neurology centre but the beds are not there.  The resources are not there and an adequate number of neurologists are not there.  That is to say nothing of the people who cannot get a bed in the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  There is a waiting list and some will never make it there.  They will never that support and discharge Ms Bardon mentioned.  It is appalling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I echo something Ms Farrell said in response to the Deputy question's about the implementation of plans.  We suffer from implementation deficit disorder in this country, particularly in the HSE.  The national neurorehabilitation policy was published in 2011.  The implementation plan was not published until 2019 and it was a framework for 2019 to 2021.  One month remains and nothing has been achieved, and there has been no funding for it.  As the Neurological Alliance of Ireland has stated, it has been ten years wasted for neurorehabilitation, which includes stroke and other acquired brain injuries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Macey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>On whether I have seen improvements, some of the issues relate to the number of rules and guidelines to be followed by different areas of government, such as county councils and so on.  I read recently on our Facebook group that a man had a stroke two years ago and has been in rehab on and off since.  He has been given notice to vacate his council house because he has broken the rules of not residing at his property.  He is being evicted because he was getting help to get better, and he will not have anywhere to live at the end of the month.  This is just crazy.  It does not make any sense.  He has made all his payments and he had his friends and family check on the property when he was not there, and now he will effectively be made homeless.  No special dispensations or exceptions are in place for people who need them.<\/p> <p>  When we were talking in our groups, we said Covid probably helped some of us in that life became much slower and there was less pressure to socialise.  We were able to take a step back and have space, with less pressure on us.  At the same time, Covid was also a great excuse for the health service to say it could not provide a support any more, and then the HSE cyberattack happened as well.  It was almost a double whammy.  When one service resumed, the HSE did not have access to files, which meant appointments were pushed back further.  It has been probably seven months since I had any real support from the NRH, which is quite a long time, given I had to wait so long to get the services in the first instance, and it is definitely not just in my case.<\/p> <p>  I am aware I am talking about my story only.  Throughout the country, there are many other people like me with acquired brain injuries or other acquired disabilities or who have been born with disabilities.  Because I have made such a good recovery physically, I do not have the experience to be able to speak on behalf of people who have acquired physical disabilities.  I do not really understand that part of the challenges they face every day.  As Ms Farrell said, you almost have to embarrass people into giving you the services or embarrass yourself to get them.<\/p><p>That is not good enough.  I feel that I have nearly had to become pushy to get the services I need.  That is not me; it is not my personality.  I have had to become a person I am not in order to just get better.  The services that are required are not there.  It is not in my nature to be like that, but if I am not like that I get passed over or overlooked.  What about the people who do not have the confidence to do that or who do not say, \"I deserve better and I deserve this type of support\"?  They are not getting that support.<\/p><p> Ms Farrell also mentioned that the services are fitting people into programmes, not fitting programmes around people.  They are not differentiating programmes to suit everybody.  That is probably because they have one programme and might have 18 patients.  The attitude is to put everybody in that programme and even if half of them get support or something out of it, it is better than people getting nothing.<\/p><p> I meant to say earlier that friends and family obviously want to help.  Initially, when you come home from hospital everybody is hands on deck.  They are making meals and taking you to appointments.  Unfortunately, for people like Ms Farrell, they cannot walk away from their family.  They have a responsibility to their parents, nieces, nephews, sons and daughters.  Most other people have to go back to their normal lives and they have more pressing matters to attend to.  They might have their own family and their own personal worries.  They have their own lives to live and they cannot be there for me or whoever to do everything I cannot do for myself.  Over time, as your physical or mental needs reduce and you are able to speak up more as your speech perhaps comes back more, people see the stroke survivor as better.  There is an expectation that because it has been six months or a year, you are better now.  We are not better.  We are not bound to be okay after a certain amount of time.  The reality is that while I can hold a conversation and be here, I am exhausted.  This is me done until next Monday or Tuesday.  There is no getting anything out of me for the rest of the week.  It does not mean that you can go back to work.<\/p><p> At the start, when I had to make my lunch it could have taken me nearly an hour to make a sandwich.  Now, it takes me 15 minutes.  That is a massive improvement.  Some people might see that as great, but I am wondering, given it has taken that long to make my lunch, how long it will take me to make my dinner.  You are going to put in whatever the easiest thing is to make the dinner.  People do not realise that.  Yes, I am able to make my lunch and my dinner, but I am exhausted after doing it.  Just because I am able to write a shopping list it does not mean that when I go to the shop I will remember to bring the list with me.  We all forget our shopping lists, but the majority of people will remember that they do not have this or that while we are not necessarily able to remember that type of thing.  Again, as I have said repeatedly, it is the everyday normal tasks that people have been robbed of the ability to do.  We need services to be put in place for us to be able to return to being able to do the mundane tasks ourselves, without being overpowered and without having the massive fatigue Mr. Macey spoke about earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111100002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Bardon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

We are both delighted to be here today at the request of the committee to answer questions around scoliosis at Children's Health Ireland, CHI.  We are both dual North American fellowship trained paediatric orthopaedic surgeons, both of us practising at Children's University Hospital, which is Temple Street, and the National Orthopaedic Hospital, which is Cappagh Kids.  We are both practising as consultant surgeons and neither of us is in an administrative position.<\/p> <p>  Scoliosis has diverse cohort of patients and it affects kids in very different ways.  Most of these children do not require surgery.  In regard to those who do, some very young children with very complex disease require surgery in order to survive beyond their 20s.  It is a completely different group of children in their teenage years.  The reason we operate on them in order to reduce their chances of breathing difficulties but not until their fifth or sixth decade of life.  It is not a homogenous group and it is important that we understand that.  I am happy to answer questions around that later on.<\/p> <p>  It is great that the committee understands the challenge of timely treatment in scoliosis, and it is great that it understand the anxiety and the suffering it is causing, not only families but medical professionals as well.  We both genuinely thank the committee for the opportunity today to advocate for children.<\/p> <p>  In order to adequately advocate for my patients and colleagues, I need to leave the committee with a very clear message.  The care of children with scoliosis in this country is absolutely inadequate.  However, the care of children with other orthopaedic conditions is just as bad.  This becomes alarming when I tell the committee that scoliosis only represents about 20% of what Professor McCormack and I do.  Therefore, the real crisis is not in scoliosis; the real crisis is everything else.<\/p> <p>  As paediatric orthopaedic surgeons, we see children with a huge potential to contribute through their abilities to Ireland in the future.  Unfortunately, these abilities are being destroyed physically and psychologically by inadequate access to care.  For example, there are children with spina bifida who are amazing, intelligent and mature.  While these children have been waiting for surgery, they have gone from walking independently to using wheelchairs full time.  They have gone from participating in school to staying at home full time.<\/p><p>They have gone from wearing shoes to sitting at home with open sores.  These are not isolated conditions; this is a group of children.<\/p><p> In regard to children with cerebral palsy, the majority should live independently in this country.  Not only that, through their amazing abilities they should be able to contribute to Ireland of the future.  Instead, these treatable foot and hip deformities these children have leave them not only not contributing, but they leave them at home and in pain and missing school.<\/p><p> It is not just children with additional needs.  We have children without any other medical problems at all who have hip deformities and limb deformities, and these children are in pain and ashamed of their appearance.  They are not going to school and they are not being educated.  They will not get an opportunity to give Ireland the benefit of their abilities.<\/p><p> We have no universal screening for hip dysplasia while we have universal screening for other things.  This is a silent condition and when it is left untreated it accounts for 40% of hip replacements in people under 50 years of age in this country.  Therefore, we are not only making the surgery around people's lives more significant, we are increasing the economic burden to the State.<\/p><p> We need to create a sustainable paediatric orthopaedic service for the children of Ireland, and for us medical professionals.  The solution cannot wait until the national hospital is delivered.  Furthermore, the committee needs to understand that a building alone will not fix all of these problems and it will only lead to disappointment.  A sustainable solution will involve infrastructure and staffing.  I can tell the committee that you would not find better colleagues anywhere in the world than the group of colleagues I have in Temple Street and in Cappagh.  This is across nursing, therapy and my medical peers.  We hold ourselves to an exceptionally high standard.  You must go abroad for international training for two years before you have an opportunity to be a paediatric anaesthetist or a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon.  Therefore, the access to care is the barrier here.  It is definitely not the quality of care that can be delivered in this country.  <\/p><p> However, over the last five years, it is very clear to me that this is coming to an end.  You are not going to find people who will drag their families away for international training.  You are not going to see nursing staff stay that extra hour continually in the face of adversity and with staff shortages.  All of this goodwill has dried up.  If we do not act now, this elite standard of care in this country is definitely going to reduce itself to \"yellow pack\", because people will not go abroad to train.  Furthermore, it is equally likely that the next generation will leave and not come back.<\/p><p> We are not asking for much.  We are asking to be allowed to do our job.  We are asking that when we come to work there is enough staff and that we will not have to fight every morning to get a bed for our patient, so we can come in and operate.  As surgeons, we are asking that we have an operating room to go to.  I know it sounds ridiculous, but I was appointed as surgeon with no operating room.  My colleague has just been appointed with no operating room.<\/p><p> I really hope that the new hospital will live up to expectations, but care for these children cannot wait.  I know a ridiculous and obscene amount of money has been spent on the new hospital, but we still need to resource children now.<\/p><p> In Temple Street, our clinical director has been fighting hard for one operating theatre to be delivered by the end of next year.  Why is it not two?  Why are we waiting until next year?  The American Army can set up a hospital in desert overnight, so why can we not have two operating rooms sooner?<\/p><p> Anybody listening to the radio this week will understand that stand alone facilities are the only way to deliver care in this country.  We cannot provide elective care on acute sites.  It is fantastic to see that the HSE and the Government are supporting these elective care facilities and we are going out to tender for it.  However, we already have one in orthopaedics.  We have the National Orthopaedic Hospital where we have Cappagh Kids.  In the last two weeks, when all elective activity was cancelled in the acute settings, we did 20 cases on children when nothing else was happening.  We can do more on these elective sites, but we need to be resourced to do so.  A plan was submitted to the HSE and a plan was submitted to the Houses for an expansion in Cappagh.  It will raise the standard of care not only in children, but in adults as well.  <\/p><p> We need to be resourced.  I promise members we will retain colleagues.  We need to give my colleagues a reason to stay.  We need a national system to be proud of, and we need the ability to care for our patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111100002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Connor Green","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.  It is refreshing to hear your passion while advocating for the patients who you represent and for your colleagues.<\/p> <p>  Everyone tells us scoliosis will not fix itself.  As elective representatives, we have received some really disturbing letters from families outlining the trauma they are going through in relation to their children and the challenges they have been facing.  One family told me the preliminary diagnosis for their child happened when it was still in the womb.  They say the years between three and ten are supposed to be the best for response to scoliosis.<\/p> <p>  You were performing surgery yesterday.  Will you talk us through what is actually involved?  I know there are three types of scoliosis: idiopathic, congenital and neuromuscular.  Apparently, we do not know what causes idiopathic scoliosis.  It can be congenital and it can run in families.  The main thing parents want to know is when their child will be seen, how they get that preliminary assessment and how long it will take after that assessment for them to get treatment.  I suppose it the same with children who are on different spectrums, where families are waiting up to two years to get an assessment.<\/p> <p>  In the current situation, how long does it take?

What I will say every time I answer a question about scoliosis is that I want to remind everyone that scoliosis is not the major challenge here.  I really want the members to understand that when we leave today.<\/p> <p>  In relation to scoliosis, idiopathic is a group we do not have a cause for.  We call it idiopathic because as doctors we like to sound smart and do not like to say we do not know.  The Chair spoke about the time to access the care and about it being diagnosed in the womb.  You have the group of children who will be diagnosed early in life who have no other medical problems.  That is the idiopathic group.  If we leave them untreated, they can potentially not have a big enough lung capacity to survive beyond their 20th year.  In fact, most of the work done in that originally was in Ireland.  We need to consider that scoliosis is just a symptom; it is not a diagnosis.<\/p> <p>  The most important thing, and I say it to all families when I meet them, is that the first thing we have to do is to decide what has caused their scoliosis.  That means you need access to a physician and also some advanced imaging.  If you are a child born with scoliosis, in theory we should get at that group quite quickly because there are very few of them.  Early-onset idiopathic scoliosis is a really rare diagnosis and we should be able to see this small group relatively quickly.  When it is said the important time for treatment is in the first ten years of life, that is true for that group.  However, the most important time for treatment is probably the first five years of life because that is when children's lungs are developing.  We call it the golden age of alveolar development.  If you can get to a child during the time, there are two potentials.  You can reassure the family in some ways that this might not be a curve that will develop at all.  If we can treat them, then sometimes we can even reverse it.<\/p> <p>  The second group is the neuromuscular group, and this can occur at an early age as well.  Most of these children need surgery to help with seating and with pain.  They can have their surgery in a controlled way, and that is probably the biggest group we deal with in the acute hospitals.<\/p> <p>  The final group is the idiopathic scoliosis group in adolescence.  In Cappagh, we have that group under control.<\/p><p>It is the one group we have under control through our rapid access service.  We have decreased our waiting time from 18 months to four weeks.  We have decreased our time for surgery from about a year and now we just give families a date when it suits them.  I have the biggest waiting list in Cappagh still, but it is only five or six.  We are in control in idiopathic scoliosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Connor Green","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Green want to tell us about the difficulty following the cyberattack?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111100002#C00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":493,"content":"<p>It did not make much difference.

How can the group in Cappagh that has been successfully catered for and managed successfully and satisfactorily be applied to other children in the various cohorts?  How can the witnesses bring it to a satisfactory conclusion in a short time?  Every parent watching a child suffer and in acute pain suffers along with the child.  As we all know, the child is not in a position to do something for themselves.  Children do not understand why they have to be on a waiting list and why they have to wait interminably while preparing for the surgery that should be available to them.  How can we apply the approach right across the entire cohort, and what is required to do so?  Is it possible to provide a fall-back system if something goes wrong in one area and there is a hold-up such as a lack of theatres or medical or surgical staff?  To allow the waiting lists to grow is appalling in the 21st century.  We should not have this situation.

We have to take a national look at this.  We are employed in Cappagh and Temple Street and we do the best we can there with the resources we have.  Each week I do a national clinic in the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, for neuromuscular disability.  Those patients are supposed to be from the local catchment area, but they are coming from the entire country.  As a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon, I can see a patient with a spine problem in the CRC and I can operate in Cappagh.  There is no equivalent of me anywhere on the west coast, the midlands or in the north east.  There used to be.  Twenty years ago, there was a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon in Sligo.  There was one in Galway, in Limerick and in Cork.  These were very well trained, very hard working consultants who ran the local service to a very high level.  Only high-risk children with difficult issues were sent to Dublin.  Nationally, now, that is all broken down.  We do not have a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon service in Galway.  A locum service is being provided out of Crumlin, which is unsatisfactory when you think about it.  We do not have a paediatric orthopaedic service established in Limerick.

We have an eight-bed intensive care unit where, on a daily basis, six beds out of the eight are only staffed by nursing staff.  The reason for that is they cannot get the skilled nursing staff to do it because these nurses are not being remunerated, educated and supported appropriately.  I do not know who would want to do that job.  I will go into more detail on that afterwards due to the limited time.  We need to resource our ICU staffing better.  We need to ring-fence an intensive care bed for elective surgery and we need to support our intensivists to recruit more of them in order to look after the patients afterwards.  The first thing I do on a Monday morning every time I come to the operating room is go up and look around the ICU.  <\/p> <p>  We need two more theatres, at a minimum, just to get us through the next couple of years in Temple Street.  I have a half-day operating once a week.  That is all I have got at present.  I cannot do a spine in a half-day.  It is impossible.  That time is nearly involved with anaesthetics.

The rate limiting step in paediatrics in Cappagh at present is the high dependency units.  In addition, we need staffing for our rehabilitation service.  We are trying to set up a four-bed unit which would decompress the main hospital and allow patients to go to Cappagh for their recovery.  That would also give us two additional operating theatres in Cappagh which would allow us to operate two paediatric orthopaedic lists a day instead of the current one, on a Monday to Thursday.  We currently have 18 potential beds in Cappagh but we need to recruit the nursing staff and the support services to support them.

We read a lot of statements from healthcare professionals appearing before the committee in regard to our health system, but I was particularly struck by our guests' testimony, honesty and candour in respect of this most serious of issues.  There is always a system failure when families are obliged to go public regarding their children's surgical needs.  We can immediately tell there is a systemic failure where they have to go on the public airwaves to get surgery.  What happens then is their child, their loved one, gets the procedure because of the outcry.  If that is the system, that is a complete failure.  That is no reflection on our guests but it is the system we live in.  I cannot blame parents for doing it; I would do the exact same myself.  If you have a child who is in constant pain, you will do everything to get that child the operation and procedure.

These children have no sensation in their feet, so if they develop a foot deformity, it will immediately break down into a pressure area and a sore.<\/p><p>We are trying to allow a child to go to school to be educated because these are bright kids.  The next group is the cerebral palsy group.  These children have sensation all the way down and so when they get a foot deformity, they cannot walk because of pain.  Again, these are bright intelligent children who should be able, through their abilities, to help Ireland.  I could continue with all the groups of children with additional needs, but there are also the other children who are completely medically well.  Normal children are born in Ireland every day and have a silent diagnosis of hip dysplasia because we do not have a screening programme.<\/p><p> We did a review with the Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital Dublin, which showed that 40% of people under the age of 50 needing a hip replacement have hip dysplasia.  Because we do not have the screening programme, I think the hip replacement cost for an under 50-year-old is probably about &euro;5,000 for implants.  I think it is about &euro;10,000.  I would not be held to those numbers because I am not an adult surgeon.  We do several operations per week and I believe our implant costs &euro;50.  Therefore, it is an enormous cost to the State and to the family.  Anyone who has a hip replacement by the age of 50 will definitely get one or two revisions before they are finished.<\/p><p> We have not even started talking about children who might just have a bit of a curly toe or a lump that needs to come off.  Those children are completely lost.  We have not said anything about our trauma service.

We have no beds in Temple Street at the moment.  We have no redundancy in the system.  We could talk all day about each aspect of paediatric orthopaedics.<\/p><p> I want to be clear in this.  I do not blame anybody within the management structure of CHI for the failings in this.  We just do not have enough paediatric resources and they need to be put in place.  I believe Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman is a very good CEO who is genuinely trying to help.  However, we are really stuck because everybody is focused on the new hospital.  Everybody thinks this new hospital will save everything and it will not.  We have been talking about a new hospital since the 1960s.  The Mater was supposed to happen and was going to save everything.  Children keep getting sidelined.  Entire generations of children are now grown up.  We need to remember that the children are paying for all our pensions and will support the State in the future.

It would be a manifestation of a healthy system that no one ever needs to go abroad for anything.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what the \"everything else\" is.  To my mind there are three elements to this.  There is the infrastructural issue, but we have brand new paediatric orthopaedic theatres in the north east.  Alone that is not enough.  Infrastructure is important, but we need additional staff.  We need consultants, nurses and so on.  We need sufficient numbers and that needs to be addressed.  The third issue is that we need quality staff.  One way to ruin any system is to put a bad doctor in, someone who is not confident or comfortable.  It is not about bringing in, as has happened, locums from eastern Europe who claim they can do paediatric orthopaedics but who cannot.  They last three or four years and they disappear.  That has happened and it is not a solution.<\/p> <p>  We need quality training.  I believe we need to train our own surgeons in paediatric orthopaedic surgery.  It will take time to get good Irish leaving cert students through an appropriate medical school where they earn their degree and become high-quality surgeons and then incentivise them to do this work.  The money is not sufficient incentivisation.  It is not about money.  We would not do this job for money.  No amount of money would make us do this job.  There is more.  It is a social contract we make with society and with our patients.<\/p> <p>  There are three elements and if one of those elements is deficient, the whole thing is a waste of time.

There were also people, for example, surgeons, retiring and not being replaced by like, that is, by equally skilful surgeons.  That creates a problem.  For instance, I know the HSE sent money to Galway to fund a paediatric orthopaedic post maybe ten years ago but the surgeons in Galway chose to use that money to hire a spine surgeon.  They are autonomous and what they do is not my business, it is their business, but what they did was to hire a spine surgeon, not a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon.  Therefore, they had one paediatric orthopaedic surgeon, who then retired and was replaced by a young surgeon, who was not happy and left, and who has come back to Crumlin for various reasons, some of them personal and some of them, I think, professional.

Hip dysplasia is a big problem.  Two years ago, over the summer I suggested to Temple Street hospital management that if they gave me a theatre on a Saturday, I would work for nothing.  I asked them to pay the nurses to work for the Saturday morning so we could work on ten or 11 kids.  It took a good chief executive officer at the time, Ms Mona Baker, to say \"yes\" and it happened.  Every Saturday over the summer I went in and operated on what I think were nine children each morning.  It was as many as we would do in a month otherwise.  That little bit of a waiting list was dealt with.  The nurses loved it because they were incentivised and that incentive was very simple.  The nurses were paid until 5 p.m., along with the anaesthetist.  If we worked hard and cut out all the bullshit, we would get the work done by 2 p.m. and that is exactly what happened.  Everybody was delighted and went home at 2 p.m. having done a good day's work.<\/p> <p>  This was amazing because in the public sector for the first time in my experience in Temple Street hospital, on a Saturday morning we cut through work just like it was a private operation.  For a second year I asked the same for the summer months and we did it but there was some resistance.  Nurses were given vouchers.  There was some detail about not being able to pay nurses extra or whatever.  The bureaucracy hit us in the face but we did it.  For the third year, which was last year, it did not happen.  There was too much bureaucracy.  The chief executive was gone and there was a layer of managers so it just did not happen because of the bureaucracy.  That is a quick fix.<\/p> <p>  Another example is that of the four theatres available in Temple Street hospital, three close on a Saturday and Sunday.  We have all this intense debate all week but on Friday afternoon people just go home and it is the weekend.  I stopped believing in Santa and God a long time ago and I have no problem working on Sunday all day.  Why not?  We have the infrastructure but it is closed two days from seven.  For God's sake - if there was a God - could we not just open the theatres and let us do some work?  It should not take that much but trying to get that through the bureaucratic management structure is impossible.  Maybe members could help with that.

We heard there are theatres available and fully kitted out, ready to accept patients, but they are closed.  That is pretty damning.  I am glad he spoke so frankly here this morning.  Many parents of kids with scoliosis in particular contact our offices and it seems there is an endless wait for that all-important surgery.

Loud and clear messaging must come from this committee that we want to see such bursting through the bureaucratic red tape.  We want to see the theatres operating on a Saturday and Sunday so we can start eating into these extensive and long waiting lists.

On top of that it is now under scrutiny by the Health Products Regulatory Authority.  I know the product and its name but I cannot reference it.

On the waiting lists, in my opinion, and as discussed today, there will be no difference in six months' time.  I am speaking only for Temple Street hospital and Cappagh hospital.  We have an issue with respiratory viruses at the moment and, therefore, the ICU system has no further capacity.  I have had three spinal surgeries cancelled in recent times.  Those patients are now pushed out further.  It is possible that the waiting lists will have increased further in six months' time, in my opinion from my practice.<\/p> <p>  In terms of meaningful change at Temple Street and Cappagh hospitals, if we get the investment for the expansion, ten months from that time it will be built and then we can start to talk about meaningful change.  That is as accurate as I can be, genuinely.  All I can do is look at the patients in front of me.  There are 224 on my list for inpatient surgery in Temple Street hospital and 282 on my list for inpatient surgery in Cappagh hospital.  On average, I get one done per list in Temple Street hospital.  That only happens if the list has not been cancelled.  On the basis of my list of 224 patients and an average of 40 lists per annum, depending on bank holidays and so on, I cannot in all honestly say that there will be meaningful change in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On Cappagh hospital and the number of surgeons that are required to be appointed, Cappagh is already the national hospital.  We accept referrals from all over the country.  We can continue to accept those referrals.  We are in discussions with regard to surgeons from Crumlin hospital coming to Cappagh hospital providing we get the adequate resources to support them.  If we had two paediatric orthopaedic operating theatres running per day, we would fill them with our existing surgical staff.  The surgeons at Crumlin hospital have access to the national orthopaedic hospital.  We also have access.  It is already the national orthopaedic hospital.

I am joined by Ms Paula Kelly, who is a consultant paediatric orthopaedic surgeon at Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin, as well as being a clinical speciality lead for orthopaedics across CHI.  Mr. Liam Woods, national director of acute operations, HSE, and Ms Helen Byrne, assistant national director of acute operations, HSE, are also in attendance.  I also acknowledge our colleagues, Mr. Connor Green and Professor Damian McCormack, for their advocacy and support, for working with us to try to resolve this issue and for their honesty in the previous session.<\/p> <p>  We are here to brief the committee on scoliosis services and to outline the progress made in 2018 and 2019 to stabilise this service, which has been eroded in the past 18 months, primarily due to the impact of Covid-19 and the cyberattack.  Most importantly, I will outline what we are proposing to do about this situation.  <\/p> <p>  We are extremely aware that behind every number is a patient, a family and a team in CHI that wants to provide treatment.  I reiterate, on behalf of CHI, my apologies to all patients and their families who have experienced increased waiting times and delays in accessing paediatric services.  We do not, in any way, underestimate the impact that this has on them, and our intention is to correct this situation as soon as we can.  As the committee will appreciate, we are not in a position to discuss individual cases in the public domain.<\/p> <p>  Timely and increased access to our services is the single greatest operational challenge in CHI.  We are operating within old and constrained infrastructures, and we have recently experienced extremely high levels of accident and emergency department and urgent care activity.  We have a plan in the form of the new national children&rsquo;s hospital.  It will be amazing and will address many of our current challenges, but we cannot wait for two and half years to improve access to our services.  What we must do is to support paediatric orthopaedic services to operate more than in their pre-pandemic levels to address the backlog caused by what has happened in the last 18 months.  The committee's focus today is on scoliosis.  We must point out that there are other children with time-sensitive orthopaedic and other conditions that we equally need to prioritise.  We are trying our best to manage all these service demands.<\/p> <p>  To contextualise the situation, at the end of October, CHI had 2,876 children on inpatient waiting lists, 2,686 children on day case waiting lists and 43,844 children on an outpatient waiting list.  As part of CHI paediatric orthopaedic services, the most complex scoliosis cases are treated in Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals, with the less complex cases being dealt with in the national orthopaedic hospital at Cappagh, known as Cappagh Kids.  Scoliosis treatment accounts for 17% of orthopaedic inpatient activity in CHI.<\/p> <p>  Through investment in 2019, CHI stabilised the service and achieved delivery of a target of 382 spinal treatments.  This was the projected annual number of treatments required to practically manage timely access within our current infrastructure.  This annual target of 382 spinal treatments was decimated in 2020 due to the impact of Covid-19, with 60 fewer spinal treatments undertaken.  A total of 322 procedures were undertaken.  We made progress in early 2021 to recover some of this activity, but the cyberattack in May really impacted services in CHI.  We anticipate that this year we will undertake a total of 335 spinal treatments in CHI.<\/p> <p>  To address the impacts of Covid-19 and the cyberattack on performance, we have developed specific proposals for HSE funding approval to increase capacity at Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals and to expand the paediatric services at Cappagh hospital.  That means more operating theatre capacity, additional beds, new MRIs and additional staff.  As of today, 203 patients are on the waiting list for scoliosis-related procedures in CHI.  These include active, pre-admittance planned procedures but in keeping with national waiting list standards, it excludes suspensions for clinical and other reasons.  The vast majority of these patients need their surgery to take place in Crumlin or Temple Street hospitals, with Cappagh hospital offering the opportunity to undertake less complex elective procedures.<\/p><p> With this new investment, we will deliver sufficient additional orthopaedic activity to substantially eliminate long waiting lists for scoliosis treatments on a sustainable basis.  In activity terms, this means increasing our annual funded target for spinal procedures from 382 to 430 in July 2022, which is an additional 48 spinal procedures in 2022.  Plus 438 in 2023, which is an additional 56 spinal procedures.  This will improve the waiting times and we are committed to the following.  By the end of 2022, all scoliosis inpatient waits will be below six months unless clinically indicated, and by July 2023, all scoliosis inpatient waiting lists will be below four months unless clinically indicated.  These targets are subject to securing the required investment and no uncontrollable events like a pandemic. The private sector capacity might be able to help accelerate these targets but we do not expect this to materialise due to the constraints in securing specialist paediatric staffing.<\/p><p> To conclude, waiting times for scoliosis services have deteriorated in 2020 and 2021 primarily due to Covid and the cyberattack.  This is unacceptable.  Again, we apologise for the distress and strain that any lack of timely access causes to children, adolescents and their families.  We appreciate that families want to know when their child will have surgery.  This is also impacting on our dedicated and professional staff who are working diligently through challenging and difficult times. <\/p><p> We have demonstrated that we can improve services when investments are made in CHI.  Despite the infrastructure and serious challenges faced on a daily basis, we remain committed to improving services.  I can assure the committee, patients and families that on securing the required investments everyone in CHI is fully committed to making timely access to our services better for children needing treatment for scoliosis.  I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hardiman.

We can clearly demonstrate and acknowledge that when we received the investments in 2018 and 2019 we made a difference.

I concur.  This is not just a matter concerning scoliosis treatment, as our clinical colleagues have said.  This is about orthopaedic services overall.  In that context, we are trying to expand the paediatric orthopaedic services we provide in CHI.  To give some specifics, and I am happy to send on the details in writing if we have run out of time, we have identified that we need a fifth theatre in Temple Street.  We have plans ready to go for that endeavour, and we anticipate that we will have that facility open by July 2022, subject to approval in 2021.  We have also identified that we are going to open unfunded elements of and expand the theatres in Crumlin.  We can move on those in the first six months to get the staff in place to extend the hours.  An MRI scanner will begin operating in Temple Street in July 2022 as well, and, subject to funding, we will have a second MRI scanner in place in Crumlin by the end of 2022.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the situation with beds, eight beds will be opening in Temple Street at the end of November.  Those are short-stay beds to deal with emergency issues, and that is intended to address the situation regarding some of the cases, from the huge numbers being seen in our accident and emergency department, being admitted up into the inpatient beds.  Those extra beds will allow us to try to decompress the pressure on those inpatient beds.  We have a plan to also put four more beds into Temple Street, subject to funding, and we can put a further ten beds into Crumlin.  Those beds will be put in place by the third quarter of next year, because they are subject to some building work being done.  We have identified the revenue and capital costs required for these investments over the next two and a half years.

There is a device that is manufactured in America.  The FDA has in July of this year issued strong caution about it.  It has alerted both patients and healthcare providers of the potential risk of this device.  One of the key concerns it flagged is that the end caps of this device have a tendency to detach from the rest of the device.  They detach from the rod itself while it is implanted.  It has also been referenced that these have not been tested for biocompatibility.  Basically, they detach when within the body of the person.  We do not know what potential harm that causes.  The scientific world is investigating this.  Currently, however, there is a suspension of the sale of this device in all 33 countries that require a Conformit&egrave; Europ&euml;enne, CE, mark.  On top of that, there is a voluntary hold on shipments of the device in other countries.  I understand that the device is still used in Ireland in scoliosis surgery.  I understand that 51 patients may already have this device implanted in them.  It is continuing to be implanted on so-called compassionate grounds on the basis that the need for surgery and the need for this device outweighs potential risks that other regulatory bodies on the other side of the Atlantic have already flagged.  I do not expect Mr. Woods to have all the answers.  It is a bit of a curve ball question.  If nothing else, I want it on record here today that we have major concerns about this device.  The world&rsquo;s scientific community has major concerns about it and surgeons have major concerns about it.  The CE mark has been withdrawn from the device.  The FDA has written cautionary notes to all in the sector.  Yet, in Ireland, we still continue to implant this.  It is essential that we slow down a little bit here and that we look at global scientific studies.  If this device needs to be suspended, which other countries have done, we should follow suit in that and not become the outlier in potentially putting patients, particularly young people, at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111100002#O01400","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

They are in wheelchairs and they are awaiting surgery.  On top of that, those who have had surgery have had this added risk, health concern and potentially a metallosis or a detachment of end caps.  It concerns me.  I am glad that we have clarification this morning.  However, we have been outliers in continuing to implant this when other countries pulled right back from it.  Ms Kelly&rsquo;s clarification is welcome here, but it needs to go beyond what is said in the committee this morning.  That needs to be issued in a communiqu&eacute; to all families of patients who are either waiting for or who have received this implant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111100002#O01900","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":670,"content":"<p>Chair, may I please have an opportunity to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111100002#O02000","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman"},{"type":"speech","time":1636588800,"counter":671,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111100002#O02100","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":672,"content":"<p>Thank you.

The number of patients waiting for inpatient and day case procedures is over 5,000.  A further 44,000 - an incredible number and quite a scandal - children are waiting for outpatient appointments.

Many of the technical questions have already been asked so I will not go through them again.  We have all had a considerable amount of communication from parents of children who are suffering from scoliosis.  I was struck by the situation of parents who contacted me.  They ended up leaving the country because they were concerned about the care their son was going to get.  I do not think they are the only ones.  They were able to do that.  I was really struck by that case.  They were comparing the care they get in Ireland and abroad.  Their son was preliminarily diagnosed with scoliosis in the womb and all these different things.  They moved to Finland.  I was struck when they told me about the comparison in the care they were getting in another country.  I was struck by how far we are from where we need to be, which has very much been highlighted here.  Those parents are confident they will get the surgery when it is needed.  In Finland, all the medical files are available online for parents to see whenever they want.  I will not even ask our guests to get into medical files and how they are made available online because I know there is a whole issue around that here in Ireland.  We need to get there at some point.  The hospitals in Finland are well staffed, modern and all of those things.<\/p> <p>  The technical questions having been asked, the main question I wish to ask is whether our guests think we have simply failed in our approach to children's healthcare in Ireland.  Have we failed in our approach to scoliosis treatment?  Is that a reasonable thing to say?  From all the communication I have received and all of the frustration I have heard from parents, the overwhelming sense I get is that we have simply failed.  Can our guests comment on that?<\/p> <p>  We are talking about specialist staff.  During the previous session, it was mentioned that a particular kind of staff member is required.  Those are people who are willing to work in a system.  I worry about the best laid plans to get the specialist staff in an area when we cannot compete with what they would get in the private market.  I was struck when it was said in the previous session that a very particular kind of person is required.  How are we going to do that?  How are we going to get away from what we have, which, as parents are saying, is a failed system?  That was the case before Covid-19 and the cyberattack.  I know there are plans and everything is laid out, but what comfort can we give to parents?  I cannot comprehend the suffering parents are going through.  They are listening to all of these plans and different things but their children needed care last year and two, three and four years ago, or before they left this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111100002#R01700","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":763,"content":"<p>I will start and Ms Kelly might come in.  It is heartbreaking to hear that people think they have to leave the country because their child's condition will not be dealt with.  We have excellent physicians and many patients who come through our systems are treated very well and very successfully.  When we got investment and addressed this issue we made a significant impact.  We will never have zero but we had 147 patients on our waiting list in January of whom 70% were waiting less than four months.  That is not bad considering the constraint we still have, which is far less infrastructure than what we will have in the children's hospital.  At a high level, we currently have 13 theatres; we will have 18 in the new children's hospital.  That takes time to develop.<\/p> <p>  We have a very good plan and the way to attract colleagues is how we have gone about it already.  The Deputy heard Professor McCormack talk about colleagues going away to the people they know and then coming back.  Our 14 physicians and surgeons are very clear about how they can develop the future trainees who are coming up.  They support, identify and work with them and we in CHI do what we call proleptic appointments.  We are even willing to appoint a surgeon to finish off his or her fellowship and then come back to us.  These are the all the measures we are putting in place and people are attracted to the posts because of what we do.  It is quite correct that those working in paediatrics are not driven by the private market.  We are driven by trying our best to put the child at the centre and working with each child as much as we can.  We have constraints because, as the clinicians quite rightly said, this is part of orthopaedics, which is a bigger area we have to address and a big factor in the numbers I read out earlier for children trying to access paediatric services.<\/p> <p>  Credit has to be given to some of the clinicians for being quite innovative about some of the ways to address the waiting list.  From a global perspective, our outpatient waiting list is going down.  It is long but is going down because of the initiatives we are putting in place.  Our day cases are also going down although our inpatient numbers are not.  That is the area that has been impacted to a major degree.  It is one of the challenges I outlined along with the fact that our hospitals are pretty much full of infectious disease and respiratory syncytial virus, RSV, cases, in which we have experienced a major surge.  It is quite complex.  I will ask Ms Kelly to talk about some of our initiatives to try to give assurance that we are trying to be as innovative as possible before we get to the new children's hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111100002#S00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636588800,"counter":764,"content":"<p>I have one comment on this.

They are the most highly trained spinal surgeons possible so it is heartbreaking to hear that parents feel they have to leave the country for treatment.<\/p> <p>  On initiatives, every crisis creates an opportunity, as they say.  We tried to do a lot of work during the Covid pandemic.  One of the initiatives we got was the active triage clinics where consultants actively triage a patient, ring them beforehand and then see them face-to-face.  To put some numbers on that, and I know it is not all about numbers, Crumlin hospital staff saw more than 1,000 patients in Citywest.  The conversion rate of those 1,000 children to surgery was just 5%, which is reassuring.  Those children were the ones who were waiting longest and that is a reassuring figure.  That initiative worked outstandingly well.  We need more initiatives and we need support from management and the Government to continue them.<\/p> <p>  We also brought in virtual fracture clinics.  That initiative really transformed how many patients we needed to see in the actual clinic.

I strongly believe, however, that no surgeon should ever get to a situation where he or she has an unmanageable waiting list.  That is just not fair on the surgeon and it is not fair on the children, predominantly, and families attending that surgeon.  There should be a system, and we are seeking to introduce it, whereby once the waiting list goes over a certain length of time, the surgeon has to essentially say \"I am temporarily full\" and deal with those children on his or her waiting list before taking on more patients, which is just not fair on anybody.<\/p> <p>  Somebody brought up the issue of looking across the group of surgeons.  If a surgeon is really good he or she will attract more patients, which is understandable.  Patients need to be able to make the choice of who they go to.  We need to look across the board - if one surgeon has a very long waiting list and somebody else has one that is shorter - at how we can implement access to care for those parents quicker.
