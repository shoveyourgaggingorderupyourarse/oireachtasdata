By 2030, we will upgrade a third of all homes to at least a B2 energy standard, installing approximately 400,000 heat pumps. Currently over 99% of our vehicle fleet is powered by fossil fuels.

The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the proposed national extension of the smoky coal ban, a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the proposal of two former Ministers to expand the smoky coal ban. <\/p>  <p>  This is particularly disappointing, given the impact poor air quality can have on human health and the environment and the emphasis the Government is putting on transitioning to a low carbon society. <\/p>  <p>  The basis of their challenge is that a nationwide smoky coal ban cannot be introduced without a nationwide ban on the burning of peat, turf and wet wood because these products produce similar levels of pollution.

The entire financial services landscape has changed utterly, characterised by the presence of new European institutions; strengthened regulations; a more intrusive supervisory approach; and a new focus on macroprudential requirements.<\/p><p>New European regulations have strengthened controls over the banking system and have resulted in an overhaul of regulation, supervision and resolution regimes.

Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils).

Revenue acknowledges that this concessionary approach was unsatisfactory and led to diverging and inconsistent practices. There were continuous efforts by elements in the industry to expand its scope to include products that should be standard rated, including products claiming to enhance male fertility, promote hair growth, boost tanning, avoid a hangover and reduce stress.<\/p>  <p>  Following complaints from the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act. The expert prepared a detailed, scientific report that concluded that food supplement products are not conventional food. Based on the expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. Following the review, Revenue engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Bill 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019.

(SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on 9 April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting.

In such schools, faith formation and preparation for religious sacraments takes place outside of school hours. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Constitution and\u00a0the Education Act 1998 parents have a right to have their children opt out of any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student or in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student themself.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt-out of any class including religion is upheld is a matter for the school concerned. The precise nature of the arrangements have to be considered by each school having regards to the particular circumstances\u00a0 in question including factors such as the numbers of children involved, the ages of those children and the availability of staff and physical space in the school concerned.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Advisory Group to the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector (2012) acknowledged that denominational religious education, including faith formation and sacramental preparation are long-established features of the primary system. With regard to denominational religious education in primary schools, the Forum&rsquo;s Report did not recommend that it be removed from the school day.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, the Advisory Group had concerns about the amount of time which can be devoted to sacramental preparation in some schools and they recommended that it should not be allowed to encroach on time allocated for the general curriculum.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is in the process of reviewing and redeveloping the Primary School Curriculum as a whole. As part of this process the allocation of time across the curriculum will be considered, which will include the time allocated to religious education.\u00a0\u00a0The NCCA will publish a draft overview of a redeveloped primary curriculum in autumn 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector also recommended that the State has a responsibility to ensure that all children have the right to receive Education about Religion and Beliefs (ERB) and Ethics.\u00a0 ERB and Ethics is being considered as part of the review and redevelopment of the primary curriculum, and is intended to be suitable for all children regardless of their religious beliefs.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  At post-primary level, the Religious Education curriculum designed by the NCCA is an optional\u00a0examinable subject at Junior and Leaving Certificate.

For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on 9 April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting.

The WEF Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) combines 103 indicators derived from both qualitative surveys and quantitative data to assess the drivers of productivity and long-term prosperity. The findings of the report serve as a critical reminder of the importance of competitiveness in laying the foundation for future prosperity.<\/p>  <p>  In the 2019 Global Competitiveness Index, Ireland is ranked 24th out of 141 countries. Over the 10-year period since 2010, Ireland&rsquo;s overall ranking has ranged from 29th (2010) to 23rd (2018). Ireland&rsquo;s 2019 score means that it is currently the 9th most competitive economy in the euro area and the 12th most competitive economy in the EU28, according to the WEF.<\/p>  <p>  Rankings can be useful, but they must be treated with caution, especially when examining year-on-year changes. The WEF&rsquo;s Global Competitiveness Rankings is one of a number of international competitiveness indicators that my Department uses to assess Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness performance. Although Ireland&rsquo;s ranking fell by one place in the 2019 WEF Competitiveness Rankings, Ireland is ranked 7th in the 2019 IMD World Competitiveness Rankings which measures the performance of countries across four dimensions: Economic Performance; Government Efficiency; Business Efficiency; and Infrastructure. Moreover, 30% of the WEF&rsquo;s GCI score is derived from survey-based indicators which are subjective in nature, calculated using the WEF annual Executive Opinion Survey. <\/p>  <p>  International rankings should be understood in the much wider context of competitiveness. To assess Ireland&rsquo;s overall performance, my department looks at several aspects of competitiveness indicators, including those in the National Competitiveness Council's (NCC) annual Cost of Doing Business report, the NCC&rsquo;s Competitiveness Scorecard, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator, the CSO&rsquo;s nominal unit labour cost indicator, in addition to Ireland&rsquo;s performance in other competitiveness indicators. On this basis, the NCC has concluded that Ireland remains a competitive economy.<\/p>  <p>  Competitiveness rankings reflect the interaction of a range of factors that, combined, determine the ability of firms to compete successfully in international markets. Advanced economies, such as Ireland, at the upper end of competitiveness rankings, can find it harder to get high impact from the improvements being made as they are already near the top score. Nonetheless, enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness by investing in areas where deficiencies have been identified is crucial to bolster our resilience to shocks, especially in the context of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  Improving our competitiveness and ensuring that Ireland is an attractive location to do business remains a key economic priority for this Government. We continue to monitor Ireland's competitiveness and analyse its underlying factors. The NCC will issue recommendations in its forthcoming 2019 Ireland's Competitiveness Challenge report in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  My officials will establish the actions we can take to further improve our competitiveness, particularly in the areas where we are lagging competitors.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600064#WRE06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600064#WRE06600"},{"type":"question","counter":320,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[42411\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600064#WRE06700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps she is taking to ensure that all public bodies comply with S.I.

That is why my Department and its Agencies have been doing everything we can to increase the level of employment and investment in every county in Ireland. This has included placing a particular emphasis on boosting foreign direct investment (FDI) in regional areas. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018, Monaghan experienced an 8% increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) employment, with 12 jobs added by companies in the County. Similarly, Meath saw a 4.5% increase, with the creation of 67 new jobs. While there were no new FDI-supported jobs created in Cavan in 2018, it is encouraging to note last week's announcement by Liberty Insurance that it will create 120 new roles in the County over the next three years. That expansion is a great vote of confidence in what Cavan and the wider Border region has to offer to multinationals.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to site visits in 2019, data is only yet available for the first six months of this year. Counties Meath and Monaghan each hosted two site visits over that period. County Cavan hosted four site visits over those six months. While the IDA will continue to promote and showcase locations in these Counties to prospective investors, it is important to remember that the decision as to where to invest is always taken by the companies themselves. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the IDA have taken a number of steps to attract further investment to these Counties. As part of Budget 2019, for example, I allocated an additional &euro;10 million for the next phase of the IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme (RPP). This includes plans for an Advanced Technology Unit (ATU) at Knockaconny, County Monaghan. I announced the appointment of a design and delivery team for this ATU earlier in 2019 with construction due to commence later this year. These facilities can help to encourage overseas investors to consider regional areas and I am confident that the ATU in Knockaconny, once complete, will lead to further investment and job creation. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the RPP, the IDA targets further investment for the wider area through its office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre. The Agency has also appointed a new Regional Business Development Manager for the North-East Region. As part of its strategy to promote the area, the IDA is focusing on specific sectors including agri-food, manufacturing, tourism and internationally traded services. The Agency's staff regularly engage with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan and Monaghan, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector. County Meath, meanwhile, is being actively marketed by the IDA as a location for second sites for multinationals in the Dublin region, with a focus on building clusters in existing sectors like high-value manufacturing and international services.<\/p>  <p>In addition to the work of the IDA, my Department&rsquo;s &euro;60 million Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) has supported five projects within the Meath, Cavan and Monaghan area, with a total investment of &euro;8.2 million. These include: the Boyne Valley Food Innovation District in Meath; a food centre of excellence in Ballybay; a networked digital and innovation hub in Cavan (with others located in Leitrim and Longford); an engineering business network across the North East region; and an investment of &euro;4.9 million in a nationally significant bioeconomy innovation centre located in Monaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600064#WRE07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Schemes","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600064#WRE07200"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[42494\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600064#WRE07300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if the introduction of a merchant's incentive scheme to grant small businesses easier access to point of sales terminals will be examined; and when the new digital strategy will be completed and published.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":327,"content":"<p>In order to support the retail sector, I introduced the pilot Online Retail Scheme in 2018.

If the forest has been impacted by biotic and abiotic factors, it\u00a0may struggle to grow as well as a forest that has not been subject to\u00a0pest or disease outbreaks. Each individual forest is, therefore, different in terms of the amount of carbon it can capture and only ground verification of a mature forest can give an accurate figure of carbon capture. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent National Forest Inventory estimates that Ireland's forests have removed (sequestered) on average 3.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year (approximately 5 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year)\u00a0from the atmosphere over the period 2007 to 2016\u00a0based on a total national forest estate of 770,020 ha.\u00a0 This is an average figure and takes into account all different types of tree species and ages growing on a range of different soil types. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the rate of sequestration changes over time as a forest develops and matures. The Department has funded a number of large scale research projects which have examined carbon stocks and stock changes in Irish forests.

An annual average limit value of 40 micrograms per cubic metre is in place to protect against the health effects of long term exposure, and an hourly limit value of 200 micrograms per cubic metre protects against acute exposure.<\/p>  <p>  In the event of an exceedance of these limits, the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2011 provide that the relevant local authority or authorities shall prepare a clear, comprehensible and accessible air quality plan, or review and revise an existing plan, to ensure compliance with the limit value or values within the time limit specified for the relevant pollutant or pollutants. Such an air quality plan must be submitted within two years of the end of the year in which the exceedance was observed.<\/p>  <p>  The report also underlines the need to implement the Climate Action Plan, which was published in June this year. The Plan includes a number of actions which will have a significant impact on reducing emissions and improving air quality, including:<\/p>  <p>  - Putting 180,000 electric vehicles on our roads by 2025 and almost 1m by 2030<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring the EV charging network underpins public confidence<\/p>  <p>  - Creating an early public procurement framework for EVs<\/p>  <p>  - Accelerating steps to decarbonise the public transport fleet<\/p>  <p>  - Establishing a Cycling Project Office, develop a 5 year cycling strategy and roll out 200km of new cycle lanes through bus connects<\/p>  <p>  - Developing a new Park and Ride Strategy, to reduce congestion and lower journey times<\/p>  <p>  - Developing a regulatory framework on low emission zones and parking pricing policies, and provide local authorities with the power to restrict access to certain parts of a city or a town to zero emission vehicles only<\/p>  <p>  - Legislating for no new fossil fuel vehicles to be sold from 2030<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are establishing a working group, bringing relevant organisations together to ensure early action is taken to improve the air quality in Dublin. This process will include the two Departments, the four Dublin Local Authorities, the EPA ,and other relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  This work will complement the work already underway in developing an all of government Clean Air Strategy which will provide an overarching policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect in a manner consistent with national priorities, EU and other international policy considerations. The Clean Air Strategy will address a range of harmful air pollutants in Ireland, including those arising from the agricultural, transport and residential heating sectors, in an integrated manner. I intend to publish the Strategy in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600067#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobile Telephony Services","counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600067#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":479,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[42409\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600067#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans for improving the availability of mobile telephone signals in rural Ireland and particularly in County Donegal; if he is dealing with this matter as a priority at present; his views on whether something can be achieved to alleviate this crisis of mobile telephone coverage nationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":480,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[42561\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600067#WRH00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the degree to which the quality and availability of mobile telephone services throughout Ireland compare with those of other states throughout the European Union; the extent to which improvements can be achieved with minimal disruption; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":481,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[42563\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600067#WRH00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the steps he will take to improve the availability and quality of mobile telephone services nationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":482,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202, 212 and 214 together.<\/p>  <p>  Providing telecommunications services, including mobile phone services, is a matter for the relevant service providers operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as independent Regulator.

In performing its regulatory function, its actions include responding to breaches of regulations while respecting fair procedures and natural justice. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has provided my Department with the following information. The Early Years Inspectorate conducted an inspection of the service in question - which catered for both pre-school and school-age children - in line with the requirements of the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016 on 19 June 2019. During this inspection it was observed that the service, which was approved for a specific number of children, was operating outside its registration status, with a substantial number of additional children observed in attendance. Tusla advised the service to revert immediately to its approved registration status, and to take immediate remedial action to address the risk posed to children on the premises due to inadequate insurance. Tusla also referred the service to the local Chief Fire Officer and to the Planning and Enforcement Section of the local Council. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla carried out a follow-up inspection of the service in September 2019, and found that more than the approved number of children were attending the service. Tusla again instructed the service to revert to its approved registration status.  <\/p>  <p>  Tusla also received an application from the registered provider for registration of a school-age service which highlighted that the service has been operating in contravention of its planning permission, which states that the number of children to be accommodated at the facility must not exceed a set number.  This has resulted in the regrettable situation described. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the independent statutory regulator, carried out some 2,513 inspections in 2018. As per standard procedure, if this case had proceeded to a deregistration notice then Tusla would have informed the Department at that point. In such cases, that information then triggers suspension by the Department of funding, and referral to the local City\/County Childcare Committee to work with parents and local services to help accommodate children who may lose their place in the service. This situation did not arise in this case.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla continues to engage with the registered provider to resolve this matter as expeditiously as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600068#WRJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Voluntary Sector Funding","counter":571,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600068#WRJ02700"},{"type":"question","counter":572,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[42480\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600068#WRJ02800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if sufficient funding will be ring-fenced for a charity (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":573,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, provides funding to many organisations that support children and families throughout the country.<\/p><p>As the allocation of such funding is an operational matter for Tusla, I have requested Tusla to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600068#WRJ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":575,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600068#WRJ03100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Services Programme","counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600068#WRJ03000"},{"type":"question","counter":575,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[42444\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600068#WRJ03100","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the steps he will take in respect of a community centre (details supplied) which urgently requires funding to address health and safety problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":576,"content":"<p>I am aware\u00a0of the\u00a0current\u00a0situation\u00a0in Huntstown Community Centre and I know how important the centre is to the community there.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Community\u00a0facilities are funded from a range of different sources\u00a0across different Government Departments and agencies.\u00a0 The supports provided by my Department help people to participate in the development of their communities and also provide funding to improve community facilities.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  For example, my Department has provided funding of &euro;184,264 to Huntstown Community\u00a0Centre\u00a0in 2019 under the\u00a0Community Services Programme (CSP).\u00a0 The CSP currently supports\u00a0more than\u00a0400 community organisations to provide local services through a social enterprise model.\u00a0 Funding\u00a0is\u00a0provided as a fixed annual contribution to the cost of a manager and an agreed number of full-time equivalent positions.

It has now been implemented across the Department's Branch Office network and in eight\u00a0Intreo Centres with rollout across the remainder of the Intreo network planned to complete in mid 2020.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There has been full and ongoing consultation with\u00a0staff\u00a0and unions in the development,<\/p>  <p>  piloting and implementation of the new model.

Commercial Rates, at approximately &euro;1.5bn per annum, make up roughly a third of local government current (revenue) income. <\/p>  <p>  Recognising the critical importance of commercial rates I prioritised the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 and it was enacted earlier this year. The Act modernises the rates system for both ratepayers and local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities are required by legislation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.  <\/p>  <p>  The annual rate on valuation (ARV) is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. The ARV is then applied to each property&rsquo;s valuation to obtain the amount payable in rates. <\/p>  <p>  The independent Commissioner for Valuation is currently conducting a national programme of revaluation to provide consistent, up-to-date valuations so that rates are equitably distributed. Revaluation results in a redistribution of the commercial rates liability between ratepayers. While an individual occupier&rsquo;s rates liability may increase or decrease, the revaluation will not increase the overall commercial rates income of the local authority. It is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase the commercial rates collected. <\/p>  <p>  After a revaluation of a local authority area the Minister is required to make a Rates Limitation Order (RLO) to ensure that the overall rates collected in that area for the following year, does not increase beyond normal inflation and buoyancy to take account of new valuations.  RLOs have been made for each of the local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date and will be made in the coming weeks in respect of the eight local authorities where revaluations have concluded this year.<\/p>  <p>  To date, revaluations have been fully completed in 16 local authorities, a further eight were completed in 2019 and the final tranche should be completed by 2021. At all stages of the process, ratepayers are consulted and informed and can bring relevant information to bear on the valuation. Ultimately ratepayers have a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal. In terms of revaluations to date, I understand that the trend is that approximately 60% of ratepayers have experienced a decrease.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities work closely with ratepayers experiencing difficulties with the payment of commercial rates.  In this regard, local authorities may facilitate the payment of commercial rates by instalments, and work with businesses to put in place flexible payment options. The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 will further facilitate such flexible approaches, provided ratepayers engage with the local authority concerned. <\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the Act also provides for new rates vacancy abatement and rates alleviation schemes, to be decided by local authority members in order to promote national and\/or local policy objectives.  My Department is currently preparing supporting regulations and working with local authorities on implementation with a view to commencing these provisions.  These new provisions will add to the suite of options already available to local authorities to support local businesses and ratepayers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600069#WRK05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tenant Purchase Scheme Eligibility","counter":662,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600069#WRK05300"},{"type":"question","counter":663,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[42363\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101600069#WRK05400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason tenants of Traveller specific homes are excluded from consideration under the terms of the incremental tenant purchase scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":664,"content":"<p>The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015, provide the basis for the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme for existing local authority houses.
