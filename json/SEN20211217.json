The Bill seeks to regulate the maritime area:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... by means of a National Marine Planning Framework, maritime area consents for the occupation of the maritime area for the purposes of maritime usages that will be undertaken for undefined or relatively long periods of time (including any such usages which also require development permission under the Planning and Development Act 2000) and licences for the occupation of the maritime area for maritime usages that are minor or that will be undertaken for relatively short periods of time, to establish a body corporate, the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority [as the Minister of State well knows, it is not a planning authority, and this point is key to my amendment], to grant, revoke and suspend such consents and licences, take administrative responsibility for foreshore authorisations and generally oversee the enforcement of this Act in so far as it relates to such consents and licences, to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide for how that Act will treat applications for development permission which must have a maritime area consent before being made ... <\/blockquote> <p>That is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#A00800","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I wish to be fair to everyone, so I remind Senators to please stick to the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#A00900","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>This sets the context for my amendment.  I thank Senators Craughwell and Keogan for supporting it.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State will be well aware of the important role of local government and our councillors.  We recently had a debate that was guillotined.  I do not intend to go through all of it because it is on the record but the Minister of State, whom I am glad is in attendance, is fully committed to the importance of councillors, as am I.  I never apologise for advocating strongly in the House for local authority members and, indeed, local authorities.  I do so again today.  That is why I have tabled this amendment.<\/p> <p>I am seeking to delete the phrase \"or a local authority\".  I have no difficulty with Oireachtas Members or MEPs not being included in the proposed maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, but I have a difficulty with councillors being excluded.  Let us be clear, in that this is primary legislation, so any suggestion that the Minister might look at doing something in future will not wash with me.  This Bill has been a long time coming and deliberately sets out to exclude local authorities.  It reads: \"a member of ... a local authority shall, while he or she is so entitled or such a member, be disqualified for membership of the Board (M) or a committee of the Board (M).\"  There is no ambiguity; the Bill excludes them.  This was thought up by the draftspeople, the people in the Department and, indeed, the Minister.  Ultimately, this legislation crossed the Minister's desk.  What I am seeking to do is afford recognition.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, held a large meeting in Cavan.  Afterwards, I spoke with its president, Mr. Nicholas Crossan, who lives in Buncrana and is an active person.  County Donegal has a long shoreline.  Indeed, there is a long shoreline all around this country.  Mr. Crossan asked me whether I would contact the number of colleagues from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Green Party and Independents who attended the meeting, which I did.  I singled out Wexford, Waterford, Louth, Galway, Clare and Cork.  I spoke to councillors from those counties and teased out some of the issues.  They are emphatic in their belief that they have a meaningful role.  I agree with them.  I was a director of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company for ten years.  I played an active role in it, as did all parties.  There was cross-representation, with four or five of us representing all the political groups.<\/p> <p>Through this amendment, I am seeking not just to talk about my commitment to city and county councillors but to include in this primary legislation the requirement that local authorities and local authority members be allowed to be part of MARA.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The suggestion is that we would allow local authorities and local authority members to be part of the board of MARA.

When I say exact, it related to the support of councillors.  To be fair to every Member on all sides of the House who spoke, they all spoke of the significance and importance of local authority members being involved.  I do not think there is any dispute about our commitment to having councillors involved, but do we have the bottle to stand up today and support this amendment?  I ask all Senators across the House to stand in solidarity with the city and county councillors who elect them, and from whom they seek a mandate, and to support them in this hour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#A01000","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his Churchillian oration.  This is a matter I raised on Second Stage with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  It applies very specifically to this legislation, but it is the general principle of the exclusion of councillors from certain State boards.  The case I made then, and to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, on Committee Stage, is that it is not about a councillor being appointed just because he or she is a councillor, it is where the person has relevant expertise and all other things being equal that he or she should not be excluded from consideration for appointment to the board because of the fact that he or she is a councillor.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is a very strong advocate of getting good people into local government.  It is increasingly difficult when we get people who have professional expertise or extensive life experience who could serve on a board but because they are a councillor, they are excluded.<\/p> <p>I raised the matter with the Minister on Second Stage and he agreed with me.  His comment was interesting.  I spoke with him separately afterwards.  Senator Fitzpatrick and I then tabled amendments and, purely coincidentally after that, Senator Boyhan tabled very similar amendments.  I am happy if there is a commitment to look at the role of councillors on State boards, as the exclusion does not just apply to this legislation.<\/p> <p>The concern I expressed on Committee Stage is that councillors are specifically excluded, but that a nominee of the county and city chief executives will be appointed to the board of MARA.  From that perspective, in terms of the balance, it is only fair that we should not exclude councillors.  It does have a general implication, because in nearly every piece of legislation that comes through these Houses, local authority members are excluded, which is wrong.  I agree with Senator Boyhan that it makes sense for particular reasons for Members of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament not to sit on State boards, but I wonder why that is the case if somebody has a particular level of expertise and he or she applies for the job and is seen as the best candidate but because he or she happens to be a councillor, he or she is excluded.  That is wrong.  I hope in the Minister of State will be very clear in setting the direction of travel in that area, because this is not just about MARA, we are trying to remove a similar proposal on the media commission that is coming up.  It applies across all State boards.  I hope the Minister of State will give us a very clear indication in his response that the general principle will be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#B00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I have seconded Senator Boyhan's amendment.

This amendment seeks to ensure that elected members of a local authority are eligible for appointment as members of the board or a committee of the board of Mara.  It is the Government's intention that MARA will become a centre of excellence for maritime usages.  I am committed to ensuring the success of the new agency.<\/p> <p>On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, we moved a number of amendments to address concerns raised on Second Stage.  These amendments rebalanced the proposed composition of the MARA board to ensure a broader scope of representation and to facilitate the appointment of a range of members to the MARA board.  Also on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, Deputies were advised that to ensure confidence in the governance arrangements for MARA, a governance review of the establishment provisions was to be undertaken.  The review focused on the code of practice for the governance of State bodies to ensure that the establishment of MARA applies a best-practice approach in order to achieve the highest possible standards of corporate governance.<\/p> <p>As Senators are aware, the code of practice for the governance of State bodies covers such matters as the role of the board and chief executive, codes of conduct, ethics in public office and the body's relationship with the Oireachtas, Ministers and its parent Department, as well as business and financial reporting requirements.  The review found that the Bill successfully addressed the key governance requirements for a State regulatory body.  It noted that the Bill provides a robust framework for the new authority, clearly delineating its corporate status, functions and structure, and defining an appropriate set of relationships internally and externally.<\/p> <p>The review was completed in advance of Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, and a number of minor amendments were proposed and accepted on Report Stage, which reflected the best-practice recommendations arising from the review.  These included the terms of office of board members, placing the board as a decision maker with regard to the employment of a chief executive officer, and reducing the time for the production of corporate strategies from five years to three years.<\/p> <p>I am fully satisfied that the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021 provides a best practice approach to the governance of MARA from the day of establishment.  While there may be requirements in the future to review the composition and corporate structure of MARA, that review should only happen once MARA has become operational and has had the opportunity to show what it can achieve.  Following the governance review, I have assurances that MARA, as currently provided for in the text, is wholly sound and balanced.  I will not accept any amendments that seek to trouble this balance.<\/p> <p>I would like to add that there is nothing in this legislation that prevents an elected member of a local authority from applying for the position of chief executive or for membership of the board of MARA.  If he or she were selected and decided to serve with MARA, then he or she could not hold his or her elected position concurrently.  This is exactly the same situation as that which pertains to a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, an elected Deputy or a Member of the European Parliament.<\/p> <p>I fully appreciate the intention behind the amendment and the reasoning highlighted by the Senator that the matter raised relates not only to this legislation.  I note that this very issue was raised only last week in this House during the Second Stage debate on the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Bill.  It may be more appropriate for the Senator to seek a holistic review of these standard provisions.<\/p> <p>As Minister of State with responsibility for local government, I am overseeing reform of the role of local elected members in the context of the Moorhead report.  I have listened to the opinions of colleagues and I wholeheartedly agree that local authority elected members do exceptional work in their localities.  In that spirit, I commit to looking at the role of elected members, and have done so, in terms of their involvement in State boards as part of the reform programme, which I have outlined many times in this House, and as recently as two weeks ago.  However, I am satisfied that the provisions as they stand in this Bill are robust and appropriate in that context.  The Senators may wish to consider the amendment in the light of my comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#B00400","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>First, I do not doubt the Minister of State's commitment to local government.

I tabled this amendment.  It is heartening that the same amendment was tabled by two Senators from across the House who are in the Chamber now.  It was the exact same, so there should be no difficulty.  What difference does it make?  I wanted to put that on record because it is important in the context of the integrity and the functioning of this House and how it manages amendments that have been tabled.  I was not aware of the content of the amendment until the cream list was published and I was delighted to see the amendments were the same.  I acknowledge the significant work the Bills Office does in preparing amendments.  The staff do exceptional work, with great integrity and professionalism, and I send out a clear message of support to them.<\/p><p>I cannot accept the Minister of State's response, with all due respect to him.  I like him as a person and think he is an exceptionally good Minister of State, but it is not enough for him just to suggest a review may be carried out in future.  Today is the day.  This is the primary legislation.  I appreciate the difficulties he has and the fact the D&aacute;il cannot be recalled.  I accept people are anxious to get the Bill to the &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in to be signed but there is no rush.  This can happen in two, three or four weeks.  There is no deadline for getting this over the line.  Let us get it right.  I set out to engage with sitting county councillors throughout the country, which I think I do reasonably well, and to ask them for their views.  I circulated the pre-legislative scrutiny report, some of which was not included in this legislation, although that is in the past.  We are here today, in the final stage of this process.  I tabled a second amendment but, unfortunately, we ran out of time.  Was I wise?  That amendment was not in the name of any other Senator, so it is not the exact same as the amendment we were talking about earlier.  Moreover, only five amendments have been submitted for today and none of them has come from the Government's side.<\/p><p>It is important we have this opportunity, in the context of what is our major function in this House, to polish up and improve legislation, as the T&aacute;naiste said when he visited here in the past year or two.  This is our opportunity.  The Government needs to big enough, strong enough and brave enough to support a good amendment when it sees it.  If we are advocating for local government and city and county councils, we must stand with them and make their points.  <\/p><p>Local authorities and their members should be entitled both to be members of MARA and to be a city or county councillor.  Indeed, I was once both a county councillor and a member of a harbour company board, and I think we did a pretty good job.  Senator Ward talked about the functions and the success of that harbour company in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  The legislation will disqualify elected councillors from membership of the board or committee of MARA and that is wrong.  We can talk all we like about supporting them, making them stronger and having reviews such that they will be the kernel of everything, but we have the power today to make that decision.<\/p><p>I will push the amendment because I have set out from the beginning to ensure this would be debated.  I believe strongly in it and think it should be pursued.  People should stand up and be counted.  They can either side with elected members and ensure they will have a meaningful role in MARA, or they cannot.

There are serious concerns in respect of the Bill.  Although we heard from the Minister on Committee Stage about all the engagement with environmental groups and the various established actors, environmental NGOs and others, that does not seem to stand up in the context of the Bill because those organisations have been expressing serious concerns.  There was discussion on that Stage in respect of the relationship to the maritime area and there was a question regarding the word &quot;usages&quot;, but it cannot be simply extractive.  Similarly, the relationship with civil society and environmental NGOs is not simply a one-sided relationship where the Ministers are happy they have consulted and then go ahead with the legislation.  There is a deep and important role and power that is rightly distributed among citizens and environmental NGOs, which have their own responsibilities and role in the context of good planning.  There is a concern that this legislation is diluting that role and seeking to dilute that power.  There are several ways in which it does so.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the issue of <i>locus standi<\/i>.  The amendment deals clearly with this issue.  It refers to &quot;a body or organisation (other than a State authority, a public authority or governmental body or agency) the aims or objectives of which relate to the promotion of environmental protection, and has, during the period of one month preceding the date of the application, pursued those aims or objectives&quot; because some such bodies will be very long-established organisations and others will be groups of citizens who come together out of concern for their local environment and they should have <i>locus standi <\/i>to pursue judicial review.  Section 110(b) as proposed in the amendment is of particular importance in the context of ensuring that groups of local concerned actors, possibly comprising people who may work together on just one area, who decide to take on an environmental issue that is really important to them and their place are not at risk of being deemed as having insufficient interest or not being allowed to pursue judicial review in respect of an MAC in particular.  This point about who can take action is crucially related to the concerns that have been expressed.  As I stated, I understand members of the environmental pillar have written to the Department urging still at this late stage that proper consideration be given and proper measures put in place to ensure we have those meaningful checks and balances that are so crucial and part of our democracy, along with the Legislature and the Executive, in the context of rights through the courts and the role of civil society.  There are many serious questions in respect of judicial review, among which is the question of who takes the case.<br\/><br\/>On a related issue, many questions arise in respect of section 133 of the Bill.  First, why is the section in the Bill?  It looks like a version of section 50B that already exists under the planning legislation.  Surely the obvious thing would be for section 50B to still apply, even though it has some flaws.  That section is what most environmental NGOs and other actors would expect to use to challenge a decision in respect of a maritime area consent based on environmental concerns, yet there is this kind of parallel version of it inserted into the Bill which subtly changes the language and removes certain areas in the context of this judicial review role.  What is really concerning is that there is already provision in respect of environmental decision-making and we know the State has obligations under the Aarhus Convention in terms of environmental decision-making so it is important for the Minister to clarify his understanding in this regard.  These are questions to which I need answers today.  Decisions relating to maritime area consents clearly have potential environmental implications because they relate to activities and consents in terms of certain usages and activities within maritime areas.  It is maritime area consent.  It has environmental implications.  I ask the Minister to confirm that he understands that.I am also seeking an explanation for the decision to insert section 133 in the Bill  in respect of judicial review rather than simply applying section 50B, which is law that already exists.<br\/><br\/>This all relates to the issue of people who are trying to take judicial review cases.  I refer to a really odd and worrying concern.  Section 133(7) contains a list of the relevant directives, with reference to the habitats directive among others, but there is a notable omission.  Section 50B, which is equivalent to section 133, contains reference to the integrated pollution prevention and control directive which, of course, has now been supplanted at European level by the industrial emissions directive.  That is crucial because this is about emissions.  It relates to any kind of significant activity.  Of course, the current direction of travel is to monitor emissions more and pay more attention to them and their implications.  To remove that directive as one of the areas where an environmental judicial review might be taken or a judicial review based on environmental concerns strikes an odd note.  It is a strange decision.  It may have implications in the context of liquified natural gas, LNG, if an environmental NGO or concerned group of citizens, for example, wished to take a judicial review on foot of concerns relating to the environmental implications of emissions from something like LNG.  It may even have implications down the line in terms of data centres, given that we know the maritime planning of that, although it might be a different planning process.  I am very concerned in respect of the maritime area consent piece.  I know the Minister will say there are later places in the planning process around these but maritime area consent is still allowing for activities that relate to this issue.  We have seen, even in the context of the climate action Bill, that where an initial activity has been taking place, that is regarded as giving some kind of future tantamount expectation.<br\/><br\/>I am really concerned that as the Bill is set out right now, it will be difficult first for environmental NGOs or local groups of concerned citizens who care about their environment to be properly recognised as having <i>locus standi<\/i>in the context of judicial review.  I am concerned about them being able to properly take judicial review in respect of those issues on the same basis they would be able to bring proceedings under section 50B at the moment.  Will environmental NGOs and others would be able to take a judicial review under section 50B against a maritime area consent?  Will that section still apply?  Can he confirm such organisations will not be told they need to use section 133? <br\/><br\/>I and, I suspect, all other Senators present would like an explanation in respect of why the industrial emissions directive is not considered to be important from an environmental perspective in this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#D00500","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time and the Order of Business for today as agreed, so I will be brief.

I refer to <i>locus standi<\/i>and judicial reviews.  The planning and development Bill 2019 will be coming back to the joint Oireachtas committee in January for pre-legislative scrutiny and review and we will be dealing with a whole range of judicial reviews.  I do not want the message to go out that this Government is against judicial reviews.  That is not the case.

I want a fair, but robust, judicial process.<br\/><br\/>The message coming from Government is that it is against anyone who objects to anything.  That is not the intention, but that is the message.  Today is not the day to be talking about agriculture in Waterford and Kilkenny and all those sorts of issues.  They will be dealt with through the courts, and appropriately.  I think we will be surprised, but let us not pre-empt what will happen there.<br\/><br\/>We need to stand firmly.  I acknowledge the Irish Environmental Network.  People think its members are a bit wacky and a bit crazy, but they are not.  They have engaged well.  Indeed, they are funded by the Department.  It is interesting that on the one hand we have issues with some of these environmental groups, but on the other hand they are being funded by Government.  That is healthy.  That is not a criticism.  It shows a sense of our own maturity about systems.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the <i>locus standi<\/i>, the proposal is that where the applicant is a body or organisation other than a State authority, a public authority or governmental body or agency, that its aims or objectives relate to the promotion of environmental protection, and that it has, during the period of one month preceding the date of the application, pursued those aims or objectives, it shall have <i>locus standi<\/i>to pursue the judicial review and be deemed to have sufficient interest.<br\/><br\/>I am familiar with many of the Green Party councillors throughout this country.  Indeed, there were six or seven in my own county.  Many were politicised through the environmental movement.  They were not politicians first.  They were not in political parties.  They engaged in this process and they came through.  Indeed, one or two of them are sitting at the Cabinet table.  I have great hopes for them, particularly in the next legislation next year to which I referred.<br\/><br\/>We need a judicial review that is fair and robust to all sides and all parties, and that is an important point to make.<br\/><br\/>In concluding, I thank the Irish Environmental Network, An Taisce and many activists, especially in the Green Party, who cut their teeth on environmental issues in local communities, who feed in, and some of whom are now at the table of Government but are in every facet of this organisation which is the Oireachtas.  They will keep a fairly vigilant eye to things.<br\/><br\/>This amendment is worthy of support.

This amendment is entirely unacceptable to the Government.  It seeks to establish the maritime area consent, MAC, as an environmental assessment tool.  That is not what a MAC is.<\/p> <p>The State owns or controls almost the entire maritime area from the high water mark to the outer limit of the continental shelf.  Anyone who wants to carry out a development or activity in the maritime area must, therefore, obtain the consent of the State to be able to occupy a part of the maritime area.  The Maritime Area Planning Bill provides that, prior to development taking place in the maritime area, a developer must obtain a right from the State in the form of a maritime area consent, MAC, to occupy a particular part of the maritime area.  This is confirmed in section 75 of the Bill.<\/p> <p>The MAC concept is new and I think it would be helpful to detail what a MAC is and is not.  A MAC fulfils specific functions within the overall consenting sequence.  A MAC is a right to occupy a part of the maritime area, conditional on securing other necessary approvals; ensures due diligence to ensure the MAC holder can undertake the proposal; manages the relationship between the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, and the holder through the MAC conditions; and is the gateway into planning permission.  A MAC is not a lease - MAC obligations rest exclusively with the holders; permission to undertake works, development or activities &ndash; that is provided for under the Planning Act or in licensing; or an environmental decision-making process.<\/p> <p>We have applied a single environmental assessment principle that is provided for under the Planning Act or in licensing.  Section 79(5) of the Bill provides that, for the avoidance of doubt, the MARA is not required, for the purposes of determining MAC applications, to carry out an environmental impact assessment, EIA, or appropriate assessment, AA, or screening for an EIA or AA.<\/p> <p>In developing the new regime set out in this Bill, we examined in detail the operation of the Foreshore Act and its interactions with the Planning Act.  We have designed a new sequenced consent regime that separates the financial and estate management issues from the environmental and planning issues.  Prospective developers will have to secure a MAC and then apply for planning permission.  They will need to secure both before development can begin.<\/p> <p>The MAC is the grant by the State of a right to occupy the maritime area.  Planning permission is a development consent.  They are different processes that serve different functions.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, by reason of the provisions of sections 79(1) and (2), section 80(1) and the criteria which MARA is required to have regard to as set out in Schedule 5, it should be noted that the information to be provided by an applicant and the criteria to be considered and applied by MARA to an application for a MAC is limited to occupation-related and estate management aspects to be expected where the State is granting an occupation interest to an applicant.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Peter Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a notable lack of reference to environmental matters and criteria, and that is intentional.  The MAC is not the type of consent that should attract an environmental assessment in any form.<br\/><br\/>A MAC is conditional on obtaining development consent or planning permission for the proposed development, whatever that may be.  If the developer fails to obtain the development consent, the MAC is terminated.  There are therefore two related and interconnected consents being granted, one dealing with estate management issues and the other dealing with the development consent issues.  The MAC deals with the estate management element.  The planning permission, whether obtained from An Bord Plean&aacute;la or a coastal planning authority, deals with the development consent aspect and this includes all of the environmental aspects of the consent.<br\/><br\/>Senators should note that, at MAC stage, most applicants will still be at the point of developing their designs and plans for planning applications and will not have engaged in investment in those processes until they have some assurance that they will get a MAC from the State.<br\/><br\/>I cannot accept any proposals that seek to fundamentally change the nature of the MAC process or duplicate what exists under the current regime.  We are creating a new, streamlined and efficient regime to better manage our maritime usages.  The estate management and planning processes must remain distinct and separate in order for the new regime to operate effectively.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, I have serious concerns that the proposed amendment could result in a body or organisation being established to pursue environmental protection objectives for a single month solely in order to meet the criteria of <i>locus standi<\/i>in judicial review proceedings.  This is a significant deviation from existing provisions, including the provisions of the planning Acts and those proposed in section 131 of this Bill.  This provision could unintentionally lead to abuses of the system and undermine the good work of existing and long-standing environmental NGOs.  There is no justification for this. <br\/><br\/>We will keep all judicial review provisions under constant review, having regard to emerging requirements, case law and other amendments elsewhere, such as in any future review of the planning Acts.  I will not, unfortunately, be accepting the amendment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#F00600","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The concerns are greatly exacerbated now.  I have huge respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and we have engaged constructively on other issues but in this regard, this feels like we have had a good-cop, bad-cop piece because we had a Committee Stage debate during which we were reassured that environment, marine planning and protection and such factors were so deeply integrated into this that we did not have to be concerned.  They were at the heart of the process and had been there in the thinking and development.  Yet here we have a clear and concerning message that the Minister of State does not think MAC is concerned with the environment.  This is just contract law, it seems then.  It is about owning and controlling consent.  It is estate management.  We talk about the State owning and controlling all the waters but the State has responsibility for all the waters.  That is another way to think about it.  The State has responsibility for our marine and its protection.  If marine and environmental protection is nowhere in this process, it is a travesty that the Government would go ahead with this process, giving grants, trades, estate managements, allowing for the occupation and effectively treating it like a bunch of property to be divided up, allowing people to occupy it and carry out different activities as if it is an asset, rather than the part of the planet and the oceans we are responsible for.  It is a worrying frame.  Many attempts in the early debates were made to tell us not to worry, these were kind of parallel and would be working together.  It is clear now.  We are told the estate management part of giving consents for things to happen - I am not saying I am talking about development but permissions for occupation - is coming ahead of marine protection and the designation of marine protection areas.<\/p> <p>People say get the legislation right so it is consistent with the law, including European law.  When people say there is a danger that this is not as consistent as it should be with European law, that is a legitimate thing to point out, much as in a judicial review.  The way to avoid judicial reviews is to get the process right in the first place, rather than by curtailing such reviews.  If we want to be honest, we need to be responsible about the fact that avoiding environmental considerations early in any process creates problems.<\/p> <p>I am also concerned that the Minister of State is creating hostages to fortune.  We look at the Energy Charter Treaty, which half of Europe actively wants to leave.  I know that treaty was there in the considerations on the climate Bill because in the Bill it was discussed why exemptions had to be given to those who had done exploration in relation to fossil fuels.  They could not be excluded from extraction because of their expectations.  The Minister of State has described here how the maritime area consent will encourage them to start preparing their planning.  Will they say that is a reasonable expectation?  Have we put in a measure to protect the State against that?  I do not want us down the line to get legal advice from the Attorney General that we cannot interfere with yet another terrible project because of legal concerns created by maritime area consent without proper environmental consideration.<\/p> <p>I fundamentally disagree with the Minister of State on this.  I agree that section 79(5) is a real problem.  It is one thing if he will not do the proper environmental considerations; it is another if we constrain those who try to do that good environmental work when the State falls short.  Unfortunately, this does both so I need to press the amendment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#G00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"vote","time":1639735200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 6; N\u00edl, 23.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Alice-Mary Higgins and Victor Boyhan; N\u00edl, Senators Lisa Chambers and Se\u00e1n Kyne.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#G00300","aye":["1634","1662","1664","1672","1684","1686"],"nay":["1629","1637","1638","1695","1639","1640","1641","1642","1644","1647","1651","1653","1654","1656","1665","1667","1670","1671","1689","1692","1693","1685","1687"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639735200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee has advised the Cathaoirleach that she has entered into a voting pairing arrangement with Senator Eileen Flynn for the duration of Senator Flynn&rsquo;s maternity leave and accordingly has not voted in this division.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 97, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:  \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t&ldquo;PART 5 <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> COSTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL MAC CASES UNDER <i>PART 4<\/i>AND IN RESPECT OF JUDICIAL REVIEW UNDER <i>PART 2<\/i>AND <i>PART 5<\/i> <\/blockquote> <p align=\"center\">CHAPTER 1<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t<i>Consultation and report on Judicial Review under Part 2, 4 and 5<\/i> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <b>110.<\/b>Within 6 months of the commencement of <i>Part 2 <\/i>and\/or <i>Part 4<\/i>, and\/or <i>Part 5,<\/i>the Minister shall&mdash;  \t(a) conduct a public consultation on the effect of this Act on the rights of the public to pursue Judicial Review under those parts, including but not limited to rights under Article 9 of the Aarhus Convention and the characteristics specified in Article 9(4) of the Convention, and the Articles 11 and 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Constitution,<br \/><br \/>(b) within 2 months of the conclusion of the consultation referred to in <i>paragraph (a)<\/i>the Minister shall prepare a report on the operation of this Act on the rights of 2 the public to pursue Judicial Review under those Part 2, 4 or 5 where any such parts have been commenced, and lay it before both Houses of the Oireachtas, and make available on a website of the Government the responses to the public consultation in <i>paragraph (a) <\/i>above, and<br \/><br \/>(c) table a debate on the report within each house of the Oireachtas within 2 months of the laying of the report before each such House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.   <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#J00100","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#J00200","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I will not speak at length to this amendment.

The amendment implies that MAC provisions do not comply with the Aarhus Convention in that they provide for no public participation when MARA grants a MAC.  I will point out that the Aarhus Convention or, more accurately, the second pillar of the Aarhus Convention, which provides for public participation, has no application to consent whereby a state is granting occupancy rights in respect of property it owns or controls.  There is, therefore, no international law or obligation in EU law to provide for public participation in respect of such a consent.  Public participation in occupancy consent applications in the maritime area is entirely at the discretion of the state and is not a requirement of the Aarhus Convention or of EU law.<\/p> <p>The focus of the Aarhus Convention is the protection of the environment and to enable citizens to participate in decision-making with regard to the environment.  The public participation, which is envisaged in the convention, is very much focused on the environment, on the public having the necessary information on the effects of the project or activity on the environment, and enabling the public to provide its views on the project and its effects before any decision on it is made.  All these matters are being provided for in the planning or development consent decisions being made by coastal planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the provisions of this Bill.  The State is fulfilling its obligations under the Aarhus Convention by providing for full public participation in planning applications and decisions in respect of planning applications in the maritime area.  It is in that process that all the environmental information relevant to the particular development will be provided and made available to ensure the appropriate public participation required by the convention.<\/p> <p>As I have explained, the focus of the MAC, however, is entirely different and is designed to address the State's estate management responsibilities.  The Office of the Attorney General has been deeply involved throughout the development of this legislation in drafting the provisions of the Bill and, therefore, I can assure Senators that I am fully satisfied that MAC procedures laid out in it are Aarhus-compliant in the context of the overall sequence of consents envisaged by the new regime.  <\/p> <p>The Aarhus Convention applies to environmental decision-making.  The MAC does not require or obtain the environmental information or environmental parameters that are necessary to enable public participation for environmental purposes.  The MAC has no effect on the development consent, does not change its basic parameters and does not determine its outcome.  The MAC is not the decision that permits the activity.  In fact, it terminates if the development consent that provides the public participation is not obtained, that is, if planning permission is refused.<\/p> <p>In considering what the MAC is and is not, it is abundantly clear that it is not appropriate or necessary to carry out a consultation, review or report on the effect of the legislation on the rights of the public to pursue judicial review.  The Bill provides that public participation is an absolute priority in plan- and policy-making and in the assessment of all development proposals.  I will take this opportunity to point out that the introduction of public participation statements contained in this Bill is a wholly new development in the planning system in Ireland and further demonstrates the commitment of the Department and the Government to the Aarhus Convention.  Making a public participation statement will be a mandatory requirement in the preparation of all maritime spatial plans and DMAPs.  The public participation statement will clearly detail the forms of participation opportunities and mechanisms in the development of plans.  For those reasons, unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#J00500","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I just cannot accept the analysis that claims that people's rights on environmental decision-making under the Aarhus Convention are constrained to areas where the State would like to use those rights.  It is very clear that environmental decision-making, not just planning, comes under Aarhus.  It does not just kick in at a certain point.

I wish to raise two issues on this section that are not strictly related to the Social Welfare Bill but have an implication on what we are talking about this morning.<\/p> <p>The first issue is regarding the gratuity payable to members of local authorities where there is an issue in terms of their pension and entitlements.  Senator Craughwell raised this issue with the Minister previously and she was very correct in her comments around the class K rate.  In fairness, one of her predecessors, Deputy Varadkar, changed that during his tenure as Minister for Social Protection.  There is, however, an issue with the gratuity being paid to some local authority members, which I know is not directly related to the Minister but it has a part to play in the whole social protection scheme in terms of what we are about.<\/p> <p>I rise primarily to speak on the issue around employment contributions and in terms of employers' responsibilities.  This morning we woke up to a myriad of news reports regarding proposals by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, that will have a direct impact on the hospitality sector.  I want to first of all say that the demonisation of NPHET by some is not correct.  It has a role to play in that its job is to advise, analyse and put forward options to the Government.  That is its job.  It is looking through the prism of a public health perspective only.  It is the job of the Government, in a broader sense, to implement Government policy.  The conundrum for the Minister and many in society is that the job of the Government is to protect business, which includes the employers we are speaking about today and the contributions they must pay and make, and also the mental health of people along with public health.<\/p> <p>The protection of public health is absolutely important.  If, however, we are to have a situation where the recommendation of NPHET is to close hospitality at 5 p.m. then I believe that is a wrong move.  I do not believe it is the correct decision to be taken now.  Recognising the importance of public health and accepting the protection of the most vulnerable is what this Bill is doing.  At its core, it protects the most vulnerable and those who are immunocompromised.  This decision will have a profound effect on the businesses of our country and on the employers and employees who work in our hospitality sector.<\/p> <p>My issue is that the closure of businesses will ensue.  As we all know, difficulties are being experienced by many people working in the hospitality sector today.  If we are to close at 5 p.m., however, that will have a gargantuan impact on the Government.  It will force the Government to continue to support and put in place a further scaffolding of supports around our hospitality and aviation sectors and our night-time economy.  What then happens when the public health advice is implemented?  The hurlers on the ditch will have their say but they will go quiet.  The responsibility will rest with all of us to ensure that we maintain the jobs in our economy and also the public health.<\/p> <p>I understand that it is not an easy situation and that it is a dilemma that must be faced in a careful way.  I am concerned that in this case, however, NPHET met on Tuesday.  On Thursday, it went to the Government and on Friday, the Government met.  We had an interregnum of two days.  I know the Minister cannot answer me today because it is not under her remit.  Can somebody explain to me, however, the difference between closing at 8 p.m., 9 p.m. or 10 p.m., as opposed to 5 p.m.?<\/p> <p>I spoke in the House on Tuesday from the position of having experience as a former schoolteacher.  I understand and recognise that many people were upset by what I said when I called for primary schools to close today for the Christmas period.  The reason I did so was very simple.  The majority of people in our primary school community are unvaccinated, wherein lies the greatest spread of the new and existing Covid variants.   I recognise the childcare issues of parents and family members.  I appreciate that most sincerely.  We are now going to face a situation, however, where the Minister will come back to us and other members of the Government with an increased budget of supports for our hospitality sector and night-time economy.<\/p> <p>In the new year, there must be a better way for NPHET to communicate with the Government.  It is not acceptable that we have leaks on a Thursday night ahead of a meeting on Friday.  It has the profound impact of creating a frenzy and scaring people.  My final comment on this section is that I do not believe it is acceptable to close at 5 p.m.  It will have a profound implication for our hospitality sector and our jobs.  At the core of what we must do is balancing those rights of protecting employment and public health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#Q00700","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>A number of Members are offering to speak on section 3.

That is what we are here to deal with today.  I am conscious of time.  I will take up the point raised by Senator Buttimer - I thank him for making it - on sitting county councillors and their contributions.  This relates to section 3.  I am not asking the Minister for a response today, but she might take it away in her bag and consider it in the new year.  There are a substantial number of councillors in her party, but the same applies to councillors of all parties.  I know the Minister treats everyone the same.  She is aware of the controversy between the K class and the S class contributions.  I know the other side of it where people from all parties and none lost their seats and when they went to the Department of Social Protection in very hard circumstances, they felt short-changed.  I will not go into the detail of it, but we need to support them.  They are public servants and they pay the contribution.  It is a tricky area.  Some say they are not employed and others say they are servants of the local authorities.  It is all a bit tricky, but, at the end of the day, they are people and they have families.  Many find themselves either single, left on their own or in whatever other circumstances, and they have worked so hard for their local communities and the State and when the turn to the State for some support it is not there.  I have experience of that, as people from all parties have spoken to me about it.  I thank Senator Buttimer for raising this important and valid issue.  It is appropriate that he raised it in connection with this section.  I urge the Minister to ask her officials to reflect on that and perhaps in the new year we might have an opportunity to discuss it.  I could raise the matter with her in a Commencement debate.  I know the Minister is supportive, but she must work within the parameters of the legislation.  Perhaps we need to do something.  I wish the Minister well and thank her staff.  She has my support for the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#Q00900","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I wish to make a point on class K contributions, but I will first make a general point.  It is unfortunate that we are taking Committee Stage and Report Stage together and on the very last sitting day of the year.  There is a lot of emergency legislation and legislation that comes through with short deadlines attached, but the Social Welfare Bill is predictable and something we can plan for.  Accordingly, I appeal to the Minister that next year we plan the Social Welfare Bill in a proper way and that Committee State and Report Stage happen while both Houses are still in session in order that there will be a genuine capacity for meaningful engagement and for amendments to be dealt with.  Sometimes there are good ideas that should be taken on board in a social welfare legislation.  It is not like the Finance Bill where we just make recommendations, there are genuine, important suggestions and it is a disservice to the legislative process to have such a fundamentally important Bill put through together on Committee Stage and Report Stage and effectively at a point where we are up against the natural guillotine of hearing if it does not pass before Christmas then payments will be affected.  I have heard that for years, but this is the most rushed I have seen it.  As a House, we must put down a marker for next year to the effect that we need to be given proper time.<\/p> <p>The Minister has spoken very well about the class K contribution issue in the past.  We had a debate on it, and I remember that she understood what is involved.  It would be good if we addressed it.  If we have not addressed it this year, let us sort it out by next year.  It is a big issue.  Regretting it will count for nothing come the next local elections when we have brilliant people from all sides and all parties who decide either not to stand or not to stand again.  We do not just have a problem getting people into local public service, but in getting them to stay.  We must address the issue.  If we had a longer debate, perhaps we could have come up with proposals and the Minister could have made proposals.  If it does not happen this year, then please let us make sure it happens next year.  There is no reason it should not.  I know the Minister understands it because she spoke very well about it.<\/p> <p>I wish to highlight an issue regarding employment contributions.  I am indicating that it is something on which we need to engage further.  I am very concerned about today's Supreme Court ruling in respect of PRSI contributions.  An undocumented person who has paid PAYE contributions and where the employer has paid PRSI is not entitled to maternity benefit.  That is the Supreme Court's decision.  I do not second-guess the courts, but, as legislators, we must look to our policy.  This is a person who was properly documented, who had a period as an undocumented person and who continued to make contributions and to work.  The person's status has been resolved, but a gap has appeared.<\/p> <p>Much as the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, has shown leadership in trying to regularise the status of a number of persons who have been undocumented in this State, sometimes through no fault of their own, I urge the Minister to similarly engage with them to ensure that people who are working and are already paying PAYE and seeking to fully contribute are allowed to do so.  It does not serve us when people fall out of the State, including the social protection and social contribution systems.  I urge the Minister to engage with the Minister for Justice to see what complementary measures might be put in place for PRSI and PAYE to allow those who have been undocumented to regularise their status.  When somebody is denied maternity benefit, it is the child who loses out.  The family loses out and is affected and that does not serve anyone.  When we finally get to the amendments, we will see that the rights of the child is an important piece as well.  I encourage the Minister to engage with her colleague on this, as she has shown incredible leadership in this area.  The Department of Social Protection has the opportunity to now put in place complementary measures to ensure the kinds of situations that were highlighted in the courts today do not leave people who are here and contributing at a distance from the state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#R00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>To follow up on what Senator Higgins said, we want good people to get into politics.  There are lots of reasons at the moment why people would not, such as social media and work-life balance.  There are a million reasons.  There are changes we can make to encourage people into politics, especially women.  Senator Higgins spoke about maternity leave, which is an obvious one.  Paternity leave is also an issue.  The Minister has done an awful lot in that regard in her time with the Department of Social Protection and that makes a big difference, but it needs to be done for councillors in particular.  Class A contributions must be addressed at some point in the lifetime of the Government and I would encourage the Minister to do that.  Most people who start in politics do so at local authority level.  That is now I started.  It is about giving people an opportunity to see that it is a good career and that they can make a good contribution to their area and community, but they need support.<\/p> <p>When it comes to support, decisions will need to be taken today that the Department must step up and support.  The Minister has done this throughout the pandemic and I ask that she would do it straight away if the decisions we hear about in the media are going to be introduced.  The situation is very distressing.  I have been in contact today with restaurant owners, hoteliers and owners of pubs in Tipperary.  They are worried that they will have to let their staff go two weeks before Christmas, and they will need support from the Department.  The employers do not want to do it.  There must be a happy medium between what NPHET advises and that the Cabinet decides and support must be provided to the sectors affected.  There is talk of closing at 5 p.m. or 7 p.m.  The Minister for Finance must put together a package to support them straight away.  We cannot just make these announcements and not provide support.  There must be an understanding that if what we read this morning is going to happen, we must make sure the sector is supported.  The past 18 months have been an absolute disaster.  The feeling on the ground for the past two weeks is that things were going to be okay and that people must hold their nerve.  It is devastating for people in Tipperary.

We have a great culture and attract so many tourists because we have a great night-time culture but if all these pubs and restaurants are hammered so much, they will not open up again and we will have nothing left.  There is significant responsibility on all of us as individuals, and I have always been a huge supporter of antigen testing, to be responsible and use an antigen test before we go out.  We must trust people to be responsible because the majority of us are responsible.  I do not agree with the 5 p.m. cut off or with closing schools.  Whatever we do, we should keep schools open.  It is the most important thing to do because it affects children.  Could the Minister look at the 5 p.m. cut off and provide a significant support package for the hospitality sector?

Restaurants do their main business between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m or 9 p.m.  If they were to close at 5 p.m., they may as well not open.  There are so many jobs dependent on this.  If this 5 p.m. curfew comes into force, a lot of those businesses will never open again.  While I appreciate the supports that have been put in place by the Government, it is a very serious issue.  My phone has been going since 11 p.m. last night when this announcement first appeared and all day today.  We need to look at this.  If the 5 p.m. cut off-point comes in, we will drive people to off-licences and into house parties whereas a pub or restaurant is a regulated and safer environment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#S00200","speaker":"1695"},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>This is more a point of order.

We are also discussing what was announced yesterday regarding the potential closing time of  5 p.m. for the hospitality sector.  I want it make it quite clear.  Closure at 5 p.m. is closure of the hospitality sector by stealth.  Asking the hospitality sector to survive after closure at 5 p.m. is unrealistic.<\/p> <p>The closure of the EWSS to seasonal hotels, which will be unable to re-apply in January, February and March, is unfair.  Should there not be equality of treatment within the hospitality industry?  A seasonal hotel that shuts down in October, November or December must come off the EWSS.  If it tries to re-open in February, March or April, it cannot qualify for the EWSS because it is not open to new applicants.  Perhaps it is an anomaly in the system and perhaps something can be done for seasonal hotels, which I believe make up 18% of the hotel sector and 11,000 jobs.  Those 11,000 jobs are viable to all of us.

I am happy to engage with the Seanad on it because none of us know where we will find ourselves and what difficulties life will present for people.

The Minister shall, within nine months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay a report before both Houses of <blockquote> \tthe Oireachtas on the potential extension of entitlement for the full duration of Parent&rsquo;s Benefit for one-parent families, to include a consideration of the public duty on equality and human rights and the rights of the child.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>The Minister gave some signal that she is ready to engage on this area in the debate in the D&aacute;il.  I add myself to those who hope for such engagement.  The Minister has indicated that she intends to engage with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman.  This is around the situation we have concerning full parental benefit for one-parent families. <\/p><p>With regard to that engagement the Minister has committed to, I will highlight two matters of importance.  There is the decision on the rights of the child which by referendum the people chose to put into the Constitution quite recently.  It is important and should be imperative in ensuring every child is entitled to the same sort and period of care during early development, regardless of whether it is by one or two parents.  There is also the obligation on the Minister's Department and all Departments in terms of the public duty on equality and human rights.  One of the grounds on equality is family status.  Will the Minister ensure family status is one of the grounds in terms of our equality legislation as well as being that public duty to actively promote equality and human rights?  I want to signal those as matters to be incorporated in the discussion and engagement around the issue of parent's benefit.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 9 relates to income disregard.  The income disregard for lone parents was cut many years ago, before the Minister's time.  It was a poor decision and made it harder for lone parents to access work.  It has been incrementally restored.  We hear it has been raised but it has not; it has just been incrementally restored towards where it was initially.  We are only looking towards restoring it to where it was, when we should be having a conversation about increasing the income disregard.  The income disregard for those on carer's allowance is much higher than that for those parenting alone.  The problem is, because it was on a slow climb back to where it was, we have not had the conversation on how the disregard matches on to the research the Minister's Department has used in other areas, such as the qualified child payments.  It is rightly used in recognising the kinds of costs the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice has identified in terms of minimum essential standards of living.<\/p><p>I want to signal it because I am hearing it is being increased but it is just being restored.  I would like that to be examined with the tools the Minister has in the Department, such as the minimum essential standards of living, looked at with regard to how it pans out compared with other payments and that consideration be given to not just restoring but increasing the income disregard for those parenting alone in the next budget if not this one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#T01000","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I echo the comments made by Senator Higgins in the first section around the rushed nature of this.

We probably would not have submitted these amendments if we had the benefit of seeing the D&aacute;il stage completed.

As we all know, it is not good practice to put the carrying out of reports into primary legislation   We all give out about clunky legislation.  I thank the Senators for withdrawing the amendment because we can carry out reports without putting them in primary legislation where they will sit forever.  When I give the Senators my word that I will carry out a report, I will do it and they can hold me to account in this House if I do not.<\/p> <p>On the amendment on parent's benefit and lone parents, this has been brought to my attention by representative groups for lone parents, such as One Family.  The position is that while my Department makes the payments for parent's benefit, it is the Department of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, which has the policy and legislative responsibility.  I will raise this matter with the aforementioned Minister.  As I understand it,  parent's leave is not transferable between parents under the EU work-life balance directive but I will raise it with the Minister.  The idea of it is to encourage men to take their parent's leave and share the childcare responsibilities with the mother.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins mentioned the earnings limit or disregard.  Last year, I provided for the earnings limit of &euro;425 per week to be removed from the one-parent family payment.  This means recipients of the payment no longer experience a cliff-edge when their employment income exceeds that amount.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Heather Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2308\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Instead, single parents can retain their payment and it is reduced gradually as their earnings increase.  In addition, the income limit for the working family payment has been increased in recent budgets.  In particular, this Bill provides for an increase of &euro;10 per week in the income limit for families of all sizes.  Approximately 50% of those who receive the working family payment are lone parents.  As a result of the budget changes provided for in this Bill, there will be a &euro;5 increase in working age weekly payments, including the one-parent family payment, from January 2022.  The new personal weekly rate of payment will be &euro;208.  The Bill also provides that the qualified child payment will be increased by &euro;3 to &euro;48 per week for children aged 12 and over, and by &euro;2 to &euro;40 for children up to age 12.  This measure will also benefit recipients of the one-parent family payment.  We fund the Vincentian Partnership to compile and provide us with the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, report.  We take it on board when we are forming the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#T01200","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the response.

Does the income disregard policy that the Minister mentioned apply to the jobseeker's transitional payment too, when people are on the one-parent family payment and move to the transitional payment after the child hits a certain age?

If we see an issue that we, in good faith, really believe is important then we want to flag it so as to ensure an issue gets addressed.  For the people whom we represent, and if we want to be able to say to the public that this is going to be looked at, then a report is how we guarantee it.  Of course, wherever possible it is much better if somebody agrees to do a report or take the engagement.  This provision is important if we had a Minister who said that he or she was not going to engage with a matter.  This provision would ensure that at least we would have signalled that a matter needed to be considered by the Department.  So reports perform important functions and there are occasions when they are successful.  For example, I sought a report on open adoption and after a report was produced there was a change of policy in the Department.<\/p><p>I wish to raise a fundamental issue that I am extremely passionate about.  Before I entered these Houses I worked for many years with an organisation called Older and Bolder, which is an alliance of all of the organisations dealing with older people in Ireland.  I worked with the National Women's Council of Ireland on economic justice for women and economic equality.  I have met older women up and down the country who still feel the impacts of the marriage bar, pension injustice and pension inequality.  I wish to note that the gender pensions gap is wider than the gender pay gap.<\/p><p>I felt disappointed after I read the report produced by the Commission on Pensions.  The approach by the commission was constrained in terms of what was put forward on a total contributory approach.  The commission brought some organisations in but specified it was only for the care component and not for the wider issue of gender equality, even though there is huge expertise.  I can say that there is huge expertise available as I have worked with the National Women's Council of Ireland.  The council has done incredible work and put forward proposals on a universal pension, and how to fix all parts and each pillar of the pensions system to address gender equality, and ensure that more is done for gender equality.  In recent years the goalposts have shifted where women have continually paid the price.<\/p><p>In terms of the 2012 changes, we were told that the pension did not get cut during the period of austerity but the requirement for contributions increased.  Only a third of the people who get the full contributory pension are women, so women are much more likely to be on reduced rates.  I first realised this happened when I met women who live on &euro;100 or less a week as they are on a reduced rate.  When contributory requirements increased from ten to 20 years people found themselves on the lower tiers of a reduced rate pension.  Rates were cut.  The top rate stayed the same but people not on the top rate found themselves two or three rungs down the ladder.  That is what happened in 2012 and it is important that people know the context.  The situation led to great concern and then we were told that a total contributions approach would be brought in.  In fairness to the then Minister for Social Protection and now Senator, Regina Doherty, and I do not know how the Department have translated it, but she personally did have an understanding that this was important.<\/p><p>The goalposts moved when the new bridging piece on the total contributions approach was brought in.  I mean we were told that the Department would give people more years in recognition of the contribution to care but the threshold has been increased from 20 years to 30 years worth of contributions.  When that was introduced the threshold figure jumped again.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection in the last Oireachtas produced a strong report.  I know because I was a member of that committee.  The report recommended that the contributory requirement should not go above 30 years.  We said that the jump to 20 years had already had such an impact that a jump to 30 years needed to be done gradually and should not go further.  What actually happened?  The Department moved it to 40 years.  The Department said it would recognise more years of care but people are still only at the halfway point.  In addition, because of contributions that are made while people receive a welfare payment, and payments that are made in terms of care, people are capped at 20 years in total at the moment.  So women who find themselves in a certain position are only at the halfway point.  Again, women suffered as a result of the jump from 20 years to 30 years.  What was meant to be an issue that would repair and address this matter instead acted as a means to push the goalposts out.  So the woman who did not have enough contributions still did not have enough contributions that were going to be recognised.<\/p><p>The report produced by the commission talks about a 40-year requirement.  How many Senators know people who will have made 40 years of contributions or even a solid 20 years of employment contributions that they can rely on in that period?  We know many  people start their working lives late.  We are effectively mandating that people will have to work for years longer to get enough contributions and that is why this report is really important.  <\/p><p>I ask the Minister to do five things.  One, analyse the previous changes.  I want an analysis done on the comparative impact, from the perspective of gender equality, if we brought in the total contributory approach at a 30-year contributory requirement and a 40-year contributory requirement.  Let us have a breakdown of the figures for men and women in Ireland as such information would be useful to us all and allow for better decision-making.<\/p><p>I want an estimate of the proportion of persons of each gender who will likely find themselves on a reduced rate pension if we opt for a 30-year contributory requirement and a 40-year contributory requirement.  I want a comparison done on the likely cost of a contributory pension that is based on a 30-year contributory requirement and a 40-year contributory requirement.  Let us see the difference.  We know that 40 years of contributions will cost more but that amount might be worth it for the difference if the 30-year option gives us more on gender equality and ensures more people will be on a full pension, in terms of the social benefits.<\/p><p>I want another comparison done on that approach and a universal pension, to see if it proved much less complicated but much more equal, for all of those in Ireland above a certain age.  A universal pension is a system that has been used effectively in other countries.  The National Women's Council of Ireland and very many civil society organisations have called for the introduction of a universal pension for years.  A universal pension would address all of the inequities.  It would address legacy issues like the marriage bar and it would address the issue for women who were born before 1946 who never had access to the homemaker's credit scheme.  There is a particular bad situation for women who were born before 1946 and they are in their 70s now.  They are exactly the women who were affected by the marriage bar when they were in their 20s and 30s.  These women have an anomaly at the moment because they are not recognised for lots of forms of care credit.  The Minister could address all of the anomalies and get a clear point of equality if we had a universal pension system but first let us see how much this costs because it might just be worthwhile.<\/p><p>I know that I cannot get the Minister to address Revenue in terms of her Department.  It is regrettable that the Commission on Pensions spoke about pension sustainability and so forth solely for the State pension but did not allow the witnesses who approached it to address the huge elephant in the room, which is the private pension tax relief.<\/p><p>In terms of the private pension tax relief, it is conducted in a very unequal way at the marginal rate.  I have the figures for 2014, and I do not have more recent figures.  From the 2014 figures we know that about 70% of the benefit went to the top 10% of earners, and 50% of the benefit went to the top 5% of earners.  Plus the majority of the people who benefit from a private pension tax relief at the marginal rate, which literally means that the people who earn more get a larger percentage back from the State, get a lot more from this scheme than those who are on lower incomes.  There is also the cost of the system.  More men avail of the scheme, which contributes to gender inequality.  There are more higher earners in the scheme.  It is worth mentioning that this scheme was one of the very few points mentioned in the memorandum of understanding that we had with the troika.  Even the troika said that we should standardise the scheme and make it 30% for everybody rather than 20% and 40% plus a source of inequality.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is something the troika asked the State to do and we did not do it.

This is a fundamental point.<\/p><p>The Minister will be glad to hear that will be the longest speech I will give today.  The point is really important.  This is one of the matters that brought me into politics and I care about it immensely.  There are great ideas out there and I know Senator Ardagh, for example, spoke about it in the previous committee as well.

To be quite honest, at this stage we have reports coming out of ears that relate to pensions and I want to see action.  It is what we need.<\/p><p>The Government is considering the report of the Commission on Pensions and we must consider this in the round.  The Government will bring forward proposals at the end of the first quarter of next year.  That is the plan.  The Oireachtas joint committee is currently hearing submissions on the report of the Commission on Pensions.  I compliment the commission on the amount of time and effort it has put into this.  There are many hours of consideration and work in it.  It did a public consultation included in that work.  Many of the matters raised by the Senator have been considered.  As I said, this is a very comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force, expenditure projections, an examination of international approaches and responses to an extensive consultation process.  The commission's technical sub-committee's working papers detail an extensive public consultation process and the submissions made to the commission are available on the website at <i>www.pensionscommission.gov.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>All of the proposals in the report were gender, equality and poverty-proofed.  I take the Senator's point about women, who have lost out in the past in this country.  There was a time when women got married, they had to stop working.  There are many women out there who were part of a business and were self-employed who got to retirement with nothing there for them except what their husbands or partners managed to accrue in PRSI contributions.  We will be looking at this through the work of the Commission on Pensions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#W00200","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I appreciate that and I have read the report.

The very large figure of &euro;2.9 billion is not financially justifiable in the other part of our Exchequer's expenditure and was not examined in that regard.<\/p> <p>A 40-year contributory requirement will have more of an impact on women, although it will affect everybody.  I am really concerned about us moving to that.  The leap from ten years to 20 years was quite hard and had major ripple effects across society.  We all know people who came to us about that.  Going from 20 years to 40 years will be pretty devastating and we will feel the effects.  If the Minister is moving forward with this I urge her to consider the 30 years option.<\/p> <p>I will press the amendment, although I will not force a vote.  It is too important to not press the amendment.  I know good work was done in the Commission on Pensions and I have looked at the report.

It has now been published and given there was such a long period of waiting for the report, we had given a collective statement in June.

To be fair, we do not always need reports to do good work.  I will tell the House about the relevant matters that are in the current budget.

Weekly income disregard for carer's allowance will increase to &euro;350 per week for a single carer and &euro;750 for a carer with a spouse or partner.  The domiciliary care allowance will continue to be paid for children who go into hospital for up to six months.  The current limit is three months.  That is a way to support parents at a very difficult time when their children are in hospital.<\/p><p>The wage subsidy paid to employers who employ people with a disability will increase from &euro;5.30 to &euro;6.30 an hour, which will bring it in line with the minimum wage.  A change in the means band will benefit people receiving disability allowance at a reduced rate.  The EmployAbility service, the employment and recruitment services for people with disabilities, will now provide grants directly to those who qualify.  There has been a focus on people with disabilities in the budget.  I will continue that focus.  We cannot do everything in one budget but we will continue to try to increase the supports that are available to people.<\/p><p>It took a while to compile the report because there was an enormous body of work involved.  The survey involved 4,000 people.  That is a big survey by any standards.  The report stated that people have different levels of disability.  I want to ensure that those who are most severely impacted get the most support.  I think we would all agree on that.<\/p><p>The report has gone to the national disability inclusion strategy steering group.  I have already addressed the steering group, which is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  I met the steering group this week, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman.  The steering group will consider the report.  I also committed in the D&aacute;il to examining the blind pension and the disability allowance.  The question is whether we need two payments or should we be making one payment because people have different circumstances.  The steering group will also look at that issue.  The Senator can see that consideration will be given to this report and to some of its findings in the next budget.

In 2016 and 2017, I specifically implored the Department to pause some of its practices relating to the public services card and the single customer view data set because of their incompatibility with the general data protection regulation.  That has been vindicated and the Department has withdrawn its appeal against the report from the Data Protection Commission.<\/p> <p>We know from the findings of the Data Protection Commission that there are certain legitimate uses of data within the Department.  This is a core area that is dealt with in large sections of the Social Welfare Bill.  Four or five findings of the Data Protection Commission now need to be acted upon.  The report now stands and its findings are now binding and need to be acted upon.  Much of the focus has, rightly, been on the second finding in the report, which it makes it clear that it is not appropriate to process personal data in respect of a person engaging with a specified body.  That has no legal basis, despite our being assured there was a legal basis.  There is a long list of specified bodies in the Social Welfare Act.  It is in the legislation we are discussing.  The aspect associated with driver's licences got a lot of attention.  A large number of specified bodied had been hoping to use the card.  It is clear now that there is not a legal basis for that.  I commend the former Minister, Shane Ross, who was one of the only Ministers who, when myself and others raised legal concerns, took our legal advice in his response to that matter.  He was right to do so.<\/p> <p>The decisions relating to specified bodies stand.  That is important, and has important implications.  However, there are also findings that need to be addressed by the Department.  It was found that insufficient information was given to many data subjects as to what was involved and how their personal data would be processed.  It was also found that there were contraventions of Acts, including a contravention of section 2D(2)(d) of the relevant Act in light of a failure to provide data subjects with sufficient information concerning the relevant potential consequences for cardholders who fail to update their information.<\/p> <p>Crucially, the third finding deals with the blanket, indefinite retention of personal data consisting of documents and information other than an applicant's photograph and signature which were originally collected for the purposes of identity authentication.  People provided the Department with documents and were told they needed to do so for the purposes of verifying their identity.  The signatures and photographs have been stored, and I will come to them in a moment.  The Department has retained original documents and letters that were given to it by people seeking to prove their identity, those documents having performed the only purpose which is legitimate under the legislation.  Those documents performed the purpose of verifying those people's identity.  It has been verified.  The Data Protection Commission, in the third finding in its report, makes it clear that the Department should not be retaining information or documents that were provided by people for the purpose of verifying their identity after that purpose has been conducted, which it has been at the point the people concerned are given their public services cards.  The information should be retained after that point.  This is important.  These are the findings of the Data Protection Commission.  There are obligations on the Department under section 2(1)(c)(iv) of the relevant Act.<\/p> <p>The amendment relating to the public services card has been ruled out of order, even though the exact same topic has been discussed in at least three social protection debates in the past.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those are actions that need to happen now and need to be followed up.  These are findings that need to be addressed.  They are no longer challenged.  This report is effectively standing now as an imperative.  I hope the State, the Minister and her Department will take action on those findings and take action to resolve the issues that have been signalled and addressed in that regard.  That is very important.<\/p><p>I want to compliment the very few people who did very good work and were very much framed as being quite outside the margins in having highlighted concerns in regard to these matters, including some very good legal experts and human rights and civil society advocates, and some individuals who were simply concerned about data protection rights and who raised those issues.<\/p><p>There are two or three other reviews under way at the moment by the Data Protection Commissioner.  One that is very important relates to the treatment of biometric information, which can include photographs.  I encourage the Department, and Deputy Humphreys, as a new Minister in this role, not to take the combative approach that the Department has taken in the past against this report, which dragged on for years.  We saw that the cost, or the expenditure, went up by &euro;30 million for these cards.  Millions of euro were spent for long after the alarm bells started ringing.  The cost of the PSC has ended up being huge.  It jumped from &euro;60 million to &euro;90 million, or perhaps it was &euro;30 million to &euro;60 million, but it was a lot.  The Department and the Minister should engage constructively on biometrics, particularly the fact that photographs, as biometric data, need to be treated separately as a special category of personal data and need to be stored separately and differently.<\/p><p>One of the other concerns identified in the report, which sends signals, was the concern regarding insufficient security, or perhaps less than ideal security and controls in how that single customer view dataset is accessed and used.  We do not want to create a honeypot for hacking, which the Department of Health has experienced.  Let us make sure the Department of Social Protection does not end up being a repository of an excessive volume of information, some of which is not rightfully being held, on millions of people.  It is very important we get this right.<\/p><p>Ireland is one of the key data regulators for Europe.  We are at risk of losing that role if it looks like we, as a State, want to evade those responsibilities.  We need to step up and show leadership, and try to push ourselves, as a State, to best practice so we can then be credible in holding the private sector and the many corporations in this area to the highest standards as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#X00900","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>The public services card predates my time in the Department.  I welcome the fact this case has been settled.  It is a good outcome for everybody.  In fairness, that has been acknowledged by both the Department and the Data Protection Commissioner in recent days.  My priority and, ultimately, the priority of the Government is to ensure that people can access services in an efficient way.  The settlement means that the Department can still process and issue PSCs for people to use.  It means that more than 3.5 million people who have a card can continue to use it for transacting with Departments and public bodies.  This has been vital during Covid and the fact people had the card meant they were able to go online and avail of services.<\/p><p>It is important to point out that people can still use their card to avail not only of social welfare services, but also <i>myGov.ie<\/i>and the many online services available throughout the public service.  To give some context,<i>myGov.ie <\/i>has been used 21 million times this year by people accessing online public services.  That is the single most important issue here, namely, ensuring there will be no impact for those customers so they can access those services in the exactly the same way they did last week.  For anybody who does not want to use a PSC, there must be an alternative option.  That is in place because Government policy is that there should always be an offline option for people who do not want or who are unable to go online.  Any actions that are required by my Department or other bodies will be acted upon.<\/p><p>With regard to bogus self-employment, it is important to note that self-employment is a perfectly legitimate and vital feature of the economy, with more than 330,000 people employed in this way.  It is also the case there is no compelling evidence that false self-employment is as widespread as some suggest.  That said, false self-employment exists and, as such, is a matter that I and the Department take very seriously.  I do not want to see a situation where any workers are denied their social insurance entitlements or where much-needed funds are denied to the depleted Social Insurance Fund.  The deliberate misclassification of a worker as a self-employed contractor for PRSI purposes is wrong.  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act contains a specific offence relating to the return of employment contributions which, on conviction, can result in fines and-or imprisonment.<\/p><p>Ultimately, there is no silver-bullet solution that will completely eradicate false self-employment.  The best way is to tackle it through inspection, compliance and deterrence.  The Department has significantly increased its employer inspections in recent years through its network of 380 social welfare inspectors nationwide.  It also established the employment status inspection unit in mid-2019 comprising six inspectors focused solely on detecting false self-employment.  This unit has carried out hundreds of employment and status investigations in a wide range of sectors, including construction, meat processing, language training and the media.<\/p><p>False self-employment does not always involve a deliberate or fraudulent misclassification of an employee.  Sometimes, it happens that both the employer and employee are genuinely mistaken in their approach and are happy to correct the position once departmental officials have made a determination.  Therefore, it is vital that employers and workers have clear information and guidance when considering employment status.  That is why I put great value on the code of practice on determining employment status.  We have recently updated the code to reflect the modern world of work and to reflect the legislation and case law that has emerged from various court cases over the years.<\/p><p>If Members are aware of bogus self-employment, they should bring it to the attention of my officials and they will check it out and investigate it.  If it is fraud, it is wrong.  It should not be happening and it is not right that people are put into a position where they are forced to be self-employed and not employees.  If people know of any of those situations, let me know about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121700002#Y00200","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1639735200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>While people can use the card, as the Minister acknowledged, it is important that they are not required to.  It is also important that the alternative should not be unduly onerous or punitive.  People should not feel disadvantaged and feel they are being given a particularly difficult route if they choose not to opt for that route.  That is also very clear in the ruling from the Data Protection Commissioner.  It is an issue that it will be important to follow through on in order to have that understanding among all specified bodies because some of them seem to be saying, &ldquo;If you are going to be difficult, we will be difficult&rdquo;.  That is not an adequate approach and, in fact, it is in breach of the law.  I want to be very clear on that.  People need to be given equal, fair and similar alternatives to using such a card.  I am glad the Minister will follow up on the other findings in regard to, for example, the retention of information and of documentation, which is one I am sure we will follow up on.<\/p> <p>I thank her for her comments on bogus self-employment.  In a way, I like to use the word &ldquo;false&rdquo;, or perhaps &ldquo;forced&rdquo; in some cases, self-employment.  However, there might still be a consideration that should be given by the Department to those who were affected in the past, when perhaps the Department was not as well resourced and the decisions were made in a different way.  Some persons who used their appeal were unsatisfied that their appeal was really considered on the basis of their case.  I would consider reopening the option of an appeal to the determination of status for those who were in sectors in which it was shown that false and forced self-employment was widespread.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That would be useful, both for those persons in terms of their rights, because it might not affect them in terms of the employment payment but it might affect them in terms of the pension, and for those depleted public coffers, as the Minister mentioned.
