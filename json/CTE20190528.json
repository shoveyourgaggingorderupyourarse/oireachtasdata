I wish to convey the apologies of our director, Professor Gerry Boyle.  He is unable to attend as he has a meeting outside of the country and is at the airport as we speak.<\/p> <p>  I will go through my presentation reasonably fast because there is a lot of information that people can have for reference or whatever and afterwards we will have plenty of time for discussion.  I will spend a minute or two describing the structure of the beef industry and the challenges facing same.  I will focus a lot on the role of technical performance in terms of the profitability of the sector.  I will also focus a little on our research and advisory priorities and some of our initiatives that are ongoing or recently started.  I will finish by outlining the factors within our remit that impact on the net margin for beef farms.  <\/p> <p>  I will outline the structure of the industry but I will not go into too much detail.  I am sure members are familiar with the fact that we have an awful lot of beef farms in this country.  The Central Statistics Office farm structure survey shows that in 2016 over half the farms in the country were designated as specialist beef production farms but a good share of the other farms also had beef cattle.  Beef production is the biggest sector of Irish agriculture in terms of the number of farms.  One can see from the pie chart displayed on the screen that over 50% of farms are specialist beef producers.  On the next page there is a chart that displays the size of farms starting with, on the left hand side, farms of less then 10 ha and gradually increasing until one sees on the extreme right hand side the number of farms greater than 100 ha.  In general, the distribution is towards the left of the graph so the sector is characterised by relatively small farms that are, on average, 32.4 ha.  Nevertheless, the share of agriculture output that comes from the beef sector is very large as displayed in the middle section of the graph on the next page.  One can see that over the years it has maintained around one third of the agricultural output of the overall sector and, therefore, beef production is a very important contributor to agricultural output from our farms.<\/p> <p>  The Irish beef sector faces many challenges and I have listed some that can be viewed on the screen.  They include Brexit, which is at the top of the list; climate change, which is very much on everybody's radar these days; and the EU trade deals, which are very important to the sector and could have an impact on the market.  Obviously we are coming into the negotiation stage for the next phase of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  The outcome is uncertain and potential changes to the distribution of direct income supports is again, potentially, a challenge for certain elements of the sector.  The price of cattle is a very important factor for the sector and profitability.  In particular, fluctuations in beef cattle prices can cause big fluctuations in income levels for farmers.  Like all farmers, beef farmers must cope with severe weather events and their effect on production systems and input costs, which we saw last year with feed costs.  Despite all of those challenges the beef sector has a lot going for it.  One of the strong points of the sector is its environmental credentials.  Irish beef is generally produced in situations of low intensity in comparison with many of the other beef production systems used around the world and these are generally very environmentally friendly.  Our beef farmers also have very high participation rates in the agri-environment schemes under Pillar 2.  When one compares the sustainability metrics such as the carbon footprint or the water sustainability system they compare very favourably with the systems used in other countries in terms of being environmentally friendly, which is very important in today's world.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider how the sector is evolving in terms of numbers.  A lot of change is happening in the Irish cattle herd at the moment.  The next graph shows the change in the number of beef and dairy cows dating as far back as 1980.  Pre-quotas we had 400,000 suckler cows and 1.4 million dairy cows but since quotas were introduced we have had a gradual decline over the following 25 years or so in the number of dairy cows.  In the late noughties and at the end of that decade the number of dairy cows decreased to around 1 million but at the same time the number of suckler cows increased to over 1 million.  Since the abolition of milk quotas, and even before that as farmers were preparing for it, the number of dairy cows started to increase and has moved towards 1.4 million dairy cows.  Over the past six or seven years suckler cow numbers have been trending downwards but not at a very rapid rate.<\/p><p>It is not happening at a rapid rate but there has been a reduction of a couple of percentage points every year in the size of the suckler herd, which is now down to slightly fewer than 1 million cows.  One of the consequences of this is that an increasing proportion of beef output will come from dairy beef, that is, beef from calves born to dairy herds.  The numbers of animals coming through the system may be largely the same, but the proportion coming from the dairy side is increasing.  That has been a concern to many people, the worry being that it will lead to a deterioration in carcase quality.  It is not just the change in the proportion of dairy beef versus suckler beef that is at play here, but the data also show that the dairy beef carcasses are deteriorating in quality over time.  In the table entitled \"Deteriorating Carcase Quality in Dairy Beef\", the first block of figures relates to the typical beef calf coming out of the dairy herd, which is from an Aberdeen Angus sire and a Friesian dam.  The highlighted column shows that, in 2014, almost 12% of those calves were graded O minus or worse, with that proportion rising to 21% in 2018.  There are two factors at work here, namely, a decline in the quality of dairy beef and an increase in the volume of dairy beef.  It is the same if we look at Friesian sires by Friesian dams and so on up the line; the quality of those calves is also deteriorating, albeit at a slower rate.<\/p><p> This is a significant issue at industry level, to which there have been several responses.  One such response is the dairy calf to beef index, which was developed by Teagasc and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, to help farmers to select sires for dairy cows to breed beef cattle that will be low in calving difficulty, of short gestation and have improved beef characteristics.  That index is available to dairy farmers for the current breeding season.  Another way the industry has responded is through various players assisting us in setting up a number of research and demonstration farm programmes highlighting the important parameters for dairy beef production.  Rearing good dairy beef is not just about genetics but also management.  There is a lot to be learned and to teach about how to run a dairy calf to beef system well.<\/p><p> Another significant issue for the industry is the export of live calves, of which there has been a substantial increase in recent years.  In the year to date, more than 140,000 calves were exported, a 55% increase on the 2017 figure.  All those calves are from the dairy industry and it is an important outlet for some of the lower genetic merit calves coming from that sector.  The bulk of the calves exported are male progeny of dairy sire.  They are Friesian on Friesian, Jersey on Jersey or Friesian on Jersey, that is, a dairy sire on a dairy cow.  We do not have a veal industry in Ireland, which is where most of those calves on the Continent are going, so exportation provides an outlet.<\/p><p> An important issue for the dairy calf export industry is animal welfare standards.  Members may be aware of a video that was doing the rounds some weeks ago showing calves being mistreated in France.  That type of practice is abhorrent to us and unacceptable to those operating in the sector.  For the industry to continue to exist, it will have to eliminate any such instances.<\/p><p> The final issue I will deal with is incomes.  The data set out in the table on family farm income, which is from the Teagasc national farm survey, include the direct payments farmers receives.  The first block of bars in the table gives the data for the dairy industry from 2011 up to 2017.  The second block represents the data for cattle-rearing farms, which tend to be suckler farms.  The \"Cattle other\" group comprises a mixture of finishers, calf to beef and so on.  The table also includes data for sheep farmers and tillage farmers.  These data illustrate the main difficulty facing the beef industry, which is the low income it generates for farmers.  That income is hovering at &euro;10,000 per farm, in comparison with dairy farms, where incomes are varying anywhere from &euro;50,000 to more than &euro;80,000.  Of all the challenges facing the sector, this issue of low incomes has consistently been the greatest.  Family farm income is what is left over after moneys are paid out to remunerate family labour and give a return on owned land and capital.  It is important to note that the beef sector is by far the most diverse of farming sectors, more so than dairy, sheep or tillage.  There is a significant diversity in the types of systems farmers operate, a large number of part-time farmers, a broad range in terms of the skills and age profile of farmers and, probably, their motivation.  For example, some people have inherited land and do not want to sell it out of the family but have another job.  For them, it is important to maintain the land and keep farming it, but profit might not be their ultimate motivation.  Of course, everybody wants to make as much money as they can, but other factors come into play in some instances.<\/p><p> We are looking at a stark picture for the beef sector in regard to profitability and income.  However, our view is that there are opportunities for committed beef producers.  They may comprise a relatively small proportion of the overall number but there are farmers making a net profit per hectare, which excludes direct payments.  There is the possibility, therefore, to run a business profitably, and it is Teagasc's view that there is potential for many beef farmers to improve profitability.  One of the features of the profitable farms is that they are adaptive and responsive to new technologies, research findings and the messages coming from advisory programmes.  The table on page 16 shows net margins, which do not include direct payments.  We see that the top 20% of farmers, who are the specialist cattle-rearing farmers, consistently achieve a positive net margin.  It is not a big net margin but it is positive.  Looking at the next couple of rows down, there is potential for those farms, through efficiency and technology, to improve their net margin.<\/p><p> This is what keeps us committed to the sector, namely, our belief that improving technical performance and stocking rate will improve profitability on farms.  The table on page 22 shows the performance of a typical suckler cow that one finds on the national average farm and compares it with the metrics for high-performance farms, which are the top 15% or 20%, that are within the control of the farmer.  The number of calves weaned per cow per year on average is 85 per 100 or 0.85.  The best performers, however, are achieving a rate of 0.95, which is worth an additional &euro;87 per cow.  Age at first calving is 32 months on average, with the better performing farmers calving down heifers at 24 months, which gives a saving of &euro;50 per cow.<\/p><p>The six-week calving rate is 55% on average.  If a farmer can bring that to 80%, there is a saving of &euro;28 and so on.  Regarding the average daily gain of calves, there is a difference of &euro;86 between the average and the better-performing farms.  Regarding concentrates fed to the cow-calf unit, there is a difference of &euro;52.  Therefore, if a farmer is able to move himself or herself from the average up to that better farm cohort, there is an extra margin of &euro;300 to be made per cow.<br\/><br\/>One might say this is all very well but very theoretical and ask whether farmers are actually doing this.  The next two charts I will show illustrate this happening in practice.  I refer to one of the programmes members may have heard of, namely, the Teagasc-<i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>BETTER beef programme, whereby we work with something in the order of 25 to 35 beef farmers, depending on the time.  They are usually in the programme for three to four years.  We work intensively with them on a programme of improving their technical performance, financial management and so on.  We then follow through on the impact of the changes they make to their output and, more importantly, their profitability.  The graph on page 23 of our submission shows the cohort of farmers we took into phase 2 of the programme.  They started on the programme in 2011 with an average growth margin per hectare of about &euro;550 and, as members can see, an output per hectare of 600 kg of beef.  Over the course of the programme they increased this output, through increased stocking rates and better performance, to over 800 kg per hectare.  Members will see here that the gross margin on these farms had increased to over &euro;1,000 per hectare.  This was not through getting bigger or anything but simply through applying best technology on those farms.  They are real farms, farmers' farms, not our farms.  We just worked with the farmers.  They were mainly suckler beef farmers.<br\/><br\/>We have another programme called green acres, which concentrates on dairy calf to beef.  It follows the same principle: these are farmers' farms and we give the farmers intensive advisory support.  I will not go down through all the details of page 24, but members can see that the gross margin on these farms at the start of the programme was &euro;513 and that at the end of it, three years later, the margin was over &euro;1,000.  Members can see the net margin improve again by about &euro;500 per hectare.  There may have been price movements between these years.  This is not corrected for changes in beef prices, and there would have been some element of that, but the vast majority of improvements in both these areas were due to better technical performance.  We see this as an area where we can contribute positively to the beef sector by helping farmers to improve their productivity and to try to make a few steps along that ladder of improving their margins.  There is nothing secret or magic about the areas on which we concentrate: genetic merit of the animals, reproductive efficiencies, grassland management, which is hugely important, animal health, financial performance and environmental sustainability.  I will not go through all the slides in our presentation, but these are just some of the beef sector initiatives we have ongoing or have started recently.  They are detailed in the slides we distributed to members.  If they wish to ask us anything about the initiatives, we will be very happy to discuss them.  This is just to illustrate that a lot of research and advisory activity is ongoing in support of the beef sector.<br\/><br\/>I will finish with the slide on page 29, which is for us where it is at.  How can farmers do things inside their own farm gates to maximise their net margins?  Margin is maximised where there is a focus on optimising performance per livestock unit farmed through the key technologies of grassland management, genetics, reproductive performance and animal health.  The importance of stocking rate cannot be ignored.  If one grows more grass, one must carry more animals to get the value out of that grass.  This means operating at a high stocking rate, whatever is appropriate to the land type, labour availability, infrastructure and so on, but one carries the animals that suit one's farm.  Overhead costs must match the level of output.  Direct payments must be maximised.  The investments in infrastructure should allow for efficient use of time and labour on farms, in particular for part-time farmers, but also for full-time farmers.  Net margins, obviously, are related to the inclusion or incorporation of the latest innovations coming from research and advice on farm operations.  For us, this is the contribution we can make to this sector: trying to make sure that farmers can maximise their return based on how efficiently they run their enterprises.  I thank the committee.  We are happy to deal with any questions or clarifications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Frank O'Mara","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Mara.

It was quite informative.  I have a couple of questions.  Regarding the suckler sector, I come from a part of the country where the farmers are nearly all small suckler farmers with an average of ten to 15 cows.  The key thing is that the cow must be kept all year round, and the only thing the cow produces is the calf.  This is one of the problems.  I am interested in the better beef challenge.  What type of land is involved, and where is the programme being run?  Is it primarily being run in the west or in the midlands?  Does it aim to get these calves up to a stage at which they are beyond weanlings and sold on to finishers or to finish them off?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the other sector Dr. O'Mara talked about, the best practice on dairy to beef, some farmers around us are now starting to take in the dairy calves and rear them, usually on contract.  As I said, the suckler farmer's biggest cost is trying to keep the cow all year round.  If the farmer has 15 cows and only two of them calve, he or she has a big cost keeping that in place.  Is it possible to see a future situation in which an alternative model to this kind of structure is developed?  The model we have at present is that the suckler cow is kept on the more marginal, more difficult land that may be suitable for dairying, tillage or other things and a very good-quality weanling calf is produced and then sold on to be finished somewhere else.  Is there a feasible alternative model to this, not a trial, that can work on that type of land and produce a higher income per hectare?  What trials have already been done on this to prove the concept?<\/p> <p>  The big issue here, of course, is the price farmers can get returned.  The prices returned from the factories at present are not meeting the needs of any sector of this.  The prices are just not able to provide the level of income required for that level of income to be fed back down the line to the suckler farmer from the beef producer to make either sector viable, the finisher or the suckler.  One of the suggestions that has been made is that more emphasis needs to be placed on providing producer groups whereby groups of farmers coming together can get better prices, produce the finished animal and sell it at a higher price.  We have had various groups before the committee talking about this and the way in which they would do it.  There are questions marks surrounding this, but how much work has been done on this concept?  Are we near or could we come to a situation in which we could see farmers on poorer land in the west of Ireland being able to finish their cattle?  Is there any model that could be developed in this regard, whereby farmers could finish cattle on such land and perhaps take quality beef calves from the dairy herd, finish them and make a better profit on them than that they are making at present, whereby they must keep suckler cows to produce the calves?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#F00300","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I want to ask the witnesses about how they see things going regarding the growth of the dairy industry and the impact this will have on beef.  Beef farmers are particularly concerned about where this will all end.  I do commend Teagasc on some of the measures, such as the knowledge transfer scheme and so on.  They are hugely important, but unless we sort out where the &euro;2.4 billion connected to the beef industry is going, we will not be able to sort out this problem and will be limited in how we approach it.<\/p><p>Has Teagasc done any models of vertical integration, as have been done with pigs and poultry and other sectors?  Why can that not be done with beef?  Can the witnesses comment on the beef industry and farming, particularly farming on the marginalised land where I come from, in terms of looking at farming in the west of Ireland as a public good?  What supports need to be put in place to really look at farming in the more marginalised areas as a public good in respect of the contribution it makes to rural Ireland and to rural communities?  I also wish to ask what the witnesses' relationship is with the beef factories, what role Teagasc can play in the pricing with beef factories and what it is doing about exports, trying to engage with the Chinese market and the replacement of the shortage of pork in that area.  I will leave it at that for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#F00400","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

I have a few different questions.  The first is about the graph which showed the increased proportion of beef that will come from the dairy herd.  Are there figures for four or five years' time?  Has Teagasc projected where the dairy herd size will go and what will be the size of the suckler herd?  A figure on the graph showed how much live exports have gone up but do the witnesses have a figure for what they expect or what the potential is for the next four to five years of further expansion?  While the graph showed there is an increased proportion, I would like to get more meat on those statistics.<\/p> <p>  The second point I want to make, which is a bit of a criticism, is about the economic breeding index, EBI, to which the witnesses referred.  In recent years, little or no value has been put on the index on the beef side.  Whether it is on the carcass value of the cow at culling or the value of the calf at sale, there definitely must be a policy adjustment in the calculation of the EBI.  At the end of the day, the EBI should reflect the profitability of a farm and if we have a 20% replacement rate for cows, a cow should be replaced every five years.  The value on the carcass between a good Friesian cow and a Jersey cross cow has not been in the EBI index and that also needs to be rectified.  The negative side of cross-breeding on beef genetics has not been economically evaluated to the extent I would like or that would influence farmers' decisions on breeding.<\/p> <p>  The third point is on live exports.  While I am open to correction, my understanding of live exports is that Jersey crosses are not welcome, whether they are from a Jersey cow or a Jersey dam.  The veal units on the Continent do not want these animals and when a number of them got there in the past, their performance put a threat on our whole business relationship with the veal units.  Has there been evaluation of those calves?  Have they any potential for the veal units or are they an absolute no-go area?<\/p> <p>  The income figures that were given on the profit per hectare and the increase in recent years where people were involved in various discussion groups, were the real eye-opener for me in that presentation.  Is there a breakdown of the figures that were given on farmers involved in knowledge transfer groups and so on as to whether they are full-time farmers or on their acreage?  A lot of figures were given on the size of farmers involved in beef production and I would like to know whether there is a co-relation with the knowledge transfer or if the larger beef farmers are getting involved in the knowledge transfer programme.  It was clear from the figures that were shown that the knowledge transfer had a huge input into the income per hectare, and at the end of the day, that is absolutely key.  The amount of dairy farmers involved in discussion groups and the percentage of beef farmers involved in the same is fairly minute.  We have had the beef data and genomics programme, which has an incentive but there was a lot of resistance to it in the past.  Have the views of dairy farmers improved as regards participation in that programme? Can Teagasc suggest ways in which we can get a substantial increase in the number of farmers partaking in its scheme?<\/p> <p>  What is the membership of beef farmers in Teagasc?  It may be an unfair question to Professor O'Mara, but does he feel that farmers, and beef farmers especially, only have a link with Teagasc for the purpose of filling out forms and to make sure they are involved with the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and various other schemes?  Is Teagasc seeing any increase in the participation in these knowledge transfer groups?  The figures that showed the improvement the profitability over a short period were startling.  We will be arguing here about five or ten cent per kilogram in beef price but the increased efficiency in the graphs shown was very significant.  There are some questions.  This committee was in Moorepark a couple of months ago and I raised questions then about the focus in our dairy research farms on cross-breeding.  Has there been a realignment of that focus or does Teagasc still perceive cross-breeding to be a key part of the dairy research in the future?  What are its implications on our beef output and has the evaluation of that increased?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#G00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I have a comment on the overall scene.  I welcome the presentation and the good work Teagasc is doing, but we are all familiar with the 21:28: 51 model that is going around when it comes to beef, wherein 21 cent of every euro that is spent across the counter by a person buying Irish beef, 21 cent or 21%, is the farmer's cut, while 28% is the processor's cut and 51% is the retailer's cut.  While Teagasc has no influence on that and is probably is not in a position to comment on how we could improve that percentage take for the farmer, Teagasc's good work here is in trying to enhance, increase and improve the farmer's profitability within a very small percentage of the overall take for beef.  Even for the most efficient farmer out there, we are still talking about increasing his percentage profitability of a very small percent of the overall income that is coming into the beef sector, the vast majority of which is going to the processors and retailers.  Teagasc is on a par with the rest of us here, because none of us can address how to increase the farmer's take, but that is basically the bottom line issue here.<\/p> <p>  I want to tease out some of the processes and production improvements for farmers, and incorporate into that what has been mentioned already.  On the increase in the dairy calf numbers, the increase in the proportion of beef that we either will be eating ourselves, or hopefully exporting, is going to come from the dairy herd.<\/p><p>For a farmer who has been rearing sucklers to rear a dairy calf as a substitute, the internal conflict is that beef is sucklers in the heads of people such as myself and Deputy Martin Kenny the further west one goes.  When one looks at the promotion material for Irish beef it shows a picture of a lovely Charolais cow with a fine big calf on a lush, green, grass field.  We are portraying that Origin Green, grass-fed image.  No matter how efficiently we do it, if we move further towards rearing dairy calves to beef there will be a great deal more inputs and more time spent inside on concrete floors, slats and the like.  While we might be getting it right in one way, are we running the risk of damaging our image in the long run?  Regardless of how efficient we become at producing the dairy bred calf, in the process of doing that could we lose our grass-fed image, which ultimately could be detrimental to selling the beef?<\/p><p> All the figures and tables in the presentation include the direct payment.  We can see from the figures how integral an element it is of farmers' incomes.  It will not be Teagasc's call or ours as the final decisions will be made further up the chain, but where would Teagasc like to see the emphasis built into the system in the next CAP payments?  Will GLAS payments, hopefully, continue?  Will there still be knowledge transfer?  They are the two schemes other than the direct payment from which suckler farmers, in particular, can benefit aside from rearing beef.  Does Teagasc have an opinion on where it would see the most beneficial payment coming to the beef sector, how it would be most beneficial and how it would improve not just the farmers' lot but the production processes in which they are operating?<\/p><p> Continuing on the beef sector and processing, how does Teagasc envisage the larger kill to produce the same amount of beef given the nature of the beast we will be rearing in the future from the dairy herd?  What type of image will that portray?  Does Teagasc see any advantages in it when it does its sums for the overall bottom line for a farmer at the end of the year if he moves from suckler production to rearing the dairy calf?  He will have to rear many more calves than his cows were rearing to produce the same amount of beef.  When one balances the two, will the farmer ultimately be better off?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#G00500","speaker":"1383","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing some of the presentation.  I acknowledge Teagasc's great role in trying to ensure there is profitability in beef farming.  I have questions on two issues.  The industry has seen major movements regarding suckler cows and trends of moving away from suckler cows.  In my part of the country, as has been mentioned by other members, the phenomenon of contract rearing of dairy calves for dairy herds has become the more profitable option within the beef industry.  Farmers are probably getting paid every month, they are getting a set amount and there is no issue with the marts or the factories.  It is becoming a pathway that many people, particularly young farmers, are considering.  They are not seeking to go into dairy but they might see an opportunity in going onto the platform of contract rearing.  Where does Dr. O'Mara see that in the future of agriculture and the beef industry?  Does he think there will be greater movement towards that?  On issues regarding bed and breakfast arrangements and the legislation, do we need to examine that and streamlining it to make it easier?<\/p> <p>  I also have a question about the ability of farming groups to work together as an entity, for example, as producer groups, to get a better price on the factory floor.  Has there been much activity in that regard?  What role does Teagasc have in promoting and activating the producer group model so there is a conglomeration of multiple farmers working together to get a better floor price and having a power hand when dealing with the entities involved?  Where does Teagasc see that in the future in terms of getting a better price for one's product?<\/p> <p>  They are two key issues.  In the industry at present one is seeing large numbers of suckler cows moving off farms and there is a knock-on effect of not having the weanlings.  Does Dr. O'Mara have a fear, and I put this question to representatives of the meat industry and they fluffed the answer, that a decade hence the meat industry might be made up of Friesian cull cows and Angus bulls and heifers?  Would he have a fear for the industry into the future if that were to be the marketability element of the industry?

However, this demand does not appear to help the farmer, the primary producer.

I am aware there are EU-wide endeavours to protect the primary producer, recognising the producers' weak bargaining position in the food supply chain.

There were many questions about price and the market.  We will comment on that as we go through the questions but we do not have any answers on it.  It is a huge conundrum.<\/p><p>The big issues for a beef farmer are the price he gets for his cattle and how efficiently and at what cost he can produce those cattle.  Our role relates to how efficiently and at what cost a farmer can produce cattle.  Getting an adequate return from the market is a job for the beef farmer.  They are our clients and we would love them to get more.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Kenny asked about the BETTER farm beef programme and asked where were the farmers who were on the programme.  They are all in every county and on all land types.  Variation in performance and profitability arose depending on land type but in all land types, we were able to show an improvement in performance by focusing on technical efficiencies.  The Deputy also asked about an alternative model for the suckler cow, while another Deputy mentioned contract rearing.  There are alternative models, such as dairy calf to beef, but we see the suckler model as integral for the future of many farmers.  This is for various reasons.  It does not suit everybody to go into dairy calf to beef farming as it is labour intensive at the rearing phase.  Sucklers are a suitable system for many small fragmented farms where there is wetland and so on.  It is not a profitable enterprise at the moment but we have to keep working at it.  The marketplace has to keep working to produce a viable return for farmers within the system.  There is an opportunity in areas such as better grassland management and better fertility.<br\/><br\/>Price is a major issue.  Over the years there has been talk of getting producer groups together and getting farmers together to brand our beef better.  These things can play a role but they have not, to date, been hugely significant in the beef or sheep sectors.  There are a number of producer groups in the latter sector but, while they work well together, they tend to be localised and do not comprise a large volume of the sheep kill.  It is the same in the beef sector.  It has to be worked on but it will be slow progress to establish producer groups in such a way as to make a significant impact on the industry.<br\/><br\/>Senator Conway-Walsh asked about the impact of the dairy sector on the beef sector.  We are seeing a fundamental change in the beef sector and we are, to some extent, going back to where we were in the past with 400,000 suckler cows and 1.4 million dairy cows.  I do not suggest suckler cow numbers will reach that level, in the short or medium term at any rate.  At the time we had those numbers there were 70,000 dairy farmers with an average of 20 cows each.  Many of them have now got out of dairy and got into sucklers, and they will not be going back to dairy production.  The structure of the industry has changed quite significantly.  The share of the kill coming from dairy beef will continue its trend over the past couple of years so it is important that we work on the quality of the calf that comes from the dairy herd, as well as continuing to support the suckler herd.<br\/><br\/>Models of vertical integration are being adopted in factories that are contracted to farmers with feedlots to finish cattle and, in recent years, factories have integrated with suppliers for particular markets.  They have a role to play in giving certainty to a producer as regards his margin at the end of the process.  Senator Conway-Walsh also talked about the role of farming as a public good.  We put up a slide on its environmental performance and beef farming has a strong performance in that area, contributing a lot to biodiversity, good water quality, etc.  That is an important facet of the industry.<br\/><br\/>Senator Paul Daly asked about the CAP.  The CAP will try to target people who supply environmental goods to reward then for their contribution.  Senator Conway-Walsh asked about our relationship with beef factories and our role in regard to pricing and exports to China.  We have no formal relationship with the beef factories but we collaborate with them on various initiatives they take to support producers, such as the Teagasc-<i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>BETTER farm beef programme, whose advisers are being funded by the three largest meat companies and FPD.  We also collaborate with them in research on meat quality through Meat Technology Ireland, an initiative funded by Enterprise Ireland and meat factories to look at the post-farm gate aspects of meat quality.  We have no relationship with them in the area of pricing, however, or how they set their prices.<br\/><br\/>We do not have a significant direct role in exports to China but we support the Department when delegations come to Ireland by bringing them to farms, telling them about the production system and giving them information about sustainability and animal welfare in our industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Frank O'Mara","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Can the current suckler farming model work profitably into the future?

Deputy Cahill asked where the proportion of the beef to the dairy herd might be in four or five years.  We do not have a crystal ball but we did an exercise recently in which we tried to model how the dairy and beef sectors would co-evolve in the future.  We examined a number of scenarios ranging from a rapid expansion of the dairy sector to the rapid fall of suckler farming, neither of which is the most likely scenario.  We will probably see an expansion in dairy cow numbers of between 1% and 2% over the next couple of years, based on what we have seen with heifers on the ground, inseminations, calves born this year and so on.<\/p><p>We are in a slower expansion phase on the dairy side, with a rate of 4% to 5%.  On the suckler cow side, the rate in the past three to four years has probably been 2% to 3% per year.  Whether it picks up in terms of there being more conversions remains to be seen, but that is the trend.  It is a question of whether the trends will remain at that modest level or accelerate in either direction.  To me, it looks like we will see a more modest trend in the next couple of years.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the EBI, the visit to Moorepark and so on.  I am not an expert on breeding.  Perhaps Dr. Kelly might want to pick up on this issue.<\/p><p> On our breeding policy, let me refer to one of the most important herds we have at Moorepark.  I was not there on the day members visited, but they probably saw the next generation herd.  We are trying to look forward to determine what the average cow might look like in ten years' time.  I am not referring to appearance but to how a cow performs.  It is one of our flagship herds and a crossbred herd.  It is a Holstein herd, but it is not all a Jersey herd by any manner or means.  We do not see that the future involves crossbred animals for everybody.  A relatively small proportion of the dairy herd is crossbred.  The figure is approximately 5% or thereabouts.  We circulated information to the effect that the only semen we used in our own cows this year was sexed Jersey semen, with a view to avoiding male Jersey calves or crossbred Jersey calves.  We published our approach in the media.  My understanding is quite a few farmers followed the practice in the spring.<\/p><p> On Jersey calves and live exports, Dr. Kelly might state whether there is an appetite for Jersey calves, or otherwise, among live exporters.  My understanding is that, at this stage of the year, quite a few Jersey calves are being exported because there is a lot of demand for them.  Dr. Kelly might know a little more about that matter.  I will leave it to him.<\/p><p> I was asked about the BETTER farm beef programme, one of our knowledge transfer programmes, and also the data we published on the dairy calf to beef aspect.  I was asked whether larger beef farmers, or others, were involved.  To clarify, the data I showed for the better beef programme and the dairy calf to beef programme were for \"selected farmers\", for want of a better phrase.  There were 25 or 30 farmers involved in the BETTER beef farm programme and ten in the green acres dairy calf to beef programme.  There was a range of sizes, from medium to large, rather than small.  On the wider question of whether our clients are large or small farmers, we have a mixture of clients.  Dr. Kelly might refer to the numbers involved in discussion groups for the schemes.<\/p><p> Senator Paul Daly, rightly, pointed out that we were working on a very small part of the cake.  Approximately 20% of the retail value is what ends up with the farmer.  That is the part in respect of which we are trying to improve profitability.  That is a fact, but a mantra from any businessperson is that one should control what one can control oneself and do it well.  We work with farmers to help them to control what they can control as best they can.  The wider picture and the share of the cake comprise a bigger issue that may be dealt with later.<\/p><p> On what we would like to see in the next CAP, we do not have a particular view on the matter.  We provide information and advice for the Government on any scenario it wants us to model, but everyone believes the CAP will probably reflect important issues such as climate change and other environmental issues in its next iteration to a greater or lesser extent.<\/p><p> Senator Lombard referred to the trend away from suckler cows and highlighted the increase in contract calf rearing.  I refer to dairy calves being contract reared on beef farms.  It has developed as a successful enterprise on a significant number of farms and we see the trend continuing.  I do not know what level it will reach, but there are probably 1,000 farms carrying out contract rearing.  I do not know whether the number will double, but there is certainly a trend towards an increase.  However, it is certainly not for everybody.  Not every farmer will want to contract rear, but those who are doing it like the certainty attached to income.  For dairy farmers, it is an important outlet or way to reduce the workload on some farms.<\/p><p> Senator Lombard asked whether there were issues that needed to be streamlined.  I am not aware that there are particular barriers, legislative or regulatory issues holding things back.  The Senator mentioned producer groups, an issue on which we have touched.  He asked whether we were afraid that there would not be enough quality cattle around in ten years' time.  I do not foresee us not having a significant suckler cow herd in ten years.  We will see more dairy calf to beef production, to some extent, and it will be a challenge for the beef industry to ensure it can market all types of animal in the industry.<\/p><p> Senator Michelle Mulherin asked about the figure of &euro;100 million and whether we had suggestions in targeting it.  There are many people with many suggestions.  There are many farmers who had a tough six or eight months because of beef prices.  There will be many ways suggested as to how to cut the cake.  I will leave it to the Minister and his officials, in their wisdom, to spend the money wisely and try to ensure the funding will go to those who suffered the biggest losses in the last period.<\/p><p> The Chairman asked about our work on climate change and what we were doing to inform and educate farmers in that regard.  With every major event we experience, we highlight important issues to do with the environment.  At our last open day in Grange there was a big element on the environment.  In our programmes, including the BETTER farm beef programme, and so on we try to highlight environmental issues as much as we can.  In agricultural colleges our students are well trained on the subject.  Sometimes it can be hard to get farmers to engage on ot.  They are much more interested in talking about breeding quality or grassland management, but, as the public debate increases, farmers are becoming increasingly informed and wish to know about the matter and circulate their side of the story.  The farm organisations represent them quite well in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Frank O'Mara","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Before we proceed to Dr. Kelly, two members wish to ask questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#K00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>On the sexed semen, do the delegates have percentages for fertility and cost?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#K00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I accept that the delegates probably cannot answer my initial question about aid for the beef industry.

Quite good land would be used for forestry.  We all accept that there is land that can only be used for forestry, which is fine.<\/p><p> Are we not facing a difficult crisis?

With the programme, we see a range of beef systems.  This goes back to some of the issues mentioned by other members, including Senator Paul Daly, regarding which systems are the most profitable, etc.  The system under the most pressure - it is used more commonly in the western part of the country - is where suckler cow farmers are rearing weanlings up to seven or eight months and then selling those calves to finishers in neighbouring areas or other parts of the country.  There is a big cost in keeping that suckler cow and the value of the calf, or the lack of value, can often have a big impact on profitability.  With the likes of the BETTER farm beef programme in the past few years and profit monitor results, we have seen that those farmers with the ability to take on those animals for a little longer and perhaps finish them are more profitable.  A high proportion of suckler cow farmers are in a system where they sell calves at a young age.  This can be down to land type and the availability of labour and housing on the farm.  Dr. O'Mara has shown a graph demonstrating a big increase in profitability, much of which arises from a change of system on a farm to a more integrated process all the way through.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill asked about live exports and the attractiveness of male crossbred calves from the dairy herd.  They only have a certain value.  Research from Teagasc in the past ten years has demonstrated that if we compare the Jersey crossbred male calves with Holstein Friesian crossbred male calves, they are worth in the region of &euro;100 per head less in terms of profitability than if the farmer was to hold on to them to finish them.  It is a challenge.  If the Holstein Friesian bull calf is only worth &euro;40 or &euro;50 in terms of profitability in the market and the others are worth &euro;100 less, the sums do not add up.  Veal units on the Continent have the same figures.  There is large availability of Holstein Friesian bull calves.  Not all of our Friesian male calves are exported and there is a selection that would not be suitable.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill referred to knowledge transfer and asked if farmers were only interested in the schemes.  That is not our experience.  Within Teagasc we are operating 300 knowledge transfer discussion groups, in which a little over 5,000 farmers are involved.  The previous scheme, the beef technology adoption programme, BTAP, ran for three years.  At this stage the majority of the farmers have been in discussion groups for a little over six years within which we have seen significant progress in the level of technology uptake by a significant proportion of farms.  We have seen the level of uptake within groups in our profit monitor results.  It is a select group of farmers who are first Teagasc clients and then in knowledge transfer discussion groups.  That is probably where we are seeing more progress than in national average figures from the national farm survey.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lombard mentioned contract heifer rearing, an issue also covered by Dr. O'Mara.  There is an attractiveness about it, but with respect to profitability, we are only starting to see farmers getting involved in these systems.  Our initial analysis is that where farmers become involved in contract heifer rearing to a high level of efficiency, there are similar enough incomes where suckler cow or dairy calf to beef rearing is engaged in to a high level of efficiency.  If we are to compare the systems, including contract heifer rearing and dairy calf to beef or suckler cow rearing, we must really compare them at a high level of efficiency.  There is similar enough income at the high levels of efficiency.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Eugene Murphy asked if there was a need for extra support for suckler beef farmers.  There are schemes such as the beef data and genomics programme which are worth quite a lot of money to farmers and where there has been a big uptake, but of the approximately 65,000 suckler cow farmers in the country, fewer than half have taken it up.  As an advisory service, we pushed both clients and non-clients strongly to take up the programme.  The Government also launched a pilot beef efficiency improvement programme, the beef environmental efficiency pilot scheme, which we also encouraged farmers to take up.  It is worth &euro;40 per cow and farmers have to weigh the cow and calf to get it.  It remains to be seen whether the full funding will be taken up.  Only a percentage of beef farmers have taken it up.  It is important that when schemes or such support is available for suckler cow farmers, that they be taken up.  Efficiency is built into them as a certain amount of work must be done by the suckler cow farmer, but it is important that they be taken up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pearse Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Is that beef scheme oversubscribed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#L00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558998000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I have not seen the figures to know whether it has been oversubscribed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pearse Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I believe it is, although I stand to be corrected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#L00500","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558998000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked a fundamental question about ongoing support for the sector.

We must also remember that beef is competing with chicken and pork which are much cheaper meats throughout the world.  There is only a certain amount that the market will be able to return.  We need to try to move up the value chain and get into premium markets to capitalise on the high quality product we have, but there is only a certain amount that can be done.  We operate in the area of efficiency and there is much scope on many farms to improve it.  For various demographic and other reasons, some would probably be slow to adopt the technologies we advise, but there is a large cohort of farmers whom we believe have the potential to adopt some technologies to improve grassland management or the genetic merit of suckler cows, etc.  The schemes mentioned by Mr. Kelly are very important, not just for the income support they provide but also for the improvements they can bring about on farms and the long-term benefits they provide.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that there is a profitability challenge in the sector.  When beef farmers with good infrastructure on their land base and good land see the profitability in dairy production, it will be an option for some.  If beef farmers do not improve their margins through productivity or the price does not increase, these farms will continue to face an income challenge, unless a support payment or whatever else is provided.<\/p><p>Whether that happens is not a decision for us.  It is a sector which has to deal with a big income issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Frank O'Mara","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558998000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Deputy Cahill asked a question about sexed semen.

I am joined by Mr. Fergal O&rsquo;Leary, a member of the commission, who has responsibility for the CCPC&rsquo;s consumer protection division and our advocacy and consumer information functions.<\/p> <p>  Since we appeared before the committee in October of last year, we have closely followed the progress of the unfair trading practices directive through the European legislative process.  We have also followed the committee's debates with interest and we are aware of the wide range of issues, particularly in respect of the beef sector, that have been raised by stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  My intention in addressing the committee on both these topics is to put forward some lessons from our own experience and some positive suggestions to assist the committee in its work.  The directive is vastly different from the existing grocery regulations in respect of which we have a function.  In scope and size alone we estimate that it could apply to approximately 10,000 businesses in Ireland.  It is a substantial directive.  We will offer our considered views as to how the directive may be transposed in Ireland, in such a manner as to address some of the issues raised by stakeholders in this sector.<\/p><p>Before discussing those matters further in detail, I highlight the extensive nature of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission&rsquo;s legislative mandate.  It has a mandate across the economy to promote consumer welfare.  This involves promoting compliance with over 40 competition and consumer protection legislative instruments. <i><\/i>We do not specialise in any one sector; rather, we extend across the full scope of the economy.  We are aware that there have been concerns and questions about competition law and the Twenty20 Beef Club, as well as concerns about potential anti-competitive behaviour in the beef sector more generally.  These two areas are within our remit and it is important that I address them first. <br\/><br\/>On the Twenty20 Beef Club, we have received a small number of complaints about this arrangement and are examining them carefully.  However, this type of agreement which is a vertical agreement, that is, an agreement between players at different stages in the food chain, generally is permissible under Irish and European competition law.  Specifically there is the vertical block exemption<i><\/i>regulation in European law which exempts from competition law scrutiny vertical agreements where the market share of both the buyer and the seller is under 30%.  It is only when it goes above 30% that one starts to have concerns.  There might be sectors where, for instance, there are many parallel agreements that absorb the entire market and where the benefit of the block exemption potentially could be withdrawn by the Commission, but in general competition agencies are much more concerned about horizontal agreements, that is, agreements between players at the same stage in the market.  We never give a clean bill of health and say, &quot;There is nothing to see here.&quot;  We will continue to make inquiries and look at complaints we receive, but at this point we do not have grounds to be concerned that a breach of competition law has occurred.  We will continue to monitor its impact and if at any future stage we have concerns, we will take action. <br\/><br\/>There have been allegations about the existence of a cartel in the beef processing sector.  Under Irish and European law, a cartel is an agreement between competitors to fix prices, limit output or share markets for their own benefit.  It is a serious breach of the law, so much so that it carries a burden of proof similar to that for other crimes such as theft or murder.  Anyone convicted of such a crime can face a maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment.The serious nature of this type of crime frames how we investigate allegations of a cartel.  An allegation does not provide a sufficient basis for us to open an investigation or obtain a warrant from a judge in order that we can search the premises of businesses suspected of being involved.  We have a team of experienced senior investigators, including serving and former garda&iacute;, whose roles are to examine the evidence and establish lines of inquiry in investigating potential cartels.  We also have a dedicated cartel immunity phone number to enable anyone who has been part of a cartel to come forward with evidence in return for immunity from prosecution.  To date, the CCPC&rsquo;s criminal investigations team has examined a number of complaints and followed various lines of inquiry in the meat processing sector.  So far, however, we have not uncovered evidence of a cartel.  <br\/><br\/>Let me comment on prices.  There is sometimes a feeling that because there is a market price, a common price among buyers and sellers, that it is evidence of a cartel.  It is not; prices being in line is not enough.  In markets which are very transparent - there are many such markets - prices tend to converge at a market level.  Let me give an example.  If one walks down Moore Street, the price of apples is going to be pretty much the same at the top of the street as at the bottom.  The reason is all buyers and sellers can see the prices being charged.  If a seller was to put up the price, he or she would lose market share because nobody would buy from him or her.  If a seller was to reduce his or her prices, he or she knows that all other sellers would see that he or she had done so and that they could also reduce their prices,meaning that everybody would lose money.  One tends to have convergence where prices are very transparent.  That seems to be the case in the beef market.  We have not uncovered any evidence of a cartel, but as with all sectors, we will continue to examine every complaint we receive.  We would welcome information or evidence of this nature from anyone.  A member of our investigations team is available to meet anyone in any location at any time.  We do not take allegations lightly, but it is important to stress the need for tangible evidence, that is, evidence of collusion, the fact that people have come together to agree on prices, when it comes to dealing with such a serious crime. <br\/><br\/>We are aware of broader concerns about sustainability and viability in farming that are being widely discussed and debated in the sector.  We listened with great interest to the end of the discussion with the representatives from Teagasc.  The concerns obviously include farm income levels; farmers&rsquo; lack of power and limited ability to negotiate the price they get for their products; and a lack of transparency to see who is profiting in the food chain.  These issues do not fall within our remit, but as they are all inter-related, I would like to offer our considered views on how some of them could be addressed in the transposition of the directive.<br\/><br\/>On the agriculture sector generally and the directive, in particular, it is important to consider the context.  The characteristics of the agriculture sector, about which all members know a great deal more than I do, including its vulnerability to extreme weather conditions, imbalances between supply and demand and price and income fluctuations, mean that market instability is a common feature and a concern for all farmers.  The majority of those who have appeared before the committee have pointed to relatively low bargaining power as one of the major issues in the sector.  It has often been cited as a competition problem.  We understand the desire to address the imbalance for farmers, but in our view the way to redress it is not through competition law.  Attempts have been made to use exemptions from competition law to rebalance bargaining power in the sector such as by allowing vertical agreements and the development of producer organisations; however, the issue remains prevalent in the sector.  The directive has also been put forward as a solution to the problem, but if the aim is to address the imbalance in farmers' power in the market, it is our considered view that, as it stands, the measure is unlikely to succeed.  Many of the people to whom it has spoken have also expressed that view.<br\/><br\/>I turn to some suggestions as to what would help.  Power imbalances are best addressed before contracts are signed, rather than trying to address them after the fact.  To be successful, a dedicated body is required to provide real support for the sector.  A critical component will be providing advice for individual farmers.  Farmers need to know what is and is not allowed and to whom they can go when they have a problem.<br\/><br\/>Members will be aware that the directive requires the appointment of a competent authority or authorities.  Across Europe there has been a wide range of views expressed on how the directive will be implemented and whether there should be a stand-alone body or whether various organisations should be given specific mandates.  The appointment of more than one competent body is allowed for in the directive.  For instance, one body may provide support, while another receives complaints.  We are unaware whether such an arrangement is being considered here. <br\/><br\/>In a number of sectors, including telecoms, financial services and energy, a sectoral specific body is given a remit to ensure specific rules are adhered to.  The body will have access to industry information and contacts.  It can build expertise in the sector in order that it can see market trends or issues as they develop and take preventive steps or alter the rules in order that they reflect new market dynamics, as they develop.  Because the legislation is industry specific, it can be both proactive and responsive and entirely focused on the sector and its needs.  A body dedicated to it would develop the information structures and relationships needed to provide real support for the sector.  If such a sectoral regulator or office was to be developed, its functions could include devising and implementing a strategy to support farmers in the context of CAP reform, advising on commercial and economic development of the sector and overseeing implementation of future European legislation.  For instance, last week details of the EU proposal for more market transparency in the EU's food supply chain were announced.  If progressed, it would require a body to capture price and market data and correlate them <br\/><br\/>It is in the nature of this industry to move quickly.  Issues need to be addressed as they arise.  Farmers cannot wait for lengthy investigations and face the uncertainty of legal challenges.  The CCPC&rsquo;s investigations are and will continue to be evidence-based and mostly retrospective.  This means that they take time.  We do not act or secure outcomes for individual businesses or consumers; we are not an ombudsman.  Our role is to enforce the law.  Under the current grocery regulations, we have not, to date, received sufficient information from suppliers to establish that a breach of the regulations has occurred or is occurring.  We believe farmers, in particular, want someone on the ground who is focused on the farming sector exclusively and can act quickly on their behalf, including by offering some adjudication, rather than adopting an enforcement approach after a breach of the directive has occurred.  To do this effectively, alternative approaches such as engaging in mediation or arbitration, as in the EU code, should be considered.  The role of the competent authority for this directive requires a dedicated organisation on the ground, with specialised expertise, knowledge and the ability to build confidence across the sector.  In return, we believe complaints about breaches and other issues would be more likely to be forthcoming. <br\/><br\/>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has been in existence in various forms for a very long time.  We are not naive about the significance of this measure and the cost of establishing a dedicated sectoral regulator.  We have not come to this conclusion lightly.<\/p><p>However, considering the nature of this market, the issues surrounding sustainability and viability and our experience of engaging with this sector, if the objective is to rebalance power, a substantial and more interventionist response is required.<\/p><p> I would like to use the last few minutes of my time to highlight some points we believe need to be considered in the transposition of the directive in Ireland, including the decision on the most appropriate competent authority or authorities.  The scale and scope of the directive are vastly different from the existing grocery regulations.  We estimate that the Irish legislation could apply to 10,000 traders in the food supply chain and their direct relationships with suppliers.  This compares to the 22 grocery undertakings and their direct supplier relationships that are within the scope of the current regulations.  There are orders of magnitude in the difference.  The expanded scope will have significant cost implications and consideration needs to be given to how such a regulatory regime would be funded.  Our initial ballpark estimate is that, to achieve the aims of the directive successfully, a minimum of 40 staff would be required.  The necessary skill sets would include investigators, economists, legal advisers, supply chain experts and auditors.  To outline a tangible benchmark for the cost, the work of the Groceries Code Adjudicator in the UK costs &pound;2 million per year, although we understand the adjudicator does not necessarily use all of that amount every year, and is funded by a levy on the much smaller number of retailers - ten - within its scope.<\/p><p> A further complication is that the directive applies to commercial relationships, regardless of the place of establishment of the supplier or buyer.  In the context of Brexit, this has significant implications for Ireland more than any other member state, given the interconnected nature of the Irish and UK agrifood sectors.  The mechanism to promote compliance with the directive needs to be considered carefully.<\/p><p> The legal basis for the directive lies in Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which relates to the CAP and its objectives, including the safeguarding of farmers' ability to make a reasonable living.  We recognise and acknowledge the importance of such objectives.  Unfortunately, they can and, on occasion, will conflict with consumers' interests and welfare.  It should also be said the original proposal was significantly expanded in the final directive which extended it to all actors in the food chain.  We note that large processors and manufacturers are requesting that the regime be further expanded upwards to address their issues with buyer power.  In contrast, others believe the directive does not go far enough and have stated a ban on below cost selling is required.  That is a measure the CCPC would strongly oppose.  In our view, banning below cost selling would not guarantee better prices for food producers.  Instead, it would guarantee higher profits for retailers and higher prices for consumers.<\/p><p> Our role is focused on the welfare of consumers.  It is an important job.  We are aware that there is a body of work ahead in the transposition of this legislation and while we fully respect the fact that our role can be and is changed by the Oireachtas, we believe in the work we are doing across every sector of the economy and wish to be allowed to continue it.  If we were to be given the role of competent authority for the directive, there is little doubt that it would drain resources and focus from across the organisation and our ability to work on consumers' behalf would be seriously compromised.<\/p><p> For all of these reasons, we strongly ask the committee to consider our view that a dedicated sectoral body is required.  It should be empowered not only to enforce the directive but also to deliver ongoing regulatory interventions to improve the welfare of farmers.  Given the transposition deadline and the fact that the committee's work is coming to a close, a decision on the issue needs to be made as a matter of urgency.  The alternative would be unlikely to achieve the desired change in the sector.<\/p><p> We will, of course, continue to do our part in this and all other sectors.  It includes continuing our work to ensure compliance with the existing grocery regulations.  We would also be happy to work with any body designated with a role in the sector.  We have previously worked closely with other bodies in the setting up of new regulatory systems and are ready to provide assistance in any way we can.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman.  We are happy to take questions and expand on our views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Goggin for her informative presentation.

If someone asked 100 farmers whether they believed there was a cartel, 99 would say \"Yes\".  Ms Goggin stated a common price was not sufficient evidence of a cartel, but these operators are selling into different markets and getting different returns.  It is more than a coincidence that, on a Friday evening or Monday morning, someone will have the same price quoted by all of the factories.  The primary producer is convinced that there is a cartel.  There was a time when a producer could ring various factories and get different quotations.  That situation has evaporated during the years.  There is no point in approaching a different processor now because there will be no difference in price.  While I accept Ms Goggin's statement that a common price does not signify the existence of a cartel, the primary producers know that the processors have different markets and returns and that it is difficult in the extreme to explain to a farmer producing a beef animal that there is no cartel.

There is a line of thought that prices do not need to be fixed too much in the sense that, although they are named differently, many of the processors quoting prices are under the one umbrella.  The CCPC plays a role in the case of mergers, acquisitions and takeovers.<\/p><p>We are talking about the beef sector, so when in that particular sector, for example, would the commission call stop?  An evident takeover of an industry by an individual company gaining more and more power has not happened yet.  When a person owns the job lot, he or she does not need communication with his or her competitors, because that person does not have that many competitors.  He or she can name the price and does not need to fixed it at all.  The person sets it and names it, and people have to take it because of that person's power.  There have been a number of takeovers and mergers in recent years, all of which the CCPC would have been consulted about at the time and none of which, from memory, it stopped or even flagged issues with.  I am open to correction on that.  How big would one ownership within a certain sector need to be before the commission would flag it as being a possible breach?

Is it possible to say how many complaints it has got at this stage?

Either Deputy Cahill or Senator Paul Daly referred to the Friday evening and Monday morning price.  When one checks it, it does, for people like us, look like there is some fixing going on.  There is no question about it, as other speakers have said.  The farming community is utterly convinced of this price fixing, and this is where we are fixed.

I am going to start by addressing Deputy Cahill's question about what is large enough and whether size matters.  I might ask Mr. O'Leary to deal with the questions about the cartel.  This is a genius question because it goes to the core of competition law and the difference I spoke about between vertical and horizontal agreements.  Size does not matter in a cartel.  All cartels are illegal.  Any kind of cartel is a criminal offence and it does not matter whether it is big or small.  In vertical agreements one looks at the effect of the agreement.  When looking at competition law, it always says that agreements which have the object or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition are illegal.  It is about object or effect.  Cartels are object restrictions, as we call them, so they are always illegal regardless of how small they are or if a person says he or she did not mean to do it.  They are always illegal.<\/p> <p>  Regarding agreements which have an anti-competitive effect, vertical agreements are generally considered not to have an anti-competitive effect until they go above a certain market share threshold.  They are generally efficiency enhancing.  They make it more efficient for the producer and the supplier.  There is more certainty because there is a contract, and that is a big issue as well because it tries to iron out some of the volatility.  That is where the European Commission has what is called a safe harbour in its vertical block exemption regulation, Regulation No 320\/2010.  If the market share of the upstream and downstream, the producer and supplier, are both below 30%, then it is okay, and in that case size does matter.  Agreements that cover a lesser part of the market are generally not considered to be a problem, unless there were three or four agreements that sewed up the entire market and nobody could come in at either level.  Many people spend their time looking at the effects of those kinds of vertical agreements.  Looking at the statistics in the Twenty20 Beef Club, if all the predictions and market share forecasts came true, they might get up to 5% in a few years, and that is not a level that would trigger our concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558998000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>If I might add on the beef club, we know that other suppliers are thinking about similar initiatives.  From our point of view, as Ms Goggin said in the statement, it is not a concern at the moment, but the bigger it gets, the more attention it would get from us.  We are not saying that everything is always fine into the future, and we will continue to monitor that.  I would have thought that any company the size of Glanbia would have taken legal advice itself before implementing such a scheme because our reputation does precede us, and if it was seen that it was even close to the margins, it would expect to hear from us.<\/p> <p>  On the cartel, I have read an awful lot from testimonies in front of this committee and newspaper reports, and spoken to farmers myself, and I agree with the sentiment that farmers feel very hard done by.  I agree as well that 99 out of 100 of them would say there is price fixing going on.  I can say from the CCPC point of view that we have had complaints.  Senator Mulherin asked about that.  We had one in 2016, four in 2017, and one in 2018.  That one in 2018 was anonymous, but I can guarantee this committee that we looked into each and every one of those thoroughly.  Cartel investigations are the lifeblood of our organisation.  We had a successful case before the courts earlier on in the year and we want to have these cases successfully brought about because of what they do for us in terms of motivating staff and our reputation.  As Deputy Cahill said, we have looked at issues in the agriculture sector, so there is no sector that we will not look at, but from a value for money to the taxpayer point of view, we have to have some evidence to go after it.  I would say to this committee and the Senators' and Deputies' contacts that if they have information, as was said in the statement, we will meet them at any location at any time and we will look into any kind of evidence we receive.  That one complaint from 2018 was anonymous, and we still looked into it and spent a lot of time on it.  We want to do that, but as Ms Goggin has highlighted, this is a market with a lot of price information out there.  It is published in the newspapers and in agriculture at a certain time.  Ms Goggin made the comparison with Moore Street.  We have a cost comparison website where one will find every mortgage rate in the country.

There are many other co-operative and private merchants, most of them of a far smaller scale, that, in the view of the merchants who have presented to us, have been very much put at a competitive disadvantage.  While this is probably beyond the CCPC's remit, Glanbia has a mechanism whereby it gives co-operatives bonuses at the end to redistribute its profits.  Private merchants are making the case to us that they are small businesses and are finding it hard to compete with this big corporate beside them that has various mechanisms of trying to disguise the price it is paying, and here it is now forcing its customers into a scheme and tying them into it for a period.  Anyone who goes into it for six months forgoes all the advantages of coming out of it.

Regarding the point Deputy Cahill made, how far back down the trading curves or trends does the CCPC go to examine this?  To buy into this scheme and produce the 5% of the beef if all targets are met, one must buy all one's inputs, including unrelated inputs, and all the on-farm products one would normally buy from a co-operative or similar-type supplier from Glanbia.  While it might only, therefore, be an end product of 5% of the beef, if there are other activities on one's farm, which can include fertiliser and not just one's inputs into the production of the beef, which is part of the package, one must buy everything and it will be far greater than 5% of the agricultural trading turnover within the sector that will buy into the scheme we are talking about in the competition between different mills or co-operatives.  The overall or final beef production is only 5%.  However, to get there, by virtue of the fact that one must tie into all one's inputs on one's farm if one is in the scheme, it will be far greater than 5% of the trading value of farm to co-operative or farm to supplier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#Q00700","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558998000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>In parts of the analysis we certainly would not look just at the output or the end point; we look at the inputs as well.

To an extent, this goes back to a previous job I had when I was the telecommunications regulator before joining the CCPC.  I would put a sectoral regulator down to four main strands: information gathering; advice; mediation and arbitration; and enforcement.  Information gathering is important because it is important for people to know what is going on in the industry, which relates to the point about digging down into the levels and what happens at the levels that are not transparent and where we do not see all the prices being quoted.  I put that as a function of the regulator because one must have statutory powers to look for that information.  When I was in ComReg we used to publish a quarterly bulletin of the main statistics in the industry.  They were provided to us by the industry but we had to make sure that everyone provided them in a format that we could use and that was comparable so we did not get one format from one crowd and a different format from something else.  We had to be able to collate the statistics to make a coherent whole.  Mr. O'Leary made the point that it is important that farmers get this advice before signing the contracts.  The danger with all these things - and we see this to an extent in the existing grocery regulations - is that the imbalance is such that in the case of a big retailer and a small supplier, the retailer is the one with all the lawyers, the corporate staff and so on and it will go in and put a 300-page contract down on the table and say, \"Here is where you sign.\"  That is not a negotiation in any meaning of the word, so there must be people who know what their rights are in respect of the directives and, from our point of view, the kinds of producer organisations that are permitted by exemption from competition law under the latest round of the CMO regulation.  That kind of thing should help farmers to build scale and to be able to work together.<\/p> <p>  Then there is mediation and arbitration.  There will be rows and matters that will need to be sorted.  I made the point earlier that we are not an ombudsman and that we do not do that kind of work.  We take cases to court but we do so on behalf of the State, not on behalf of an individual.  We say, \"The law was broken here so, on behalf of the State, we are intervening.\"  However, this is not to get something back for particular consumers.  There is in some areas of consumer law a right to a compensation order but not in the competition law sphere.<\/p> <p>  Enforcement is a backstop because ultimately one must have a big stick.

Looking at the situation across the water, there is a lot of this.  There is the information, the adjudication and the investigations, and as we said in the statement, this costs &pound;2 million per year.  However, the scope is smaller.  Something like this proposal, as we said, would probably involve 40 people.  However, one would need a period of implementation and then escalation.  When we get new functions, as we do, we first build a common level of understanding across a particular sector in order that everyone understands the rules.  We spend probably a year or two doing that, after which everyone knows the rules.  Then we start into the enforcement side of it, so this kind of regulatory model is something that is done over a period.  The difficulty with this directive, though, is that it is hugely complex in what it allows.  Ten areas are blacklisted such as payment after 30 days or payment after 60 days.  Then one gets into a list of, I think, six areas that are called greylisted.  They are only allowed if they have been agreed in advance.  Again, each individual entity that will be under the onus of these regulations will have to understand what is and is not allowed.  This is a significant educational challenge and will take a couple of years to do.  Then there are issues such as mediation - who one goes to and what kind of information one needs before going to them.  Afterwards there is the idea of enforcement.  From our point of view, looking at this, we do not believe an impact analysis for Ireland has been carried out yet, so this is all still open to scrutiny, but one needs people in regional locations across the country.<\/p><p>They need to advise people on what is or is not allowed, and when there is a well-founded problem, who to go to and what can be offered in terms of mediation or redress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#Q01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>My question about mergers and acquisitions was not addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052800002#R00200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558998000,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I apologise.

The test is whether there is a substantial lessening of competition, and that involves looking at many factors, including the strength of buyers and sellers, as well as how much competition exists and might be introduced.  I am reluctant to say how many players would be enough because we and the European Commission do a lot of very detailed scrutiny on every merger that comes in.  There have been industries where what is called a four to three merger has been permitted, where, for example, there used to be four players and, say, the number one player buys the number four player.  That would be looked at differently from the number one player buying the number two player, because then the two strongest players would be coming together.

However, it would be worthwhile to recap on these differing roles and responsibilities to help inform our discussion this afternoon.  When it comes to capital spending and the procurement of individual capital projects, in accordance with Government policy and in compliance with the public spending code, I can summarise the position as follows.  I am responsible for setting the overall five-year multi-annual capital expenditure ceilings and for allocating these resources across different Departments.  My Department is also subsequently responsible for monitoring expenditure every month at departmental level against these agreed ceilings.  Decisions on how and where these allocations are then invested by individual Departments are a matter in the first instance for the relevant Minister, in line with the conditions of delegated sanction specified by my Department.<\/p> <p>  My Department maintains the national frameworks within which Departments operate and make their decisions to ensure appropriate accounting for, and value for money of, public expenditure.  These frameworks include the public financial procedures, the public spending code, and the national public procurement guidelines.  The management and delivery of individual projects, within allocation and in accordance with the relevant national frameworks such as the public spending code, public financial procedures, etc., is primarily the responsibility of the relevant individually responsible Minister.<\/p> <p>  The public spending code requires Departments and agencies to undertake an appropriate appraisal, such as cost-benefit analysis or cost-effectiveness analysis, on all expenditure proposals with an estimated value in excess of &euro;20 million.  This requires Departments to submit their appraisals for such projects to my Department for technical review with regard to the methodology used and to ensure compliance with the requirements of the public spending code.  Departments are further required under the public spending code to update project appraisals or cost-benefit analyses continually as the procurement process evolves and as actual tender costs, as opposed to cost estimates, become available.  My Department may be consulted to review such updated proposals technically, if necessary.  While my Department is not involved in the assessment of the tenders for individual projects, if it emerges that the cost of a project is not capable of being met within the agreed multi-annual capital allocation of the relevant procuring Department, then that Department must engage with my Department to explore how to proceed with regard to the project.<\/p> <p>  In the specific case of the national broadband plan, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is the sponsoring agency and the Government is the final sanctioning authority.  Where the Government is the sanctioning authority,  the public spending code makes it clear that the day-to-day oversight functions of the sanctioning authority revert to the relevant line Department, in this case the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The Government is then involved at major decision points.  My Department has engaged with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment throughout the process with regard to the economic appraisal of the national broadband plan.  The purpose of that engagement was to review technically the economic appraisal to ensure that the methodology used was robust and in compliance with the requirements of the public spending code.  There has also been ongoing engagement between the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and my Department in respect of the cost and affordability of the project, in particular once it emerged that the cost of the project was not capable of being funded within the allocation that had been made for the project in the national development plan.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the three specific issues that the committee has tabled for discussion today.  In terms of the impact on the national development plan, NDP, and other infrastructure projects, I have already indicated that I intend to provide the additional capital required to fund the additional cost of proceeding with the project.  This means that the decision to approve the appointment of the preferred bidder will have no repercussions for other planned projects within the national development plan.  No other projects will be delayed or rescheduled and no other changes will be made to the capital allocations for other projects, such as those set out in the national development plan, as a consequence of the Government&rsquo;s decision to proceed with the broadband plan.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the future budgetary impact, the current indications are that the additional requirements will be approximately &euro;200 million in 2021 and 2022, rising to &euro;300 million in 2023.  This will result in a disimprovement in the general Government balance of approximately 0.1% of both GDP and GNI* annually compared with the projections published as part of the stability programme update.  As the committee will be aware, projections for general government revenue and expenditure beyond 2023 have not yet been compiled by the Department of Finance.<\/p> <p>  Finally, regarding the risk associated with the project, I accept that there is risk associated with the decision the Government has made.  Rolling out a form of technology like this to 1 million of our citizens who live across the length and breadth of our country is an inherently complex activity and therefore one which must involve risk.  If it was not complex and if there was no risk involved, the private sector would already have delivered this.  While I accept that there is complexity and risk involved in the decision that has been taken, I believe that, on balance, this is the right course of action to take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#B00100","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>A number of Deputies have indicated.

It is many years overdue.  Many commitments, deadlines, and promises have been made but missed thereafter.  The cost, however, is far in excess of what was originally indicated.  When two bidders dropped out, there was an understanding on their part, I am sure, that the subvention was to be far less than it has turned out to be.  That in itself is not of great value to the taxpayer, in hindsight.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Donohoe, as Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is a senior member of the Government which approved this plan.  Having read through his submission, he seems to be indicating that it is a matter for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.  Fobbing it off to that Department in the absence of further questioning will not cut it, I am afraid.  It is perfectly fine for the Minister, or any other Minister, to challenge, to disagree with, or to question the advices that arrive on his desk, but in this instance, despite continued communications to the relevant Department, the Secretary General, in his final memorandum to Cabinet, outlined his serious concerns.  I am sure the Minister was well aware of those.  He was well aware that these concerns related to value for money, the cost-benefit analysis, the impact on the national development plan, projects to be forgone as a result, the unprecedented risk, and the plan's lack of compatibility with Project Ireland 2040.  For the Minister to counter that and for him to say that, on balance, he disagreed, where did he go to, who did he consult, and what advices countered that advice primarily for him to arrive at the conclusion he did?<\/p> <p>  I refer to some of the specifics.<\/p><p> In the first instance, notwithstanding our questions, if this project were to proceed and the contract were to be signed, we need clarity on aspects of it.  The State will enter into a contract with National Broadband Ireland.  According to the reply to a question I asked on 15 May, NBI comprises Granahan McCourt Dublin, Tetrad Corporation and McCourt Global.  The Minister or his Department has since clarified that McCourt Global is not a shareholder.  The Minister and his colleagues have said consistently that in the contract and the method by which the contract will be adhered to the risk is on NBI, not the State.  If that risk is called in, is he sure there is a lien on, for example, Tetrad Corporation?  If NBI folds, do the holding company or the shareholders walk away?  If they walk away, is that not a lien on the State?  That is not protecting the taxpayers' interests in the way in which the Minister and his colleagues have said they will be protected.<\/p><p> The other issues relate to the mammoth cost associated with this.  It is far in excess of what had been indicated over the past number of years.  The Minister said it will come from future revenues.  It is almost magic, a Freddie Mercury job.  The Minister has to be straight.  It is either capital projects forgone, as the Secretary General says, or not.  Where will the future revenue come from?  Will it be from corporation tax or new taxes?  If not from there, is it coming from current spending and what implications will it have for current spending?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#B00300","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>The Deputy has one minute left in his first round of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#C00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Yes.

That is why I am before the committee.  I am happy to answer all questions about it, both as Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  While it is true that under the public spending code line Departments are responsible for the implementation of their projects, the two portfolios I hold mean I am fundamentally involved in these matters and will answer all questions relating to them.<\/p> <p>  To give the context of how I will answer Deputy Cowen's questions, I formed the view that three particular decisions made by this and previous Governments have set the path to where we are today and the proposition we are now debating.  The first was the decision made 20 years ago to privatise Telecom &Eacute;ireann, the second was the decision to pursue 100% coverage and the third, which was made by those involved in the bidding process, is the preference for fibre optic technology.  Those three points are fundamental to understanding the decision the Government will make when we go to sign the contract.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy put three questions to me.  Who did I meet in forming my view on this?  I met nobody beyond officials in my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  My diary is published every few weeks.  It contains everything in respect of this and all the meetings I have.  All the engagement I had with this matter was confined to my two Departments and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  That engagement was intensive, extensive and over a long period.<\/p> <p>  On the second question, my view was formed by a document that was published as part of the information I released in the aftermath of the decision being made.  It is the options analysis.  It went through every other option that the Government or any of the Deputies might put forward to find alternative ways of delivering the national broadband plan.  I formed the view that each of the options available would have incurred either significant delay in the process or additional risk, crucially, would not have delivered the 100% coverage and would have raised further issues regarding cost certainty in the future.  All of those considerations led me back to the conclusion I made which is, I believe, on balance the option that is available to us and the one I recommended to the Government.  I went through every other option at great length over the past six to nine months.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the risk that exists and how that will be managed, I am confident that the nature of the agreement that is open to the Government to sign finds a way of managing that risk.  I say that for two reasons.  The fact that the potential contribution of the State is capped and is up to a certain figure is profoundly relevant to the decision the Government might make.  In any situation in which risk could occur in respect of either roll-out, implementation, take-up or impingement on the coverage area, the fact that our exposure is capped is fundamental to why I believe, on balance, this should be done.<\/p> <p>  With regard to how this will be paid for, I acknowledged in my opening statement that there are options available to us for how it will be done.  It is worth pointing out that the highest cost of this is liable to the State at the point at which our surplus is due to be growing.  There will, therefore, be options open to the Government of the day, including me now, regarding how to recommend paying for it.  I will provide my views in that regard in both the summer economic statement and on budget day.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude by emphasising the point of risk.  In all the Deputy's calculations about how to do this, and the views he may form on how to do it, covering 540,000 homes and 83% of the country with new infrastructure is inherently risky.  I invite those who disagree with the recommendation we have made to examine the options I have rejected and outline why they think they are better.  I will engage with the Deputy in this committee over the course of this process and answer his questions about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#C00700","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>My question was not answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#C00800","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>If there is a specific question that was not answered, the Deputy can state it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#C00900","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>There are two.

I am concerned about the disparity between the view of the Secretary General and the Minister.  Earlier the Minister stated, \"No other projects will be delayed or rescheduled and no other changes will be made to the capital allocations for other projects, such as those set out in the [NDP]\" and that \"the decision to approve the appointment of the preferred bidder will have no repercussions for other planned projects within the national development plan\".  However, the advice of his Department to the Minister runs completely counter to that and talks about being unable to recommend the project to proceed for reasons of cost, the impact it would have on the national development plan, the affordability of what has been proposed, the fact that there was a lack of competition; the reputational damage it would do to the country; and the risks for the State, including emerging technologies.  I suppose, most importantly for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, his Secretary General pointed out that there is a risk to the perception of the economic competence of the country and the Government.  In essence, he went on to say that for the current national broadband plan to proceed a number of other key projects within the national development plan would have to be delayed or deferred and the list ranges from primary schools to the Dunkettle interchange to primary care centres.  I am referring to the advice that the Secretary General of the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform gave to the Minister.  I ask the Minister to explain the gap between his advice and the Minister's decision?  I ask because the Minister took responsibility for the decision today when he said that he recommended this option.  The Minister recommended this option against the advice of his Secretary General and, therefore, it is reasonable to ask why is the Secretary General still a Secretary General if the Minister went against such significant advice on such a significant project?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#D00900","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I shall deal with each of the points in turn.

If one looks at the final recommendation that was made to me, and it is a recommendation that is covered off in the document there, it is a lower-cost option.  That lower-cost option does not deliver 100% coverage and involves different uses of technology.  Had the Government and I made that decision, we would now be involved in an appearance here at this committee regarding the number of people who had been left behind and why we had used a technology that might not be the most resilient one in the future.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the final point on why my Secretary General is still the Secretary General, and I work so closely with him, is because I value independent and strong advice.  We nearly always agree.  We do not always agree, as is the case with a Minister and any Department with which he or she works but that is the way we should be making decisions about major projects now.  I can understand completely why Deputy Lahart is scrutinising why I made my decision and I am doing my best to answer his questions.

The Minister referred to projected growth but we are also aware of risks including the corporation tax yield from multinational companies and Brexit.  The projected growth may not work out.  A reply to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, on 21 May said that it was estimated that the national broadband plan would cost &euro;200 million in 2021, an additional &euro;200 million in 2022, &euro;200 million in 2023 and so on.  The Department estimated that the additional cost of &euro;1.6 billion until the end of the term of the national development plan in 2027.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said that he intends \"to provide the additional capital required to fund the additional cost of proceeding with the project\" in his opening statement.  That is the context.  I assume he is saying that the taxpayer will provide the additional capital.  Will he confirm that additional capital will be transferred from the Exchequer to NBI and the private bidder, Granahan McCourt or whatever new name is attached to the entity, if it changes once again, having changed several times in the period since I have followed this project?  The Minister needs to clear this up, as I have not heard a convincing answer.  One can only spend money once.  I have never had &euro;100 or &pound;100 old pounds in my pocket that I was able to spend twice.  I do not know of any business, county council or Department that can spend money twice.  It can only be spent once.  An indicative list of projects will be cut to fund the broadband plan, including roads projects, primary care centres, and schools.  Can the Minister confirm that the transfer of money will happen and where he will get it from?  He is going to have to do one of two things - to cut the capital projects and forget about them, or increase some form of taxation, whether direct or indirect, but most likely the former.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister has confirmed that Granahan McCourt will only invest &euro;180 million up front in equity capital, which was originally set out in the released memorandums by the Secretary General, Robert Watt,.  Many of us, particularly members of the communication committee, thought that it would be at least 50:50.  That is &euro;180 million in private equity while the State puts up &euro;2 billion for a project it will not even own.  Robert Watt wrote in his memorandum that by 2028 the private operator will have all its moneys paid back while the Exchequer will have paid out almost &euro;2.5 billion.  The contract is due to be signed by the end of the year with deployment to begin in 12 months, which is the end of next year, and the full deployment to be finished by 2027.  By then Granahan McCourt could have flipped the business and sold itself off.  According to the documents we have seen, by then the scheme could be fully rolled out and the entity sold off.  Does the Minister believe that represents sound use of public funds?  It is very high risk.<\/p> <p>  The reason for going with the gap funding model - and if I have heard it once, I have heard it a thousand times from the Minster and his Cabinet colleagues - was competitiveness.  That competitiveness is gone.  An auctioneer who is selling something and finds himself or herself with a gavel in his or her hand and only one bidder does not have the edge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#E00800","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to finish up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#E00900","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to deal with this issue and the fact that taxpayers are front-loading the funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#E01000","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>On the gap funding model and the front-loading from the tax payers, the key is that we are seeking to expand a broadband network, where we do not own the current network.  The fundamental factor which made the gap funding model the appropriate one to take is that we are looking to extend an asset which is not currently owned by the State.  If we were looking to create an asset to deliver 100% coverage, we would have to build it and then own it.  That would cost more than what I, on balance, think is the preferable option open to us and open up a new set of risks and challenges as we go down the planning process and look to put new infrastructure in place.  That is why the rental or concession model we are using is the best way to move forward.<\/p> <p>  The State's money is being front-loaded because the delivery of the infrastructure is also being front-loaded.  We have faced the charge, which is understandable from the Deputy's perspective and that of people who seek broadband, that there is a delay.  There is disappointment that it will take up to seven years to get to the 100,000 homes per annum after the first year where we will build up to that.<\/p><p>The reason the investment is front-loaded is that the delivery of the infrastructure is at the start of the 25-year period with the balance of that period being used to maintain it with a further ten years after that.  <\/p><p> The Deputy is right that the equity contribution is up to &euro;222 million but the overall cost of this project will be in the realm of &euro;5 billion so there is a further &euro;2 billion that the consortium will need to provide in order to deliver all of this and our contribution is capped at &euro;3 billion with a possibility, although not one I am going to commit to in front of the committee today, that the cost will come in below that as we work our way through the different phases of the delivery of this.  <\/p><p> Regarding the Deputy's point about transfer of money, it is transfer of money but it happens retrospectively.  At the end of each period, if the broadband has been expanded, the consortium gets paid and if the contract is not delivered, it incurs penalties and-or does not get paid.  Is it paid for doing this?  Yes, it is paid via a subsidy.  Why does it need a subsidy?  It is because the private market will not deliver 100% coverage.  The subsidy is delivered retrospectively with many different clawback mechanisms in place.  <\/p><p> With regard to the corporation tax piece, the great risk of corporation tax is that one relates corporation tax to day-to-day current expenditure.  As I said in response to Deputy Lahart, current expenditure is growing at 4% per year.  We have massively increased capital expenditure and corporation tax has played a big role in paying for that in addition to dealing with the difficulty I have had with a Department over the past number of years.  Even routing that in, the growth in current expenditure is 4%.  I go back to the point made by Deputy Stanley.  We are looking at extending an asset we do not currently own.  The question therefore arises as to why we would want to own something if it is adjacent to something that is in private ownership.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#E01100","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Could I just ask for clarification on something?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#F00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>One small point of clarification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#F00300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Obviously, the Minister cannot magic up income to fund capital spending.

Because we are running a surplus this year of 0.2% of national income that, even with the risk we have built in, is due to rise next year and the years beyond that to well in excess of 0.5%, there are options open to the Government.  Yes, we could make the decision to pay for it through taxation revenue that has been collected but I emphasise that the revenue forecasts are not done by me.  They are done by the Department of Finance.  Of course, there is then the choice regarding the level of surplus we run across that period.  I would make the point that once we have paid for this, it is then paid for for a 35-year period and unlike current expenditure, does not become a recurring year-on-year cost.  The huge difficulty is when one commits oneself to current commitments that are recurring and that one cannot get out of without great pain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#F00700","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for attending.

I refer to all the costs of renewing and maintaining the network and dealing with all the things that could happen when expanding a broadband network across 83% of our country.

The point I have made in the media a couple of times when addressing this topic is that the rolling out of broadband is regularly compared to the electrification of Ireland.  When electrification occurred, people at the time thought it was simply to bring light into their houses.  Nobody could have envisaged the many uses for electricity down the line.  To my mind, high-speed broadband &mdash; fibre broadband &mdash; is exactly the same.  We will have uses that will be crucial to how we live our lives in the very near future but that we cannot yet envisage.  We are very quickly moving from a position in which high-speed fibre broadband is seen as a luxury.  It is becoming a necessity.  Just as we would not consider living in a house without electricity, very soon we will not dream of living in a house without high-speed broadband.  Therefore, we are not far off from a position in which, if the deficit in rural Ireland is not addressed, those concerned will move out of rural areas into larger towns and cities where they can access the service.  This will have a knock-on impact on everything we are trying to do to achieve balanced regional development.  It fundamentally boils down to whether one believes in a person's inherent right to live in rural areas or a rural one-off house.  I believe people in rural areas are entitled to the same standard of living as those in our larger urban conurbations.<\/p> <p>  Could the Minister outline the role of his Department in the early part of this process in respect of the procurement element?

Did the Minister make inquiries as to where the senior civil servants in the line Department were when these social contacts were under way?  Anyone who has read the ministerial handbook would literally be very shocked at some of the revelations which were made.<\/p> <p>  This remains a fear factor underlining this project.  In other words, in the conviviality of a social-type occasion, basically, would the State get taken for a ride?  Obviously, at times, people on the commercial side can be very charming, very compelling and one can get carried away.  If they are millionaires and billionaires, then the people acting on the other side in a Government context could risk being anxious to please.  Did any of that concern the Minister in terms of propriety?<\/p> <p>  The Minister referenced Eircom.  The fact is that as a financial project which was initiated by a previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government to a great fanfare of excitement, that investment in the financial model has been flipped over and over again, and is currently being flipped again.  Therefore, my second question is, what is to prevent those who have been identified as the investors in the project from flipping the investment once that investment has been established?  The nature of State risk in regard to public private partnerships, or parallels to public private partnerships, is that if one has a private investment in something that is a public good, and we have heard a lot of discussion of the importance of this public good, then the State cannot, in the event of the investment being flipped or the investment failing, suddenly close the public good.  It cannot close the hospital, it cannot close the road and I put it to the Minister that it cannot close the broadband network because that would be unacceptable to citizens.  Therefore, while the conversation is about risk being transferred to the private investor, the reality is quite different.<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister have a figure for the total amount spent on consultancy to date?  We have heard reference to a whole host of different kinds of studies, value for money reviews, cost-benefit analyses and so on.<\/p><p>Can he give us a broad cost figure for the consultancy?  How has he satisfied himself ultimately, as the lead decision-maker and adviser to his colleagues in Cabinet, that the risks are acceptable?  How has he guarded against what happened with Eircom and what may very well happen with this, at which point the people of Ireland will be captives of a financial model that is very crude but very effective for the investors?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#J01800","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":221,"content":"<p>To respond to the Deputy's first question, the ministerial handbook and its implementation is a matter for the Minister of the day and the Taoiseach.  As Deputy Burton knows, the circumstances were that the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, resigned and ceased to hold office after a number of issues regarding this process developed around a year ago.  In answering the Deputy's question as to whether this was influenced in any way, the key thing is the investigation commissioned by the Department of the Taoiseach by Mr. Peter Smyth into what happened.  That report concluded that no inappropriate influence took place.  I remind the Deputy that the process up to that point had been going on for approximately six years, led by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, with huge safeguards around it.  I know that the Secretary General of that Department was before his own committee when this issue developed to give assurances regarding the integrity of the process, which I accept.  I also accept the Smyth report into the issues to which the Deputy referred and I believed it was appropriate that Deputy Naughten resigned at that point in order to allow this process to go forward.<\/p> <p>  To respond to the understandable questions she has put to me about the protections available to the State in respect of change of ownership, throughout this entire ownership period the Minister can terminate the agreement.  There are a couple of different levels in this regard.  The first is that the contract makes clear that there is an absolute prohibition on a change of ownership in respect of the contract to what would be described as an unsuitable third party.  That power is available to the Minister.  The Minister's consent is then required at different points in this process regarding the sale or shares of ownership regarding the consortium.  This is laid out in the contract.  As for citizens being held captive by this, with respect, that is overstating it.  If this works, which I believe it will, we are talking about citizens who will have access to broadband which they do not have at present and providing a service to citizens that the private sector will not provide.  One area on which I do agree with the Deputy is what has happened with Eircom, whereby we have seen the organisation change ownership on many different occasions.  Again, when that decision was made, I could see merit in it.  Having now been in this role for a number of years, I think the Government of which Deputy Burton and I were members was wise not to make sales of any assets at that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#K00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":222,"content":"<p>May I ask a further very brief question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#K00300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>A very brief question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#K00400","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Does the Minister know whether Mr. Smyth - another report - spoke to Frank McCourt, who was in New York city at that time as well?

If I hear him rightly, he is sort of acknowledging that the privatisation of Eircom has landed us in this situation and that the fact that much of the broadband network is already privatised means that even though we are not in a good situation, we must now continue with the privatisation process because it would not make sense to have one part public and one part private.  He also seems to be saying this would minimise the risk for the State.  This is a very peculiar logic that does not really stand up.  First, do we not carry all the risk regardless?  This consortium could unravel or fall apart, the people involved might just decide they will not make enough money out of this or there might not be enough take-up, and we will end up holding the baby.  The only risk the consortium is taking on is the &euro;175 million, so we are in any event taking all the risk, and all the upside is for the consortium.  We pay &euro;3 billion; it pays &euro;200 million.  If things go well, it owns the asset; if things go badly, we hold the baby.  Why on earth would we not use our investment to guarantee that we have the asset at the end of this?  It would not really be a risk for us in that sense if we did it that way because we need the thing.  It is only a risk because these people are in it for money.  If the consortium cannot make money, its investment could fall apart.  Is it not also, by the way, very unusual that the consortium that has been given this is not even the original consortium?  It is evidence before our eyes that the original Granahan McCourt consortium was different, involving different people, who then pulled out, and that this consortium could also unravel.  I just cannot see the logic of persisting with this.  The Minister's own Secretary General is saying precisely all this.  I just find it rather bizarre.<\/p> <p>  My other question concerns the National Broadband Ireland board.  The Minister says there will be someone be on the board to look after the public interest, but did we not have this with the national children's hospital board?  There was supposed to be someone on that board looking after the public interest and they did not because the collegiality and confidentiality of the board trumped their accountability to the Government, the Department and so on.  What reason do we have for believing that exactly the same thing will not happen again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#K00800","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>The key level of risk here is not the desire on the part of anyone to earn a profit; it is the fact that we are talking about expanding an expensive asset to 1.1 million people who do not currently have access to it and to whom the private sector is unlikely to supply it.  The fundamental factor in all this is whether we want to move away from 100% coverage.  This has a very big effect on how much this will cost.  To my mind, having worked on this now for quite a while, I believe that is the decision we need to evaluate.  I believe a commitment to 100% coverage is understandable in the context of what will happen with public services in the future, but that is where the risk emerges from.  Deputy Boyd Barrett may feel it is better for the State to carry all that risk.<\/p><p>There is benefit in that risk being capped.  That is why, having weighed all the pros and cons, this is the safest way forward for us.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked the difference between this and the national children's hospital.  The fundamental difference is we will be making a decision on this with all the cost, complexity and options now available.  We have a tendered cost.  The contract will be signed with the tendered cost known and the contingency structure in place.  That is different from what happened with the national children's hospital where, as a result of the two-stage planning process, a decision was made to go ahead and, as the Deputy is well aware, the cost is now different from what was anticipated.<\/p><p> On the role of the person on the board, I will be making sure that, and working with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to ensure that, the person on the board will have very clear duties to perform and that he or she will be very clear about what he or she will need to do on the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019052800002#K00900","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":230,"content":"<p>The Minister has not really answered the question.

There is also the question of value of fibre optic technology in future.  These are all significant issues and risks that somebody else will now have to manage.

The issue which generated this invitation to attend the meeting and to make a written submission is the matter of the recruitment and retention of social workers.  In the published Tusla business plan 2017 there were 1,472.75 whole-time equivalent, WTE, social work posts recorded.  Of those WTE posts, 8% were vacant, generating 4,282 cases awaiting social worker allocation.<\/p><p>Of the whole-time equivalent posts, 8% were vacant, generating 4,282 cases awaiting social worker allocation, 654 of which were deemed high priority.  Based on an accepted norm of a running caseload of 15 cases per social worker, the deficit identified amounted to a minimum of 285 whole-time equivalent social workers.  This situation has not improved in the intervening period.  We have sent, as an appendix to this statement, a submission which was made to F&oacute;rsa by the union's social work professional committee within Tusla which outlines the views directly held by social workers regarding reasons for difficulty in retention of social workers.  Common themes outlined directly by social workers include child protection work having become increasingly complex and more demanding, which places increased levels of stress on individual social workers, including the younger cohort of social workers who enter the system, many of whom by that stage do not yet carry high-demand family responsibilities.  As social workers become more experienced, there is a correlation between work demands and increased family pressures.  An overwhelming percentage of social workers are female and find it increasingly difficult to achieve the level of work-life balance to cope with these added pressures.  In addition, given the percentage of female employees in social work, it is inevitable that there will be large tranches of both maternity and parental leave.  While this is, of course, a most welcome condition of employment, the problem arises when the replacement and backfilling strategies are both cumbersome and unproductive.  This is clearly evidenced by the number of unallocated cases, previously cited.<\/p><p> Many young social workers who enter into the workforce are immediately challenged by the demanding nature of the post of child protection social worker.  Typically, these would be college graduates in the early to mid-20s age range, who opt to travel, as an example, at a time in life when there is a better opportunity to so do.  Unlike nursing or medicine, there is no real requirement to emigrate as far as Australia to gain experience in the area of career development.  The proximity of the NHS in the UK affords an opportunity for short-term emigration without too much upheaval to gain experience in the universally accessible and more attractive health and social care system.<\/p><p> The career pathway for social workers has not been examined for more than 15 years, in spite of the much-changed environment and landscape of child protection in that time.  Innovative ways need to be found to provide a gateway for college entrants to choose social work as a profession.  On entry into the workforce, this gateway must be developed into a pathway whereby social workers can see the prospect of career progression as their levels of experience grow.  Automatic advancement from basic grade to senior grade social worker based on protocols and checkpoints would provide a clear vision of career development at little or no cost to the State as those levels of posts already exist in the system.  In addition, having garnered years of experience, it is not uncommon for a social worker to excel in a particular area of expertise.  The State, therefore, would greatly benefit from converting this specialist expertise into a model of advanced practitioner working.  To complete the journey, this expertise and experience can be of further benefit if imported into posts which have responsibility for service planning and delivery.<\/p><p> Due to the cumbersome nature of the recruitment processes, a market has been created for the use of agency staff.  Therefore, a young social worker can choose to register with an agency and be assigned to work in a particular area.  This has potential for a twofold negative on the system in that, first, the agency social worker is not committed to a durable post and is not tied down to it and, second, working conditions are much looser in areas such as pension contributions and so on.  In Ireland, there is an increasing blame culture on the rise.  Tusla, as an institution, has been a headline victim of this culture in recent years.  It is not unusual to hear calls to have Tusla disbanded in the wake of a particular child protection controversy.  This undoubtedly places a stigma upon the workforce at all levels, most notably upon the social worker who is at the very centre of child protection work.<\/p><p> By nature, a high percentage of child protection and social work issues in society are spread throughout urban areas.  The associated costs of living in urban areas, which is reaching crisis point in this country, is restricting the attraction of social work as a career of choice.  A formalised exit interview system must be used to analyse properly the reasons that such a relatively high percentage of social workers choose to leave Tusla.  Additionally, the change management culture in a relative new organisation like Tusla can often be driven as a priority reaction to negative media and public comment.  It is often non-inclusive and creates additional demands on social workers without any sharing of a common vision.<\/p><p> The committee's invitation to this meeting also asked for real-life experiences of social workers.<\/p><p>I have a short anonymous statement from a social worker who is a couple of years in the system.  The social worker is of the type or generation close to entry to the workforce whom I have spoken about.

If there are any questions, Mr. Cantillon has the working experience to be able to deal with them.<\/p><blockquote>From having worked as a child protection social worker in the past number of years, there are several issues that I believe have contributed to the difficulties that social workers face on a day-to-day basis.  There has been a great deal of change in the past 24 months with regard to the restructuring of the child protection sector within Tusla.  Married with this, there has been a change with our approach to working with children and families to the Signs of Safety framework.  Below are prevalent issues for social workers.<br \/><br \/>The threshold of risk varies in different offices and counties.  Therefore, assessments and decisions vary depending on teams.  This makes it difficult when receiving cases previously unknown to social work involvement and for plans being put in place with families.<br \/><br \/>The nature of child protection services presents difficulties.  We need evidence before an action or plan is put in place.  Therefore, preventative intervention is lost and social workers are working with families through risk management as opposed to a supportive approach to bring about long-term positive change.  This creates families understandably putting blocks to social work intervention.<br \/><br \/>There is no clear guidance on procedures on founded or unfounded allegations for social workers.  Safety planning is often not completed with families where allegations are retracted, often through coercion.  This is despite concerns remaining for the children and families due to evidence no longer having weight because of retraction.<br \/><br \/>The fast-paced nature of child protection work and high caseloads block social workers from completing therapeutic direct work with families and children, resulting in social workers relying on outside services to undertake work that guides our assessment.  This can be a costly and time-consuming process.<br \/><br \/>Working with children and families takes time as does relationship building and meaningful engagement from social workers and families.  Given the availability of social workers this is not always achievable, as mentioned, due to high caseloads.<br \/><br \/>Staff retention is an issue within Tusla at present.  Therefore, staff turnover frequently results in teams being unstable and inconsistent.  Often this leaves teams low on numbers resulting in social workers taking on colleagues' cases as well as their own.  It proves difficult when emergencies occur with families with whom social workers are not familiar especially regarding safety planning and interventions.  Although Children First guidelines aim to put statutory obligations on professionals and members of the public to identify and report child protection concerns, in practice this is still a major difficulty facing social workers on a day-to-day basis.  There appears to be a lack of consequences for those not upholding their statutory obligations.<br \/><br \/>As noted, interventions are based on concerns being evidenced.  Drug use and alcoholism are only detected through positive screening or by client disclosure.  My experience is that clients are not often open about their addiction and therefore social workers rely on co-operation of general practitioners or screenings carried out by addiction services to carry out drug screenings.  However, there is major difficulty at present with GPs refusing to undertake such screenings, therefore causing difficulties to social workers in identifying substance misuse and addressing the risk that it poses to children.  There is no statutory obligation or guidance for GPs to work with social workers in place with regard to urine analysis.<br \/><br \/>The fostering department is currently having major difficulty with sourcing and keeping appropriate foster carers.  Foster carers have reported to social workers under the child protection theme to the effect that they believe they have not received adequate training or preparation to care for children who often present with high needs and behaviours.  Such needs are difficult for inexperienced carers to manage.  This lack of training and support often results in placement breakdowns.  This is problematic for children who have come into the care system, often experiencing instability or inconsistent care.  They may continue to experience this in the care of Tusla.  Furthermore as a social worker in child protection much of my work with children in care involves supporting the foster carers, but this is not my role.  The fostering department is extremely busy at present and does not appear available to provider carers with the day-to-day support that foster carers require, resulting in the child's social worker carrying out this work.  Furthermore, I have concerns regarding the efficiency of foster care assessments being carried out since I have had significant concerns regarding foster carers with whom vulnerable children are placed.  While I can appreciate that foster placements are scarce I would have concerns regarding foster carers being passed by committees but who are not able to meet the emotional needs of children.  Furthermore, there does not appear to be a functioning placement matching process in place to identify appropriate placement matches for children to foster carers and it is seen as trial and error.  Finally there is a significant backlog of children-in-care cases transferring from child protection to children-in-care teams due to understaffing in the children-in-care teams.  This results in social workers and the child protection team holding a children-in-care caseload as well as child protection.<\/blockquote> <p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to make this statement.

In the Dublin region there is a particular difficulty in sourcing foster care placements for children, which has led to placements being sourced through private agencies down the country.  Social workers are finding placements for children from the Dublin region in Wexford, Kilkenny, Munster and even Donegal.  Responsibility for each case remains with the social worker in Dublin, despite the child being placed in Donegal or Wexford, etc..  The social worker has to visit the young person involved while their caseload remains the same as if the child had been placed in Dublin.  Social workers from Dublin are travelling across the country to meet the children for whom they are responsible but this is not reflected in a reduction in their caseload, even though these visits may wipe out an entire day or even more than that.  This places particular difficulties on social workers in Dublin and many colleagues have told me they cannot do it any more.  Their work day begins early in the morning when they have to travel to meet young people in Donegal, Cavan or Westmeath; I had to go to Wexford and across the midlands under the caseload I had to manage.  One ends up spending half a day for a short meeting with a young person's school and yet one has all the other cases to deal with as well, which makes it particularly difficult for social workers.<\/p> <p>  The children-in-care teams manage caseloads of children who are in foster care but there are difficulties in the recruitment of social workers, and there are not enough of them.  When a child protection concern comes in and a child is identified as needing to go into care, the duty or child protection team is meant to take responsibility almost instantaneously but there are no social workers to do that so the children have to remain in the caseload of the social workers at the duty end of the house.  Those workers carry huge responsibility for assessing the cases coming in and carrying those cases when they should be on another team.  Significant stress and pressure are being put on individual social workers to manage this as a result of the difficulty in recruiting social workers.<\/p> <p>  Other areas of social work also have high case loads but those in child protection are unmanageable because of the lack of staff.  In May and June every year, the local social work departments speak with the new university graduates and everybody who wants to come into Tusla is recruited at that point.  By September or October, this pool of people has dried up and another cohort of experienced social workers have left, while those who started in May or June begin to leave.  By Christmas there is usually nobody available to fill vacancies and we have to wait until the following June or July to fill them from the new round of graduates.  The cycle is exhausting for social workers because they have to carry the burden of all the additional cases, which are unallocated at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019052800002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Cantillon"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>A couple of questions arise from Mr. Donnelly's opening statement.

The reason it is of benefit is that one can identify particular areas of critical need and match them up with particular areas of experience and expertise.  They can be matched up.  That is the model.  I always say that if one wants to attract people into a career, one first has to make it attractive but once that gateway is opened, one needs to create a pathway.  Nobody is going to stay in a career that has no pathway.  Part of that pathway is advancing to a more senior level but a critical part is for someone to be able to say they have developed a range of experiences, to know what he or she is good at, what their area of expertise is, and that there is a societal need to deliver it.  That is the model and that is where the best is extracted from people.  Mr. Cantillon might be able to advance on that but that is my concept of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019052800002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Donnelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558998000,"counter":336,"content":"<p>In terms of the advanced practitioner role, there is a greater responsibility to go to court and to fulfil statutory needs within child protection social work than in other areas of social work.  There is a huge amount of responsibility and the gaze of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on the work of both individual social workers and teams, is almost continuous.  Experienced social workers have left to go to other areas of social work, and the reality on the ground is that the overwhelming majority of social workers in child protection teams, particularly in the Dublin area, only have a few years experience.  The more experienced workers have either left or moved down the country.  We end up in a situation where the team's experience might only be a few years old; they do not have the experience of decades that one would hope for across a functioning team that is nurturing its workers as they move through it.  It is about capturing the experience one gains from having worked in a field for a long time and rewarding people for their expertise, saying we recognise that expertise by creating a grade which reflects the level of expertise and value a person brings to a team.  Senior roles have been created in other areas of social work which have allowed people to advance from their grades into other areas without going through a separate recruitment process.  That makes those other roles in social work more attractive to people, as well as the fact that they carry less responsibility and are not under a constant public gaze.  Social workers welcome the work of HIQA in identifying flaws and failures in the system, but we sometimes feel we are being assessed in a situation where we do not have the resources to solve problems, because we do not have the staff coming in and are not able to retain the expertise that would allow us to produce or provide the best service we possibly could.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019052800002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Cantillon"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Mr. Donnelly referenced the pathway a couple of times saying it would benefit the system, but he also mentioned that it would have little or no cost to the State.

In some areas, social workers are told there is an expectation that they would reduce their mileage as a mechanism to save money.<\/p><p> On mileage and other areas, staff are told they cannot use a taxi, for example, to transport a young person because it costs money.  All these factors add to the difficulty of doing the job.  One ends with circumstances in which staff sometimes feel they have responsibility to visit a young person but cannot use the easiest mechanism to get to the placement while doing all the work they are expected to do.  A resource issue on a wider level creates a lot of difficulty.<\/p><p> In some parts of Tusla, social workers end up doing a lot of administration work and carrying out many roles that are actually social care roles.  We end up in circumstances in which, because there is a lack of social care workers, whose grade and profession is separate from that of social worker, social workers end up taking responsibility for the supervision and facilitation of family access and contact.  This adds to the stress attached to the social worker role.  Social workers are now not just responsible for managing the case and the care planning; they are also responsible for bringing children to placements and collecting them afterwards.  The social worker might have to collect a child placed in Wexford, for example, bring that child to Dublin to see his or her parents and then drive him or her back to Wexford afterwards.  In essence, one is making four trips in the day.  One must, therefore, go up and down twice to make sure the young person sees his or her family.  We want the children to see their families, which is important, but because we do not have the support staff to help us carry out the functions, social workers end up feeling they have to do everything.  In addition, a lack of administrative staff in many departments has led to circumstances in which social workers are doing practically all their own filing.  In many offices, there is no support to help with filing because there are not enough administration staff.   I realise there is a public perception that there are too many administrative staff in the HSE and Tusla but the experience of social workers on the ground is that this is not true.  We need the support of our colleagues in administration.  We just need more of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019052800002#J01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Cantillon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>As a matter of interest, does Mr. Donnelly know the administrative staff whole-time equivalent in Tusla?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019052800002#K00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558998000,"counter":352,"content":"<p>No, but the figure for administrative staff generally runs at about 11%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019052800002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Donnelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>It just interests me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019052800002#K00400","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558998000,"counter":354,"content":"<p>It would not be greatly different from the HSE figure.

For 20 years, I have advised on financial institution risk in London and globally.  I wrote books on risk measurement and financial instruments and trained more than 100 bank regulators globally.  I gave evidence to two UK House of Commons inquiries.<\/p> <p>  I am joined by Mr. Tim Bush, a former member of the Urgent Issues Task Force, UITF, of the then UK and Ireland Accounting Standards Board.  The UITF examined whether proposed accounting standards complied with company law.  In 2010, Mr. Bush warned that the impairment accounting rule used by British and Irish banks was not in line with company law.  This year, after nine years, the accounting profession and the Financial Reporting Council confirmed that the standards did not fit with the law.  The law is concerned with accounts underpinning what is known as capital maintenance, which includes capital solvency.<\/p> <p>  At the 2015 Oireachtas bank inquiry, Irish bankers incorrectly claimed that, by law, they had to conceal losses and claimed that a new accounting standard would resolve this.<\/p><p>It will not do so.  Rather, it could lead to bigger problems.  Among the problems created are subsidies to vulture funds.  Some banks claim they profited from loan sales to vulture funds, but this is extremely unlikely.  Thanks to flawed accounting standards, banks can bury loan write downs into reserves and thus record an artificial accounting profit.  These transactions are potentially illegal if the true subsidy is concealed.  The matter was addressed in an article headlined, &quot;Questions raised over AIB &euro;1.1 bn problem loans sale&quot; published on 4 November last year by the <i>Financial Times<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>A further problem is insurance against past losses.  Irish banks were not solvent on the night of the September 2008 guarantee.  Unlike the Government, the ECB was aware of this, yet it insisted that the Government should pay for these hidden losses.  Under EU law, the Government is not liable.  Indeed, the cancellation of the promissory notes may be illegal.<br\/><br\/>Liquidity difficulties are another potential problem.  If banks conceal their losses, it becomes impossible to borrow money.  Today, banks continue to conceal losses which make borrowing difficult and expensive, a cost borne by current Irish mortgagors.<br\/><br\/>Asset stripping is another problem.  One UK bank with operations in Ireland may have pushed small but healthy businesses into liquidation by calling in loans unnecessarily, a matter on which evidence was given to the committee by a group of small business owners.  The actions of the bank were partly motivated by flawed bank bonuses and incentive schemes.  Anthony Stansfeld, police commissioner for Thames Valley in the UK, expressed concern at similar practices in the UK and claimed that the problem is widespread, advising those affected to read the Project Turnbull report which was produced by a bank whistleblower.<br\/><br\/>A new accounting standard could also lead to abuses of company law.  Some years ago, a well-known company was able to split its assets into two separate companies.  Investors could recognise substantial profits from the property of the company while staff and creditors were shunted into another company and were unpaid, contrary to the spirit of company law.<br\/><br\/>On pension and reputation, the recent collapses of London Capital &amp;amp; Finance, Patisserie Valerie and Carillion caused havoc for those in private sector pensions in the UK.  Kevin Hollinrake, MP, called for an inquiry into compensating investors.<br\/><br\/>On rights issue problems, it is difficult to see how banks can approach shareholders and investors for additional funds if they are not disclosing all of their losses.  Company law prevents innocent shareholders from being burdened with losses that were concealed when they made the investment.<br\/><br\/>On subsidised loans, the accounting profession may have exploited accounting standards to conceal subsidies given to developers, a matter which Deputy Catherine Murphy attempted to investigate.  There is a risk that IBRC exploited the accounting standards when measuring these subsidies.<br\/><br\/>As regards a solution, a House of Commons report published in April, entitled &quot;The Future of Audit&quot;, concluded that banks concealing losses are potentially breaking the law and that advice by the various accounting bodies, including a legal opinion they commissioned, is incorrect.  Under the capital maintenance rules, banks are not allowed to pay dividends out of capital, as confirmed by the AssetCo <i>v<\/i>. Grant Thornton LLP 2019 case law.  Mr. Bush presented this at a House of Lords inquiry in 2010 and, on behalf of the UK Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, obtained a legal opinion from George Bompas QC which set out the law in a way which indicates that some witness statements given to the Irish banking inquiry were incorrect.  The aforementioned AssetCo High Court case confirmed this interpretation of the law. <br\/><br\/>We strongly suggest that bankers who appear before the committee should be asked to restate their published accounts to comply with the law.  If they do so, banks will have to reveal that they were insolvent at the time of the guarantee and, as a result, the ECB loans will have to be reclassified as capital.  This would automatically resolve the legality surrounding the repayment of promissory notes and, more important, reveal the huge subsidies given to various vulture funds.  It would also reveal the extent of asset stripping that forced many Irish businesses into failure.  If the banks fail to do so, they will have to provide a legal opinion stating that the report of the House of Commons report is wrong and so is the recent admission by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, ICAEW, that it gave flawed advice on the concealment of losses.  Under Irish company law, it remains a criminal offence to misreport the financial position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Butler","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558998000,"counter":457,"content":"<p>Mr. Butler explained the defective accounting standard known as IAS 39 very well.  Essentially, the problem started because the standard was drafted to be compatible with EU law, but the detailed guidance notes which everybody follows and which are explicit on points of detail were drafted with the position in the United States in mind.  Obviously, that creates scope for confusion and, as a result, banks recorded artificial profits and paid flawed bonuses even on loss-making transactions because their profits and assets were overstated for a considerable period from approximately the beginning of 2005 in the UK and Ireland when the standards were introduced.<\/p> <p>  I have submitted a PwC document published in 2004, entitled \"Joining the Dots\", to the committee.  It correctly identified that the banking regulation known as the Basel accord relied on banks recognising all losses to comply with company law in the way described by Mr. Butler.  These are known as the EU capital maintenance rules, which apply to all companies and ensure that banks and other companies only pay dividends out of genuine profits.  Basically, it is a solvency test that applies to every company.<\/p> <p>  The Basel rules were intended to give an additional layer of protection, beyond what is required of normal companies, to banks.  The purpose was to protect the interbank market, in which banks borrow from and lend to each other.  If the interbank market is enabled to operate effectively, banks can borrow and lend cheaply with each other.  Company law is supposed to protect creditors and shareholders and the Basel system is supposed to protect the interbank market and make it safer than would be the case under company law.  That is why, before the crisis, banks could borrow at cheaper rates than companies.<\/p> <p>  The PwC document refers to the problem with these revised standards, but draws the incorrect conclusion that the Basel accord compensated for it; it did not.  At best, it took one year&rsquo;s losses, rather than lifetime losses, and for some strange reason divided that by two, assuming that half the loss could go to creditors and half to subordinated debt.  The technical reason for doing so was a concern over allowing banks to go into run off.  Ultimately, banks failed to be going concerns when investors would not touch them as a result of their suspicions eventually that there was no capital there.<\/p> <p>  Ireland, the UK and the US were the worst-affected regimes.  It was not a global crisis.  Those three jurisdictions had the worst ordinary lending banks, as opposed to investment banks.  Interestingly, some countries, such as Australia, introduced safeguards to counteract the problem.  Australia created an additional standard in 2006 - I have provided it to the committee - which would have solved all of the problems we face today and which were present before and during the crisis.  There was also a natural correction in much of continental Europe as countries there did not permit the faulty standard in the accounts of banks themselves and it was only compulsory in the consolidated accounts of listed groups.  As such, a French bank such as Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale would have proper numbers in the accounts of what it considered banking companies, as well as proper public accounts - only consolidated accounts would be slightly wrong.<\/p> <p>  However, because the UK and Ireland have similar accounting regimes due to the accounting standards board setting the standard for both states, they did not adjust for the defect in IAS 39 and permitted the option of IAS 39 operating in banking companies, rather than using UK and Ireland generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP.  Of particular significance is that in a further step it was also permitted to be used for management accounts for the banks.  Although the Ireland and the UK merely permitted the use of IAS 39 in banking companies, rather than its use being required, using UK or Irish GAAP was an option which could have corrected it.  Unfortunately, the accounting standards board also copied IAS 39 into the UK and Irish GAAP, such that even if one prepared accounts under UK or Irish GAAP rather than international standards, one would have the same error.  That is why there was a near systemic banking crisis in ordinary Irish and UK high street banks and building societies.  I say it was near systemic because four of the main London-based clearing banks, namely, HSBC, Lloyds, Barclays and NatWest, which is part of the RBS group, had counteracting controls that seemed to make some proper adjustment in spite of the standards.<\/p><p>None of those banks collapsed.  The problems with Lloyds when it acquired HBOS - a bank that had collapsed - and the problems with NatWest were not just NatWest itself but with the wider RBS Group.  All of the big ones that collapsed were the Alliance and Leicester, Allied Irish Bank, Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, the Co-operative Bank, HBOS and the parts of RBS that were not based in London.  At the time we produced an analysis for the local authority pension funds entitled Banks Post Mortem, which was released in 2012.  Interestingly, at the time we produced the report we could not understand why the Co-operative Bank had not collapsed.  A year later it did collapse because the Bank of England went in and discovered that its loan books were as bad as all the others but because the Co-operative Bank did not have a quoted share price the market did not pick it up. <\/p><p> My simple conclusion is that accounting standard setting cannot be left to the accountants.  It should have legislative standards of scrutiny.  Part of the reason we are still talking about this ten years after the crisis is that people who have produced faulty accounts for banks have a vested interest in pretending there was nothing wrong.  For basic strict liability reasons the penalties on directors and auditors for producing faulty accounts are quite severe in civil law.  Effectively they owe all the losses back.  My overall conclusion is that one has to have legislative standards of scrutiny of the standards when they are being set, not after they have caused the problem.  I say legislative standards of scrutiny because all of these issues link with other areas of law around misrepresentation on the purchase of shares, misrepresentation when people put new capital into banks and misrepresentation at annual general meetings when directors want to get elected on the numbers.  The simplest answer would be to look at what the Australians did in 2006. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052800002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Bush","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bush.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052800002#H00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat and I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

There are the different layers of the standards bodies and the Central Bank, which is the regulator.  There are also the big four audit companies.

It is a very good question.  When we identified the problem back in 2009 and 2010 it struck me early on that one of the first people to openly speak out, not only to describe the problem but to describe it very clearly, was the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan.  He put it beautifully and so clearly.  The Bank of England was not saying the same thing.  The Bank of France was kind of saying it because it was in a position where it could.  The then outgoing Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, started talking about it but I believe that the problems the central banks have is that in law it is illegal for them to prop up a bank that is insolvent.  They either lend to a solvent bank or they have to transparently put in new capital.  If they are lending money to an insolvent bank they are effectively putting capital into an insolvent bank, and by that they should not be able to whip it out again.  Huge conflict of interest arises when a central bank lends to a bank that is, essentially, bust and it then goes into a limbo state.  I believe it is best to let such a bank fail.  One does not have the ongoing zombie state of the living dead where the central bank is conflicted because it has lent money it, the auditors are conflicted because they have followed particular accounting standards that have not delivered company law and the directors are conflicted because they have run the bank badly and have given numbers that do not show the true position.  The conflicts of interest are enormous.  Interestingly, Mr. Butler refers to the case that settled in the High Court in London in February this year, called AssetCo plc <i>v<\/i>Grant Thornton UK.<\/p><p>AssetCo is a company that sold vehicles to the United Arab Emirates.  The AssetCo case was interesting because it was the first major case against an auditor to settle in a UK court since 1968.  The law was so clear in the 1968 case that it was enough to refer to and the respondents - the big four firms - preferred to settle out of court rather than having the 1968 case given a second lease of life.  AssetCo decided to take its case right to the High Court, which was decided there.  The case describes exactly not only the 1968 position but also the 1890s law because these are the same issues.  The law is quite shocking and is quite clear that in the AssetCo case the auditors owed back to the company all the dividends that had been paid from false numbers.  Not only that, the auditors owed all the funds that had been put into the company but which were then mis-invested.  Effectively, it is consequential loss, which is the consequences of making business decisions based on the wrong numbers.  When they see this case most people are quite shocked that it is the legal basis of settling on cases where the accounts were faulty.  The position is so harsh that one can see why people do not want to go around the street with a loud hailer telling everybody that that is their liability position.  Potentially, any company where there has been misinvestment due to the wrong numbers could follow the AssetCo case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052800002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Bush","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Mr. Butler referred to Carillion and the impact of the audit company ruling Carillion was in a good state of health and the small and medium businesses have really suffered as a result of that.

Between 2005 and 2008 we had a situation where the European Central Bank would have been aware that banks were measuring insolvency and measuring their losses incorrectly, but the Irish Government was not so aware.  In 2008 the Irish Government effectively either gave a guarantee or injected funds into the banks, but at that point the banks had already suffered losses.  This has caused a problem, which probably explains why people are slow to correct this issue.  The problem is that once one lends money to an insolvent bank one cannot take that money back out again.  The bank must declare that it is insolvent and the money is then distributed to all the creditors evenly so no creditor is affected worse than other creditors.  In 2008 many of the banks, if not all of them, were insolvent.  The ECB had injected funds.  The ECB had made a loss at that point.  I shall outline what should have happened.  The banks should have declared their insolvency and should have looked for an equity injection.  The central banks really should have said: \"We do not want the commercial banks to fail and therefore we need to put in an equity injection.\" They, however, did it the wrong way around.  They lent money to the banks and the banks delayed telling us about their insolvent situations.  The ECB lent money to the banks and the Irish banks then approached the Irish Government for support and funds, admitting they were in difficulty.

For instance, there was an issue surrounding burning the bondholders and some of the Irish banks took American hedge funds to court.  The banks told the hedge funds that they had huge losses for which the hedge funds should bear some of the burden.  The hedge funds told the banks, more or less, that once the banks started declaring themselves insolvent, the hedge funds would start accepting the losses.  Of course, the banks were unwilling to state they were insolvent but the fact that they attempted to burn the bondholders meant that they felt the bondholders had suffered loses.

The key issue when things go wrong is who knew what, when and where.  The case of Northern Rock was the first run on a bank in the UK for 100 years in the early autumn of 2007.  The day after that, somebody in <i>The Times<\/i>wrote an article asking if the situation was the same as the collapse of the City of Glasgow Bank 100 years previously, that is, this was not a liquidity crisis but a capital crisis and that was why nobody would lend to it.  It is as if markets smell that there is a problem.  That analysis kind of faded away.<\/p><p>Six years later, the Bank of England minutes were released publicly.  In that autumn, the bank knew it was lending money to Northern Rock but the public did not know, because it was private.  A board member asked if the numbers are right, if the bank was insolvent or if the problem was one of liquidity.  Again, that analysis got pushed away because other parties were saying that the banks were all solvent.  If an entity has audited a bank, it has an interest in saying that the bank has capital.  If it has audited ten banks globally, it has a major problem on its hands if it starts admitting that there is a systemic problem and that the banking crisis is actually a capital crisis.  It suited an awful lot of people to call the banking crisis a liquidity crisis when it was actually a capital crisis.  Every banking crisis in history has effectively been an insolvency crisis where the assets are overstated and the capital is, therefore, overstated.  For years, people were running with a red herring and what was quite remarkable in the UK was that the Walker review, which was conducted in early 2009, came up the liquidity crisis diagnosis but if one talks to people in the capital markets, they knew that was because they suspected that the banks were bust.  I worked with somebody who was experienced enough to remember the secondary banking crisis of the 1970s and he suspected that it was a capital crisis in the first part of 2007.  There was a disconnect between what I call PR-based analysis and proper fundamental common-sense-based analysis.  One interesting feature of all of the studies and reviews during the banking crisis is that the people asking the best questions and coming up with the right answers are elected politicians, like members of this committee, and the press.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052800002#L01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Bush","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Surely governments are there to protect citizens.

The committee should be aware that at the moment, banks are claiming that they are making profits when they sell loans to vulture funds but they are not.  A bank with a portfolio of loans worth &euro;1 million will claim that when it sells those loans to vulture funds, it will make a profit but that is not the case.  The banks are using the same accounting techniques that they used nine years ago.  They are writing the loans down to a level the vulture funds are willing to pay and then they sell them to the vulture funds.  This matter came to light in an article in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>on 4 November 2018.

We do know that the ECB is telling the banks that if they sell loans to vulture funds, they can delay the recognition of losses on those loans as far as it is concerned.  In other words, they can bury the losses into reserves so that, in some cases, they can record an accounting profit even though they have made a loss.  If one is worried about the sale of assets to vulture funds, there is a potential defence that one can use here.  If a State-owned bank is selling an asset to a vulture fund and that bank is giving a subsidy, then the Government is entitled to know that subsidy.

Such profits should be going to Irish banks in order that they could be used to write down customer loans.  The banks are selling loans to vulture funds which are making a significant profit on them.  They are buying them at a significant discount.  Members may remember the Project Eagle scandal uncovered by Deputy Wallace a few years ago.  The Comptroller and Auditor General calculated a subsidy of approximately &euro;300 million which was not disclosed by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  It wrote down loans to the amounts the vulture funds were willing to pay.  As the vulture funds wanted to make a profit, loans were written down unnecessarily.  NAMA should have had a much more open competition to determine the best price it could obtain, but it ran a very restricted competition.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was of the view that the price received in the NAMA sale was substantially lower than it ought to have been.  If that scandal had been acted on, many of the vulture funds sales would have been questioned.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult to believe vulture funds are the only groups competent to recover money.  The Irish banks are capable of doing so, but, as a result of a flawed incentive, they are selling the assets to vulture funds.  They claim that the ECB is putting them under pressure.  However, it is not allowed to force banks to do so because if one sells an asset under its value, there is a company law issue as one is effectively paying a dividend.  As a result of that company law issue, significant disclosure is required of the true substance of the transaction, not just the artificial accounting.  Similarly, in some instances, banks set up a special company such as a global restructuring group.  They close a loan and force the sale of an asset, but the asset is dealt with through a separate company which the bank owns.  That company can make a profit because it can buy an asset at a distressed price.  I have seen evidence that an individual with a property portfolio worth &euro;65 million had their asset sequestrated, effectively, to settle a loan worth &euro;10 million.  I have strong evidence that the asset was sold at a distressed price with a relatively high discount.  The bank may not necessarily recognise the loss on the loan sale, but it recognises the profit on the sale of the distressed asset.<\/p> <p>  The banks are using flawed incentive schemes for these transactions.  This issue must come to light.  When bankers appeared before the committee, members correctly asked them what discounts were being given to vulture funds or other groups.  The bankers stated there was a confidentiality clause and that they would not reveal the information to the committee.  It is extremely difficult to see how they can justify this legally because if one is the owner of an asset, one is entitled to know whether it was sold at a profit or with a subsidy.  If it was sold with a subsidy, there are complications involving a breach of the law because one is not allowed to give a subsidy to vulture funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052800002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Butler"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>If one is the owner of the asset, one is entitled to know-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052800002#N00300","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558998000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>One is entitled to know whether the bank is better off in selling the asset or keeping it and earning money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052800002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Butler"},{"type":"speech","time":1558998000,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Who is entitled to know?

It was operating with private sector wages, was not subject to freedom of information and was not subject to public sector procurement rules.

The FRC was acting, however, as if it was a private sector body.  The new authority is in the process of implementing the necessary safeguards to be a public body with public pay, which might need pay capping, and changes will include not being able to use the same firms of lawyers that the accountancy firms use, and an obligation to respond to freedom of information requests.

Some of those small business owners were given letters stating that, under the new facilities, the loans would operate as on-demand loans rather than term loans.

It is wrong to change a term loan to an on-demand loan.  It is simply illegal.  There is a second point to be made.  Many of these companies were sold what are known as \"hedge products\".  A loan would be given for 20 years but then the customer would be told it would be an on-demand facility and asked to take out a fixed-rate swap.  The customer might sign up to that not fully understanding what is going on.  The problem is that if a lender gives a customer a fixed-rate swap on an on-demand facility and interest rates go against the lender and in the customer's favour, as it is an on-demand loan the lender can cancel it and demand the money the following day, thereby cancelling the swap.  It was a one-way bet for the bank.  It would make money if interest rates went down but would not lose money if interest rates went up.  There was mis-selling, the consequence of which is that all of these small businesses were paying more interest than they should have been and that increase in interest pushed them into bankruptcy.  It is a bit like the issue of tracker mortgages.  Once the companies went into GRG they were subjected to a management fee and were also exposed to restrictions.  Some were told that certain assets could not be sold and that approval was needed even to sell something like a car.

If a loan is given to someone whose salary is &euro;100,000 but that person's salary suddenly decreases to &euro;30,000, the lender will clearly be unable to recover that loan.  The lender then has to ask what is the maximum loan it would give to that person today and to write down the loan by an amount equal to the difference.  The loan then becomes a performing loan.  Under its definitions the EBA might say that this customer defaulted because he or she did not meet the conditions of the original terms sheet.  It could therefore be an NPL by definition.  The EBA definition, however, should not come into play.  We in Ireland should classify loans as non-performing if the full amount cannot be recovered and such loans should therefore be valued down.
