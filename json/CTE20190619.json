I also take this opportunity to thank my officials who are here, Mr. Brian Carroll and Mr. Eoin McLoughlin, and the many other officials in other Departments who have contributed immensely to the development of this plan, which is determined to raise our ambition and deliver on the expectations that children and future generations are putting upon us.<\/p> <p>  The past ten years have seen Ireland achieve a great deal.  In many ways, those things would have been unthinkable in the past.  We changed our Constitution and we brought our economy back to full employment.  However, we can and we must do the same for the greatest challenge facing humanity today, namely, global warming and the impact it is having on our society and the sustainability of civilisation and the natural world, which so many people are looking to us to protect.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is far off course and very exposed.  We set a target of reducing emissions by 20%.  Between 2013 and 2020, the impact of the recession brought us below the curve but when the economy started to recover, it was very clear that we failed to break the link between economic prosperity and carbon and greenhouse gas emissions.  We have to act now to make ourselves resilient in the face of this perilous threat facing the globe.  The longer we delay taking the necessary action, the harder it will be and the fewer opportunities will be available to our people in the coming change.<\/p><p>Like many of those achievements, we started by developing a determined resolve across our community.  That is the significance of this Oireachtas committee bringing forward, on the basis of the proposals coming from the Citizens' Assembly, a detailed worked-out strategy based on hours of hearings.  As with other challenges we faced in making change in this country, that has created a solid foundation.  It is something that can allow us to bring the community together behind this effort.  It is not without significance that the committee's report was endorsed unanimously by the D&aacute;il, in that process declaring a climate and biodiversity emergency.  That has created an important backdrop for the work we are now seeking to do.<\/p><p> This effort is integral to the vision that we have for Ireland in Project Ireland 2040 of a country that is regionally balanced and that is compact, connected and sustainable.  There is much work to be done to realise that vision.<\/p><p> I accept fully that Government has major and central responsibility in bringing forward this plan and designing the roadmap for achieving our targets.  In doing that, we have sought to design a pathway that is both sensible and fair, sensible in the sense that we have selected areas which represent the least burden to our community in making the adjustment.  We have gone to great care to evaluate the different options and different technologies and how they might evolve over the next ten years and picked a pathway that represents the least burden and the most opportunity.  We have also been at pains to ensure that those who are most exposed or least equipped to support the change necessary will be supported as a part of this plan.<\/p><p> I suppose what makes the journey difficult for people is that we all have to make a big shift in our priorities in how we spend our money and how we live our lives.  It is important that we engage with citizens as leaders of this community to persuade them that this is the right course and that the future resilience of their children, farms, enterprises and homes depends on us making changes that adapt to this new reality.  There are actions expected of every section of Irish society and one will see these are detailed in the chapters on electricity, enterprise, agriculture, transport, the built environment, waste generation and the circular economy; on the public service leading by example; and on the international stage.<\/p><p> I am confident that when we determine to make a shift, we build on this shared determination, and we put in place the structures that we are putting in place here that are legally underpinning this and overseen with the leadership of the Taoiseach's office.  We can deliver this change.  The committee will recognise in much of the plan its own fingerprints and the work that it has put in.<\/p><p> We are supporting the European Union aim to be net zero in 2050 and undertaking the work to show how Ireland can contribute to that.  We are aiming for 70% renewables in electricity.  We are aiming to deliver the 30% reduction in the non-ETS.  We are adopting what I might call a \"precautionary principle\" in doing that.  We are not relying on high oil prices to do the lifting for us or switching from the ETS sector to make less adaptation in the undertaking.  Of course, the reason we are doing this is that the period to 2020 is the start of the change we must make if we are to reach net zero in 2050; the pace of change will increase in that second period after 2030.  It is right that we try to do as much as we can in this early period when we get a much bigger payback in terms of the overall impact.<\/p><p> We are adopting carbon budgets, with a target range assigned to each Department and sector.  This is a powerful tool to change the way Departments and Ministers think about their responsibilities.  We are all used to living within the financial resources that are given to us.  We must now be conscious that we must live within the carbon resources that are afforded to us in a fair way.  That is also something this committee was determined to see.<\/p><p> We have adopted a model of a climate implementation board in the Taoiseach's office so that we have that central not only co-ordination but impetus and momentum of accountability to the very heart of Government.  We are strengthening the Joint Committee on Climate Action, as the committee itself recommended.  We are updating our legislative arrangements so that the responsibility and accountability will be clearcut.<\/p><p> I hope the committee sees in this plan something that it can support and adopt.  It deals with an issue that is contentious for some, namely the pricing of carbon.  I am an absolute believer in the pricing of carbon.  It is important to recognise that the emission of carbon dioxide damages our environment and at present people do not pay for the damage that is created.  In any trajectory of change, we must recognise the polluter pays principle and the damage has to be included in the price if we are to make the right decisions.<\/p><p> We have here something that is workable and deliverable.  We have 183 actions that get this project off to a strong start but I assure the committee that this will be a rolling plan.  We will be taking on board new ideas and new suggestions.  We will be adapting it based on experience and we will be seeking to make this a rolling, adaptive and sensitive approach to what is an important challenge.<\/p><p> This is a test for all of us, particularly those of us who are policy makers.  It is a test for citizens as well.  I believe that the spark of creative power is strong in Ireland and that if we can kindle that, we will deliver this change and ensure that we pass on this country, but also the globe, in a better condition as a result of the actions we initiate from now on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#B00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming before the committee at such short notice, in fact, in the same week that he launched the all-of-Government action plan.  Members are eager to discuss the measures in this plan with him.  It is the most ambitious plan ever to come from Government addressing climate change and how to reach our targets.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has listened to us as a cross-party committee.  He has adopted many of the committee's recommendations, some of them word for word which is quite unusual for any Government action plan.  We all look forward to working with him over the weeks and months ahead to ensure that these measures are rolled out.<\/p> <p>  In the area of governance, the fact that the Minister has adopted our recommendation on governance is central to this whole plan, ensuring that we, as a standing committee, will have the oversight, in relation to implementation, accountability and transparency, for all Departments and State agencies in reaching their targets.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the Minister.  This is an all-of-Government plan and the Minister made reference to the fact that, as then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, he had an all-of-Government action plan on jobs.  What are the learnings from that process in 2011, where the Minister had to reduce unemployment from 16% - it is now down to below 5%?  From working with the different Departments and pulling the different Secretaries General and officials together, what are the learnings from that process that the Minister could use in implementing this ambitious climate action plan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#C00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I refer to the learnings that I mentioned among which accountability from the centre is crucial.  If one has 15 distinct Departments and they all are working to their own priorities and within their own silos the needed change will not be achieved unless one has not only a verbal commitment to deliver but it also becomes a priority within that silo<\/p><p>When things do not work as intended, there will not be quick adaptation and responsiveness within the different sections of government.  Having the central authority of the Taoiseach overseeing these targets and the reporting on them on a quarterly basis will ensure this becomes a top priority.  That was a feature of the action plan we had.<\/p><p> The other very important element is the capacity to continually adapt to the experience, new suggestions and finding where the boot pinches, if one likes, in trying to achieve the change.  We must carry people with us.  It cannot all be about imposing change on people.  We must talk to people, understand and work with them in order to make changes.<\/p><p> The scale of this challenge is different.  In trying to deliver employment growth everyone started with a shared objective.  In this area there will be more of a tendency for people to ask why someone else is not making more of an effort.  One of the challenges is to ensure what we will ask of different segments of the community is fair and balanced.  That is a challenge on a scale that is different from what we experienced with the Action Plan for Jobs.  In recognising the difference we have put much more legislative infrastructure behind this.  We recognise the role of the committee as being really powerful and the need for the accountability of individual Ministers to the committee.  While we are building on the previous model, we are adapting it in the light of the work of the committee and the scale of the challenges we are seeking to meet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#C00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the presentation.  As we dig deeper into the report, it becomes evident that while it is clear on why we need to do what must be done - we are all aware of this - it is about setting out clearly what needs to be done to reach the targets we have set and moving towards net zero emissions by 2050, but it is relatively light on how we are going to do it.  In saying that, we need to look at costs.  I know that there was a discussion yesterday about this issue at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, but is there clarity on the cost, on the one hand, and, on the other, savings to be achieved based on the actions and what needs to be done?  Will the Government set out how much of the cost of the new climate plan will have to be carried by the Exchequer and non-Exchequer sources?<\/p> <p>  On accountability and targets, will the Department provide information on implementing the committee's recommendations?  We need some more information on this aspect.  <\/p> <p>  On the just transition in detail, for example, our recommendation was clear.  We indicated the need for a just transition task force.  The plan only identifies that a just transition review will be carried out by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, which is already carrying out some research in the area.  If we are serious about the impacts of the actions that must be taken, there will be a significant effect on certain parts of the country.  There was much talk here about the impact on the midlands of the non-use of peat in any aspect of the economy, not just on the electricity side of things.  There is a target to end the burning of coal at Moneypoint by 2025, while the plan speaks about moving away from fossil fuels in the heating of homes.  That will have an impact on those who are servicing the industry.<\/p> <p>  There will be a significant transition required in the various sectors and I do not know how it will be catered for from the Government's perspective.  The more I read the report, the more I gain an understanding of what the Taoiseach spoke about in \"nudging\" the public along, rather than hand-holding them through the process, which I believe is necessary.  If people are only nudged along in the areas where jobs will be affected or even taken away, they will be left behind.  We were very clear at this committee during the various hearings that we should not end up in a rust belt scenario, as was evident in the United States or other countries where there had been a move away from traditional industries.  I would like to hear much more from the Minister about how that process will be managed.  We can have all the accountability we want and oversight by the Taoiseach's office, but unless we have the work done contained within, it will just be a box-ticking exercise.  The Government will have to take a much more involved role.<\/p> <p>  On the energy side, we very much support the idea of getting much more of our energy from offshore wind energy projects.  I would like to see detailed plans in place to assist that sector and recognise how there can be a dividend from being part of the early adoption of these technologies and developing them to the point where there can be a new industry for us.  <\/p> <p>  Also on the energy side, will the Minister explain why it will take two years to introduce the feed-in tariff for solar photovoltaics, PV.  The plan indicates a pilot microgeneration grants scheme for solar PV will not be in place until 2021 which is quite a distance out.  Will the Minister confirm that community-led development and citizen participation will be supported in the first round of the auction under the renewable energy share, RES, scheme, on which we really need to get moving?  Part of it is getting citizens to participate.  These are measures in which people can and want to participate.  When people contact us, they say microgeneration is a big issue.<\/p> <p>  On the housing side, is there any available information on the cost per home in various sectors?  As we know the building system and models used for houses in different times, has there been any analysis of the cost per house of a deep retrofit?  We all use these terms that slip off the tongue, but somebody will have to pay for it.  I am certainly concerned that if we are depending on citizens to make these changes in order that we will make these binding targets, we will place a huge burden on the shoulders of homeowners.  We need to be up-front with them at an early stage and indicate what will be the cost.  Will they be able to afford it off their own bat or will the State have to do more to support them?<\/p> <p>  Our report requested the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to produce a plan for the agriculture sector to align it with meeting our Paris Agreement commitments, including a review of national land use under agriculture schemes and extensive public engagement.  The Minister's plan makes no such commitment, nor does it provide any of the detail of the ongoing review and revision of Food Wise 2025.  Will he mention some of the reasoning?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#D00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his constructive contribution throughout the debate both in the Chamber and here.  <\/p> <p>  On costs, we have &euro;30 billion in the national development plan assigned for this purpose, including investments in retrofitting, the grid and so on.  It includes the climate action fund.  There is significant money being set aside to achieve this.  We have learned that we must be more innovative in using some of the money.  This relates to the Deputy's final question.  We rely largely on subsidies given to individuals to undertake retrofitting, but that model will not deliver the scale and aggregation we need to achieve.<\/p><p>We must think in terms of targeting wider areas, aggregating and scaling up work, using smarter procurement for more cost-effective professional advice and installation work and developing smarter finance and easier payment methods.  We recognise that we need to use our money more innovatively.  Almost &euro;4 billion has been set aside in that area and we must ensure that we use that in a targeted way which has the greatest impact and delivers quicker than the current model.<\/p><p> In delivering this, we had to consider a range of policy instruments for every sector.  We cannot expect the Exchequer to fund all change.  We had to ask in which cases regulatory changes are appropriate as a means of creating an obligation for people to make those changes.  This approach tends to be adopted where the case for not making the change is very weak and the changes are necessary because they stand out as sensible both economically and in terms of climate.  That is why we are discussing the options of obliging employers with more than 20 parking spaces to have electric charging facilities, requiring new homes to be built to a net zero energy standard and eliminating the use of oil boilers from 2022.  In some cases, we are making decisions to impose requirements where the cost must be borne by the people.  We will choose those areas sensitively and they will evolve over time and recognise the difficulties that will be encountered, for example, supply chain issues.<\/p><p> It is important that carbon pricing is recognised as a means of changing the payback period for people contemplating changes.  If there is a trajectory for carbon prices, people will choose to adopt changes earlier than would otherwise be the case.  Everyone who has considered this challenge and advised on it, including the Climate Change Advisory Council, has recognised that.  Incentives also have a role.  That can often be important, particularly in introducing people to technologies they might not otherwise consider.  Significant supports have been available for deep retrofitting, the adoption of electric vehicles and so on.  A mixture of policy tools will have to be developed and adapted over time to shape the share-out of cost.  In addition, money raised through a carbon price will be available for disposal.  The Minister is consulting on how that might best be done.  This offers an opportunity.<\/p><p> Approximately 75% of the measures we have chosen pay for themselves.  They would be good for the country, even if there was no climate crisis.  It is important to recognise that.  There is not a net cost to all these measures, some of which are very justifiable, especially in areas such as electric vehicles, retrofitting work and elements of agriculture.  The selection of measures and their sequencing were based on a recognition that some of them will be economic today, while in the case of others, for example, batteries, technology will bring down the price at a certain point such that they become economic.  This is an evolving area where we must adapt policy and ensure it is delivering the targets.  There is no perfect foresight where we can see a curve with a series of fixed elements for which an exact share-out of the sort the Deputy suggests is available.<\/p><p> The just transition should be integral to the implementation of the plan.  Having the NESC issue strong advice that will be core to the implementation of the plan, which will be run from the Taoiseach's office and my office, is the right way to do it.  It makes the NESC integral to the plan.  We will have to use the new opportunities creatively, for example, retrofitting and microgeneration, to ensure they recognise areas of pressure, including the bioeconomy and the renewables sector, to which the Deputy referred.  We will need to use the regional enterprise funds, the urban and rural funds and climate action funds in a way to support the transition.  <\/p><p> The decision on achieving 70% renewables was very important.  The Deputy is correct that we will need detailed planning to achieve this and that planning is being undertaken.  We can absorb up to 65% renewables on the grid at the moment and we are developing plans to push that figure up to 75% and subsequently to 90%.  We must make changes in the grid's capacity to make much higher shares of renewables possible.  <\/p><p> The committee has been conscious that we must adapt the Foreshore Act to provide for offshore wind capabilities.  The Deputy is absolutely right that detailed planning is needed and that is already under way.  The plan will extend to dividends for the community.  We anticipate community gain and participation and the first round of the renewable energy share, RES, scheme will include a pot to be allocated to community bids.<\/p><p> The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has done a great deal of work on how much it costs to retrofit homes and how one incentivises people to retrofit their homes and come together to have work done.  The authority has developed sustainable energy communities and various grant schemes, including the warmer homes scheme which provides grants of up to 100%.  As the Deputy will have seen, while it costs approximately &euro;14,000 to undertake external wall insulation in a typical home, cavity wall insulation costs approximately &euro;2,000.  There are significant differences in the cost of improving the fabric of a home depending on the starting point.  Heating control systems cost around &euro;1,000 but they have a rapid payback in terms of the impact on heating bills.  Grants are also available for heat pumps and solar installation.<\/p><p> We have a fair idea of the costs involved in retrofitting homes and different houses will have a different menu to choose from.  The ambition is that 500,000 households, or approximately 30% of the 1.75 million homes in the country, will have made significant investment in the fabric of their houses by 2030.  I acknowledge that this requires people to change what they regard as the priority for their home.  They will have to view future-proofing their homes for the changes taking place around the globe as beings as important as other items on which they spend money in their homes.  The State will have to change its approach achieve this because the current model is not fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#D00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>What will that mean for the current grant system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#E00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>We need to move to an aggregated system, one which operates on a much larger scale.

Someone asked me why we put it in as the last chapter rather than the first.  That is a reasonably well-made point.  I suppose the idea was to outline the scale of the challenges in the sectors and then see how we ensure that communities can participate.<\/p> <p>  I omitted to answer Deputy Dooley's question on microgeneration.  We do need to consider planning restrictions.  That is one of the areas.  We need to consider the pricing. The Citizens' Assembly recommended a wholesale price and there is an EU obligation on us to pay.  We are conscious of the need to think that through because some of the schemes elsewhere have run into difficulties of equity as between people who are selling into the grid and those who are not and the share out of the cost of running the grid.  We have to make sure there is an equitable scheme there.  We aim to have that worked out by the end of 2020, which is ahead of the legal obligation of 2021.<\/p> <p>  The sustainable energy communities are great exemplars.  They have run from small to very large scale.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has very good experience in this.  It has mentors and the opportunity to develop a plan and there is support for that.  It then has the opportunity to implement that plan and there is another layer of support for that.  The sums of money can be quite big.  They require partnerships.  It cannot be just the local authority.  It has to involve multiple sectors within the community.  The plan envisages that the number of those would grow sixfold over its course.  We want to see far more people getting involved in that, as well as the sort of community participation that Deputy Dooley was talking about.  <\/p> <p>  The details of the smart finance and the area-based schemes have yet to be worked out.  There is no doubt that the local authorities and the housing associations are critical players or obligated entities, as they are called, which now support some of the sustainable energy communities, employers, funders and the State and the SEAI.  We will have to design a package that can aggregate that work, take on the professional expertise in an effective way, reach out to communities in a way that is more effective than the one-off application form model and develop easier payment methods.  We have seen the ability of the State in partnership with financial institutions in microlending to bring down that cost.  It may involve the State taking a layer of the risk but we need to evolve that model.  We are starting that work as a priority.  <\/p> <p>  The full make-up of the implementation board has yet to be decided but we must make that the Secretary General to the Government and the Secretary General of my Department are at its core and that reporting is to the Taoiseach.  Experience shows that creates a level of accountability that guarantees a much higher response rate to the actions we are putting in place.<\/p> <p>  The area-based scheme in the midlands is evolving and will involve local authorities, housing associations active in the area and other energy entities in the area, funders, employers, community groups.  We need to get a group that is effective but also a model that can deliver effectively and the design of that is under way.  The Government recognises that we need to do that and that proceeding on the present basis with subsidies will not get the scale of change we need.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#F00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister that we are at a turning point where this country will become a leader on climate change.

The measures that will help in that later journey are not all economic at this point, whether it be carbon capture, carbon reduction, fossil fuel alternatives to  back-up our electricity grid and so on.  We have started with the 2030 target, which is a legal obligation, but we are way off course.

There are plenty of very expensive actions but if one sought to do them now before the technology had evolved, they would prove very expensive.  One must judiciously choose the pathway based on the information available.  We got help to identity the direction of travel of the technologies and that is why there is a greater emphasis in the plan on electric vehicles.

One of the key recommendations made by the committee was to use a land use plan akin to what was done in the UK.  Lord Deben was very clear about the benefits to be gained from a land use plan and I specifically sought this measure.  There are many references in the agriculture section to some of these issues that we are talking about yet it is not specific and clear.  Action 110 on page 54 states: \"We will develop a roadmap by the end of the year to ensure the future development of agriculture and land use, including the forestry sector, will be built on environment sustainability and contribute fairly to Ireland's climate, air and energy targets.\"  That roadmap could, and should, be a land use plan in the sense of not telling what every acre is going to be.  The Government says it wants to increase afforestation from 5,500 ha to 8,000 ha but it says nothing about how many of those hectares will be new continuous cover forestry or a continuation of single species, clear felling and fast rotation.  It is vital to have that detail because a biodiversity emergency and not just a climate emergency has been declared.  I recall when our adviser, Professor Peter Thorne, an eminent scientist said that we have to seek win-win solutions.  Land use is the biggest area for win-win solutions though the rewetting of bogs, the diversification of farming, and changing of the current farming model of just beef and dairy production at all environmental costs and these opportunities could be stitched in this.  That has to be mapped and based on a land use plan.  Action 110 states that other key stakeholders will be involved.  They should include the environmental community such as the National Wildlife Trust and others that have an interest because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for us to tackle the biodiversity crisis as well as the climate crisis.  That can only work when one has a proper land use plan that operates from the top down.  Is my interpretation of the roadmap correct?  Will a land use plan be devised?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#G00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I understand that there are a number of ongoing pieces of work on the concept of agricultural evolution and land use development.  Part of it came from the climate advisory committee and Mr. John FitzGerald is undertaking work in this area.  The Department is also committing to engage with all stakeholders, not just the farming stakeholders, to evolve what it describes as a roadmap.  The Common Agricultural Policy must also be evolved.  As I have seen from the comments of the Commissioner, there is a very strong appetite within that.  Indeed, it is written into the new policy that 40% of the money must be assigned to work that improves the environment and improves carbon emissions.  That body of work will incorporate the ambitions that the Deputy mentioned.  I am not sure whether that meets what he described as a land use plan.  I cannot say that this exactly what he has in mind.  The ingredients are the same and there is a clear ambition that we need to see the evolution of our agriculture sector in a way that futureproofs family farm income.  If family farm income does not recognise that the world is changing, that the expectation of consumers are changing and that we, as a farming country that exports 90% of our output, must be conscious of what those who buy our product expect in respect of the certification of the environmental standards being applied.  I know a little about that from being on trade missions and being responsible for presenting the case of Irish produce.

There is a complete lack of ambition for change or for efficiency and long-term decarbonisation.  The Government is sticking with our current transport plans and converting diesel cars into electric vehicles.  While I very much support electric vehicles, the change is not sufficient.  First, rather than just saying there will be 860,000 electric cars, the Government should make car sharing happen.  The State may achieve the same reduction in emissions and the same transport service by only buying half, a third or a quarter of those cars, which may be much more achievable.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, I refer to the lack of any other vision for a switch away from our current road-based transport system, which has led to further sprawl.  It is fundamentally unsustainable and impossible for us to meet our 2050 net zero target if the State continues with what the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is overseeing, which is a massive continuation of long distance commuting and sprawl, a major use of resources and ever increasing building out and out, and a road-based system that can never be climate ready even if the entire fleet comprised electric vehicles.  The Government must address the gridlock we are facing and the social and environmental costs of consumption of an individual car-based system.<\/p><p>I accept and welcome the Minister saying it is an iterative process.  However, the first thing that has to go in that context is the transport section.  This or another Government will have to come back with something completely different as this does not deliver.  I have set out some of the reasons why at the transport committee.  It completely fails to address the scale of the challenge.  What was the level of co-operation from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport?  Why did it not come back with anything other than, in effect, a daft scrappage scheme for which there is no detail and a congestion charge hint that does not mean anything.  It is just about certain electric vehicles.  After two or three years in everyone's crosshairs, this is the one Department which is failing completely to address this issue.  Why has it come back with nothing else?  Why is it failing so clearly in its responsibilities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#G00500","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Public transport does not represent an effective substitute for a great deal of the travel and transport that generates a carbon impact.  That is part of the problem we face.  When we looked at and got the professional advice on the degree to which modal shift would contribute, the unfortunate answer was that the contribution of modal shift to the reduction of carbon emissions will be surprisingly low.  I was surprised myself.  We have to focus to a great extent on changing the type of travel that occurs while moving to electric vehicles which represent a very strong opportunity for us to meet our carbon emissions targets within an early period.  I do not accept Deputy Eamon Ryan's view that modal shift is not a major part of the change that is coming.  While it may not have a great impact on carbon emissions, it can have a huge impact on quality of life, in particular in our towns and cities.  There is a very welcome change in the new strategies that will emerge on park and ride, cycling and the new capacity of local authorities to introduce measures in their own areas to improve the modal split and the environmental soundness of what is happening in transport locally.  We look forward to those five-year strategies that will have to be published before the end of the year or early next year in respect of cycling, park and ride and so on.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will also make the point that if one compares new public transport at, from memory, &euro;8 billion with new road spending, which is much smaller at &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion in the plan, the comparison is not far off the 2:1 proposal.  However, 2:1 is not the way we should be planning infrastructural choices of this nature.  One of the important decisions in the plan is that anyone planning any public investment will have to price carbon on the basis of a trajectory reaching &euro;265 per tonne by 2050.  That will undoubtedly change the type of investments chosen within the national development plan.  However, there are needs with regard to roads.  Other Deputies will indicate that there are needs at critical points where new road investment is needed.<\/p> <p>  Transport will continue to have to make significant changes.  For the first time in this plan, we have a very ambitious target for transport to reduce its emissions.  Members will have seen over recent years that transport has consistently expanded its emissions.  Deputy Eamon Ryan is right about that happening nearly throughout the whole period.  Even before the recovery started, there were signs that transport emissions were increasing.  This is a massive change in the direction of travel to which the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has committed with regard to the carbon emissions the sector generates.  There are major commitments to improving public transport while also changing fuel use and developing strategies to align travel to a greater extent with compact living, which we all desire to see.  In BusConnects, we see the ambition that exists not only to improve bus services but to add 200 km of safe, separated cycling.  There is a significant ambition regarding a shift from where we have been.  I commend the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for stepping up to the plate and for taking responsibility in this area.  As with every other sector, we expect the Department to deliver on what it seeks to achieve here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#H00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending.  As I usually do when we deal with this issue, I refer to the IPCC report.  It is worth couching everything we do at the committee in the words of the report which stated that we need far-reaching, unprecedented and radical change.  When the fanfare dies down, one has to look past the layers of green clothing that mask a business opportunity for industry, corporations and, in particular, private finance.  The Government's report referred to the phasing out of our reliance on fossil fuels.  Is the Government going to continue to block the Bill calling for an end to the issuing of exploration licences?  Can the Minister explain how, if we are to phase out our reliance on fossil fuels, we can continue to support the development of runways and airports?  Indeed, the report does not look at the aviation industry at all.  There is no measure within it regarding the aviation industry's contribution to emissions.  We are supporting new runways and the development of LNG terminals.  That contradicts fundamentally the aims set out in the report.<\/p> <p>  An issue that really jumped out at me is the absence of any attempt to put the burden of dealing with the crisis on global corporations in the fossil fuel and food industries which make billions in profit.  The burden is entirely placed on changing individual behaviour, including individuals who are as well off as the Minister or as poor as the Travellers I met this morning who are dealing with fuel and energy poverty at halting sites.  The Government has committed to attracting data centres to Ireland and it is estimated that 30% of our energy production will go to keeping those centres open.  The solution proposed is to urge and plan for corporate power purchasing agreements, which are described as long-term contracts under which a business agrees to purchase electricity directly from an energy generator.  Where did the idea come from to litter the country with data centres using up 30% of overall energy production and most of our water while being powered privately by energy companies dotted around the State?  It did not come from the Citizens' Assembly or the joint committee.  Did it come from someone the Minister knows such as a former head of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or a Secretary General in the Department of Finance?  It strikes me as a business plan writ large that would do more to damage our capacity to reduce emissions.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan on the woeful attempt to deal with public transport.  In fact, there is no attempt to deal with it.  I heard the Chairman explain that on TV3 last night by saying it was all contained in the capital development plan.  However, that is not so.  That plan commits itself only to BusConnects which, for example, only puts a couple of hundred more buses on the roads in Dublin than were taken off the road during the austerity years.  There is nothing there to help us deal with what is required, namely a massive increase in frequent, free, or at least much cheaper, public transport in every town and village and not just in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  Unless we provide that, people will rely on their cars.  They have no choice.  During the election campaign, I listened to Saoirse McHugh, who became a very popular figure overnight because she was so radical and passionate about climate change.  She was a Green Party candidate in the west in the recent European elections.  She described her life on Achill Island noting that there was one bus out in the morning and one back in the evening.  Her house is 200 years old.  She asks how she can cut down on her carbon emissions if she does not have proper public transport and help to retrofit her house.  It will continue to require burning coal to heat her home and diesel to run her car.  That is where the bulk of Irish society is at.<\/p><p>Despite all the commitment to private financial loans being available left, right and centre to people, the vast majority of people in this country - in middle Ireland, as it is often described - cannot afford to take out loans of &euro;40,000, &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 to retrofit their homes.  Middle Ireland cannot afford to borrow to buy an electric car in the morning and start paying back the loans.  Most people struggle to pay their mortgage, rent and to get to work in overly expensive private transport because public transport is not available to them.  This is a disaster of a plan.  I will quote a part of the Minister's plan which sums up the attitude of his Department:<\/p><blockquote>... those inflicting the damage do not pay the cost of the damage they inflict.  This is the rationale for charging a carbon price for carbon emissions which reflects the growing damage that they are inflicting.  This serves to discourage emissions and to make carbon abatement more profitable.<\/blockquote><p>I would agree with that statement if it applied to the fossil fuel corporations and global corporations that abuse this planet through the overproduction of plastics, goods, oil and gas and then force us all into situations in which we use these products.  However, it does not refer to them but to ordinary people in this country who the Minister says must change their behaviour, while giving them no help to do so except to tell them to go to the private financial market.  The IFSC will gloriously come up with innovative ways to deal with this.  Was it not great when it came up with innovative ways to help companies to evade tax and to create Ireland as a tax haven?  This is a very damaging document when one looks at the lack of an attempt to really deal with the problem.  Colleagues have spoken about electric vehicles but I do not understand how, in ten years, the Minister is going to get almost 1 million electric vehicles into this country.  The production and importation of those vehicles somewhere on that planet, though maybe not here, will create a massive amount of carbon.  We instead need a massive amount of public transport that is frequent and free.<br\/><br\/>With regard to retrofitting homes, three families came to me in my clinic on Monday.  I have written to the Minister about this and have his replies.  In one case, the family is earning &euro;5 per week more than what would qualify them to be determined as living in fuel poverty according to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  They are not entitled to a fuel allowance because of &euro;5 extra per week.  In the other cases, it was &euro;7 and &euro;7.50 extra each week, yet they are families who live to the pin of their collars to try to heat their homes.  They must turn on the gas, burn the coal or the peat briquettes because they have no other choice.  In most of those cases, they also have varying health issues such as arthritis or lung disease but they do not qualify for an allowance.  Nothing in the Minister's document deals with them or with the Traveller community which launched a report on fuel poverty among Travellers this morning.  I was the only Deputy who attended that.  They invited four different Ministers and they were all unable to attend.  It was a disgraceful abuse of a community that we celebrated in this House just a couple of years ago.<br\/><br\/>The best thing that we could do, instead of passing a motion that declares a climate emergency, is to pass a legislation, as the Government passed financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation during the financial crisis.  Let us pass climate emergency measures in the public interest that will allow us to borrow massively at a very cheap rate for the country to invest in publicly-owned renewable sources, not to put it out for tender to the private market to see what company might be able to build offshore or onshore energy generators.  Have we not learned about private tendering from the broadband and children's hospital examples?  If one wants something done in this State, the State must take it by the short and curlys and do it itself.  This document does nothing about that.  It throws the responsibility entirely back at the market which is responsible for putting the globe in the danger that it is in already.<br\/><br\/>I ask the Minister to specifically address where the idea came from that date centres would somehow be a great solution to reducing emissions or helping our society or economy.  Where did the idea of corporate purchase power agreements for electricity come from?  In ten years, how will the Minister deal with the question of nearly 1 million electric vehicles being purchased in the country when the majority of people cannot afford to buy one?  Will he comment on the lack of any mention in this document of aviation emissions and the support he is giving to introducing new runways?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#H00300","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>The difficulty I have with Deputy Smith is not her commitment but that she applies the same old ideology to every new problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#J00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>So does the Minister.

The Deputy said that there is no help to do anything except to go to financial institutions and then she made a pitch for an adjustment of the means test on a scheme that provides 100% assistance to people in fuel poverty to do exactly what the Deputy is asking for.  There is clearly State support to help people.  Some 32,000 homes undertake retrofitting every year and all of that receives support from the State.  People are changing to electric and hybrid vehicles.  That has increased sixfold so far this year and the State is supporting those people in that change.  There is a grant of &euro;5,000 from one's vehicle registration tax, VRT, a &euro;5,000 subsidy and a subsidised electric vehicle charger.  Many people are making that choice.  As technology becomes available and the price of changes reduces, more people will make that change.  The State will design a scheme to make it easier for people to take on the retrofitting challenge.<\/p> <p>  We are devising ways of doing this that will help people to make the change.  That is the right thing to do in this situation.  Many people recognise that and we have taken advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council which was established to help us to do this.  We are taking up much of its advice and the advice of this committee.  That is how electric vehicles will be taken up.  We purchase 280,000 vehicles each year so our aim is that 960,000 of those would be electric vehicles by 2030.  That is achievable.  I believe that technology will make that possible and people will not only have a better environment but also cheaper costs.  The cost of running a petrol car is eight times that of running an electric vehicle.  There are savings to be made.  People will make decisions that are in their long-term interest.<\/p> <p>  The evolution of data centres is not an invention of this document.  The reality is that data centres are being established here.  We need a strategy to manage the demand that is coming from data centres which is part of the evolution of the digital society.  We need to manage it in a way in which it does not put excessive strain on the targets that we are trying to achieve.  This is about better regional allocation of such investments but also seeing that those companies would seek to make their own arrangements for securing sustainable renewable energy to serve their needs, so that the needs of those multinational companies would not all fall back on the State.

This action needs to be immediate and robust if we are to retain our ranking and maintain the world as a safe place.<\/p> <p>  A number of people have touched on transport and, in particular, the implications of transport emissions on public health.  Has there been analysis of the likely reduction in air quality in city suburban rings from the expanding park and ride facility, which is lauded as a way to ease congestion and to encourage people to use public transport, which often does not have the capacity to cater for them?  I refer the Minister to a study on congestion charges, nitrogen oxide levels and carbon dioxide increases in the suburbs where commuters were converging to park their cars in London and other cities throughout the UK and I ask him to comment on it.<\/p> <p>  Another transport-related issue is the Shannon Foynes waterway, which was committed to some years ago.  There is nothing in the report that might result in a waterway conclusion for sustainable transport policy.  Has there been a feasibility assessment of the use of the Shannon Foynes waterway for waterborne barge freight as per the terms of reference for a sustainable transport review?  Like many of my Dublin colleagues I have been involved in the BusConnects consultation.  This project is a &euro;2 billion investment that would take seven or eight years to complete, if it were to be agreed.  It is nowhere near agreement at the moment and the plan is to continue to purchase a diesel-only bus fleet.  We have to change the record and draw a line under that.  Time and again, I have raised this issue with the NTA but it is sticking to a diesel fleet, which means that even if BusConnects goes ahead tomorrow, in 2028 this city would still be serviced by diesel bus transport.  We need to change this as it is reflective of the seriousness with which we view transport pollution and the quality of our air.  <\/p> <p>  On a fair transition, which the Minister talked about earlier, the International Labour Organisation, ILO, has laid out a framework of the steps needed in regard to that transition, which has been included in Sinn F&eacute;in's minority report.  It provides a template of what is needed for a fair transition that is understood by workers and communities, not just in the Portlaoise area but throughout the country.  For example, in regard to the electric vehicles, EVs, which we are all being encouraged to purchase, affordability aside, we need to know who will maintain and repair these vehicles when they break down.  I presume it will be a person qualified in electronics rather than a car mechanic.  Is this skills provided for in the apprenticeship programme?  Are we specifically training people to perform that task?  Under this plan, boilers will become defunct in a couple of years' time.  Are we likewise training people in the skills necessary to maintain and repair heat pumps?  To achieve the just and fair transition that we need, we will have to encourage the 300,000 young people who left this island, taking their skills with them, to return and upskill others in this area.  <\/p> <p>  The cost of retrofit was touched on as well.  The cost of retrofitting a large home is estimated to be &euro;60,000.  One would not see a return on that amount for 33 years, which does not incentivise lending in this area.  I am not sure what we can do about that.  Roof and attic insulation is cheap and effective.  Every building could be brought up to that standard without too much financial outlay.  We must be careful not to scare off householders that would not have &euro;40,000 or &euro;60,000.  Following completion of that work, we could move to the next level of insulation to reduce emissions as well.  <\/p> <p>  I would welcome a response from the Minister on those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#K00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>The Senator is right that the development of a park-and-ride strategy will have to examine air quality and other issues such as location, traffic management and so on.

All of these alternatives need to be developed.  This plan is open to sensible suggestions as to how those can emerge.<\/p> <p>  I confess I do not know if the Shannon Foynes waterway is part of a plan.  We did not get down to that level of individual project.  On the bus fleet, from 1 July there will be no diesel-only buses purchased.

As we move towards electric vehicles, one of the advantages, apart from the carbon, will be the reduction of the air pollution that goes with fossil fuel burning vehicles.<\/p> <p>  On the transition to new sectors, the Senator is right that we do need to develop the apprenticeships and traineeships.  To be fair, we have been through a much larger transition in terms of the sectoral make-up with the collapse of the construction sector from 12% of employment to 1% or 2%.  It blew away a lot of apprenticeships and traditional opportunities.  We have managed to see these people retrained and absorbed into other sectors.  We now have a much more robust mix of sectors.  We have to do the same now in terms of moving from some of the more traditional fossil-dependent sectors to new sectors.  We have the capacity, with a just transition strategy, to make those changes and to support people to make the changes.  We will be well able to meet the needs of people in terms of retrofit of their homes.  These are skills that can be learned.  They are largely blue-collar skills and there will be a tendency for some of the new technologies to displace blue-collar workers.  There is an opportunity for identifying opportunities in microgeneration and retrofitting, as well as in the bioeconomy and so on, that have a skill mix that can be very positive for those who need to redeploy into new areas.  This is central to the plan.  The education and training boards, ETBs, the institutes of technology and the bodies that are transitioning to technological universities will have to step up to the plate in this area.  As an aside, we need those agencies to take on more mature people rather than gearing up their systems for only younger people coming out the schools.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is right that some retrofitting can be very expensive and some can be very cheap.  The Senator is right also in advising that we start with the shallow retrofit.  In adopting an area-based approach, we can do that on a scale and make it easier for people to take on.<\/p><p>If all they want to do is the shallower retrofit, that can be possible, but, of course, we will need to see people moving to carrying out deeper retrofits over time.  The figures are on the SEAI website if the Senator is interested in seeing them.  It is less than &euro;2,000 for a cavity wall for a very strong improvement in the fabric.  The figure for an external wall is &euro;14,000.  It is much more expensive to achieve the same thing.  Clearly, there is a rationale for us to start with cavity walls and move to deeper interventions as a system evolves.  The Senator is right to suggest we do the sensible things first that will yield a result.  We should not seek to scare people off by bigging up the most expensive possible retrofit to a very large house in a very isolated area with very bad heating systems and so on.  For a lot of people, the changes will be more modest and affordable with a quicker payback.  However, over time we will need to accommodate the deeper changes such as moving to heat pumps, heat controls and deeper retrofits.  Once we start this journey with a credible model which we need to design, we can ramp it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#K00500","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>We see some parts of the plan falling short.  We looked for the sectoral targets and commitments and the governance structure, all of which are welcome.  Straight lines of accountability and measurements give us something on which to work.  We have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% at an absolute minimum by 2050.  The clock is ticking.  With the plan, we should have a minimum of 20% done within the next 18 months, but, obviously, we are not going to do that.  By 2030 we are looking at a 20% reduction.  That will leave us with a 60% reduction to be achieved within the following 20 years.  There was such a thing as the swinging 60s.  People refer back to decades in which there were major changes or upheavals.  I think the 1970s were supposed to be socialist, although, unfortunately, they were not.  We will have a big transition to make in the 2020s.  Even allowing for a brown to green revolution in the 2020s, there will be a massive catch-up required in the following 20 years, about which we have huge concerns.  I welcome the sectoral targets and governance commitments because for the first time they give us a straight line in terms of accountability and oversight.  During the debate on the low carbon climate action Bill five years ago, I pointed out consistently, over and over again, that it was a fatal weakness of that legislation.<\/p> <p>  On a just transition, I see Portlaoise mentioned in the plan, which is good.  It should be a test case or trial for what can be rolled out in other towns.  It should go past the two prisons and the two hospitals.  There are communities that need to be brought in also.  <\/p> <p>  On the midlands and support for the regional transition team, we have to get away from putting task forces in place when an event is happening or has happened.  We have argued from the beginning that we need a just transition commission.  A range of things are going to happen.  Motor mechanics who have upskilled and completed their apprenticeships will find that their skills will be out of date.  Apprentices this year will be okay as most of them will have the required skills.  There is Moneypoint, as well as several other places where a transition will be made.  I ask the Minister to address that issue.  <\/p> <p>  On retrofits and a just transition which are mentioned in two separate parts of the document, in the midlands and other parts of the country a lot of workers will be affected.  On the other hand, we have this great need to do a lot of expensive work in retrofitting.  There is the question of financing it.  A lot of households do not have the earning capacity, while others that do have it find it is soaked up by childcare and commuting costs and in paying existing mortgages from now until kingdom come.  They will not be able to access the &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 in finance required to undertake the retrofitting.  We need to deal with that issue.  These are big challenges for us.<\/p> <p>  Another challenge is finding the skills and labour required.  There are still about 160,000 people unemployed.  I do not want this to be taken up the wrong way, but I deal with a lot of foreign workers who are doing fine in working here.  They have brought skills and energy, which is all good.  However, we do not have houses to house people.  We were caught in a perfect financial storm ten years ago and are now caught in a perfect storm in providing housing.  We do not have the skilled workers required to build or retrofit them.  If we bring in more workers, we will not have places in which to house them.  We are caught in a bind.  There are probably a number of parts to the solution.  I suggest the Oireachtas needs to make a decision on the 160,000 people who are unemployed.  We need to decide to train and upskill a section of that workforce.  As the Minister said, we have SOLAS.  We also have the education and training boards, ETBs, which have been modernised and are working better than the old vocational education committees.  We have major training centres, including in the midlands.  We need to move ahead to start upskilling those workers to fill the vacancies and carry out the work of retrofitting that will be need to be carried out across the State.  We have big semi-State companies, some of which are diversifying.  Bord na M&oacute;na is going to move towards producing green energy, but that will not replace jobs.  The morning I started working in Bord na M&oacute;na there were 95 others starting with me.  That will not happen in the industries it is moving into.  I am not arguing against the changes, which have to be made.  However, it has a great history of offering apprenticeships.  Some of my family were trained as apprentices in it.  It is an area we need to consider as it is a company with a history and the infrastructure to do it.<\/p> <p>  Biogas is dealt with on page 41 of the document which we received today.  The actions include \"carry out a public consultation\"; \"develop and update a feasibility study\"; \"set a target\"; \"assess potential impacts\"; \"consider\" and \"examine the potential\" of something else.  It is a little fluffy and does not do the business.  I published a microgeneration Bill over a year and a half ago and it is now before the committee.  I ask the Government not to hold it up by stating a money message is needed or any other last minute booby trap.  We are wide open to amending it.  My party brought it forward deliberately to kick start the debate and also to try to get legislation in place.  As I said, we are wide open to working with those on the right and the left, in the centre, the Greens, or anyone else to get it moving.<\/p><p> I attended the Committee on Budgetary Oversight meeting yesterday because it was dealing with these issues.  I raised issues with the panel in attendance, including Professor John FitzGerald.  I am sorry but I forgot to make a point about retrofitting.  There is a demand for housing but according to the ESRI, with the current workforce, every nine houses we retrofit results in one less house being built.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#L00200","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Will the Deputy address the biogas issue?

The Deputy is asking the same question Deputy Eamon Ryan asked earlier, that is, whether we are we leaving too much for the 2030 to 2050 period.  I will give the Deputy the same answer.  We do not have the same certainty around the costs and the choices in technologies needed to make to make those decisions now.  We could make bad calls by picking wrong technologies and sinking many resources into technologies that do not evolve.  We have taken the best advice on the evolving technologies and have picked the ones that show we can deliver by 2030 with the least burdens being imposed on people.<\/p> <p>  The next phase will need more work.  I have told Professor FitzGerald, and I am sure he has said this to the Deputy, that we need more research to be done on that next phase.  We will start to do that work ourselves but much work is probably needed to identify the sort of technologies that should be adopted over that 20-year period from 2030 to achieve the net zero.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of just transition, I was gratified that when the difficulties arose for Bord na M&oacute;na, under the regional enterprise strategy I was party to putting in place, which was to have regional enterprise strategies in every sector, the midlands regional strategy immediately moved to adopt decarbonisation as a central plank of its strategy.  It is using the regional enterprise fund and the network it has developed to deliver that.  I found it heartening to know that something decided upon in tougher times when we were simply talking about trying to get jobs off the ground is in place to deal with adaptation which is occurring.<\/p> <p>  I also make the general point that in the space of ten years, we have come from an economy that lost 120,000 jobs in construction and created well-nigh 500,000 jobs in other sectors.  That was a phenomenal transition.  I have read the stories of people who lost their job, took on Springboard, took on a traineeship, reinvented themselves and are back in that economy.  We need to make that easier for people to do.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s belief that the education and training boards, ETBs, are very well placed to do that.  We will be relying on them to respond to the change so that as retrofitting starts to take off, they are responding with the skill base.<\/p> <p>  I would argue with my former employer, the ESRI, saying that every nine houses we retrofit results in one less house being built.  Many colleagues I talk to say that there is not much house construction going on in many counties and constituencies.  There is capacity for people to do retrofitting in some areas not experiencing that sort of acute demand for housing and house building, and it does not have the displacement effect the Deputy spoke about.  However, I acknowledge that there is a capacity and we need to plan for it.  We are committed to doing that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy should not say that everybody will have to face a bill of &euro;50,000 to &euro;60,000.  If someone has a cavity wall, they can do that for &euro;2,000.  If one does not have one's attic insulated, one can do that for &euro;1,000.  One can put in heating controls.  Many things can be done that are not those huge asks, so to speak.  I agree we have to start to do deeper retrofits but we want to get one third of the houses retrofitted by 2030.  We want to get on a roadway where people are doing more of that.  For many homes that will be possible, and we will support them to do shallower things on a journey over time to deliver that.  We should not put people off by saying they might suddenly have to face a huge bill.  We can evolve that and develop the system.<\/p> <p>  On biogas, it goes back to the point made at the outset.  The reason we are reticent and saying we need to assess this is because, on the cost basis, it does not look as if it is in the area of the curve where we need to move immediately.  It is further up that curve and until we test and assess its capacity, we need to do more work to see the role biogas will play.  Many people say that burning biogas in a power station is not a good policy.  We are supporting it in combined heat and power situations where one is getting a much better bang for one's biogas buck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#M00400","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The Minister is talking about biomass there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#M00500","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>It is right to be more cautious about some of the technologies.

There is a great deal of joined-up thinking in it because of the comprehensive consideration given by this committee in producing its report, the Citizens' Assembly and the work done by the Minister and all the Departments with which he worked.  Notwithstanding that, it will be a massive challenge to achieve what the Minister is trying to achieve, which is to take carbon out of our economy and our lifestyles and, as a consequence, provide cleaner air, cleaner water and all the other good things that can flow from this.  We only have to look to Canada and Prime Minister Trudeau's green agenda, the <i>gilets jaunes<\/i>movement in France and the row-back on carbon tax.  This can be even more divisive than climate change, not to take from the changes in climate that result in catastrophes around the world.<\/p><p>The very people who say we should do something about climate change will not help one bit.  They do not have any solutions.  They are full of criticism.  While we can understand that the ordinary person can be fearful of so many changes and their cost, no solutions are being provided by the detractors.  That is the truth.  That is where dialogue is needed.  We have to remember that dialogue is about just transition.  How do we make it fair?  How do we balance it?  If we agree that something needs to be done - and it seems there is a general consensus to that effect - it is no longer enough to point the finger at agriculture, some other sector or somebody else.  This is tough and difficult.<\/p><p> This comes back to the issue of dialogue with the public.  A report prepared by NESC a couple of years ago examined delivery of renewable electricity.  One of the most significant issues was not cost but community acceptance.  It all goes back to that.  This is about how people feel about this in their individual communities and how it impacts on their lifestyles.  The Department of Finance is working on carbon tax and how it might look to facilitate that dialogue.  We are trying to find innovative ways to engage with the public.  At the moment, however, pursuant to our national planning framework, the regional assemblies are charged with the delivery of regional economic and spatial strategies.  We are talking about fundamentally overhauling lifestyles based on fossil fuels and the technologies emanating therefrom, including the internal combustion engine.  We have not invested in renewable energy.  This means that renewable electricity is now more expensive to deliver than electricity from conventional sources.  Can a specific climate change element be added to the ongoing process of developing regional spatial plans under the national planning framework?  That way people can be encouraged to engage.  This could be brought down to the level of local authority areas' development plans and co-ordinated with the regional climate change offices the Minister has established in the regions.  That joined-up thinking could help us determine where to put charging points, what we need to do and where to put infrastructure.  We must think about the bigger picture.  <\/p><p> Second, now that the all-of-Government climate action plan has been produced, will the Minister amend the draft national climate and energy plan he submitted to the European Commission in December, which is now in draft format?  I understand the Commission is to revert to the Department with its views.  In what way might that be changed?  There is a lot more consideration of and focus on climate change than ever before.  I would like to see how one document fits into the other. <\/p><p> Returning to the issue of communities, there is a lot of talk about microgeneration.  It is important that people feel they have a stake.  We will have to acknowledge the reality that most communities do not have the money to develop renewable energy projects.  We have to find other ways for people to enjoy the benefits.  I know the Minister's Department has a code of practice for wind farm development.  These projects are being developed at the moment.  Unfortunately, the envisaged community benefit is a lump sum per MW to the benefit of the community.  It gives no recognition to the fact that some people live beside wind farm infrastructure.  There needs to be another layer which benefits individual households.  I live near the Oweninny power wind farm, a joint venture of Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB Networks.  The community accepts it.  However, it is a sparse rural area.  The households immediately beside the site will get no particular gain.  They are looking for reduced electricity prices.  ESB Networks runs a near-neighbour scheme but there is no Government guidance on it.  The local authority does not seem to be able to deal with it.  <\/p><p> We have to recognise that some people will be asked to bear more of the burden than others.  There must be more than a community gain whereby money is given to a community centre 15 km up the road, which most people are never going to use.  I will bring further details to the Minister.  I have put it to the Chair that the committee must examine this issue in more depth, but I want to flag it with the Minister.  There is a deficit in the code of practice for wind farm development.<\/p><p> I commend the objective of decarbonising transport.  There have been a lot of contributions from the city folk among us.  I can see that if I lived in Dublin or Galway I would need public transport.  However, when the commentary turns to rural areas, it sounds like a parallel universe.  We need roads to put the buses on.  We will not get a bus every ten minutes as one can do in a city.  It is not enough to rubbish the idea of electric vehicles or say they are insufficient.  We need roads so that all the development and economic and social growth does not end up in the cities.  There are whole regions, the west and north west, which did not get roads during the Celtic tiger era.  They are acknowledged as being disadvantaged as a result.  This veers into unreality, like some of the talk about agriculture.  The idea of not spending money on roads is crazy.  We will not be putting a train into every village and up every b&oacute;ithr&iacute;n in rural Ireland.  It is one thing to tick a box.  There is no comparison with something running every ten minutes.<\/p><p> The best initiative for rural Ireland is the national broadband plan.  Broadband means people will not have to get into their cars.  The sooner that can be rolled out the better.  There is a lot of talk about the market, commercial investment and intervention.  They has all been tried.  We should support the national broadband plan.  It is not commercially attractive and that is why the Government has to spend money on it.  There has been so much warped commentary on the plan when it is exactly what is needed for connectivity in rural Ireland.  That is not just relevant to economic growth; it also pertains to medical interventions in the future, remote diagnosis, etc.<\/p><p> I refer also to the SEAI and its better energy warmer homes scheme funding.  As the Minister correctly pointed out, the most disadvantaged people in our society, who qualify for fuel allowance, get their homes retrofitted 100% free of charge, which  is welcome.  I want to ask the Minister about a current issue that I have flagged and that has not gone away-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#M02000","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":67,"content":"<p>The Senator must be very brief.

There is a problem in the SEAI, and I would like a clarification on when they will be paid.  People are looking for their houses to be retrofitted.  When will that be done?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I welcome the approach taken in agriculture whereby we will seek to implement the objectives in the Teagasc report, which provides a roadmap for this sector.  Agriculture is big in our county because we do not have heavy industry.  That is why it accounts for so much of our emissions.  Several members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I had occasion to meet delegations from China, Russia and other countries outside the European Union.  They do not have a bit of interest in carbon emissions reduction.  They wanted to compare notes on the experiences and challenges of farmers.  Their farmers do not have the equivalent of the CAP.  However I would like further strides to be made in recognising the efforts made to date by our farmers in the dairy and beef sectors and across the board in reducing carbon emissions per unit.<\/p><p>Our farmers should be championed for more carbon-efficient production.   Food is not an optional extra.  We need to eat and we want our food to be produced in the most carbon-efficient way.  Our farmers should be championed for their efforts in that regard.

We are seeking to do several things to build that up.  One is that every public body, such as local authorities and the HSE, is being asked to adopt a climate change mandate.  I hope that public leaders in every community will adopt a strategy and attitude in their interactions with clients, suppliers and workers that this is a change we need to make.  The Senator's local authority is taking a leadership role in that regard and has an ambition to have a carbon-neutral strategy.<\/p> <p>  Her suggestion to use the regional spatial strategies to embrace the physical change is a good one.  If I announced 100 years ago that an underground tank containing highly inflammable fuel was to be installed in every village and that people would be expected to dip into it to fill up their cars, there would be a huge reaction against that proposal, but petrol stations are now part of the furniture.  There is a garage with a forecourt in every town and village and people do not bat an eyelid.  This will involve change.  We are not used to the technology or infrastructures we need to be sustainable.  Rather, we are used to the infrastructures that make us unsustainable.  As the Senator pointed out, there is a real issue in terms of how we socialise that structural change in our society.  We are trying to maximise community gain and participation, including local people being close to facilities that are being provided having sustainable energy communities and having mandates for every public body.  As a result of the green schools programme, many children go home and lecture their parents on the weaknesses of some of their behaviour.  We are starting to wheel that scrum, but there is far more to be done.<\/p> <p>  We will amend the national energy and climate plan, NECP, such as in respect of the new target we are adopting for renewables.  In the previous NECP we put our hands up and admitted that a target of 75 million tonnes was to be met, that 16 million tonnes of the target would be met from what we were doing and that another 58 million tonnes had to be found.  We will show how we hope to find those 58 million tonnes across various areas of activity.<\/p> <p>  I fully agree with the Senator that balanced regional development constitutes a real and sustained challenge.  On the national broadband plan, the reason we made that decision was not to bring ire on our heads about the cost of the project but, rather, because we believed that &euro;2.5 billion spread over the next 25 years is a correct investment to future-proof rural Ireland.  I will defend that decision to the last.  It is the right thing to do and we will be proven right in spite of the short-term push-back which exists.  It is right that everything be cross-examined and due diligence applied but we are making the right decisions.<\/p> <p>  Like every other scheme, a budget was allocated for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, scheme and the SEAI must stay within budget.  There is no doubt that one of the features of 100% grants is that demand grows exponentially when such grants are available.  We need to move to area-based schemes which involve big blocks of work being done together, some of parts of which will be 100% grant funded while other parts will receive lower levels of contribution.  It will be a better model when we develop that alternative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#O00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Has the budget been spent?

I was chairing a meeting of another committee.  I thank the Minister for attending.  I hope we can have a further engagement with him on a line-by-line basis, if time allows, at some future date.  Our committee has 42 recommendations, whereas 183 actions are outlined in the Government's report.  I perceive a gap between the all-party committee's recommendations and the Government's position.  Notwithstanding the positive aspirations in its approach, I hope the entire Government can work with the joint committee to iron out some of the gaps.  One such gap relates, as Deputy Pringle indicated, to the relevant legislation.  There is a sense of urgency on the part of the joint committee in respect of the need to put in place, sooner rather than later, a legislative base for the legally-binding targets leading to 2030 and, thereafter, the net zero target for 2050, which is one of the recommendations.  I am a little concerned that the Government's approach means that a Bill might not be published until next March and that it would not be enacted until the end of 2020.  Another year could conceivably pass before we address the binding targets.  The Minister might comment on that point.<\/p> <p>  The second and probably more important aspect relates to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 60 million tonnes to 33 million by 2030.  In the Government's plan, I do not see clear metrics on how we will do this and adhere to the 2030 targets.  Respectfully, having worked with the Minister in other Departments and knowing what he has delivered, I am worried that there might be slippage and that we might overshoot the 2030 targets in favour of an aspiration to net zero by 2050.  By 2030, however, we may still be far off target for our commitments under the Paris Agreement of 2015.  I wonder whether there should be a greater sense of urgency for clear, bespoke actions.  For community energy, rural transport, active travel and the rewetting of peatlands, for example, my fear is that within the Government, there will be a siloed approach, without a proper reporting mechanism or smacht for individual Departments to deliver on those actions.  If there is not a properly overarching Cabinet sub-committee or a robust climate action delivery board, I worry that Departments will slip in their obligations to deliver on climate action.  Respectfully, it is not enough for the Government to appear before the committee and say it is for, say, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, to examine the rewetting of peatlands in view of the fact that we already have evidence, through our deliberations in the committee, that only 1% of peatlands in Ireland are under rehabilitation or restoration.  I would like to hear the whole-of-Government approach to that rather than having to wait from the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#Q00300","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy have more questions?

I see the process as iterative.  If Oireachtas recommendations need to be developed, we will work with the committee to develop them where they can be shown to be cost-effective in a transition.  It is important we choose to make the changes in the correct order, as we have taken great care to do.  The only reason we were able to bring every Department with us to sign up to the targets we set is because we showed they were based on the least burdensome approach.  We have been able to tell people that if they wish to have their obligation waived, they should know they are opting for a more expensive change to be made in some other sector.  That approach has been important to bring everyone to the starting line.  Even if there is something else we could do, as the Deputy suggested, we must ensure that it is done in the right order.  There is no reluctance to bring forward legislation.  From hard experience, however, as the Deputy will know as well as I, having legislation processed through the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, the committee and so on is slow.  It will be challenging to meet the objectives.<\/p> <p>  We do, in fact, have a binding target.  It runs until 2030 and penalties are attached.  In the plan, we have set sectoral targets and Ministers will be accountable for achieving them.  The legislation will slice the targets into five-year blocks and provide for more forensic analysis.  Sectoral targets are already included in the plan. <\/p> <p>  The Deputy is worried we are not making sufficient effort in the period to 2030 but I have adopted what one might call a precautionary principle.  I have not assumed a trajectory of high oil prices to pretend we do not need to make changes but rather that oil prices will stay low and, therefore, we have to plan for more structural change, not less.  Moreover, I have not banked on the &euro;18.8 million flexibility, where one can switch from earnings we would receive in the emissions trading system, ETS, sector to offset changes we ought to make in non-ETS sectors.  It is a real, demanding target that outlines the detail of what changes need to be made to underpin it.  There will be an obligation on Departments.  In the coming weeks, there will be a delivery board within the Department of the Taoiseach overseeing the delivery of the 183 actions.  We will not wait for a legislative underpinning to put in place that type of accountability.  There will also be the Estimate.  In any year where an obligation is put on the State, if we do not meet the target, it will not be shown in my Department, as is now the case, but in the relevant Department.  It will be more closely attached, therefore, to the sector that falls short.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#Q00600","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>On carbon budgeting, does the Minister envisage providing a figure for the amount saved in net tonnage?

They are frightened and afraid about what the future holds for them.  They would not mind if the plan was practical and introduced gradually but it sets targets and deadlines without providing proper funding to people to implement the changes the Minister says they will have to make.  People are telling me that the reason for this urgency and hullabaloo is that the Green Party won a few seats in the local and European elections and Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are tripping over themselves to be greener than the Green Party.  The people are going to be sandwiched in between and will suffer.  A very honourable, fine gentleman in the village of Brosna told me at midnight the other night that people could listen, accept changes and try to do their best but he asked why the other larger economies and countries are not being asked to do the same.  Why do they not face the same deadlines and targets?  He told me that Ireland has 0.06% of the world's population while China and India have 40% between them.  There are no deadlines or targets on them.  Why are we being targeted?  Why is our little country being targeted?  They are the questions I am being asked.<\/p> <p>  This is going to hurt farmers and self-employed people in rural Ireland because they have to travel.  People are used to heating their houses with turf they have cut themselves and because they have to travel long distances to go to work or wherever else, they have to use cars.  They have no other transport.  People in rural Ireland will not be provided with public transport.  They will need their car.  They will also need their tractor.  On my farm I have a 1995 tractor, so it is coming up on 30 years old.  I am no different from anyone else.  That is what they have.  A tractor is a long-term investment for a farmer.  I have not seen any electric tractors so I do not know how practical they are.  Who is going to subsidise people to buy them?  Farmers are only barely surviving as it is.  They are not going to be allowed to cut turf or burn timber when there are trees falling down all around them.  This plan is not practical.  If it was practical people would listen to it.  Farmers have invested great sums in slatted tanks and environmental measures.  They are now being told that they will have to reduce production.  Looking back, they were told every day that they would have to increase production to stay viable.

We will be delayed if I go on.  There are a few things there.  Why does the Government not remove the VAT from low-emission slurry spreading equipment?  The Minister says that forestry eats up carbon but at the same time there is a great deal of marginal land in south Kerry and other parts of the county but farmers will not be given grants to plant on it.  They will be given grants to plant on good ground - green ground, as it is called - but they will not be given grants to plant on marginal ground.  There is also a problem in that when storms knock down the forestry, as has happened, there is no grant to replant it.  If the Government was serious about planting trees, it could help people in that regard.  There are people who cannot cut down their forestry.  They get their last grant payment 15 years after planting but it is not viable to cut it until 30 years have passed.  It is there and is doing the country good but, as a farmer who came to me the other day said, the farmers are getting nothing for it.<\/p> <p>  There is also another type of farmer.  At one point in February there were 140 farmers who could not take out their timber and replant because they were prevented from getting planning permission for roads by serial objectors.  I have asked this question in the D&aacute;il; what is going to be done about these serial objectors?  These are real issues.  <\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of designations, such as that for the hen harrier.  A farmer cannot establish forestry on land that is designated for hen harriers.  At the same time, right on the other side of the ditch, forestry that was planted 20 or 25 years ago is growing fine.  The hen harrier has no problem going into the forested area.

There are no such obligations in this plan.  Those who are shocked or frightened should be reassured by that.  Equally, however, we have to recognise that we are starting on a journey of change on which Ireland and the people whom the Deputy represents are extremely exposed.  Many of our enterprises, farms, towns, villages and homes are at risk in a world that is changing rapidly.  One only has to listen to young people coming home and saying that our generation is failing to understand that this is real.  It is real in Kerry, just as it is real in any other area.  If farmers want a future and want strong family farming to survive, they also have to start thinking about the changes that need to be made to copper-fasten the future of family farm income.<\/p> <p>  The sort of changes they are being asked to make are absolutely sensible.  Many of them will pay for themselves over their lifetime.  A new Common Agricultural Policy is coming and 40% of the income support for farmers under it will be dependent on farmers demonstrating that they are making changes that will improve the environment and reduce carbon impact.  There will be recognition of farmers who are making the pioneering change but by making that pioneering change, they will also be better placing their farms to thrive in the future.  I have been on trade missions and the people who buy our products are asking about their environmental certification.  We are being asked to show evidence that the methods we use are sustainable.   That is what is being asked.  If we want premium margins for our agricultural produce because of its quality and Origin Green certification, we have to make these changes.  These measures are in the interests of our communities, whether rural or urban.<\/p><p>In many ways they are more in the interests of rural communities, because of the exported nature of much of the produce of rural Ireland.  The figure is 90%.  They are dependent on these international markets.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the question of China and India.  China and India are part of the United Nations agreement.  They are making the changes but they are starting from a position of a far lower impact on global carbon emissions and greenhouse gases than we are.  They are far below us.  For us to say we are not willing to make the change because people in poor countries that are at a far earlier stage of development and that have not been part of the fossil boom should make more changes than us does not stand up to scrutiny.  If we went to Europe or the UN and tried to advocate that those of us in Ireland, which is one of the wealthy countries, are going to sit on our hands waiting for China and India to make the changes, others would rightly say that it was a contemptible position to take up.<\/p><p> We have to be part of a change that has to happen globally.  There is no easy way around this.  If we want to pass on our environment in a better state to our children and the coming generations, then we have to start making these changes now.  The window of opportunity to do that is narrow.  A tipping point is coming when the environmental damage done by carbon emissions is going to accelerate, not decelerate, and these changes are upon us.<\/p><p> It is entirely wrong for Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's friend to suggest this part of an election result.  This committee and the Citizens' Assembly have been working for months in detailed hearings.  This was nothing to do with an election result.  Having said that, the election result perhaps does reflect the importance this issue has for our world and our country.  It is timely that we, as a political grouping of all parties, are showing that we are facing up to this.  We unanimously adopted the plan produced by the committee, including the Deputy.  There was not a single dissenting voice in declaring a climate emergency or in adopting the plan that is highly influential in what we are doing.<\/p><p> I believe these are the right things to do.  We will try to ease the passage for people, whether farmers or householders.  There will be supports from the State but we cannot pay for everything.  We are going to have to try to design policies that help people to make these changes.  At some point we will have to say it is time to stop doing X, for example, stop putting oil boilers into new houses.  That is the sort of change I have in mind.  It is sensible.  Why commit or lock down houses into a fossil system that will become more and more expensive for households to run?  We are asking people to do sensible things that are part of a pathway to help our communities to be resilient in future in a rapidly changing environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#R00900","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I have to bring in Deputy Martin Kenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019061900002#S00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I need clarity on one thing.

I am learning something here.  I want to focus on agriculture mainly and on the custodians of the land and the opportunity that may be there for them in future.<\/p> <p>  Forestry has been mentioned as one of the major methods of sequestering carbon.  There is a vast amount of forestry in Leitrim.  We have more than our fair share at this stage.  Almost 30% of the land is covered at this stage.  The forestry is mainly Sitka spruce and there is monoculture and so on.  I do not intend to get into that discussion with the Minister.  I want to talk about some of the issues that could make a major difference but are not currently.  For example, every farmer in rural Ireland gets Pillar 1 payments through the Common Agricultural Policy.  They are required to submit a map that shows the land parcel.  Each land parcel is divided by hedgerow.  Farmers submit the land parcel map.  They have so many hectares for payments.  Then, a photograph is taken from outer space.  If the hedgerow happens to be growing out wider and the farmer loses half a metre along the length of the hedgerow, he is penalised and could lose up to 20% of his payment.  That is probably 20% of the farmer's income.  Indeed, in some cases the payment from Europe is more than 100% of the farmer's farm income.  A simple change would be to say that a clump of whins on the side of the field can be included as part of the land parcel rather than immediately punishing farmers for it.  Everywhere I go around the country I see hedgerows cut to the stump.  Farmers do not want to do that but they are being penalised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for not allowing them to grow.<\/p> <p>  Another issue I want to raise relates to new sectors.  It has been mentioned that we need to develop new sectors in agriculture.  The plastics sector is one possibility.  Plant cellulose could be used to make plastics that are biodegradable.  This will not happen by farmers doing it on their own.  To develop a sector large enough to be sustainable in future, farmers need to work in partnership with big business or Government.  Will the Minister leave it to the market to find that solution?  Is the Government prepared to play a role to ensure that these sectors can develop?  Hemp is one obvious material.  The hemp sector could provide income for farmers and provide a solution for our biodegradable plastics problem.

Where a state decides to do it, it creates rigidity that is hard to replicate.  Bord na M&oacute;na is an exception because of its long history, but it is looking for technologies to adopt.  It is a State company that is diversifying and looking for new technologies.  We should not say the State is going to go into a new wheeze we have identified.  Let it emerge in the usual way.

I am joined by Mr. Eddie Ward, principal officer with responsibility for special education section in the Department.  Ms Madeline Hickey of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is in the Gallery.<\/p> <p>  We welcome this opportunity to appear before the committee today to discuss the issues raised in Petition No. P00011\/18 regarding mandatory training on spectrum disorders for teachers.  To assist the committee we have provided a briefing note for circulation to members for today&rsquo;s meeting.  That note provides an overview of policy developments and provision in the area of inclusive education and forms the basis of our presentation.  I note that the focus of the petition is primarily on the need to educate the educators.  This aim is fully shared by the Department and I hope to demonstrate today that there have been substantial developments in recent years.  This has occurred in both initial teacher education, ITE, and in continual professional development for serving teachers with the aim of supporting teachers&rsquo; knowledge and understanding of the specific needs of children with special educational needs, including those with spectrum disorders including dyspraxia, sensory processing disorders and dyslexia as well as autism and other spectrum disorders.<\/p> <p>  I note also that the petition suggests that the desired objective could be achieved by making training mandatory.  In his response to this committee on this issue in May, the Secretary General of the Department advised that inclusive education, including the education of children with special educational needs, is already a mandatory part of the standards for initial teacher education.  The Teaching Council&rsquo;s accreditation process for initial teacher education programmes is the mechanism through which the council can satisfy itself that its standards are being met through a given ITE programme.<\/p> <p>  The Secretary General also noted that, at present, no mandatory professional learning is required of teachers after they have completed initial teacher education and induction.<\/p><p>In this context, section 33 of the Teaching Council Act provides that the Teaching Council may make renewal of registration subject to having completed an accredited programme of continuing professional development, CPD.  To inform and support the development of Cos&aacute;n, the national framework for teachers&rsquo; learning, the Teaching Council implemented a comprehensive, multilayered consultation process in 2014 and 2015.  Some 5,000 teachers contributed to the process, and the feedback was rich and helpful in informing the drafting of the framework, the purpose of which is to ensure there is a mechanism through which there could be further consideration of mandatory CPD.  Findings from the process identified that teachers are very interested in opportunities to engage in high-quality professional learning activities that are relevant to their needs and those of their pupils and that enhance teaching and learning in their classrooms.  Allied with this deep interest in professional learning is a strong interest in personal development and in the types of collaborative learning and professional conversations that take place in schools on formal and informal bases.  The findings are confirmed by the strong demand for professional learning opportunities provided by the Department through its funded professional development services including the professional development service for teachers, the junior cycle team, the national induction programme and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, along with other professional learning opportunities, about which I will speak further. <\/p><p> In considering the question of mandatory CPD, it is important to consider any evidence to indicate that a mandatory approach to CPD would enhance teachers&rsquo; practice and ensure that teachers are taking account of the diversity and complexity of learners&rsquo; needs, especially in a special education context.  The evidence gathered thus far by the Teaching Council has led it to the conclusion that ongoing learning by teachers should be encouraged and incentivised to ensure authentic engagement in a way that is sustainable and impactful.  Through the Cos&aacute;n development process, the council is exploring with the profession how this can be done.  The Department will be guided by advice supported by appropriate evidence when considering the broader question of linking teacher registration to the completion of accredited courses.  At this time, the Department is of the view there is much more work to be done before such a move should be considered.  In the material provided for the committee, we have included details of provision for professional development and, therefore, I do not propose to list the entire provision in my remarks.  Nevertheless, I point members to the supports available to teachers through the NSCE.  The council's remit is to develop schools' capacity to support students with special educational needs, including those with spectrum disorders, and to promote a continuum of educational provision that is inclusive and responsive.  The NCSE is responsible for the allocation of additional teaching and care supports to schools to support children with special educational needs.  In addition, the NCSE support services provide additional professional development supports for teachers of children with special educational needs.  In this way, the NCSE fulfils a vital role in enhancing the quality of teaching and learning in the area of special needs provision.  CPD and other in-school supports provided by the NCSE are designed to enable teachers to adopt evidence based approaches to teaching students in special and mainstream classes and special schools.  The focus of professional development is on enhancing teachers&rsquo; understanding of the nature of the special educational need, including autism and other spectrum disorders, and the learning and teaching implications for each individual student and teacher; enhancing teachers&rsquo; use of a variety of interventions and teaching approaches for students based on the assessed needs of the students and taking account of empirical research; and enabling teachers to assess, plan and implement effective and differentiated teaching strategies with a view to meeting the needs of students through individualised planning, which I will address further.  <\/p><p> To support children with autism, the NCSE support service and the Middletown Centre for Autism operate co-operatively on the provision of CPD for teachers in the area of autism spectrum disorders. The Middletown centre, based in County Armagh, is a joint North-South initiative established in 2007 with funding provided by the then Department of Education and Science, along with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.  Its purpose is to support the promotion of excellence in the development and co-ordination of education services to children and young people with autism.  There is also a range of other Department-funded CPD supports provided through other support services and delivered throughout the national network of 21 whole-time and nine part-time education centres, as well as in primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  When designing CPD for delivery to teachers, all support services must take account of the needs of all learners, including students with spectrum disorders and all students with special educational needs.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention.  We are happy to answer any questions they may have.  We look forward to engagement with Mr. Harris.

Whether we are discussing the need for additional autism classes, the special needs assistant, SNA, scheme, reduced timetables, better outcomes for autistic students or children out of school, the issue of teacher training cannot but be central.  It is no surprise to us that it has been brought to the attention of this committee by concerned parents and we congratulate Ms Boles and others who took the initiative to get the matter on the committee's agenda.<\/p> <p>  By way of context, I am the founder and CEO of AsIAm, Ireland&rsquo;s national autism charity.  We will be five years old this year.  We endeavour to bring about an autism-friendly Ireland, that is, a society where every autistic person is respected and accepted as they are and has the opportunity to participate in every aspect of Irish life.  Central to this aim is an inclusive education system that universally respects and values autistic students and their unique way of communicating, understanding and interacting with the world.  It is important that we treat it as an accessibility issue.  In the context of the discussion about mandatory training for mainstream teachers, we must recognise that the right to access mainstream education is enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<\/p> <p>  We are at something of a crossroads in respect of autism access to education in Ireland.  A total of 86% of autistic students enrolled in school now attend a mainstream school, which is a sea change compared with the norm perhaps 20 years ago.  As a young child, I spent the first three years of my education in a special school due to a complete lack of support or knowledge of autism in the mainstream school system at the time.  It is clear to us, however, that while the quantity of children attending mainstream school has vastly increased, the quality of their experiences is greatly varied and significant change is required to ensure that every autistic student has a positive, empowering school experience.  Sadly, that is not currently the case.  Every week, my team deals with cases of autistic children being disciplined because of their autism and how they may interact with others or due to high levels of anxiety.  We also deal with children who do not have a school place or are on reduced timetables, often because of a lack of suitable teacher training, and a sense of rejection when a child is not understood, respected and celebrated within a school environment.   <\/p> <p>  To include autistic students meaningfully, there are numerous essential ingredients.  Schools must be adequately resourced, that is, they must have access to the staff numbers, capitation and clinical expertise they require to include students universally, a point which is repeatedly raised.  The environment of schools must be autism friendly.  When we consider accessibility, we often think of wheelchair ramps and lifts but we often overlook the sensory needs of autistic students in busy, loud and often congested mainstream school environments.  Even buildings currently being constructed lack autism proofing in their design.  School policies must be autism proofed.  Policies that, for example, deal with discipline, assessment and enrolment cannot remain the same as before the introduction of autism inclusion in school.  They must reflect the specific support needs of a cohort of students who may need to do things in a substantially different way to get through stressful school days, which affects the culture of schools, including the language we use to describe autistic students.  Everyone in a school community must be informed and respectful of autism.  This includes peers, parents, non-teaching staff and members of the boards of management.  Perhaps most critically, all teachers within a school must understand and accept their role in teaching students on the autism spectrum and must be able to access whatever training they need to provide a differentiated, accessible education for such students. <\/p> <p>  I have outlined these different issues because it is right that we understand meeting the needs of autistic students as something of an ecosystem as opposed to any one action.  Although we are in attendance to speak specifically about teacher training, it is important we also acknowledge the need for the State to do more to support schools.  For those who may not be very familiar with autism, it is perhaps useful to provide a short explanation of the condition and why, as a result, students may need teachers to be further equipped to support them.  Autism is a lifelong developmental condition that relates to how a person communicates and interacts with others and how they experience the world around them.  In practical terms, this means that autistic students may communicate in a different way from others.<\/p><p>This might include using alternative communication systems as opposed to speech, understanding language very literally or not using facial expression or body language in the same way as other people.  A student might see detail as opposed to the bigger picture.  A student might not be able to fill in the blanks in social situations as other people can.  If a student perceives his or her environment very differently from others, this may lead to sensory overload and significant discomfort.  When these issues are misunderstood, it is easy for breakdowns in communication to occur, frustration to develop and a lack of understanding to become evident.  Unfortunately, we often take a deficit approach to autism.  If we accept that autistic people sometimes need to do things differently, we can unlock the potential of students whose insight is different from others and who often excel in areas in which they are most interested.<br\/><br\/>Given that one in 65 students in our education system has a diagnosis of autism and that autism is a vast spectrum, with every autistic person having different levels of need and different challenges and strengths, it is easy to see that every teacher will encounter many autistic students in his or her career and will need to have the capacity to adjust his or her pedagogy and classroom environment accordingly.  We can think about this from an accessibility point of view.  If a teacher does not have these skills, the school is not accessible for students.  Many teachers are already taking action in this regard.  AsIAm has been inundated with requests from schools to access training and talks during Croke Park agreement hours.  The Middletown Centre for Autism is playing a vital role in providing a range of high-quality free training to teachers across the island of Ireland.  We are lucky to meet incredible teachers every week who have learnt about autism through their own initiative, and are now playing a vital role in ensuring their students can fully participate and succeed.  However, <i>ad hoc<\/i>efforts like this are simply not enough.  This cannot be optional because inclusion is not optional.<br\/><br\/>The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 is 15 years old.  If we consider this in the context of a student&rsquo;s journey through school, we will understand that a generation of students is now ageing out of the school system.  It is regrettable that not enough has been done in that time to ensure every teacher knows and understands autism.  Autism education does not constitute a compulsory element of initial teacher education.  There is no mandatory training for existing teachers.  Many teachers who are assigned to autism classes have little or no training on the condition prior to taking up their posts.  This is a recipe for disaster because it places students and teachers in an entirely unacceptable position.  Unfortunately, many students are being failed today as a result.  I am sad to report that we hear each week from students who have fallen out of school or are attending school irregularly.  A key factor in these cases is teachers who are not equipped to meet the needs of autistic students.  This must stop.<br\/><br\/>I would like to make some practical recommendations to the joint committee.  Autism training must form a compulsory requirement of initial teacher education, in line with recommendations already made to the Department and the Teaching Council by the National Council for Special Education.  As I have explained, autism is counter-intuitive in many respects.  As a result, it requires teachers to have a discrete knowledge of the condition.  Autism training can improve their overall teaching skills.  Mary Immaculate College in Thurles has taken the first steps in this direction.  I encourage the committee to learn more about its rationale for making this decision and to encourage all other initial teacher education institutes to follow suit.<br\/><br\/>There is also a need for a national programme of training and continuous professional development for all teachers in autism and other disabilities.  We need to get beyond the concept of autism being the purview of any one teacher.  It must be the responsibility of every teacher in every school.  We welcome the similar calls that have been made by teacher unions.  We urge the Department to commence consultation with stakeholders on what such a training programme should include and how it should be conducted.  While I recognise that an evidence base is needed in this regard, it stands to reason that if a teacher does not have the knowledge to meet the needs of an autistic student, that student would be better served if the teacher were to acquire that knowledge.  That is pretty intuitive.<br\/><br\/>Our next recommendation relates to the range of offering.  It continues to be the case that a significant cohort of students who need autism classes or special school places cannot access them.  Greater consideration must be given to the voices of parents when decisions are being made about school placements.  Teachers in special classes must have advanced training and significant expertise.  When we talk about training, we must remember that the people best placed to provide insight into their access needs and strengths are autistic students.  In our work with young people, we have found that when students are not consulted on how they are supported, this reduces their self-esteem and their openness to accepting help.  The voice of students must be built into the individualised planning process for autism because it is true that someone who has met one autistic student has met one autistic student.<br\/><br\/>I would like to highlight a positive example of partnership between educational stakeholders and our organisation.  AsIAm, in partnership with the joint managerial body and the Irish Primary Principals Network, has developed a reflective online tool for teachers and schools to explore their own practice regarding autism.  This will include three hours of free online training for every teacher in the country, aimed at a whole-school level of understanding.  We will pilot this programme with 200 schools in September.  Schools and teachers are often asked to be autism-friendly without a clear or fair picture of what this looks like.  We hope this tool and training will help to make that relationship attainable.  Teachers can massively improve the lives of autistic students.  The teachers I had in school made such a difference in my life.  The profession is already doing a lot, but we must put in place supports and standards to ensure inclusive practice is a universal reality in our education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019061900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.  I am delighted to participate in this discussion with the stakeholders.  Parents approach Deputies and Senators on a weekly basis to look for supports for their children.  It is commonplace and is becoming more commonplace.  I welcome this discussion.  I have two questions.  What is Mr. Mulkerrins's assessment of what we have heard from Mr. Harris?  Where can common ground be found?  I ask Mr. Mulkerrins to share some of the Department's experiences of hearing from parents and boards of management about the supports that are needed.  There is a conversational style of open and frank debate at this committee.  I would appreciate it if Mr. Mulkerrins could address some of the points that have been made by Mr. Harris.<\/p> <p>  When Mr. Harris, who is very welcome, was speaking about autistic students at the beginning of his presentation, he mentioned that the quality of their experiences is very different across the board.  Has his organisation assessed the demographics of that?  Are these differences geographically based?  Has an effort been made to drill down into the reasons for this different quality of experience?  Mr. Harris mentioned teacher training as well.  He also stated that teachers must understand and respect their roles.  He mentioned that one in 65 students in our education system has a diagnosis of autism, which certainly stacks up from our perspective in light of the experiences we have on a weekly basis.  He further stated that each student who presents with a diagnosis has different levels of need and different challenges and strengths.  Therein lies the problem in terms of the requirements for teachers and the challenges they face.  Mr. Harris spoke about the training required by teachers to acquire the different set of skills that is needed.  Can common ground be reached with the Department as it seeks to face the challenges that have been outlined by Mr. Harris and with which his organisation is dealing?  We can see from our work that this is a very complex area.  We are not trained to deal with it.  Mr. Harris's organisation, the Department and society in general want to see a far more welcoming attitude.<\/p> <p>  I disagree with the suggestion in the petition that our educational system has not changed much since it was introduced during the Industrial Revolution.  I can see the education system that my children are enjoying in primary school.  It is far more welcoming, inclusive and open than the system I was brought up in.  It welcomes all children's strengths and weaknesses in the classroom setting.  The petition is unfair in that respect.  I would appreciate a response to the questions I have asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019061900002#E00200","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised a number of issues and asked me to respond in general to the points made by Mr. Harris.  I would be happy to do so.  I will begin by making a couple of technical points.  The petition relates to the experiences of children with spectrum disorders.  It does not refer specifically to autism.  I do not want to get into the personal details of the petitioner's child.  Our comments have a broader focus than autism.  I acknowledge that autism is the avenue we are likely to follow because it accounts for the overwhelming majority of children with spectrum disorders within schools.  I am of the view that we can agree on this.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge Mr. Harris's point about AsIAm being inundated with requests for training.  I welcome that level of demand, to be frank, because it speaks to the willingness of the teaching profession to seek out and access opportunities for learning.  The experience I would like to outline speaks enormously about the value of what has been traditionally been referred to as CPD.<\/p><p>Mr. Harris pointed to the NCSE's recommendation on mandatory training for teachers teaching children with autism.  In 2013 and 2015, the NCSE recommended that there should be mandatory CPD.  In that context, work is under way at the moment both within the Teaching Council, the NCSE, and collaboratively between the two, to develop the framework for CPD.  We would all agree that it would not be very effective for the Department to simply issue a circular from next Monday or 1 September saying it would be mandatory for teachers to undertake training on autism.  One has to develop the training and ensure the training is appropriate, recognises the needs and contexts of children and also that it is capable of being translated into better practice within the school.  One then needs a framework for the evaluation of that.  Otherwise, it would be meaningless as well.  We fully acknowledge that there is work to be done in that regard.  The Department's concern is that before we get into the space of deciding that there should be a mandatory component on CPD that we would have the evidence base to underpin the decision and that is just not there yet, but work is under way.<\/p><p> I also acknowledge the point made by Mr. Harris that Dr. Finn &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, head of education in Mary Immaculate College on the St. Patrick's Campus in Thurles has introduced autism in the initial teacher education training courses.  That is one good example of practice.  Dr. &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has a background in working with the special education section of the Department and continues to inform it of best practice in this area.  He also had a significant engagement with the Middletown Centre for Autism.  There is a wealth of inter-agency activity, engagement and consultation happening in this space.<\/p><p> I wish to make a broader point, namely, that we have probably come from a difficult enough period perhaps 15 or 20 years ago when there was little in the way of additional provision and inclusion was not the language of the education system.  In a very short period, the level of resources provided to support the inclusion of children in education has increased exponentially .  During my time in the area of special education, the entire budget has increased from approximately &euro;880 million to &euro;1.8 billion.  Such was the commitment of the Government and the Department to support children's education, and specifically the education of children with special educational needs, that it was done over the ten years of the worst economic depression that the country has ever experienced.  That has seen a significant increase in the number of additional teachers to support special education.  We are now at in excess of 15,000 teachers and we just reached 16,000 SNAs from a very low base in the mid-1990s of approximately 300.  Approximately one third of the adult population within schools is specifically related now to special education, particularly when one adds in the number of teachers teaching special classes and the number of teachers who teach in special schools.  The investment is significant.  That has encouraged a significant increase in the number of children who are being included.  We are working at breakneck pace to try to ensure that those teachers are supported in order to ensure that there is best practice within schools.<\/p><p> We acknowledge that at a time of substantial change there will always be examples where one will find that the best things are not necessarily happening or where decisions within schools are not necessarily the best decisions in the context of, for example, the assignment of teachers to special classes or the assignment of teachers with special needs responsibilities.  It is around those concerns that the NCSE has made most of its recommendations on training and qualification structures.  The recommendations are now being actively interrogated in the context of the consultation and development work that the NCSE and the Teaching Council are doing.  The Teaching Council's exercise, which I referred to in my opening remarks, on engagement with the teaching profession has satisfied it and we in the Department are convinced that there is a ready openness on the part of the teachers to engage.  There is openness and willingness to engage in professional learning, including the formal and informal conversations in the schools and within the training opportunities that are provided, both by the NCSE and the Teaching Council through the education centres and all of the other training opportunities that are available, including Mr. Harris's organisation, AsIAm.  The willingness to engage in training and the positivity towards it is what we are trying to identify better and to base the future on rather than simply engaging in a box-ticking exercise.  I use the words somewhat advisedly because in preparing for the meeting we looked at where there is evidence of a mandatory CPD programme.  Since the introduction of its mandatory programme in 2011, the Medical Council has published a report indicating that in many respects the mandatory CPD programme for doctors is regarded as a point of contention, a box-ticking exercise and does not speak to a quality of provision.<\/p><p> In terms of ensuring that it translates properly into schools, the Department is currently examining the Looking at our School document, which we use to ensure that schools are self-reflective in terms of their practice , that they are understanding of all of the different contexts within their schools - for example, that assignments are conducted appropriately - and that leadership and school management are conducted appropriately.  That document speaks significantly about the inclusion of children with special educational needs and other diversity issues, including for example, disadvantage.  We are currently reviewing that and we are conscious that there is an opportunity to bring all of our service providers, the PDST and the NIPT, which are responsible for induction training of teachers, and the JCT and the NCSE, together to ensure that there is coherence between development work and how that translates into best practice within schools.  As members are aware, the inspectorate is a mechanism through which we look to see how schools are being effective in terms of practice.  In the context of whole-school evaluations, inspectors will typically look at what the schools are doing in respect of the implementation of all that good stuff in the Looking at Our School document.  There is a lot happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019061900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Mulkerrins","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I will respond to some of the questions from Deputy Cassells.  He asked where we have seen examples of a differentiation in quality.  In the first instance, we have probably seen it at a very anecdotal level in that we do meet many young people and families who are having positive experiences in schools and who attribute that to the teacher in the class or the teachers in the school.  Inversely, the organisation receives approximately 70 queries a month from families.  Consistently, the top five issues are school issues concerning the support they receive within schools, the appropriate management of the resources Departments are giving them, engagement with parents by teachers and disciplinary processes.  To give an example of the latter, if a student who is autistic experiences a meltdown during his or her school day, very often the policy that is being used to address that does not relate to support; it is a disciplinary policy and it deals with the person involved in the same way as it that deals with students who smoke behind the shed.  That is a big issue.  What we have been concerned about in particular is that while there is no doubt that a lot of students have very positive experiences, we are seeing an increasing number of students not attending school, not having access to a school place or illegally being placed on reduced timetables.  That is consistently coming about fundamentally due to a lack of teacher knowledge.  Schools are afraid to open autism classes because teachers do not feel that they have the training.  Schools that have such classes or have students enrolled in mainstream classes perhaps are not in a position to support students as well as they could.  That is central to it.  We published a report in April that documented the cases of 313 children, whom we call \"invisible children\" who are currently out of school.  That represents a very small example of the people in that position.<\/p> <p>  Another indicator that is important is when one looks at schools that have autism classes, there was a vision when such classes were established that students who enrolled in the classes in junior infants would increasingly spend more and more time in mainstream school as time went on.  However, the evidence suggests that children who are enrolled in junior infants very often spend their whole education in such a class, which suggests that not enough is being done in reverse integration and slowly supporting students on the autism spectrum who enter schools.  When we look at what happens to students when they finish school, while some progress to university, many find themselves in a position where they are very socially isolated because they have had negative experiences.<\/p> <p>  In terms of how teachers can manage the varied needs, fundamentally, what this comes down to is resources and then planning and differentiation.  The courts have been clear through the years that people with disabilities have a right to an appropriate education and that an indicator for that, if one likes, is differentiation.  I do not think that is particularly new in terms of what we are talking about because the established policy of the State is that in the vast majority of instances students with disabilities should attend mainstream school.  The difficulty is that often while that is the established policy, schools then are not being sufficiently supported but also are not sufficiently regulated in terms of delivering the service.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities clearly states that it is never the case that a child needs to change or adapt in order to go to school, rather it is incumbent on member states and their agencies, in this case schools, to ensure that the service they offer is accessible.<\/p><p> This brings me back to mandatory CPD and the training relating to it.  While I recognise that there might be a need for an evidence body for an overall mandatory CPD programme, if we do not have mandatory CPD, this is literally the equivalent of asking somebody who does not speak French to go in and teach a French class.  Fundamentally, autism is a completely different way of doing and seeing things and placing a person without that knowledge and insight in a classroom is setting everybody up for failure.  There is an evidence base for that.  To return to language, there are current examples in the education system of non-verbal autistic children whose SNAs and teachers do not have the training to use the alternative communication styles they might use, which highlights the importance of this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019061900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>In the context of what Mr. Harris said in terms of children being illegally placed on reduced hours and sent home, in the past two months I was made aware of two cases arising in two separate schools located close to each other in a rural area of County Meath.

It is very clear from the Department's point of view that every child is entitled to receive a full education.  If there are examples or situations where children, because of a medical or some other pressing need that is supported by expert evidence, require to have that curtailed for any reason, it should be part of a plan about which parents are consulted.  There should be timely engagement and there should be defined objectives as to what the outcome of the plan is.  That should be reviewed and it should not happen as a surprise to the parent, with he or she just being called in to bring the child home on a recurring basis.  This should, very clearly, be a response.  There are support services available to help schools around individual children, such as the National Educational Psychological Service, for example, and there may be others.<\/p> <p>  On the legal side, it is clear that, under the Education (Welfare) Act, there is an obligation on schools to record attendance and to report on non-attendance.  Where a child is sent home and there is no consultation and it is not part of an educational intervention, it is technically a suspension.  It should be recorded and should be reported to Tusla, which has guidelines and a range of interventions in place through its education welfare service for that to be followed up.<\/p> <p>  On the broader issue, Mr. Harris made very valid points about school culture and teacher competence.  The OECD  carried out research a number of years ago which stated that the quality of teaching in a school cannot exceed the quality of the teachers.  That has been central to Department policy-making and thinking in recent times, as well as to the emphasis on how we address that from a strategic and policy point of view.  The establishment of the Teaching Council was a very strategic move in order to guarantee in terms of quality what we now call the continuum of teacher education, which governs the initial teacher education piece, then bridging the initial teacher education piece into teaching, and through to career-long professional development.  The whole thrust of policy should be evidence-based throughout and, obviously, it is very much about bringing the profession with us.<\/p> <p>  While there is clearly a bit to go on that, much work has been done.  All of the initial teacher education programmes, of which there are quite a few, have been reviewed and reconfigured since 2012.  In the context of the NCSE review to which Mr. Mulkerrins referred, there was clear evidence in terms of these programmes having inclusive modules within them.  There may be some work to be done on that and, clearly, the work of Mary Immaculate College will be useful in that regard.  However, it is safe to say the council in its work is very much driven by what is the State's policy, what is international best practice and where are our needs currently.  In other words, if we want to meet the needs of children who are in school today, we need to respond to that and pick up on the work of our inspectors and the work of Mr. Harris and his organisation.<\/p> <p>  The other strategic move the Department made was to establish the NCSE.  This was an intervention designed to address a lacuna in the Department's ability to respond to the needs of children in special education and to make sure the Department, in responding, was doing so on a very reliable evidence base.  Mr. Mulkerrins outlined some of the statistics on the work that has been done.  The commitment to supporting children with special educational needs and spectrum disorders cannot be second-guessed because the position regarding what has happened since 2011 is very clear, particularly in the context of the number of special needs teachers and SNAs, as well as the variety of supports going into schools, in place.<\/p> <p>  The emphasis on training cannot be understated and this is very clear in terms of the advice we have been getting from the NCSE, and we will see more on that.  We know that, last year, something of the order of 15,000 teachers were trained on special education in general terms.  There are further statistics, if the committee wishes to break that down, but that is a very clear statement in its own right of the commitment of the State to support the upskilling of teachers.<\/p> <p>  We have made a number of other innovative moves on the advice of the NCSE.  There is currently a school inclusion model in development which will see a range of new therapies being brought into schools.  It is happening in 75 schools currently and will be piloted for a further year.  It is about bringing occupational therapy, speech and language and behavioural practitioners into schools so we support teachers in a way they have not been supported before.  While special needs assistants are doing a magnificent job, it is clear they do not have the skills and competencies in some of the areas where children exhibiting needs in schools need to be supported.  The outcome of this pilot will further inform policy as to how we might extend that model into the future.<\/p> <p>  The point I am making is that we recognise there is an increased need, our understanding and knowledge is building the whole time and we are trying busily to catch up, given that resources are not unlimited.  Currently, almost 20% of the total education Vote is being spent on supporting special needs and that investment will grow.  We need to be sure we are doing it based on good, sound evidence, which is our intention.  Teacher education and general training have to be central to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019061900002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Ward"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I want to speak on reduced timetables because this is something of which we are seeing a great deal.  It is fair to state that there are instances where parents are comfortable with reduced timetables, feel that it actually helps their children, and are of the view that it is better for them to go school for part of the day rather than not at all.  The aspect that really concerns us is where these reduced timetables are imposed unilaterally by a school.  There has been a real culture of secrecy around that and, certainly in the surveys we have done, it appears reduced timetables have been put in place in a very coercive manner, with the approach to the effect that \"If you do not accept this, we will be looking at suspension or expulsion.\"<\/p> <p>  What came out of last week's Oireachtas committee is very important, which is that Tusla has clarified that a reduced timetable is a suspension.

I will address my questions first to Mr. Ward.  I have encountered many cases of children with special needs who are having problems,.  Mr. Ward referred to schools having programmes and so on.  Is he referring to a national programme for schools or is it based on the fact that, as we all know, some schools will perform better than others, and it depends on the co-operation between teachers and principals with regard to better supports for children in schools?<\/p> <p>  The Middletown Centre for Autism came up a number of times.  I was lucky enough to visit the facility last year with a number of Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues.<\/p><p>We had a frank discussion on this issue and the fact that it supports the industry, as we will call it.  The reaction I received, however, suggested that the people in Middletown actually want to do more.  They are chomping at the bit.  The centre is co-funded by the British Department of Education and the Department of Education and Skills.  The people there referred to how to \"encourage\" schools.  That was a very cute word to use, but they were referring to encouraging schools through an accreditation system.  It would be a case of inviting schools to state how many pupils they had and how many more were expected and then asking if there was a way to obtain assistance for those schools to upskill their teachers, without putting extra pressure on them.<\/p><p> As has been stated by previous speakers, this is an issue of resources and forward planning.  What I understood from our visit to the Middletown centre, however, is that it has the system required to move this issue forward.  We need the Government to buy into that system and to co-fund it.  We will call it that.  The positive aspect is that people want to do the right thing.  It is a normal human reaction to want to help people in difficulty regardless of what is the problem.  If a school is encouraged to help its teachers upskill`, the obvious knock-on effect is that the quality of school life improves for everybody.<\/p><p> In addition, with accreditation comes acknowledgement.  That is something that is missing from many systems in this country.  We do not acknowledge the good work that people do.  Would the Department be interested in this?  Reference was made to cohesion and to tying everything up.  Is there a way that everyone can tie in to this?   I am referring to linking in with the Middletown centre.  There is a coincidence in the name because I am from Middleton.  It is strange because Middleton was also called Middletown long ago.  The Middletown centre is totally non-judgmental.  It has looked at the sphere of education in a 32-county context in a very honest fashion.  Would this be a way of achieving joined-up thinking?  I ask that because we have seen that many organisations want to do the right thing but they are all doing things differently.  My question concerns whether our guests would regard this as a way to tie things together.  If this is the only 32-county autism specialist centre, could we not link up and link in the work of the education Departments on both sides of the water?  I understand that there may be an impact as a result of Brexit.  The Departments are already working together, however.  Surely they can come up with a plan and I think the accreditation model would benefit everybody.  What is the opinion of our guests?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019061900002#G00600","speaker":"1279","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>The Department is working closely with the Middletown centre as matters stand.  We view Middletown as a centre for excellence on autism.  We want to work with it and we have a programme of work with it at the moment.  The centre works with the NCSE and delivers programmes for us.  The centre will also be very closely involved as we move forward.  For example, we are looking at a training programme for schools which are establishing special classes for the first time in September.  The Middletown centre will be involved with our own National Education Psychological Service and the NCSE in developing that programme.  I do not want to pre-empt how the delivery might work but clearly we are involving the centre more and more in our thinking, policy-making and planning.  It is already involved in the delivery of programmes.  The centre has expertise that we do not have in ready supply and we will be drawing on that.<\/p> <p>  The Department spends approximately &euro;50 million each year on teacher education.  That covers everything from employing teachers, developing and delivering programmes, paying for substitute teachers in the base schools and all of the other expenditure involved in teacher education.  The expenditure is significant and it is going to increase.  Much of that increase is connected to new curriculum innovation and all of the things that will happen in a school such as the introduction of mandatory child protection guidelines, etc.  There is much going on.  The issue of special needs and spectrum disorders, however, is a priority.  We are very aware of the increased needs, as we see it, and the issue of how we will respond to those needs.  Deputy Buckley referred to resources and as a good official I should refer to resources as well every now and again.  It is a question of balancing priorities.  However, we take the point on board.

Not reinventing the wheel is particularly important because schools are getting so many new initiatives at the moment.  In the resources we have developed, which I referenced, we have used the Middletown framework, the Autism Education Trust framework and all of the relevant departmental policies so there is not something new.  It is just making everything a bit more cohesive.  The point regarding accreditation is interesting.  AsIAm accredits many organisations such as universities, shops and other businesses in respect of being autism friendly.  We have been reluctant to do that for schools.  There is a reason for our reluctance.  We would very much like to do it.  We must look, however, at a pattern that is occurring and which is worrying.  Sometimes in a geographical area one school will step forward, state that it wants to be inclusive and that it will do the right thing by opening a special class.  What tends to happen then is that every time one school steps forward all of the other schools take two steps backwards.  We are hopeful that the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 will address this issue with the ability to designate areas for autism classes.<\/p> <p>  We are concerned that some ghettoisation is happening.  In other words, one school ends up taking all of the children with special needs.  That school is then mandated as the school that is good at that instead of there being a recognition that every school has a role to play.  It is worth stating in this context that league tables and media reporting of league tables have a negative impact on outcomes for autistic students.  Those league tables define that the only good school is one which does well in the league tables as opposed to one that works for everybody.  I would love to do accreditation but the worry is that it would designate a school as the only school that does this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019061900002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Harris.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019061900002#H00400","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Harris.

The Deputy mentioned issues regarding school programmes.  It is important to point out that there are many programmes in place to support teachers working with children with autism spectrum disorders and a range of other special educational needs.  They are typically supported by means of provision from the NCSE.  Work to develop those programmes is informed by the Middletown centre.  It is a significant part of a much bigger joined-up process.  Everything the centre does informs development work in this area.  I refer to the development work that the NCSE is doing as well as the development work that Mary Immaculate College is doing with its particular programme.  Dr. Finn &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, while he was in the inspectorate, was involved in a major inspection of the Middletown model and he is very familiar with it.  There is again much joined-up thinking in this regard.  Turning to encouraging schools, from my own experience the difficult bit is to encourage schools to get to the starting point, to open the class and to enrol the child.  There is a real willingness to continue once schools have opened classes.

Having listened to the presentations, I have comments rather than questions.  Our guests should feel free to comment as well.  We are continuing to see what should be a normal way of teaching within a diverse system as something additional.  We are taking it for granted that every child in a room must learn in the same way except for one child who might, possibly, be on the spectrum or is diagnosed as being on the spectrum.<\/p> <p>  That is instead of acknowledging that there should be a mandatory or general training scheme for teachers.  That should be the case even if a teacher is not aware that a child in a room has a diagnosis or if there is child in a room that should have diagnosis.  Teachers should be informed and trained in such a way that they teach on the assumption that they should teach in a particular way regardless of whether there is specific notification of a child or children needing special attention or special education.  I am the mother of someone on the spectrum.  Navigating the school system was really difficult for her.  If some simple things had been done within the mainstream system, it could have made that experience much easier for her.<\/p><p>Looking at some children who end up on reduced timetables particularly due to tiredness and the emotional toll it takes to navigate a school day - when one has that narrator in one's head about what one is supposed to do next and has to consider how to find one's way to a classroom when everybody moves into the corridors at the same time, or even where the teacher sitting at the top of room constantly clicks a pen and is not aware of the impact of that on someone in the room - there are very simple things that could be done to stop reduced timetables.  It is the environment that creates the anxiety rather than the person's diagnosis.  This involves the environment, the response to the person and the learning style that person is not receiving - the idea around verbal instruction and how we provide people with information on how to carry out their homework.  The problem is that we keep seeing special education as additional.  Every single piece of teacher training, regardless of what module it is or what teacher training year it is, should have a thread through it.  It should naturally include the idea that different people learn in different ways.  Perhaps what I will say next is not true but I will make the assumption that it is.  If a teacher taught a class as if every member of it had autism and the assumption that everybody in the classroom is different, it would be a much nicer learning environment for most people because the teacher would take into account the fact that some people will have sensory issues or a different way of receiving information.  That is where we are failing in terms of special education because we keep seeing it as an add-on.  Unfortunately, accreditation would do that as well.  Do the witnesses see a space where we need to transform teacher training in general to be more reflective of Irish society rather than having to keep finding these add-ons?  What impact would that have?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019061900002#H01200","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I certainly agree with that.  While visiting a few teacher training colleges to give talks over the past while, I have had the pleasure of meeting student teachers who are on the autism spectrum.  I think that will be so important in, ultimately, shifting the profession and moving it away from one type of person teaching other types of people and making the profession more inclusive overall.  The point made by the Acting Chairman is really important because we talk about universal design and universal design for learning.  The problem is when many of these frameworks were developed, autism was still addressed as a medical issue and was not seen as part of that.  As I briefed the committee earlier, I even see that with regard to how school buildings are being built.  They are incredibly accessible with wide corridors but are less accessible than they ever were for autistic students for a range of reasons.  There is a need to embed autistic people into the universal design process recognising that it is not about charity or special education but about diversity and embedding that culture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019061900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Certainly it was true in the past that the classroom was such that teaching was teaching and teaching the child with autism was different but everything else was uniform within that almost as if the child with autism was inconvenient.  A lot of work was done in this space around the introduction of the new resource teacher model in 2017 and it took many years to get us to a place where we could introduce that.  The distribution of teachers was one small part of introducing the new model.  The major part of it was changing the approach to teaching within schools, which now informs teacher training.  Much of that was around the identification of pupils with additional needs and moving away from a model that relied entirely on a diagnosis because, frankly, a diagnosis of autism does not tell the teacher anything about the needs of the child.  Every child with autism is different, as indeed is every child who is deaf, hard of hearing, blind or visually impaired or who has ADHD, dyslexia or dyspraxia.  There are lots of different needs in there so it was very important that we would have a model that would encourage the school to have a better understanding of the learning needs of children and then develop planning.<\/p> <p>  We issued very substantial guidance to all schools and teachers around the introduction of that new model and also issued circulars around the distribution of teaching resources and what they would be used for.  I will read one small part of it.  Under the heading of additional teaching support in the 2017 circular for primary schools, it states that the classroom teacher in consultation with the special education teacher, as required, will consider ways in which the curriculum can be differentiated or adapted to suit the needs of individual pupils.  It states that this may also involve identifying the most appropriate teaching strategies and programmes to meet the child's needs and deciding which additional teaching supports are required.  It states that parents should normally be consulted as part of this process.  That was a radical move from where we were where, essentially, the needs of the children were being negotiated between the parents and the NCSE and the response was \"we'll provide a couple of hours teaching and some SNA support.\"  This was now a discussion around the learning needs of the child in a way that did not really happen until then but is happening now and is informing the differentiated teaching practices of teachers.  A teacher should now understand the learning needs of all of the children in the classroom regardless of whether they have autism, Down's syndrome or moderate learning difficulties.  Teachers should understand the needs of children.  They have the supports to work with them and should plan to teach the child in respect of those needs and plan in consultation with the parents.  That is what our teacher training and continuous professional development efforts try to support.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019061900002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Mulkerrins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":188,"content":"<p>We recognise that the Department can come up with great policies and strategies but there can be a gap when it comes to implementation at local level.  The point has been made - perhaps more than once - around what the school culture is like.  Very often, it can take time to move school culture.  It is a constant process and it is through training, information and leadership development that we get agents of change across the system at every level.  I do not exclude the Department from that.  It is a challenge.  During my time in the Department, we have certainly moved in terms of the provision of special education, about which we have spoken.  We have also moved in terms of curriculum development.  There are strands of curriculum development that are focused around differentiated learning and teaching in the classroom.  I know that in respect of the new primary language curriculum introduced in the past number of years, there would have been dedicated aspects of training to help teachers in the different environments they might be in.<\/p> <p>  The other issue concerns the quality of relationships within the school.  Some of the points made by Mr. Harris refer to that.  Clearly, we must value the voice of the student and child more and more because there is great learning from that.  We have ways and means of beginning to capture that evidence with our inspectorate model and increasingly consulting with parents and families around their experience.  We are beginning to focus on that more and more through the work of agencies such as the Teaching Council and the NCSE.  <\/p> <p>  By its nature, change takes time.

I thank the committee for inviting me here today to discuss the impact of homelessness on children.<\/p> <p>  As members of the committee know, the Ombudsman for Children's Office is an independent statutory body, which was established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  We have two statutory functions, namely, to promote the rights and welfare of children under 18 years of age; and to examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children about the administrative actions of public bodies, schools or voluntary hospitals.<\/p> <p>  The rights and welfare of children experiencing homelessness has been a strategic priority for my office since 2016 and will remain so as part of our new strategic plan up to 2021.  As members of the committee know, there has been a steady increase in the number of families experiencing homelessness in Ireland in recent years.  According to the most recent monthly homelessness report from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, in April there were 1,729 families with 3,794 children accessing local authority managed emergency accommodation.  A total of 75% of those families were in Dublin while 25% were spread across the rest of the country.  Lone parents represented more than half of the families, 58%, accessing emergency accommodation in April 2019, reminding us of their risk of homelessness.  Other types of families at higher risk include young parents aged 18 to 24 and families with four or more children.<\/p> <p>  A majority of families with children who present as homeless are still being provided with emergency accommodation in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  Similarly, the practice of self-accommodation continues to operate in certain circumstances.  I am very concerned about the impact of that and that there do not appear to be clear timelines in place for bringing an end to these practices.<\/p> <p>  As members of the committee know, the development of family hubs emerged in 2017 as an alternative to hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation to provide for the emergency, temporary accommodation needs of homeless families.  While hubs may be preferable to hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, they have developed in the absence of an evidence base, without an initial pilot phase or any clear public policy objectives for their use.  There are currently 27 family hubs in operation nationally providing 650 units of accommodation and my understanding is that further hubs are being developed.<\/p> <p>  In light of how family hubs emerged and are being developed further, we wanted to learn more about what it is like for children to live within those family hubs.  Between October 2018 and January 2019, we undertook a consultation with 37 children between the ages of five and 17 years of age and 33 parents of 43 children under five years of age who were living in eight different family hubs.  I would like to use the remaining time available to me to briefly highlight a number of the issues and recommendations contained in our report No Place Like Home, which we produced in April 2019 to highlight the views and experiences of those children living in family hubs.<\/p> <p>  Through our consultation, children and parents told us about what they liked about living in the family hubs, what they found challenging about it and the changes they would like to see made.  As regards the positives, younger children spoke about making friends.  Those who had access to outdoor play space and child support workers spoke very positively about those aspects.  However, several younger children could not identify anything positive about living in a family hub, with some children simply saying there was nothing positive about it.  Thirteen to 17 year olds were positive about the support provided by staff in the hubs.  Where provided, facilities such as computers, a TV room and a study room were regarded as positives.  Some older children regarded living in a family hub as comparatively better to where they had been previously, which may have been overcrowded family accommodation or hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  Parents of children under five years of age welcomed the relative security and stability provided by hubs.  They also spoke about the support of the staff in those hubs.  Where provided, the good facilities and activities for their children and access to a child support worker were also highlighted as positives.<\/p> <p>  No Place Like Home also highlights the accounts of children and parents of the negative impact that living in this type of environment is having on family life; parenting; individual and family privacy; children&rsquo;s ability to get adequate rest and sleep; children&rsquo;s health, well-being and development; children&rsquo;s ability to learn and study; children&rsquo;s opportunities for play; children&rsquo;s exposure to aggression and fighting; children&rsquo;s freedom of movement; and children&rsquo;s ability to maintain relationships with extended family and friends.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the children we met frequently expressed feelings of sadness, confusion and anger.<\/p> <p>  One of the most concerning features of the perspectives shared by children is the consistency with which they referenced feeling ashamed about being homeless and living in family hubs.  Similarly, parents consistently spoke about feeling that they had failed in their role as parents.  Such feelings of shame and failure underscore the corrosive impact that homelessness can have on people&rsquo;s sense of their own dignity and worth.<\/p> <p>  As such, the accounts of these children and parents recall the UN Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, who has characterised homelessness as a violation of human rights because the lived experience of homelessness \"challenges the very core of what it means to be human, assaulting dignity and threatening life itself\".<\/p> <p>  We have identified a number of priorities for action which were outlined in No Place Like Home.  Among those priorities are the following - timelines need to be put in place for ending the practices of self-accommodation and providing emergency accommodation to families via hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation; an independent, formal evaluation of the suitability of family hubs as an approach to providing emergency, temporary accommodation needs to be undertaken; and additional measures are needed to combat the stigma associated with family homelessness and to support the dignity, self-worth and resilience of children and parents experiencing homelessness.  Practical measures that need to be considered include increasing the number of child support workers, therapeutic supports and family support services available to children and parents living in emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the indications that the National Quality Standards Framework for Homeless Services in Ireland, NQSF, will be introduced nationally over a 12-month period from 1 July 2019.  However, we are concerned that there do not appear to be any plans to put in place independent statutory inspection of those homelessness services.<\/p> <p>  Existing primary legislation needs to be amended and strengthened to make children visible and to require housing authorities to provide appropriate accommodation and supports to homeless families with children.<\/p> <p>  The issue of enumerating the right to housing in the Constitution needs to be progressed as a priority.  We would like the Oireachtas to proceed with a detailed examination of the recommendations contained in the Eighth Report of the Convention on the Constitution without further delay.<\/p> <p>  Following the publication of No Place Like Home, I had a constructive meeting with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I have also written to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to ask her to give serious consideration to increasing the practical supports, including child support workers and family support services, available to children and parents living in emergency accommodation, including family hubs.<\/p> <p>  I am deeply concerned about the immediate and longer-term impact that the trauma of homelessness has on children and their families, therefore, I welcome this committee&rsquo;s decision to examine the impact of homelessness on children.  I am happy to take questions if I can be of further assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon.

The Children's Rights Alliance is an umbrella organisation.  We represent more than 100 members.  Our goal is to make Ireland one of the best places in the world to be a child.  Our work is around promoting children's rights in Irish policy, law and services.  We also provide an information helpline and legal advice services for children, young people and families so that they can contact us directly.<\/p> <p>  The issues I want to raise today relate to our helpline but also those coming from our members.  We started working on this issue a number of years ago.  Our members contacted us because they we so concerned about what they were seeing regarding the homelessness crisis.<\/p><p>Teachers were telling us they had seen children arrive in dirty clothes for the first time in their lives and that they had never seen it before.  They are seeing children arriving hungry and exhausted.  They wanted to know what we could do about it.  The ombudsman has talked about the high numbers we have at the moment.  There is no doubt that there has been a lot of Government action in this area to try to alleviate the impact of homelessness.  A good example of that would be the early years scheme that was put in place to give children in homeless accommodation the chance to be in an early years setting, to get a free meal and to get someone to look after them.  There was research commissioned into food poverty.<\/p><p> The other area is that of education issues.  The Children's Rights Alliance decided to take that up directly because we felt there was a particular gap and wanted to bring some attention to it.  With the support of the Community Foundation of Ireland we commissioned Dr. Geraldine Scanlon, who is in the Gallery today, and Ms Grainne McKenna to carry out a study.  They found that school was a really important source of solace for these children and that the parents would do anything they could to keep the children in school because it was their only sense of normality.  The schools were found to be doing a great job.  That was the overwhelming feeling coming through all the case studies with the families.  The flip side of that was the individual experience of children.  Parents were spending long periods travelling across the city to keep their child in school.  For example, there is no homeless facility in Bray at the moment so people from Bray will end up being accommodated in Dublin, maybe in Clontarf.  Parents could be travelling across the city nearly two hours to get the child to school.  The child will be hungry and will probably miss the breakfast club and arrive at school late.  He or she will not have homework done having spent another two hours trying to get home in the evening, will try to keep up in school but start to find it very difficult.  It is very hard to motivate oneself when one is hungry and tired.  When a child starts falling behind in school it is very hard for that child to motivate himself or herself.  That was ultimately what the researchers were finding with these children.  The longer they were spending in homeless accommodation, the greater the impact on their well-being and their mental health.  We are very concerned about the impact on their long-term prospects in school and their ability to complete school and do well there.  These are the kinds of things we are grappling with.<\/p><p> When we look at the homeless crisis itself, there are lots of solutions and tangible ways we can address this crisis.  These include public housing to address the housing shortage, preventative measures to keep people in their homes, and also measures to alleviate the impact of homelessness on children.  Particularly in non-DEIS schools, teachers and principals told the researchers of our report that they needed support, they needed an extra teacher or a home-school liaison officer for a temporary period to get them through this crisis.  That made all the difference for them.  They also talked about the need for a small budget to buy a meal for a child or to buy a bean bag if a child needed to sleep - these are some of the things they were thinking about - or a school uniform if the child arrived in dirty clothes.  These are very basic things but they could make all the difference for these children.  I urge the committee to look at prevention, housing solutions and measures to alleviate the impacts of homelessness.

However, as outlined in the statement that has been furnished to the committee, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child affords the right to an adequate standard of living for children within the jurisdiction.  The courts in recent times have demonstrated a willingness to interpret domestic and constitutional obligations in light of public international law obligations on the State.  That has been seen in cases such as N.H.V. <i>v.<\/i>the Minister for Justice and Equality in respect of the right to work.  There is also a debate going on about the impact of Article 42A in respect of the right to housing and children.  The result of this remains to be seen through litigation.  It is also outlined in our statement that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in its examination of Ireland in 2016 found that there were reports of major delays in respect of families living in emergency accommodation and inappropriate, temporary accommodation on a long-term basis.  We must recognise in the political discourse that those families are also categorised, quite correctly, as homeless.<br\/><br\/>The Children's Rights Alliance is running a campaign called No Child 2020.  The overarching principle behind it is for every child to be provided with secure and affordable housing.  That is not the case now.  Instead, we face an emergency in the homelessness crisis.  That has been outlined in the Children's Rights Alliance report card.  The Children's Rights Alliance is advocating for a best interests analysis to be inserted into the heart of legislation on the assessment of families who find themselves in homelessness.  The evidence shows that the largest cohort of people in homelessness are lone parent families.  As Ms Ward has outlined, children are being placed in accommodation far away from their schools and communities.  This has long-term ramifications for their mental health, welfare and well-being and their interactions with their own communities.  There is also a lack of suitable facilities within the emergency accommodation in which children are placed, and a lack of space, which is causing major problems for families.  We are calling for a statutory obligation to be placed on the Government and local authorities to carry out a best interest analysis when placing children and families in accommodation and to ensure that the voice of the child is heard throughout that process and that children are consulted on placements.  The other thing the Children's Rights Alliance is calling for through the No Child 2020 campaign is for a limit to be placed on the amount of time for which families can be placed in emergency accommodation.  The politics of this is difficult but the evidence through the Home Works report has demonstrated that families in emergency accommodation are finding themselves becoming increasingly institutionalised and that is causing major difficulties as well.  Those are the two immediate asks of the Children's Rights Alliance in order to be able to realise the much longer term solution of providing secure and stable accommodation for families across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lewis Mooney"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mooney and Ms Ward, who have both emphasised the need to enshrine housing rights in the Constitution.  From a personal perspective, I believe the Constitution is a document of principle but the fine detail of what that means for any matter should not be in the Constitution.  The fine details should be in legislation.  That is my view and, given what we have done in recent years, I think the public believes that as well.  On the basis that enshrining housing rights in the Constitution does not build a house, change a policy or direct a budget, are we sure it is the answer to the housing and homelessness crisis and to the 3,700 children who are in unsuitable accommodation?<\/p> <p>  I completely agree that local authorities should consider the best interests analysis which Mr. Mooney mentioned but there is an automatic knock-on effect that persons who are legitimately on housing lists are displaced because a family has applied and there are children involved.  Clearly the remit of the Children's Rights Alliance, the Ombudsman for Children and this committee is to prioritise rights and protections for children and the supports they receive.  That is our role.  However, is the best interests analysis something that would by default displace individuals who are on housing lists legitimately and may be ahead of those families?  Is that the priority?  Is this similar to medical grounds becoming a priority?  If that is the case, that is fine, I just wanted to seek that clarification from the witnesses.<\/p><p> I completely agree on the time limits.  The evidence presented to the committee and the reading I am sure all of us have undertaken indicate the profound and long-lasting detrimental impact on children in unsuitable accommodation, such as hotels and hubs.  It has the potential to seriously damage the development of children, teenagers and young adults.  The effect may be felt for many years afterwards, as the witnesses have both outlined that these young people are unable to do their schoolwork or study at secondary or third level.  There is no dispute that these would be profound and long-lasting effects.<\/p><p> None of us wants 10,000 persons in unsuitable accommodation or 60,000 or 70,000 people on housing lists around the country.  There must be some way in which we can alter the manner in which we procure or deliver housing in the first place, including the planning process.  It has been altered but I have not seen major evidence of run of the mill, three-bedroom, semi-detached houses being delivered on the basis of fast-tracking.  It has all been apartments etc., which is fine.  Since everybody outside Ireland is doing that, why should we not do it too?  At the same time, I appreciate that a three-bedroom, semi-detached house with a front and back garden is something that families need; children need those desperately as there is no better space for a child to grow and be nurtured and loved than in a home with a garden.<\/p><p> The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Ireland is a signatory, has a reference to adequate shelter.  I struggle with this as I have heard it so many times but does this change policy?  If not, which policy needs to be altered to ensure 3,700 children will no longer be in unsuitable accommodation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061900002#D00300","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":207,"content":"<p>The constitutional change is vital.  We have seen the benefit of constitutional change over the past number of years.  Society changes and it gives our people on the ground around the country the benefit of these changes.  A survey of Irish primary school principals at the start of the year indicated that 40% of principals had engaged with children in homelessness.  The problem is spread all over the country and everybody knows someone in that situation.  There is a groundswell of opinion that we must now protect our children and families at the highest level.  We all know legislation changes behaviour.  We have seen that with the other constitutional changes over the past five, six or seven years, all of which have created a conversation, brought issues to the fore and allowed a discussion to take place.  We are asking for a discussion to take place in the Oireachtas and across the nation to ask if this is the way we want to go and if this is the sort of standard that will be set for our children so we will not allow anybody to fall into this position ever again.  Of course, this must be followed with legislation and that is where work must come from parliamentarians.<\/p> <p>  We must send a signal that our children and families are so important we will not allow anybody else to be in this position ever again.  It must a constitutional right that can be stood over.  This must undoubtedly be followed with practical actions but that is the best answer.  With the recent referendums on children and marriage, there was a very clear statement to the cohorts affected by the issues that we are standing by them.  We need to get to that point.

I know members of the committee are aware that the eighth report of the Constitutional Convention looked at economic, social and cultural rights, and it made a recommendation on the right to housing.  Due to the complexity of the matter and the time available to the convention, it asked that the matter be considered by the Oireachtas.  That was in 2014 and we are now in 2019 but the matter has not been the subject of detailed scrutiny by the Oireachtas in the way other recommendations flowing from the Constitutional Convention have been.<\/p> <p>  In the first instance, we would like to see that recommendation from the Constitutional Convention being subject to detailed scrutiny so the issues could be teased out.  We are very clear that the constitutional right to housing is not a silver bullet and it will not effect change overnight.  However, it has potential and it remains a stone left unturned.  In light of the crisis we have all seen unfolding in recent years, it is incumbent on all of us to ensure no stone is left unturned and the potential of the Constitution is properly explored.  The key element for us is that the conversation, as and when it happens, should not be about whether it should be done but how it can be done in a way that brings the potential to have a meaningful and constructive impact.<\/p> <p>  As the ombudsman was saying on the best interests issue, under the Housing Act 1988, children are invisible.  It is one of our key concerns.  As members are aware, a Private Members' Bill, the Housing (Homeless Families) Bill 2017, has reached Committee Stage after consideration by the D&aacute;il.  It has not progressed since 2017.  It is not a panacea but as primary legislation it has the potential to achieve some very important objectives.  It would make children visible in the 1988 Act.  When local authorities are making a decision on a request by a family for assistance, the Bill would recognise the family as a family unit and treat the best interests of the child as paramount.<\/p> <p>  Whatever about constitutional change, there is an opportunity to effect positive change for children and families in the context of primary legislation.  Our understanding is there is, broadly speaking, cross-party support for this Bill and we would like to see it progressed.  It may be adapted or changed but we would like to see that conversation happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061900002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen McAuley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I will share my response with my colleague.  We support a constitutional right to housing and the time is right to seek a constitutional referendum.  It does not guarantee a house for every person, as has been noted, but it would set a clear direction to the Government about what it must do with respect to housing.  Looking at the standard and unpacking it, there would be an onus on the State to provide homeless accommodation or a homeless services response and to provide social housing to vulnerable groups.  It would also have to look at the quality of accommodation, as conditions have a major impact on the welfare of children and families.<\/p> <p>  There is the question of how a constitutional right to housing has been interpreted in other countries when people have taken cases under such a provision.  It has not necessarily led to a slap on the wrist for a government or that a particular person had to be given a house.  These are progressive rights so governments have had to realise them over time in line with available resources.<\/p><p>It puts a spotlight on the Government's approach.  Has the Government done everything that it can with its available resources to address this issue or have its decisions or actions been irrational in some way?  It would shift the direction of how homeless and housing policy are developed.  We have heard a few times about the issue with using prevention measures to keep people in their homes which would be challenged because we have private property rights in the Constitution.  The Chief Justice and members of the court in general seem to be quite open about this issue which needs to be tested.  If we had a right to housing in the Constitution, it would help to balance that issue.  Private property rights would not trump the right to housing, nor would the right to housing trump private property rights.  The courts would have to interpret both together.  As the Ombudsman for Children said, it would be a strong statement that we are about providing everyone with an adequate standard of living, including the right to a house.  It does not mean in reality that everyone gets a house but is more about the approach of the State to housing and accommodation.  That is what it means legally.<\/p><p> A good case in South Africa explains this.  It relates to a local equivalent of a county council which knocked down a shanty town for social housing.  It was a good goal but the court said that the authority could not knock down a shanty town and not provide an alternative for the families living there.  It found against the state.  Those are the ways that a right to housing could improve or help the decisions that the Government and county councils might be making in this area.

The simple answer is \"No\".  The statutory mechanism would remain in place for assessment of people on the housing list and it would not be legally possible to displace individuals already on the housing lists.  The best interest assessment would look at where children should be placed.  As outlined already, hotels and emergency accommodation hubs are having a profound impact on children's education.  It has been seen through childcare cases in courts that parents are finding it increasingly difficult to parent young children in emergency accommodation, which is leading to major problems.  The best interest analysis would seek to assess what is in the best interest of that child's well-being, such as the facilities that the child requires in the accommodation to be able to develop and being as close as possible to the community the child is leaving and the educational establishment or school that he or she is in.<\/p> <p>  Through the Children's Rights Alliance \"Access to Justice\" helpline, numerous children as young as nine and ten have contacted the Children's Rights Alliance to try to find information on their rights.  They have outlined profound issues about having to travel to school and the conditions that they are living in.  That is why we think it is crucial that children are heard through the process and that their views are taken into account in this best interest analysis.  There is an argument to be made that Article 42A already mandates this.  That remains to be seen through testing Article 42A, which is obviously in its infancy as a constitutional provision.  It is arguably legally mandated apart from what we in the Children's Rights Alliance are advocating for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lewis Mooney"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Before Ms Ward comes back in, I understand where Mr. Mooney is coming from.

While many of us have a great deal of knowledge on housing, planning and such, our role is a little more narrow.

For children under four who have developmental delays, we could look at intensive early years provision to catch up because they can catch up.  Educationalists working with these children and families could help them with the transition to primary school.  They will be behind everyone else by the time they start primary school and there is a general impact on their well-being, including anxiety and stress.  Children experience stress due to their parents being stressed about trying to get through the day, travel and missing out on things.  We could look at that.  There are solutions to this in education.  Some schools are doing very well already, especially the DEIS schools because they have some of the resources.  They are looking for direction and support.  One of the solutions that Grainne McKenna and Geraldine Scanlon came up with was having a number of DEIS schools working together with someone supervising who has the expertise to support the schools with their solutions.  We know that this crisis will last until at least 2023 based on the statistics as they are at present.  We need a time-limited solution to address it and to think about the school completion programme perhaps playing a bigger role in the longer term in tracking these children's development, keeping them in school and helping them to do well throughout the process.<\/p> <p>  The last matter is mental health and well-being.

That is becoming a norm for those 650 and, as Ms Ward said, an institutionalising effect is created because there is no clear pathway.  I will be a little bit political for 30 seconds.  Earlier this week, I saw a report which stated that 25,000 new units were being built by Government.  If we want to cut to the chase and not insert anything in the Constitution and if we wanted to alleviate all child homelessness in the country, of those 25,000 units, we should allocate 1,750 for all the families who are experiencing child homelessness and just deal with it.  That sounds very simple but it ends the problem.  Despite all the long conversations we have had about children experiencing the fact that they cannot access education, do not have a front door, cannot be in their community and cannot play outside, among other effects and everything else we are doing to alleviate it, we can actually solve it because we only need 1,750 houses.  That might sound very simplistic but it is much simpler than changing the Constitution, doing pre-legislative scrutiny and so on because at least we have a good base to start with.  We would have removed the crisis and emergency.  That is what I think we should focus on, lobby the Government for and ring-fence.<\/p><p>How will we use the allocation being built this year and next year?  Houses are being built.  They might not be built in the locations where everybody is but, then again, this is where there will be an onus on people to work with local authorities to ensure that if they are offered a property where there is adequate support through schools and communities, they avail of it and do not state it is not close enough to their families or X, Y or Z.  This is what we should be looking at.<\/p><p> The Children's Rights Alliance, the Ombudsman for Children and the committee should seek the ring fencing of 1,750 houses.  Then we could use the hubs for the next tier of people who need to avail of them.  We would have a strategy and a system in place.  This might be simplified but we need solutions as opposed to getting bogged down with what is in or outside the Constitution.  We should work on that on the side.  The Children's Rights Alliance displayed a card with an F but we need to display this card along with the solution.  The solution is to ring-fence and we need to look for this.  The committee would be supportive of this.  We have to have solutions.  We have to take children out of the crisis.  Last week I was critical of the local authorities and I will continue to be so until we get the systems put in place for them.  It does not need to be legislative; it is called best practice.  We need to simplify this so there is a direction from somebody in a Department on best practices.<\/p><p> One of the reasons we have a housing crisis is the collapse of the economy and nobody can shy away from this.  We have had five and ten-year fixed terms, which have all been maturing and now builders or whoever owns the properties are selling with a relative balance of equity.  Some of the families who bought properties and fell on hard times also are within this.  The HPL form that must be stamped is preventing families accessing social housing scheme faster.  It is a Revenue document.  If people received tax credits over the previous years, it cannot be stamped.  If the form cannot be stamped people do not qualify for social housing.  This is a huge barrier for many families trying to access the process.  It is something that needs to be looked at.  There has to be some way to support these families when they come forward.  They are the people self-referring to bed and breakfast accommodation.  They have had their own properties and feel the shame that has been spoken about.  They do not want to tell anybody.  The first time they look for support they are slapped straight back down because they do not qualify.  These are middle income earners.  They are middle Ireland.  They get up and go to work and they are trying to balance everything.  They could not hold on to their properties and they are struggling to pay the rent.  They are being held back because of this form, which is something we need to look at.<\/p><p> What would the witnesses like from us?  They have told us what they want in legislation but what are their quick fixes that we can push on the floor of the D&aacute;il or Seanad to intervene?  When the Minister, Deputy Zappone, intervened in the early years programme to help with buses it was a simple solution.  How can we help with the meals?  How can we ensure spare uniforms or an allowance?  What is needed within the schools' capitation budgets if spare uniforms are required because they have not been washed?  Is there is an allowance for lunches to be provided?  Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien explained it very well when speaking about a particular school where every class brought in an extra lunch.  There was responsibility within the class.  People have lot of pride.  Perhaps we should give some control back to the primary and secondary school principals so they have a budget to provide uniforms, books or lunches.  Will the witnesses tell us exactly where they are at with regard to recommendations to the Government for support on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061900002#F01200","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte this crisis is a result of the recession, the IMF visit and decisions made in the 1980s and 1990s to stop building social housing.  This is what it is about.  The homeless crisis is symptomatic of a deeper problem and it is a crisis of the rental market.  The rental housing market is carrying everyone.  It is why rental costs are spiralling out of control.  If I were here speaking about child poverty I would say people on good incomes experience poverty because their incomes are being eaten because of the cost of rent.  I agree the solution is building.  On Saturday, I heard the Taoiseach speaking about building more houses this year than ever before, with 22,000.  This is great to hear, and more investment is being made, but the challenge is with regard to what is needed.  IBEC states 36,000 completions a year are needed to keep up with the growth of the population, workers coming from outside Dublin and regional centres where the crisis is hitting, and workers coming from other countries.<\/p> <p>  Private builders have a solution and they have an important role to play.  Some of what they are building is not having the impact we thought it would.  The reason high-density student accommodation is being built is because of the price of land.  It is the only way some of them can make a profit but actually we need far more homes.  The only solution is for the State to get building directly itself and increase the number of homes being made available to people.<\/p> <p>  Finland does not have a homeless crisis but had one in the past.  It addressed it through the Government having its own construction company, which built sustainable housing.  Denmark is another example.  Here, in the past, when social housing was provided local authorities provided 30% of housing.  I grew up in Cabra.  My father's family were working people.  They were not on the social housing list. They both had jobs when they got the house.  Local authorities were providing housing for working people.  Something we will have to do to address the crisis is have social housing not only for vulnerable families but also for working people on low incomes.  This is the solution.  If we really want to end the crisis this is what we need to do.  We need to get building.<\/p> <p>  Professor Tony Fahey in UCD has done a lot of work in this area.  The research now states big housing developments are a good thing.  We used to think they were a bad thing because of places such as Tallaght and Ballymun.  Why those places had the problems they did but do not have them now was because at that time, there was poor family support and not enough garda&iacute; doing their job investigating crime.  They are now rich and vibrant communities.  Ballymun still has its problems but this is what the finding is.  Where we have developments with just a small number for social housing and the rest for private housing we find that people in social housing get very isolated in bigger-scale developments.  We need to rethink the housing solutions.  They are all there and I hope we can do it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Rabbitte is right that there are quick fixes to some of the problems families face.  Families want the Leap card for the summer.  Is there some way to do this?  With regard to education, non-DEIS schools state they need home school liaison officers or teachers.  A family will arrive and the principal will contact Focus Ireland because there is no one else to do it.  The principal spends time doing this work to try to get a family into a home or stays late with the family in school trying to find a solution.  This would be a quick fix for those schools, as would giving them the small budgets they need.  They are not looking for big money.  The principals have said if they had a small amount of money to make sure every child was fed or he or she could subsidise something that was needed it would give the child and the family some level of dignity.<\/p> <p>  Some schools have come up with some very good solutions to help families.  Some of them got beanbags for children to sleep on because they noticed they were exhausted.  They were being quite flexible.  They created a room for children to have a little nap to catch up.  We could give all schools the capacity to do this or support them in what the solutions might be.<\/p><p>That could make a major difference to families.  We are hearing feedback from some of our members, especially in the family support and early years areas.  They want to provide more services but find it difficult to know where the children are.  A mapping exercise needs to be done to ensure we know all the hubs where children are located and all the housing developments.  For example, in a place like Clontarf all the local services have to be contacted and told the people are there so that they can start to provide the services or get the families into their services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061900002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Does Ms Ward agree with me that we should have a complete call on Government at this point to draw a line in the sand in respect of the 22,000 units?

From our point of view, obviously, if there is a quick way of getting children and families into new homes, then that is a fantastic achievement.  From what I can see, unfortunately, the mix does not seem to be as good as we would like it to be.  I hear of new units, but many of them are for student or buy-to-rent accommodation.  These are smaller units with fewer facilities and less car parking.  Those living there have no need for the same level of facilities as families.  These units have different square footage.  Families are not necessarily settling into these new units.  They are not designed or being built in the way we would like.  I doubt whether we would get the numbers we want in the right places.<\/p> <p>  That is one crucial part of future planning.  It is okay to say we are getting 22,000 new units but are they units that will eradicate this in future?  Will they ensure we are stocked up for the future?  Much of this accommodation seems to be for students or well-paid young single professionals.  The units going up at the moment seem to be for them.<\/p> <p>  We have to work towards removing the crisis.  That is definitely a key point.  We also need to remove the possibility of the crisis recurring.  That is a longer-term argument.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte.  The sooner we can get children and families into homes, the better.  We have to see housing as a social good.  That is the way it has to be.  Housing is a social good and not a commodity.  That is what we need to change for the future.<\/p> <p>  The only tool the Dublin Region Housing Executive has is the housing assistance payment scheme.  That is what it uses to get people out of family hubs and into rental accommodation using their allowance.  Straight away, we can see the landlord has all the power.  They are the people who make the decisions.<\/p> <p>  We can see the problem outside of Dublin.  Galway and Limerick have no rental accommodation any more.  Cork is running out of rental accommodation.  The HAP scheme is useless or not as good as it can be in those situations and we are relying on the private landlord, as Ms Ward has said.<\/p> <p>  We have to get the State building again.  We have to get control of those houses and get them built for the future so that we are working towards reducing the figure of 70,000 on the waiting list for general housing.  That is a crucial part of the social good that we have to try to establish as a nation.<\/p> <p>  Ms Ward has referred to many of the short-term fixes.  We recommend these fixes for child support workers in the hubs to help children and provide them with better facilities or opportunities to talk.  We suggest therapeutic support should be available.  It need not necessarily be in every hub but it should be available to children and families in this situation.  We know that people are traumatised by becoming homeless.  We have heard the eloquent words about people from different backgrounds becoming homeless.  This is not what they expect or plan for.  It is not what they want for themselves or their children.  There is automatic trauma there and the longer people are subject to that trauma, the more difficult it is for them to come out of it.  Therapeutic support would be fantastic as well.<\/p> <p>  The Departments of Education and Skills and Employment Affairs and Social Protection are now moving to bring 7,500 school dinners into a pilot scheme in September.  That is an automatic thing.  I do not know why we need the pilot.  We are the last country in western Europe to bring hot meals into schools for free.  The only good thing about it is that we now have a situation where everything is recyclable and the quality of food is high.  It would be great to speed that up.  That is a real joined-up approach and it will help every child without anyone being stigmatised for being the recipient.  That is fantastic work.  Ms Ward referred to the Leap card scheme for the summer.  That is working well.  However, we know there are major problems outside the Dublin area where people do not get a Leap card.  It is far more complicated for a homeless family to get access to free transport there.  We know about the community welfare scenario as well.  Dr. McAuley may wish to comment if there is anything I have left out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061900002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":238,"content":"<p>The broad points made by people so far are right.

We need to consider the odds of it changing around and Ms Ward has spoken about that.<\/p> <p>  There is a broader point.  Mike Allen from Focus Ireland was talking about this last week.  He said the solution to homelessness is not emergency accommodation but rather housing and homes.  One of the key things in broad terms is what may not necessarily be a solution but a response now.  For example, we need to consider our reliance on the private rental sector in terms of facilitating families as far as possible to exit homelessness as quickly as possible.  We do not see that as a solution in the longer term.  It comes back to this idea of investing in housing as a social good and recognising it for what it is.  Housing provides a fundamental human need for security and stability.  We need investment in a scheme of public housing.  I know that is not a response but in the longer term, it is a question of how we think about this.  Emergency short-term measures are reactive and limited to what is possible right now, to a certain extent.  We need to ensure we do not start speaking about them as long-term solutions, because they are not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061900002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen McAuley"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I wish to apologise to everyone for being late.

This was from a child in a hotel or bed and breakfast accommodation.  That stopped me in my tracks.  Reference was made to looking at mental health.  Looking at it is one thing but what the hell is happening?  What can we do?  What can I do to help the Children's Rights Alliance and the Ombudsman for Children with that aspect of it?  I might not be able to do anything but I believe we should be thinking about what this Government can do for the next six to eight months, because really that is all we have.  Let us be real about it.<\/p> <p>  We can talk about legislation and introducing things into the Constitution but that is all long term.  I have learned one thing from being here for three years.

It is important that there is legal change and that rights are afforded to children which they can realise through the courts if necessary but so that they can also have those recognised by local authorities.

There were a few things that jumped out of the presentations, however.  One was the interviewing of children in the Ombudsman's report.  Some children said \"nothing\" was their answer.  That is really sad.  It is important to read here the response of the ten year old girl who said: \"Some days I didn't even want to wake up because I didn't want to face this day.  I am tired in school.  Some days I would just sit there and not even smile.\"  That is heartbreaking and would be for any parent whose child felt like that.  What do we do for that ten year old child?  We know we have to build social and affordable housing.  We cannot sit back and say \"Let us do A, B, C and D\" because there is another tranche coming in behind.  There are people out there who cannot afford the rents.  Unless we get into a proper programme, we need to build housing.  The numbers are increasing every month.  The Ombudsman's report refers also to the stigma and shame of being homeless.  What can we do in the here and now for those 600 children in the hubs to ensure they do not feel shame and are not stigmatised.  Is there anything we can do for those children who are going to school and do not even want to smile?<\/p> <p>  I note to Ms Ward that we went to the Minister again last week to ask for Leap cards.  He said he has no plans to introduce a Leap card over the summer period.  I find that horrific.  It is something we can do here and now as a committee with responsibility for children and youth affairs.  In that report, our teenagers say they feel isolated and excluded.  As a committee, we need to contact the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and tell him we want these teenagers to be given this Leap card over the summer period.  It will not make their lives fantastic.  It will not get rid of their stigma.  They will not be jumping around in happiness.  However, it will help them in some way over the summer period so that they are not excluded and can take part in activities and meet their friends.  It is something we can and should be doing when we leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  There has been a great deal of talk about national standards for hubs.

There was a Fianna F&aacute;il-sponsored motion on it and we had discussions on the report with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  We have had some good engagement with Tusla and the school completion programme under Noel Kelly.  However, the key recommendations, in particular those to be led by the Department of Education and Skills, have not been implemented to date.  Deputy Mitchell asked about solutions.  The Leap card for the summer is a good solution which would help to reduce isolation.  Geraldine Scanlon has discussed the need to use the provision of &quot;July hours&quot; to give schools the option of running programmes over the summer.  That is because for the 1,000 families in emergency accommodation in particular the other issue is hunger.  We do not have cooking facilities.  While that is not something about which children think <i>per se<\/i>, one needs to think in terms of basics about the holiday hunger issues that will face children in the holiday period.  Summer holidays are a drain for these families to try to get through and that needs to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>On mental health and well-being, this is being driven by the structural issues.  Getting families into homes as soon as possible and reducing the amount of time in hubs and transitory accommodation is key.  The reason for the time limit is to force the Government to build.  That is one of the things we want to see.  If there is a time limit, the Government must end the use of bed and breakfast homeless accommodation and get building.  That is what we hope the time limit will do as it has had that effect in other countries.  Looking at the best solutions around mental health and well-being for children in these types of situations, in-school support is one of the better approaches.  Some children like to have psychological support outside, but most want it in the school.  It is about making sure those schools dealing with higher numbers of children who are homeless have the right number of psychologists to work with them.  It is about supporting schools with the toolkit and techniques on emotional wellbeing.  Things children could be doing include stillness, mindfulness and practices like that to help them get through what they are dealing with.  Those kinds of techniques would make a major difference.  Another solution is to have services working with children in the family hubs to provide those kinds of support.  It is about ensuring children have play and recreation facilities where they can be normal children and young people.  These things could make a major difference to their mental health and wellbeing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061900002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>In his opening statement, the Ombudsman said he had written to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to request her to consider increasing the provision of practical supports, including child support workers.

We have said the standard should be that we will not allow anyone to go to a hub that does not have a childcare support worker, good play facilities, a therapeutic connection and easy access to schools.  Those are the sorts of things to start creating now.  Ireland has a history of creating an immediate solution that lasts for ten or 15 years.  We do not want to mention examples of that again, but we need to get to a stage where we provide high-quality, short-term solutions.

As Ms Ward said and as the figures have shown, it is probably going to be 2022 or 2023 before the numbers level off.  We could create a five-year contract for somebody.  It does not have to be a full-time Civil Service job for life but we can put this system in place and provide supports.  It is similar for the education system.  Many of the extra supports do not have to be provided by a high-level psychologist and it could be therapists or child support workers.  There are various ways to make sure that we make this happen in the immediate term and provide consistency around the country.  People could be doing well in a particular hub in Dublin but other hubs are not as high quality and they are less consistent, less supportive and provide less access to what one needs even in terms of cooking facilities and stuff like that.  A lot of them are glorified hotels that have installed extra washing and cooking facilities.

Other aspects of the report are equally heartbreaking.  One of the cases that comes to mind is the five-year old who tried to commit suicide and is being minded by his seven-year old sibling.  There are children who find solace in school.  The only thing they look forward to is going to school because it means leaving the facility.  All of these issues have an impact on their mental health, which is compounded by a number of factors concerning accommodation such as a lack of space, a lack of facilities and exposure to other family stressors.  The situation is compounded by their parents' sense of not being able to parent and cope.  Children are ashamed and embarrassed and parents feel like failures, which is not a healthy scenario for a child to spend any time in as part of a family.  As Dr. Muldoon mentioned, we have argued for family support to be increased in the report.  First, family support should be part of a solution because families, as a whole, in these situations need support.  Child support workers are specifically needed to help children not necessarily deal with these issues on a day-to-day basis rather than a psychological level and to have meaningful activities and a little independence and normality.  There should then be outreach therapeutic services for children who need more psychological or mental health intervention.  I agree with Ms Ward and the Ombudsman for Children that having resources school is a good place to locate these resource  but while I do not mean to be flippant, we are back to the Leap card situation.  What does someone do for the three months of the summer if he or she has a child who is suffering with this?<\/p> <p>  We found that many children do not want to identify as homeless and their schools are unaware of their situation.  As Ms Ward said, they may show up in dirty clothes or hungry but that may not be enough for the school to identify them as children living in these circumstances.

Focus Ireland was here last week but I did not get an opportunity to commend its work alongside BeLonG To in preparing research and data on LGBT homelessness in this State.  It is a global issue.  A recent study in the UK found that a quarter of young homeless people are LGBT.  The Albert Kennedy Trust report found that 69% of young LGBT people reported that parental rejection was a reason for their homelessness.  In 2013, the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children that LGBT people were highly represented among Ireland's homeless and \"a targeted response is required\".  Are the witnesses conscious of the issue?  A hostile family environment and stigma are more prevalent than we realise, particularly for young transgender people. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061900002#K00300","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":250,"content":"<p>It is not something that we have picked up on in a lot of the cases.

I come from a rural constituency and see homelessness presenting in slightly different ways where we have families living with grandparents or many people in one house.  We do not have hubs and for the most part do not see people on the streets.  There are some families who use vouchers for bed and breakfast accommodation.  The local authorities are quite reluctant to go beyond five days at a push.  In my office I frequently meet people who have been told to apply for the housing assistance payment and are asking for help in finding a property to rent.  However, they are not available.  The last time I searched <i>daft.ie<\/i>in the entire county of Mayo there were about 90 properties, even though it is a very large county.  In some areas there were no properties available for rent, but there were a number of properties available on Airbnb.  That is an issue not just in the cities but also beyond them.  Are there specific solutions for rural communities in counties such as Mayo?<\/p><p>It is great when families come out of homelessness and are finally housed.  On the follow-up with children who have spent a period in homelessness, there is stigma attached to it and the damage is done which they take with them.  Is there any follow-up?  Does it vary from county to county?  I presume Tusla is responsible for that engagement.<\/p><p>My final suggestion came from a discussion about Leap cards.  What to do with children during the summer is a problem for all parents, especially when it is raining and they do not have the routine of going to school every day.  The parents who can afford to do so send their children to summer camps such as C&uacute;l camps or Let's Go camps.  This gives them routine as they are gone in the morning and back in the afternoons, a little like school.  People who are homeless obviously do not have the resources to do so.  Perhaps as a short-term measure for families living in hubs, bed and breakfast accommodation or hotels a grant or money could be made available to allow the children to participate in the summer camps we all attended when we were children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061900002#L00300","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I think it is a fantastic idea to find some way for children and young people to become engaged with summer camps.  We are aware that some of the hubs have connections with voluntary organisations that allow that to happen in the local area.  Most of them are outside Dublin, in which there are one or two.  It is happening locally, but it could easily be moved forward on a national level.<\/p> <p>  The committee has discussed making more use of school facilities outside school terms.  That might provide opportunities for all children, not just those who are homeless.  If the playground was available or some supervised activity was allowed in the gymnasium - there are facilities that are unused for two or three months - we could possibly use them in different ways.  They are great ideas.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of quick fixes in hubs, one of the children suggested to us that for teenagers who could not move from their bedroom to the television room or the study without their parents and other children coming with them, we could provide perhaps a university student to oversee a teenage room in order that the parents would not have to supervise every child all the time.  That is the lack of privacy they experience in hubs.  It is something we could do quickly.<\/p> <p>  I am fully aware of the rural homelessness.  Each local authority does it differently.

Last week I spoke to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government about the psychological impact of the first 1,000 days of homelessness for all children.  For a child who spends even 12 months in homelessness as a baby, the follow-up needs to be almost as long to ensure they will get back on track as quickly as possible.  Dr. Nowicki wrote in the <i>Geographical Journal<\/i>about children and families who had come out of homelessness and found a new place in which to live.  They were still feeling the impact of trauma, the shame and guilt.  They will not go away for a long time and the parents will carry them even longer than the children.  They still need to be acknowledged, recognised and worked with in order to come out of it.  It is important to find a way.  I do not know if one agency has taken this on board.

I appreciate the point about taking immediate measures to alleviate the position for families who are experiencing homelessness now.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the legislation, as I know members of the committee appreciate, the provision of emergency accommodation for families and others in whatever form it takes is at the discretion of the local authority.  In the longer term it is about legislating to create an obligation to require the local authorities to provide accommodation and supports for people, including families, who present as homeless.

On the issue of urban Ireland versus rural Ireland, local councils need to build their expertise and funds, as well as the accommodation stock.<\/p> <p>  There is a range of aftercare supports provided by homeless services.  Focus Ireland does a lot of work with families when they come out of homelessness, for example.  One of the challenges for such a family is the having the ability to hold down a home as they could have become institutionalised when in the homeless services.  Simon Communities does this with single people who have gone through addiction, emotional or mental health issues.  However, some families do not need that support and are resilient.  They might spend a shorter time homeless and get out of it quickly.  However, there are others, particularly those who are homeless for longer, who tend to be more vulnerable.

This led us to establish an evidence base which included drawing on previous reports, of which there have been many, and to meet stakeholders on over 40 occasions.  We undertook a public consultation, to which we received over 100 replies and many written submissions, and we felt it was important to compare the situation in Ireland with other countries, particularly other EU countries. <\/p> <p>  Our main finding is that the State and the voluntary sector need each other.  The voluntary sector provides 28% of inpatient hospital beds and two thirds of disability services, while the State pays &euro;3.3 billion a year to the voluntary sector to provide these services.  <\/p> <p>  We recommend recognising this reality and making a new start through building a new relationship of mutual trust and respect between the parties.  In our report we explain how and why we believe the relationship between the voluntary sector and the HSE has broken down and why it is necessary to find better ways of working together.  In our view this should be done through State recognition of the role and value of the voluntary sector and by recognising its separate legal status.  Equally, the voluntary sector must recognise that it is an integral part of the overall health and personal social care system with all the duties and responsibilities that arise.<\/p> <p>  We propose giving this recognition through a charter and a forum where the voluntary sector and the State can interact on a permanent basis.<\/p><p>We recommend a two-way process of consultation, early involvement, listening and learning to deliver a genuine partnership such as exists in several other EU countries.  Drawing on wider EU experience, we recommend moving to a system whereby the State decides, in early and real consultation with the voluntary sector, on a list of essential services to be delivered to the public.  The list should be based on full-cost pricing for the delivery of these services, with prices fixed nationally but with room for regional variation.<\/p><p> A first step on the road to this way of delivering services would be to improve data and to map service needs across the country.  We recommend including a map of difficult-to-replace services to help ensure continuity of services in the case of withdrawal of key service providers.  We recommend that the State should apply or fix national standards for commissioned services.  Obviously, the list would require regular updating.  Such a process would be more patient centred, providing greater certainty about availability and affordability of services and would have the benefit of moving the dialogue between the HSE and the voluntary sector away from the current overwhelming focus on funding to instead focus on the type of services to be delivered and their quality and outcomes.<\/p><p> In addition to hoping to put relations between the HSE and the voluntary sector on a new footing, we recommend separating the commissioning and service provider roles of the HSE and making the executive more accountable to the Minister and the Department of Health.  We also recommend a stronger and more visible role for the Department, including ensuring more joined-up services for users and fostering greater co-operation between Departments and agencies to reduce unnecessary duplication.  We also point out that the voluntary sector needs to modernise and improve its governance, to strive to avoid duplication and to accept it is part of delivering a national health service that requires it to take wider considerations into account.<\/p><p> With specific reference to the faith-based organisations that formed part of our terms of reference, we carried out a detailed analysis to establish how many there are and who owns them.  That detail can be found in the annexes to our report in particular.  In summary, we concluded that 14 of the 48 public and acute hospitals in the State are voluntary and that as many as 12 of them still have some degree of faith-based ownership or governance involvement.  This situation is changing and new decisions are being taken.  We foresee that the number of faith-based hospitals will reduce to four in the coming years.  We looked at the mission statements of faith-based organisations, examined how they provide access to services and considered issues around ethos and decor and the range of services they provide.  We made recommendations to the organisations and the State in the light of previous experience.  For example, on the issue of co-ownership, we recommend that in future, the State should own the land and buildings of publicly funded hospitals.  Where this is not possible, financing and governance arrangements should be agreed before funding decisions are taken.<\/p><p> To conclude, we met a wide range of very dedicated public-service-minded people in the course of our work.  We thank them for their input.  We also met with high levels of frustration in both the voluntary sector and the HSE.  We believe that a new beginning is needed if we are all to benefit from the positive contribution of the voluntary sector as described in more detail in our report.  Other countries have found ways of working with the voluntary sector in mutually beneficial partnerships and we believe this is possible here, provided a new relationship is developed based on mutual trust and respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Catherine Day","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee on the report commissioned by the Rehab Group and with which members will be familiar, entitled \"Who Cares?\" on building a new relationship between the independent voluntary sector and the State.

Early in 2017, we asked Dr. Chris McInerney of the University of Limerick to conduct the research because we and our colleagues in the section 39 or disability sector had a sense that in addition to facing many challenges, basically, something was wrong and we wanted to establish what that was.  He looked at the larger section 39 organisations which, coincidentally, are providers of disability services.  That is interesting because, as members know, section 39 organisations are supposed to provide services ancillary to those provided by the State.  However, RehabCare, a division of the Rehab Group with which the committee is familiar, is funded to the tune of &euro;65 million annually to provide disability services, which is hardly ancillary.  We are the largest section 39 organisation and would argue that our services and those of other large section 39 organisations are anything but ancillary.  They are vital.  The day services, residential and respite services we provide are essential for those who use them every day.  The first thing to realise is that section 39 organisations are not ancillary.  Rather, they are core and central to the delivery of a vital part of health services in this country.<\/p> <p>  Our report found that our future is very uncertain.  The extent of the challenges we face means that our future as a sector is anything but secure and, as such, the services we provide do not have a secure future.  The sector stands at a crossroads and the core, immediate and urgent issue is funding.  My colleagues will substantially address that issue.  The adequacy of funding and our wider relationship with the State as represented by the HSE and more broadly are key.  A hangover from the recession years is that many section 39 organisations are carrying a deficit as a result of underfunding and that is making them financially unsustainable.  Members will all be aware of the recent efforts of Rehab, particularly during May, to secure more funding.  I thank all members for their support of our efforts because, thanks to those efforts, the Minister and the Government agreed to provide us with the essential funding we needed, which means that the services we provide are secure.  Rehab is not the only organisation which has been facing financial sustainability issues, as we pointed out to the committee at the time.  The issue of deficits was called out by the members of the independent review group.  In particular, we strongly support the recommendation that the issue be resolved and ask the committee to call on the Minister for Health to establish an urgent time-bound process to have that happen as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  We want this meeting to be the start of something.  We are very pleased to be here to outline the issues to the committee.  We are very supportive of the clear and powerful recommendations of the independent review group.  The key issue is that they must be implemented.  We want and need a process to ensure that happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen O'Meara"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":285,"content":"<p>It is no surprise to us that the findings of the report commissioned by the Rehab Group and entitled \"Who Cares?\" are mirrored in those of the independent review group.  The messages and conclusions in both reports are clear and consistent.  Independent voluntary disability service providers operate in the absence of a Government strategy for our role and future or adequate funding for services.  Our warning is that this will soon be unsustainable.  The people impacted on by this uncertain future are those who rely on our residential, respite and day services and who deserve to live full lives as citizens of this State with the support they need.  The \"Who Cares?\" report and the  independent review group report concluded that the relationship between the State and the independent voluntary sector has deteriorated and that there is an urgent need to place it on a new footing.  The conclusions of the \"Who Cares?\" report can help us to design a roadmap which would see the independent voluntary sector working in partnership with Government bodies to provide services for people with disabilities which promote, protect and ensure their full and equal enjoyment of all human rights while promoting respect for their inherent dignity.<\/p><p>Those objectives are reflected in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the ratification of which the voluntary sector campaigned for and which the Government effected last year.  We should all be on the same page in supporting the implementation of the convention.<\/p><p> Members will hear more details from our colleagues in the sector about the deficits organisations are facing.  Our research findings highlighted that the HSE is not paying the full economic costs for services delivered.  Organisations have exhausted their economic reserves, board members are no longer willing to operate the law as it stands and, without change, more organisations will be forced to closed down.<\/p><p> The first step on the road to a solution would involve the Government bodies paying the full cost of the delivery of services and dealing with the immediate and urgent problem of the deficits in voluntary organisations.  As we experienced recently in RehabCare, many independent voluntary sector service providers are just a few short steps from closing down essential services for vulnerable people.  It is only a matter of time before some hand their keys over to the HSE.  I ask the committee and the Government officials here today to consider what the HSE will do when the deficits are too large for these voluntary organisations to bear.  What will happen when board members refuse to tread recklessly under company law and organisations are forced to close down?  What is the Government's plan B when - it is a case of when, not if - this occurs?  When doors are shut, what will happen to the thousands of vulnerable people who use these services throughout the country?  As a matter of urgency, the current financial deficits facing these organisations must be addressed by an independent reviewer.  Ultimately, the State must pay the full cost of delivering the services.<\/p><p> The second step is that the independent voluntary sector must build a new relationship of partnership with the State organisations.  We should be working towards one goal, namely, providing services for people with disabilities which protect and promote their human rights.  Why is that not at the core of the relationship?<\/p><p> The third step is to develop a compact to govern this relationship which sets out a clear vision and principles for interaction.  We also propose that the Government create a junior ministerial portfolio within the Department of the Taoiseach to manage the strategic relationship with the community and independent voluntary sector, including the compact.  We have a responsibility to get this right for the people who rely on our training and education and our residential, respite and day services, all of whom deserve access to the supports they need to live full lives as citizens of this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mo Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Flynn and invite Mr. O'Regan to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#E00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee today on behalf of the 59 service providers which comprise the membership of the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies and, more importantly, on behalf of the thousands of children and adults with intellectual disabilities and-or autism and their families who those organisations support, to discuss our concerns for the future of the voluntary care sector.  The federation is the umbrella organisation for the voluntary agencies that provide approximately 85% of the direct support services to more than 25,000 children and adults with an intellectual disability in Ireland.  All providers are governed by boards of directors, are made up of some 395 volunteers and are subject to a wide range of oversight, from Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, regulations to company law and housing regulations, where the provider concerned is also an approved housing body.<\/p> <p>  The disability sector is facing a critical challenge in 2019 owing to financial constraints which, if not addressed in a comprehensive way, will have serious repercussions for service provision and for people with disabilities and their families.  In 2017, financial losses occurred in 23 member organisations for which full accounts are publicly available.  The combined deficits of those companies were &euro;25.2 million in 2017.  Some boards that are carrying operational deficits are unable to sign service agreements as that would effectively mean signing off on a \"reckless trading\" situation which is contrary to their legal obligation as directors of companies limited by guarantee.  Some have signed the agreements as a good-faith gesture in anticipation of addressing the underlying funding deficit as part of an engagement process with the HSE.  However, if the deficit is not addressed, those agencies will be left with no option but to cut services, transfer services to the HSE, or enter into a voluntary liquidation process.<\/p> <p>  Several key drivers have given rise to this situation.  We have supplied the committee with supporting documentation that provides more information, so I will focus on two key factors.  First, providers have frequently felt forced to implement cost-increasing measures following HIQA inspections to avoid being in breach of the law and facing closure orders.  Boards of directors are faced with the unenviable task of meeting the terms of HIQA regulations or face legal proceedings, which has often resulted in financial deficits.  Second, the changing needs of persons availing of services, together with the higher standards required resulting from regulation, are another significant cost driver in voluntary agencies at present.<\/p> <p>  Due to the lack of appropriate supports, thousands of citizens with intellectual disabilities are not being supported to live lives of their choosing or to maximise their potential to live as independently as possible as contributing, active citizens.  In addition to the personal cost, this is not compliant with the requirements of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which Ireland has ratified.  Older family members are trapped in unsustainable caring roles in the community due to the lack of investment in planned supports.  Families are forced to watch key milestones in their child's development pass without appropriate intervention due to waiting lists and, in the most distressing cases, children and young people are moving into full-time care on an unplanned basis.<\/p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms Shakespeare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":289,"content":"<p>The scale of service delivery by members of the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies is, in cost terms, worth &euro;1.3 billion.  However, many of them face financial deficits which relate, in the main, to compliance with HIQA regulatory standards and the need to respond to the urgent support needs of children and adults.  The required expenditure reduction over the period 2009 to 2016 and the continued maintenance of agreed service levels over that period are central to understanding the current financial sustainability predicament.  We cannot close wards as the acute care sector can do.  The care our members provide is in people's homes as part of their regular day-to-day lives.  As providers, our members have exhausted all possible savings across management, administration, maintenance, and non-pay, in addition to savings achieved through efficiencies such as roster reviews, service innovations and attendance management initiatives.  There is a significant risk for the State arising from the lack of financial viability of the voluntary disability provider sector, where verified deficits total some &euro;25 million in the annual financial statements of those companies for 2017.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note the vulnerable position of volunteer company directors who are faced with intensive demands to deliver services while also meeting extremely demanding regulatory compliance requirements which have created a significant burden in both professional and reputational terms for those concerned.  The degree to which these significant stakeholders can maintain their position should be of particular concern in terms of their organisational resilience and capacity to continue indefinitely to maintain organisational service delivery.  To be clear, the disability social care sector is in a seriously weakened state in respect of both its financial stability and its organisational resilience.  This represents a serious risk for service users who rely on our services.  The provision of support from the HSE, including cash liquidity to ensure day-to-day operations are maintained, has provided some remedy for the organisations concerned.  However, it cannot and will not provide the necessary ultimate solutions to ensure an ongoing and resilient voluntary provider sector into the future.<\/p> <p>  I will now outline our main recommendations to establish an immediate and longer-term resolution of the challenges facing the sector.  There is an urgent need for the State and voluntary sectors to work together to implement in full the recommendations of the independent review group.  Its recommendations challenge all stakeholders, both voluntary and statutory, and provide a framework for addressing the urgent challenges facing us in supporting the future of our citizens with disabilities.  There is also a need for urgent financial investment by the State to resolve the unsustainable deficit situation.<\/p><p>Companies will fold.  There is an urgent need for a multi-annual investment programme to address the unmet need outlined in the supporting document we have tabled and the working group's report developed by the HSE as part of the Transforming Lives programme.  There is a requirement for consideration of a change in the approach to the application of the HIQA regulations that will move from a position of compliance to a model of service user outcomes.  It should include a legal obligation to have regard to the financial resources available prior to compliance plans being developed and accepted.  The State and service providers must work together to innovate and develop new models of integrated service delivery in accordance with Sl&aacute;intecare, harnessing the capacity of the community and voluntary sector in the provision of effective social care for persons with disabilities as citizens of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Shakespeare","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to present on behalf of the Not For Profit Association and the tens of thousands of people for whom we provide services.  <\/p> <p>  The report of the independent review group, rightly, recognises that Ireland owes a debt of gratitude to the voluntary sector which was the first to provide hospital and social care services at a time when the State did not.  As outlined by my colleagues, the current crisis in the sector calls into question the value the State places on the sector and, more importantly, how it prioritises the rights of the people who depend on the services the sector provides.  The sector has grown to provide two thirds of all services for people with disabilities on behalf of the State and the continued delivery of those services is now dependent on the financial sustainability of voluntary organisations.<\/p> <p>  The Not for Profit Association represents the largest independent, national, not for profit organisations engaged in the provision of essential social care services on behalf of the State.  Collectively, the seven member organisations manage an annual service delivery budget of more than &euro;200 million on behalf of the State.  We employ 7,000 people in delivering services to more than 30,000 adults and children in every part of the country.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding the distinctions between section 38 and section 39 funded organisations as set out in the Health Act 2004, we provide direct services on behalf of the HSE under the mandate of the service arrangement process.  The services we provide are essential, not ancillary, and annually include 1.8 million personal assistant hours, 150,000 days of service in our centres throughout the country, 40,000 respite care nights, 125,000 clinical interventions, as well as a wide range of other person-centred services, including training, education, employment and independent living.  What will happen to these services if the organisations can no longer provide them?  Their continued delivery is under immediate threat.  Our member organisations are struggling to remain financially viable, some to the point of existential crisis, following years of cumulative deficits that have eroded financial reserves.  The deficits have arisen owing to austerity cuts that have never been restored, additional costs of compliance and regulation, ageing infrastructure and general inflationary cost increases as the economy continues to grow, but there has been no equivalent increase in State funding for the services provided.<\/p> <p>  In 2018 Not for Profit Association member organisations reported a combined deficit of &euro;8.3 million which was directly attributable to the shortfall between the cost of delivering services on behalf of the HSE and the funding allocated by the HSE for these services.  For ten years our member organisations have subsidised the cost of providing services on behalf of the HSE from their own independently generated income and related reserves.  Those reserves are depleted and continued delivery of services is under immediate threat.  Should the organisations have to cease providing services, the HSE will be required to resource and reinstate the services at full cost to and with no scope for savings for the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  The issue of deficits for our member organisations is compounded by the HSE's ongoing insistence that deficits not be recorded in the annual service arrangements process.  They are, therefore, not provided for in funding allocations and, presumably, not included by the Department of Health for consideration in future year budgets and strategic service planning.  It is further compounded where service providers do record the deficits in service arrangements, thereby reflecting the true cost of delivering services.  The HSE then threatens the withholding of 20% of the already inadequate funding, further compromising service delivery.  This practice completely disregards and undermines the organisations' obligations in statutory corporate governance requirements, as companies limited by guarantee, to ensure the accuracy of information contained in legally binding contracts.<\/p> <p>  The State's regard for the sector is evident in its recent handling of the pay restoration process for section 39 employees.  Having had funding cut to ensure our employees took the same austerity cuts as public sector staff under financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, they were left out of the original public sector pay restoration process that began in 2016.  Late last year the HSE agreed to a process of partial pay restoration for employees in just 38 out of more than 2,000 section 39 organisations, which will see these staff only return to 2008 rates of pay by October 2021.  Recent communications from the HSE state there will be no funding for the pension element of pay restoration when historically service funding from the HSE always covered the pension element of service related pay.  Our member organisations which are already operating with significant deficits arising from underfunding by the HSE cannot fund the pension costs arising from pay restoration.  This is likely to lead to further industrial action which, in turn, will have a detrimental impact on service delivery and the lives of those depending on it.<\/p> <p>  The recent communication also states there is no expectation or requirement for section 39 employees to be aligned with health service salary scales.  This seems to be a contradiction in the service arrangement process in which there is a requirement to have regard to public sector pay scales and the decades long practice of funding section 39 employees' pay at public sector pay rates.  There is now a two-tier system of pay for social care workers, with those in the voluntary sector lagging behind their public sector peers in doing exactly the same work.  In an economy with full employment this has created huge challenges in staff recruitment and retention, with a knock-on impact on service delivery already evident in our member organisations.<\/p> <p>  The publication of the independent review group's report should serve as a defining moment in preserving the positive impacts of the voluntary sector and its recommendations should be the anchor that will underpin a new relationship between the State and the sector.  Failure to urgently implement the recommendations made in the report will result in many voluntary organisations being forced to terminate services.  The biggest losers in this scenario will be the tens of thousands of people throughout the country who rely on the organisations for these essential services.  The Government was able to find &euro;3 billion to connect people virtually through the national broadband plan.  What is it prepared to do, before it is too late, to connect tens of thousands of vulnerable people who are dependent on the services provided by voluntary organisations for their communities and society?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosemary Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, I must vacate the chair.

Will the delegates describe for us the impact on the organisations because it would be dramatic and the potential impact on service users?  For the organisations and their staff, having to read in the newspapers that there is a deficit is very worrying, but, in turn, it has an impact on service users.  I note the use of the phrase \"more than a little coercive\".  Will the delegates describe exactly for us what that behaviour is and how it manifests?  It is a serious charge.  There is the notion that people are somehow being coerced into signing service level agreements when they know that they will not be in a position to deliver on them and when they also know that if they do not sign them, they will find themselves in a position where their funding may be cut off.  I believe I am quoting the phrase directly from at least one of the reports.

I am CEO of the Irish Wheelchair Association and as recently as yesterday, we received a letter from the HSE advising us that because we had shown deficits in our service arrangements for this year that accurately reflect the cost of delivering those services, we will now be faced with a withholding of 20% of funding.

In 2017, we decided to include all of our deficits in our nine service arrangements around the country and the HSE moved to withhold 20% of funding.  At that stage, we exercised our right under the service arrangement to enter into the dispute resolution process and were able to demonstrate clearly that the HSE had no legal right to withhold funding under that service arrangement.  Once we had demonstrated this, the HSE rescinded its action.  However, we are a large organisation and were able to enter into the process.  In addition, we had the capacity to manage the situation during that period.  For many smaller organisations, the withholding of 20% of funding on a monthly cashflow basis is incredibly difficult and poses considerable challenges in terms of meeting pay costs, service delivery costs etc.  The measure pushes many organisations to the extent where they must sign in the way in which the HSE has indicated and that is primarily by not demonstrating that there are deficits.<\/p> <p>  Again, I echo what was said by my colleague whereby if we continue to produce service arrangements, which are public documents, indicating there are no deficits, then we feed into the myth that there are no deficits in the sector.

This is something that is very much under the radar.

I support everything that was said about the experience with service agreements.  Our own members have experienced that as well.  Boards of directors have been placed in a very difficult situation.  They are asked to govern organisations that provide services to people with disabilities, which is their core purpose and the only reason that they exist.  They are very driven by a commitment to people with disabilities to provide the best services that they can and respond to their needs.  They do so in an environment that has changed dramatically over the past five to ten years in terms of the level of compliance in respect of lots of different regulations.  That is very different from how things used to be.  The environment has improved for the better but there are consequences, much of which were not properly planned for, anticipated or costed in terms of potential implications.  Directors govern organisations and ensure all of those requirements are met.  At the same time directors are conscious of the unmet needs and try to respond to them.  Directors are being placed in situations where there is not proper and adequate funding for the actual cost of the services they are being asked to provide and yet must provide the services at the level that is expected.  For them to continue to do both of these things without adequate funding places them in an unenviable situation.  They do not have the finances to do this work, yet are driven by both regulation and needs at the same time.  The effect of that on the people we support is either they do not get the services they need or their confidence in the services they receive and their sustainability into the future is always in doubt.

We also felt, from what we heard, that the way in which the HSE negotiates the service agreements was to start by saying one got X last year so it will start at X minus so much this year.

While it is dangerous to simplify, I will do so nonetheless.  There is not a good understanding of the value of the positive contribution made by the voluntary sector.  It was present in Ireland for a long time, but it has evaporated.  The need to impose cutbacks during the financial crisis was interpreted not in a partnership way but in a command and control way, to adopt the wording the HSE often used with us.  Unfortunately, we found that the emphasis had almost shifted to the financial side.  That meant that the quality and range of services being made available to service users tended to be squeezed out.  For that reason, we have recommended that there be a new start.  In some parts of the HSE there was a tendency to amalgamate the voluntary sector with the public sector.  That is why we are recommending that the separate legal status of voluntary organisations be respected.  Their permission is needed to involve them, rather than presuming that certain services will be made available through them.<\/p> <p>  We have looked at how this has happened in other EU member states, most of which have a similar background in having voluntary health and social care services provided partly through faith based organisations and partly by means of philanthropy.  Unless there is a new respect for the role, nature and difference of the voluntary sector, it will be hard to fix this problem.  Now that there is a new CEO in the HSE and a new HSE board - there was no board for most of this period - perhaps there might be an opportunity to fix it.  We hope our report will make a contribution to it.  We would like the forum we have recommended to be convened quickly in order that our ideas can be discussed.  It may transpire that they are not the best ones.  There are many people in voluntary organisations and the HSE who have good ideas about how things could be improved, but those voices do not seem to be getting through.  The idea is that the forum would enable them to meet and hammer out ways to improve things.<\/p> <p>  Everybody understands public money is limited and has to be spent wisely.  It seems to us that people in the voluntary organisations are fully cognisant of the fact that they have to be accountable for public money, but they also believe many things could be done better.  There is a need for a change in attitude and culture.  We hope the changes at the top of the HSE provide an opportunity and a moment to bring that about.  Having been at the head of the European Commission, much of what we have heard during this discussion reminds me of when the Commission had to change its attitude from one of arrogance to one of consultation and involvement.  It was a difficult process.  The people at the top level understood it was not possible to continue with the old way.  As a result, the message came strongly that a change in attitude was needed.  That is part of our message.  We think it is important for the future that there be such engagement and involvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Catherine Day"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>The key to our thinking in this regard is the need for mutual recognition that the &euro;3.3 billion voluntary sector is an integral part of the way services are delivered in this country.

The HSE knows what it gets for the money it pays.  Our point was that no advance consideration was given to the services needed by the population.  It is forecast that the population will grow by 1 million in the next 20 or 30 years.  Rather than start with how much money we have, how much we can spend and what we spent previously, we need to look at the population, including the increase in it, and try to come up with an idea of what those people need and what services the State should be obliged to provide for them.  Without oversimplifying matters, some continental countries involve the voluntary sector with the equivalent of the HSE.  Together they work out which services are needed in order to take care of vulnerable parts of society.  They debate how many services will be funded from the public purse and how many will be provided through voluntary fundraising.  In times of budgetary cutbacks perhaps the list of publicly funded services might have to shrink, but at least there is clarity on what services are needed, what services are to be funded and how they are to be funded.  If we were to adopt such an approach here, it would give much more certainty to families, parents and service users.

It was a painful process, but it led to better outcomes for service users because it created an ability to have economies of scale, bring in more expertise and do a bunch of things that really small organisations find it difficult to do.  Is that something the voluntary sector would consider to be okay?  Does it think there is a good opportunity to consolidate to try to create a smaller number of bigger organisations?  I would also like to ask about the pension funding issue in that context.  Deputy O'Reilly has spoken about the deficit.  The funding of pensions can destroy the wealthiest of organisations.  Am I right in thinking the State is now saying it may fund some of the voluntary organisations' capital, wage and associated costs but that they will have to find the money to fund the future pension contributions of their staff?

I will not embarrass the Minister of State by the referring to the fact that no information was received in response.  We had an example of the real problems that exist in the first five minutes of today's meeting.<\/p> <p>  The issues in this sector are coming to a head due to the report that has been carried out.  I believe this is a crisis, which is one of the greatest crises facing healthcare in this country.  It has been suggested that these organisations provide ancillary services but that is not the case; they provide essential services.  I have been fighting for two years on behalf of a young man from Waterford to get him full-time residential care.  That has not happened because there are no services to be found for him.  That is a crisis for him and his family.  No funding is available to provide the required services for him because the package needed would probably cost &euro;250,000.  That is just one example.  When we break this issue down to individuals and how they are affected, I have an image in my head of that young man. <\/p> <p>  I will ask some specific questions because what happens at this committee is monitored closely by the Department of Health and the HSE.  They need to start paying attention to what is happening here.  Some of the staff in the HSE, in particular, are excellent people.  Off the record, those people will admit that they know that this cannot go on.  How I do I know that?  They tell me the same thing.  This situation has to come to head and, hopefully, this meeting will facilitate that happening.  We cannot go on the way we are.  I have some specific questions on the deficits.  How much is the total deficit?  I know this will be a matter of guesstimates to some extent, but how much do the witnesses reckon is the total deficit in the sector?  I refer to the deficit in funding for current services right now in June 2019.  I have heard the figure of &euro;30 million mentioned.  Is that accurate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#K00800","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":345,"content":"<p>It is &euro;30 million between the two umbrella organisations we represent.

Another issue concerns the hands-off approach of the Department of Health.  That is obvious.  It outsources responsibility to the HSE.  The HSE then works with the umbrella groups to outsource service provision to the member organisations.  The witnesses have outlined in detail how they have to balance corporate governance, company law and trading recklessly versus moral issues.  The dependency of the users on the service providers must also be taken into account.  That is a difficult position to be in.<\/p> <p>  This situation has been constructed and facilitated by the HSE.  The Department of Health is aware of what is happening.  It is a process whereby the HSE is effectively facilitating the potential for reckless trading, in some cases.  The dichotomy is that on one side there is a necessity to behave in a certain manner while, on the other, there is no way in which we want services to be taken away.  That is an impossible situation for all of these organisations to be left in.  It is not the fault of the organisations.  I know, however, where the finger of blame would be pointed if there were to be any issues.  It would not be at the Department of Health or HSE.  The finger of blame would be pointed at the witnesses' organisations.  That is not right. <\/p> <p>  I want to focus now on the process that happens each year.  I ask that the committee be sent a copy of the letter sent to the Irish Wheelchair Association stating there would be a cut of 20%.  I also wonder whether it would be possible to canvass all the organisations that the witnesses represent and find as many of those types of letters as possible that have been issued in the past three years.  I ask the witnesses to forward all of those letters to the committee.  I make that request because it would be good to get a sense of the scale of what is going on.

The services are being provided on a contractual basis.  I agree, as that is my understanding as well.<\/p> <p>  To what degree does that entail the Department of Health or the HSE providing support for pensions or for other services?  In my view if one has a contract to provide a service, it entails everything.  One brings one's baggage to the contract and one provides everything oneself.  I provide everything myself if I am a contractor, in the same way as a builder or somebody else.  To what degree have the witnesses found that it was necessary to call on the RehabCare voluntary fundraising activities, the HSE or the Department of Health to assist in such issues as pension provisions for the future?<\/p><p>That is another question. <\/p><p> To what extent has consideration been given to the multiplicity of organisations that appear to be engaged in the delivery of vital and sensitive services in the same marketplace, in competition in some circumstances, particularly with regard to voluntary fundraising?  How do voluntary bodies fit in there?  Would some degree of amalgamation might be beneficial?  For example, the HSE - and the health boards in the past - has certainly attempted to provide services under respective headings from within its own resources.  The other issue is the voluntary sector, which consists of many and various compartments these days.  I respect the voluntary sector for what it does.  It does a great deal of work.  The religious parts of that have been referred to on numerous occasions.  The country was quite happy to accept the services provided by the voluntary sector in years gone by.  We cannot state that we do not want an organisation because it represents some religious group but that we want the services it provides.  We are being hypocritical in how we look at some of those issues.<\/p><p> How do voluntary and non-profit bodies see themselves fitting into the fabric of services provided by the HSE or the Department of Health?  Our guests had a meeting with Laura Magahy.  How long did the meeting last and was it satisfactory?  Did Ms Magahy provide any indication of future prospects around interaction?  Will there be a further meeting?  The cost of providing health-related services are growing all the time and will continue to do so.  Even in the context of the very extensive budget of the Department of Health, &euro;3 billion is a great deal of money.  The extension of the cost of the services is likely to continue based on information to date.  What is the likely outcome in terms of the necessary increase in taxation to fund it?  That is the only way it can be funded.  The Minister does not stick his hand into a back pocket to find money.  He does not refuse to find money either.  He wants to help out and the Department of Health wants to help for obvious reasons, including political ones.  There are all kinds of reasons.  The creation of the belief that in some way the Minister is opposed to providing the necessary services is completely wrong.  Everybody has to look at how they present the picture in that context.  If we do not, we are heading back to 2008.  If we want to go back to 2008 in respect of the national finances, it might be a learning process.  It might be a hard way to learn, but also necessary.  Maybe the country has to go broke again in order to illustrate fully the seriousness of the situation in which we find ourselves.<\/p><p> I have restricted my submissions so far and I intend to come back in.  I have a final question for now.  Has any evaluation been made of the extent of the increase in income tax paid by the public on a weekly or monthly basis?  It would be helpful if we were given some indication of where we might have to go in future.  If we do not pay for the services, we lose them.  If we do not provide the funding through taxation - and it does not come from anywhere else - the services will go too.  We are caught in a cleft stick.

We were asked first to perform a factual assessment of the situation.  The reason we recommended mapping the services was that we felt there was not a good overall understanding of the services that were needed and what it really cost to provide them.  That is why we raised in our report the question of the ballooning deficit.  It was simply being put to one side as though it did not exist.  We recommended the mapping of the services because we need to know what the extent of those services is and the State needs to indicate how many of the services that are needed it is willing to provide for.<\/p><p>The State must then decide whether it should provide for them through the public system or whether it should contract out to the voluntary sector because it feels there is a positive value in working with that sector.<\/p><p> The question about the large number of organisations came up and we looked at that as well.  We did not make a recommendation to consolidate because we feel that, in many cases, proximity to service users is part of the extra that the voluntary service adds.  The reason we recommended that the State should have a rolling list of services that it commits to fully funding is because then it would be possible to be clear with people about what services would be provided.  We made the point that, for example, one could not prevent a group of concerned parents from setting up a voluntary organisation if they felt they could help in some way but, equally, they could not have an expectation that the State would fund whatever they decided was needed.  This why we need clarity in terms of what services are required by the population and how much of those services the State is prepared to provide.<\/p><p> In the context of the negotiations with the HSE, we are not starting afresh; we are coming from an historical position.  We are coming from a situation whereby the HSE wants to provide the services but has a limited amount of public money.  Instead of looking at the services that are needed, it and, to a certain extent, the organisations are looking at it as being a case of \"Well, we are here because we are here and we need to be funded to continue.\"  We felt that this was not a sustainable situation and that what we needed was to be clear about which services are to be provided and by whom.  The full cost must then be paid, particularly if one considers what might happen if, to use the expression used earlier, the voluntary sector \"throws back the keys\".  If the latter happened, the would have to step in and provide those services.  One needs to look at the cost of that and decide whether it is better value for the public purse to do it through the voluntary sector - taken in the round, not only financially but also in terms of the quality of the services that are offered - or whether it is not sustainable because the voluntary sector does not have the capacity to do it.  If the latter is the case, then provision must be made, from a budgetary perspective, for the public sector to provide it.  What we were trying to recommend in our report was that the factual basis needs to be established.  As a result, we suggested that the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform look at the deficit situation, put a figure on it and then work out how it will be absorbed or what services will be cut if it cannot be absorbed.  There is a need for greater clarity on the factual situation and then a strategic discussion about what services are to be provided and by whom.

It produced a report which projected that an additional investment of &euro;200 million per annum for a five-year period was needed, based on cost at that time, in order to meet known and future need.  My understanding is that this is being updated by the Department of Health, which is looking at a ten-year project to build on that.  That is the kind of cost at which one would be looking in terms of meeting current and future need.  That does not include the type of issues we are raising around deficits or dealing with the things that are there.  They would be on top of that.  That is the kind of scale of investment we think is needed.  That was work done by the HSE.<\/p> <p>  Part of the challenge in respect of the work in which we are involved relates to the challenges around contracting for services.  We are in support of people who travel along the whole-of-life journey.  We can engage with the HSE today to agree a budget for the provision of a service to a person but that person's needs can change quite significantly tomorrow.  What we do not have is a system that permits renegotiation when those things happen.  They are real-life situations.  We cannot and will not abandon people in those circumstances but we need an arrangement with the State because, on the one hand, the State has a finite resource and has to manage within that resource and, on the other, we need something flexible and adaptable enough for us to be able to engage properly around when those changing needs occur and to be able to respond to them in a reasonable way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#O01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Can Mr. O'Regan envisage a situation whereby voluntary bodies, on an ongoing basis, can inform the HSE and the Minister for Health at the beginning of the year that they will have add-on costs throughout the year arising from extra services that need to be provided or additional costs associated with services that are being provided and in what way?

For the ordinary population that requires increases in health, dementia and social care supports.  We have not done anything similar for disability social care services.  I understand this is something at which the HSE is looking and to which the voluntary providers are committed to contributing.  There is no equivalent for what the acute care sector calls the exotic or unscheduled care budget for disability social care services.

There is no doubt that, to coin a phrase, the independent review group has done the State some service, as will become manifest and for which the three representatives need to be thanked, as do those who are providing the support they receive in doing that work.  My colleagues have made several useful and interesting points.  To put it mildly, we have excavated a range of concerns and issues.<\/p> <p>  My first question is a speculative one for Dr. Day.  Are public bodies and the political system threatened by the voluntary sector as an equal partner, a conscience and critical friend?  How might the broken-down relationship be put back together?  What are the first three steps or the key pieces of that process?<\/p> <p>  There is an idea of health being a resource for living and well-being, something that supports people in being out and about, rather than simply being cared for in a health setting.  This point was touched on.  Is this being considered as something valuable in what I would call the investment, rather than the cost, made from the public purse?  I will put it in industrial relations terms.  Could this be the productivity element that will bring us from deficits and under-funding?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to other EU countries that had got it right.  To get us to use Google in the right place, about what states are we talking?  Mr. and Mrs. Google are our saviours.<\/p> <p>  In effect, the faith-based organisation sector was one of the spurs for the independent review group in starting its work.  It is interesting how it has moved from it.  I have in mind the idea of charity status and the Charities Act.  For charitable purposes is a concept that dates back hundreds of years, long before the Republic, the Free State or anything else.  It comes from an altogether different world view when kings were appointed divinely.  Now we have the notion of public benefit which the Constitution sets out in secular language.  It underwrites the connection between the old-fashioned terms of charity and charitable with public benefit.  The Constitution also includes fundamental freedom provisions.  Reference was made to a point about a group of parents.  The Constitution refers to the right of people to form associations and unions.  It does not give them the right to send in invoices to be returned as paid within 30 days.  That is understood.  Can the review group representatives offer some thoughts on whether that could be a way to bridge the traditional concept of faith-based or charitable purposes with public benefit or the public good?<\/p> <p>  I will come down to more testing or immediate issues.  The new head of the HSE was before the committee smartly after he was appointed.  He brought with him a letter he had written on 14 June.  Two things in it interested me.  The first was the statement that the director general held the line absolutely on the budget he had been given.  We know that the footnote is that every year we have seen the budget broken such that the State has to come in with a Supplementary Estimate.  We now have the idea that this cannot or will not happen or that it could happen but will not happen.  My second point is allied to the first.  The director general stated the HSE had to earn the trust and confidence of its funders.  I put this point to him on the day.  He is suggesting people who are not receiving services, whether they are disability or elderly care services, will have to wait until a public body earns the trust and confidence of another public body.  I simply do not know what words to put on that statement, but it is a serious place for public bodies in which to find themselves.  From our point of view and that of the people we want to serve, that leaves them well and truly out in the cold and there are many of them.  There are deficits and unmet needs.  We also have the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council giving us a financial weather forecast.  Let us also bring it in.  There is considerable competition in public spending.  The issue arises as to whether the base of &euro;60 billion has to be looked at or whether we keep looking at the portion on the edge that is considered to be extra funding.<\/p> <p>  I turn to the disability organisation representatives.  I am someone who lives on both sides of these tracks.  That is my position in the here and now, not only in the past.  I will attend a board meeting tomorrow of the Disability Federation of Ireland, of which I am chief executive.  I will attend our annual general meeting.  We are dealing with a 20% deficit in funding this year, as are others, because of reductions made earlier this year by the HSE, about which I am not moaning, as we all know it.  I have it also in being involved in the Seanad which is a great privilege and honour.  It is a valuable position to be in.<\/p> <p>  Section 38 and section 39 organisations provide ancillary and essential services.  Perhaps some of those present know this off by heart.  I have in mind two organisations, Ability West and the Brothers of Charity, both of which are based in Galway.  One is a section 38 organisation, while the other is a section 39 organisation.  I defy anyone to put the thickness of the paper I have in my hand between either of them.  That is one of the great lies in all of this.  Do the disability organisation representatives wish to comment on that matter?<\/p> <p>  The current narrative emerged during the past couple of decades.  It was different in previous decades, for example, when I started work in the Irish Wheelchair Association.  At the time, we might have met the Minister if he or she came to open something and do whatever else.  I am paraphrasing, but the Minister would say to us that when the Government got some money, we would be looked after.  It got money and we know exactly where we are today.  Something has shifted in the past 20 years.  That is one of the conundrums.  The narrative now is that there are too many organisations with inefficiencies and that there is duplication.  The view is disability services are getting almost &euro;2 billion annually.<\/p> <p>  My next comment is for the committee.  We need to have some analysis or receive some response smartly from the three connected entities in the public arena, namely, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Health and the HSE.<\/p><p>We know the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is always busy elsewhere.  I cannot see, however, how it, with any honour, could refuse to be part of this conversation with this committee and others.  I am sorry that my colleague, Deputy Bernard Durkan, is not here.  I found some of the things he said confusing.  I am coming to a conclusion after these points.  Deputy Durkan stated that he respected the voluntary sector for what it does.  He continued by saying that as a country we were happy to accept the services provided in the past and now.  I will put this point to the voluntary organisations.  As somebody who has grown up with and has a great gr&aacute; for voluntary participation in this republic, I find it hard to hear what Bernard said. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#P00200","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Which Bernard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#Q00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I am not referring to Mr. Bernard O'Regan but Deputy Bernard Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#Q00300","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":460,"content":"<p>There are two Bernards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#Q00400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>For the avoidance of doubt, I am referring to Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#Q00500","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Where is he?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#Q00600","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":463,"content":"<p>On his way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#Q00700","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":464,"content":"<p>Emotionally and instinctively, I heard that statement from Deputy Durkan in regard to a fear or threat of finding ourselves back in 2008 because the voluntary disability organisations would be getting a lot of funding.

Regarding the first point on whether the Department and the HSE regard the critical friend of the voluntary sector as a threat in some way, I cannot speak for them.  Let me take the question in a different way.  In our report we state that one of the strengths and one of the positive contributions of the voluntary sector is its ability to advocate, champion and say uncomfortable things.  We felt that was important in a democracy.  Those who work in the public sector are not free to criticise public policy.  I cannot remember the exact wording we used, but we stated that the role of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and the voluntary sector in this particular case is necessary to keep challenging the system to deliver the best that it can deliver.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the second point, the other European Union countries we looked at included France, Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands and Belgium, among others.  A European Observatory on Health Systems and Polices exists and gathers much comparative data which is very useful in looking at how other European countries are doing this.  We all know that there is no country on earth that does not have problems in its health sector.  We are not stating that everybody else has got it right and we do not.  We are stating that there are interesting things to learn from what others are doing in this area.  I hope that what comes through from our report is that there are problems but that they are fixable.  That should be our goal.  We should be trying to find a way to bring the parties together to fix these problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#Q01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Catherine Day"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I will make two comments.  Regarding the point made on the lack of difference between section 38 and section 39 organisations, I think that is correct.  It would not be possible to slip a sheet of paper in between the services provided, the language used in the legislation and in the contracts and to distinguish one as ancillary and the other as essential.  That makes no sense when they are exactly the same services.  This raises a core issue as to how we as a State and a country look at all our citizens and how we judge them.  If we look at the services being provided by one organisation and we describe them as ancillary but exactly the same services as essential services for somebody else, we are saying something as a State to those people with disabilities regarding how the State views them.  I do not believe that is how we think about it.  We want to treat everybody equally.  Our legislation and language, however, undermines some of that desire.  We end up with differences regarding how staff are being paid for doing the same job depending on which organisation they happen to be employed by.  That states something as well about the people in receipt of those supports and services.  We have to be cognisant of that too.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the point made about avoiding going back to 2008, we as service providers are really conscious of how the economic downturn affected people with disabilities in Ireland.  It affected all citizens but we have to be mindful that it had additional consequence for those people with disabilities.  There is no way that we want to cause or participate in a process that brings the State backwards.  That is not what we are about.  It is important for us today to name the issue.  We know we have a stake in the resolution of this problem.  We made the point in our opening statement that the IRG recommendations are challenging for everybody.  It is not just the State that has to do things.  There are things in there that we will find challenging as well and that will require us to consider how we are doing things, how we are using our assets and many other aspects.  If we are looking for the recommendations to be implemented, it behoves us to state that we are committing to something as well.  That has to be to work jointly with the State so that we do not go back to 2008 and we do not get into this belief that what is involved is always about just throwing money at the problem.  It cannot just be about that.  Equally, we cannot state that it is not about some money.

It is good to see that the Charities Regulatory Authority is looking at the Australian charities passport idea.  That would be very good.

Both reports are very welcome.  I will start with the increase in the health budget over the last four years.  There has been a substantial increase.  Have comparable amounts of money been allocated to the HSE and the voluntary sector?  We are talking about &euro;3.3 billion.  I think that is nearly the same amount as four years ago.  Has the comparable increase been looked at?  My second point concerns staffing levels in the HSE.  There has been an increase of 13,000 in four years and 2,700 of those are in administration and management.  I have serious issues with that.  Staffing in public health nursing has only increased by 3.7% whereas there has been an increase of 17% in administration and management staff in the HSE.<\/p><p>I do not believe there has been a comparable increase in staffing levels in the voluntary sector.  If anything, there has probably been a greater demand on the voluntary sector to do the same amount of work with fewer staff or do more work with fewer staff.  Has a comparison been done between the increases that have occurred in the public and voluntary sectors?<\/p><p> There is a lack of understanding in Ireland about the contribution of the voluntary sector and the organisations working in it.  I remember approximately five years ago going through the HSE's annual report and seeing more than 2,500 organisations getting funding and trying to explain it to the general public.  Does the voluntary sector need to get more information out there about the services it delivers and how cost-effective it actually is?  I know the nursing home sector is not comparable because it is very much the private sector and not the voluntary sector but I have seen that a relatively new nursing home run by the HSE costs &euro;1,600 per bed per week whereas a comparable facility three miles away receives &euro;900 per bed per week to look after the same demand for patients.  It is the same with regard to costings for the voluntary sector.  It appears to deliver very effective care to a large number of people at a very efficient cost but does not receive recognition for it.<\/p><p> Will the witnesses comment on increasing demands?  In private session this morning, I raised one aspect of the HSE whereby the staff of an entire section resigned because they cannot cope with increasing pressure from the general public requiring the service to be delivered.  To put my cards on the table, this is because of a lot of adverse commentary in the media.  For instance, if a voluntary organisation runs into any difficulty, the media immediately seem to focus on that particular aspect of the organisation without looking at the overall picture of what the organisation does.  Voluntary organisations are, unfairly, very prone to adverse media coverage.<\/p><p> The report shows the need for us all to work together, including the general public, voluntary organisations, the HSE and the Department.  There is a disconnect and the question now is how do we go forward.  It is not only about the HSE and the voluntary sector working together but also the general public.  There is only so much a voluntary organisation or healthcare system can do.  Perfection cannot be provided in every area but we have reached a stage where people are looking for perfection that we cannot deliver.  How do we get out the message that everyone has a part to play, not only those providing the service and working there but also the general public?  I might come back to make a few more comments later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#Q01600","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>Senator Burke is right about the lack of public visibility of the services provided by voluntary organisations.  People do not realise the depth and breadth of the essential services our organisations provide.  Interestingly, until 2016 the social care division of the HSE produced an annual report that set out in detail the funding that went to each organisation and the types of services provided.  People did not use it for bedtime reading but it was available in the public domain.  That report has not been published for the past two years so there really is no visibility of the quantum of services provided.  We need to find a way to get that message out there publicly.  We do it individually as organisations but the HSE in its own annual report should recognise the contribution of the voluntary sector and the types of services and quantity of services we provide for people.<\/p> <p>  With regard to whether headcount increases in the voluntary sector are comparable to those in the HSE, the short answer is that they are absolutely not.  This is compounded because we have a pay disparity between the public and voluntary sectors.  All of our organisations are struggling in a full economy to recruit and retain staff.  My organisation is the largest provider of personal assistance hours in the country and we find it very difficult to recruit and retain staff because people doing exactly the same job in the HSE are getting full pay restoration.  In the past month, they have been getting the benefit of pay for travel time, which our organisation cannot provide.  We cannot compete.  This impacts our services.  Already this year we have been unable to deliver personal assistance hours and this will only be compounded.  At the end of the day, it goes back to the people sitting in their homes relying on those personal assistance services.  They are in complete isolation and cannot get out of bed or their houses.  They cannot participate in and contribute to society and it is very important that we hammer this home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosemary Keogh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Senator Burke asked about the increase in budget and whether it was matched between the HSE and the voluntary service providers.  This year, the HSE budget uplift was 6%.  Our members did not experience a similar uplift.  It is a little more complicated for section 38 agencies that use the pension related deduction, or the additional superannuation charge to which it has become this year, as part of their operational income.  This goes back a little to Deputy Durkan's query on how we are funded.  We are funded by using some of the pension levy income in addition to the allocation from the HSE.  The effect of this for some of our members is they have had a negative increase in budget, that is, a decrease in budget, or a 1.16% or 1.6% increase in budget.  This does not match the pay awards we are expected to pay to remain compliant with health sector pay policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Shakespeare"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>It is fair to say that section 39 organisations have not seen a similar increase in budget.  The only increases we see are specific to service areas.  An individual's care needs may have increased and we may have negotiated an increase in funding for that person.  It is, therefore, very much related to particular services rather than the organisation as a whole.  Perhaps during the year HIQA inspections identify increased service requirements.  It is those we hope to get funded in the following year.  In the years they occur we are expected to meet those costs ourselves.  To give an example, as a result of a meeting with HIQA yesterday, we will probably have an additional cost of between &euro;60,000 and &euro;80,000 for just one service for three people.  That is just one of 61 residential services I have and that additional cost arose in one day.  These are continuous costs that increase but are not being met and have to be negotiated on a case by case basis each year.  Provisions are made in the HSE budget for increased numbers of places or increased numbers of multidisciplinary services such as occupational therapy but while they may be seen as increasing within HSE delivered services, those rarely translate to those of us in section 39 agencies.  We cannot avail of psychology services.  We spend more than &euro;250,000 each year buying in private psychology services to deliver to our service users because the HSE is unable to provide them through the public service for the individuals in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019061900002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mo Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":477,"content":"<p>If we compare what was going to the voluntary sector as a percentage of the budget four years ago with today, my understanding is that in real terms the budget to the voluntary sector has not increased.

We have just had that information given to us and it clearly shows those costs have increased exponentially in recent years.  We do not come under the remit of the State Claims Agency.  The section 38 disability agencies were brought in under the remit of the agency some years ago.  The ongoing effect that has had is that the insurance pool has decreased, which means that private insurance companies are now insuring section 39 agencies on the basis of a reduced pool and, therefore, our costs have gone up because we are not under the remit of the State Claims Agency.  That has had a significant effect on us.  Some of us self-insure, which is a perverse place to find oneself in, but there is no doubt that while the solutions are being considered, nothing has been forthcoming to offer us the same protections through the State Claims Agency as our section 38 colleagues.  As Senator Dolan said, the difference between us is barely a slip of paper.  This comes back to the issue of costs and contracts.

The process of examining such applications is set out in the International Protection Act 2015 with first instance decisions considered by the International Protection Office, IPO, and appeals determined by the International Protection Appeals Tribunal - both independent in the exercise of their functions in accordance with the Act.  The processes in both offices have been designed with input from the UNHCR. <\/p> <p>  While an international protection claim is being examined, we offer accommodation and related services to anyone without means.  This includes all meals, medical care and utilities.  A weekly personal allowance is paid to each person and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection cover exceptional needs.  The Department of Education and Skills provides school places for children resident in the centres and children also have access to the free preschool scheme, the early childhood care and education programme.  The HSE provides mainstreamed health services to residents.  It is a whole-of-Government approach to supports and services for applicants. <\/p> <p>  There is no obligation on anyone to accept the offer of accommodation and there is no restriction on the freedom of movement of applicants throughout the State.  Any notion of incarceration of applicants is wholly misleading and risks stigmatising the residents. <\/p> <p>  The pressure our accommodation system currently faces is clear.  The Reception and Integration Agency of the Department is accommodating 6,108 people - the figure last week - in its 39 accommodation centres and a further 760 people are in emergency accommodation in hotels and guest houses.  The use of emergency accommodation is sub-optimal.  It does not allow us to provide the full range of services to applicants that the &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; centres provide.  However, we must ensure that each person arriving today to claim protection, with no advance warning, tonight has shelter, food and any urgent medical care required. <\/p> <p>  Coupled with an increase in the number of people applying for protection in recent years is the large number of people with an international protection status or a permission to remain who continue to live in RIA accommodation.  We have approximately the same number of people in this scenario as we have applicants housed in emergency accommodation.  People with status or permission to remain have the same access to mainstream housing supports and services as nationals.  We are working intensively with organisations such as the Peter McVerry Trust, Depaul and the Jesuit Refugee Service to assist these people to transition to mainstream housing services but, as members will realise, that is challenging in the current housing environment.<\/p><p> The committee heard from Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon of the improvements that have been made to the system in recent years.  Significant improvements have been made to the system to deliver real improvements in living conditions and standards for residents.  Chief among these is the introduction of independent living.  I understand that most of the members of the committee visited the Mosney accommodation centre last Friday where they will have seen how independent living works first hand, including the foodhall where residents can obtain food and toiletries through a cashless and points-based system.  More than half of all residents now have access to cooking facilities and our aim is to have all residents in commercial centres benefitting from independent living by the middle of next year.  This will be achieved through our ongoing regional tendering process for the provision of accommodation.  Successful bidders will also have to provide dedicated living spaces for families and teenagers, and greater facilities for recreation.  Standards developed by an advisory group have recently been finalised and approved by the Minister, and will be applied in all centres.  Access to the labour market has also provided an important integration opportunity for eligible applicants.  To date, the Minister has granted 2,633 labour market access permissions, including 1,900 to direct provision residents.  Residents also have access to the services of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children.  Importantly, each centre also now has a friends of the centre group, which brings together residents, community and voluntary groups to increase integration opportunities and provide support for residents by local communities.<\/p><p> The Department is now engaged in its own review of the direct provision system.  I chair a high-level interdepartmental group to examine the current system and report to the Minister.  As part of this work, we are identifying gaps in service provision, areas where we can strengthen existing service provision and supports, and may propose alternative options for the provision of services to applicants in the short and medium terms.  The work of the committee will be an important consideration for the interdepartmental group.  As Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, said previously, we would welcome proposals and tender responses from individual non-governmental organisations or groups of NGOs that want to work with us to improve the system.  Indeed, we are already working with some NGOs to see how they can play a more active role in supporting residents.<\/p><p> The system has provided a safety net for more than 60,000 individuals and families since its inception 20 years ago but there is room for improvement.  These committee hearings are timely and coincide with the work that is already under way in the Department.  We have followed the hearings to date with great interest and carefully listened to the testimony of witnesses.  We share many of the views that were expressed to the committee.  The system of deciding on applications must continue to get faster and the improvements to living standards must continue to be implemented.  Where we may differ is on how we get there and how quickly the protection determination process can be made taking into account that this is a legal process, which requires full consideration of all aspects of each individual case.  We are open to engagement with all stakeholders to provide a system that is responsive to the needs of applicants, treats applicants with dignity and respect and continues to meet our international and humanitarian obligations to people seeking international protection from the State.<\/p><p> My colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions that the Chairman or members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Buckley.

I take on board all of the information Ms Buckley has given us.  This review has been extremely difficult.  For us, it has been devastating to hear some of the direct testimonies from people living in the system.  Ms Buckley said that changes have been made but there was room for improvement.  I understand the Department is taking steps but I feel that is a huge understatement.  This committee's role is to highlight as clearly and as fairly as possible places where we see the system is falling short of what is expected in terms of human rights and basic dignity, and to propose changes.  Some of the changes relate to the system as a whole and, therefore, political decisions must be made at Government level.<\/p> <p>  I wish to focus on questions relating to the operation our asylum system and the Department's responsibilities.  The first one is waiting times and delays.  After the passage of the International Protection Act a commitment was given to have a nine-month limit on a first instance decision.  Currently, the median waiting time is 15 months and the average is likely to be much longer.  Why has the target been missed?  Are more resources and staff needed to meet the target?  Does the Department have a timeline for when it expects to reach the nine-month target?  Similarly, there is often a long delay between the time people receive a positive decision and the final letter from the Minister.  What is the reason for such a delay?  What happens in the interim?<\/p> <p>  The second issue is about standards, which is critically important and repeatedly arose during the hearings.  The difference in the standard and quality of facilities is astonishing and urgently needs to be addressed in the short term.  I understand that the standards have been agreed and will be published soon.  Can Ms Buckley give us an overview of some of the areas that will be covered?  How do they differ from current practice?  What kind of oversight mechanism will be put in place?  Any standards will not be worth having unless they are closely monitored by an independent body that has real teeth and that conducts random inspection, which is vital.  During the hearings it was suggested that the remit of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, could be extended cover this.  How will the oversight of the standards work?  Will there be reporting on whether standards have been met?<\/p> <p>  The EU Reception Conditions Directive includes the need for an ongoing vulnerability assessment.  I have read the replies to parliamentary questions that were tabled on this issue.  It seems that what is being described is the basic medical screening that is carried out in Balseskin.  That is different from a proper vulnerability assessment because it would not pick up mental health issues, an in which I am specifically interested, trauma and sexual abuse.  Can Ms Buckley elaborate on the screening process and how the legal requirement for an ongoing vulnerability is met?<\/p> <p>  I have just started to explore the issue of profit.  The decision to operate our asylum system on a for-profit basis is a political one.  Yesterday, I looked through some of the materials on the contracts and I was quite shocked.  I would like to get the Department's perspective on it.  For example, Bridgestock is a company that runs two direct provision centres - Globe House in Sligo town and The Old Convent in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo.  The State pays Bridgestock about &euro;6 million per year to run the centres.  Since 2000, Bridgestock has made almost &euro;100 million.  In 2011, the company became unlimited and the majority of its shares were transferred to the British Virgin Islands.  That means the company's accounts are not published and it is shielded from public scrutiny.  Does Ms Buckley think that a private company with the majority control exercised from the British Virgin Islands with no public transparency as to its costs and profits is conducive to a safe and respectful asylum system?  It has been said also that the average amount paid to each company is &euro;35 per asylum seeker per night.  In Bridgestock's case, that provision amounted to &euro;6 million last year.  Does the Department know the profit margin enjoyed by the companies that run these centres?  How much of that &euro;35 of public money is spent assisting asylum seekers?  How much of it goes to the shareholders?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061900002#E00300","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":512,"content":"<p>The Senator has asked quite a lot of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061900002#E00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Yes.

Indeed, I might ask one of my colleagues to give a more detailed answer as I might know the generalities but not the detail.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the waiting times, the goal of the Department is to meet a medium time for first decision, from the International Protection Office, IPO, in nine months, by the end of this year.  We are, however, a way off that at the moment and we may miss our goal.  Part of the challenge has been as follows.  We have increased staffing in the IPO of civil servants by 20% and doubled the number of legal advisers who conduct initial interviews and so forth in the last two years, it is challenging for the Civil Service to recruit people into what, as members will know, is an extremely tight labour market.<\/p><p>We struggle to recruit the necessary staff in a timely fashion.  This problem is not unique to the immigration service or the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is an issue in Dublin with regard to recruiting civil servants.  However, we have increased staffing there by 20% in two years.  We have doubled the number of legal advisers who do the initial interviews.  We have reduced the overall hearing times.<\/p><p> Another issue that has arisen is that when the 2015 Act came into force thousands of existing applications were in the system.  They were reset to zero and started again through the process.  There was a challenge in dealing with the bulge of overhanging applications that existed at the time.  They had to be dealt with in a timely fashion and in order because of legal restrictions and requirements, and the requirements of the UNHCR.  Unlike other organisations that I managed in the past, where we were able to work on new applications and existing applications in two streams, this had to be done in consecutive order, which led to a large delay that was, in effect, built in from the get-go.  The team in the IPO is getting on top of this and we are moving towards a situation where applications coming in under the new Act in the first instance are being dealt with in a more timely fashion.<\/p><p> Senator Black also mentioned delays between the decision being given by the IPO or the international protection appeals tribunal, IPAT, and the letter issuing from the Minister.  Certainly there has been issue with an extended delay due to checks being conducted.  These final checks involved a final run through to establish, for example, whether there was any issue of a criminal record.  As my colleague, Mr. Kirrane, will be able to tell the committee, we have introduced a new policy of issuing these letters in a much more timely fashion and we should start to see it come through very shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061900002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>To add to this, at present we have approximately 330 of these cases on hand.

As I mentioned, the standards have been drawn up and were recently approved by the Minister.  We are working with his office on establishing an oversight committee.  As the committee knows, an oversight and inspection mechanism is part of the structures established for this.  We have not yet determined what that inspection mechanism would be.  What I can say right now is there are independent inspections of our direct provision centres to the standards that currently apply and they are unannounced.  RIA itself makes two unannounced inspections every year and a body contracted by RIA makes a further unannounced inspection every year to make sure the standards that apply are being met.  We certainly will look at the introduction of an independent inspection mechanism that will be subject to the oversight of a committee that will be there to ensure the Department manages and maintains the system to these new standards.  I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Baxter, to discuss the detail of the standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061900002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh Buckley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":519,"content":"<p>The standards are an example of the collaboration that RIA has had with the NGO sector, including NGOs such as the Jesuit Refugee Service.  The Children's Rights Alliance was integrally involved in the standards development process and the standards themselves were developed and facilitated by an independent facilitator.  It is a very good example of collaboration that covers accommodation, food and living conditions.  An example of where there will be a step change is in the area of training.  It will require ongoing training of centre staff and management with regard to person-centred approaches to the delivery of services.  There will be training on interculturalism, awareness of trauma and mental health issues and whether a person has experienced sexual or domestic violence.  We feel this represents a step change in the capacity of centre managers and staff to engage with centre residents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061900002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Baxter"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":520,"content":"<p>The third aspect mentioned by the Senator is vulnerability assessments.  It is a legal requirement of the directive that a vulnerability assessment be carried out.  I mentioned that putting people into emergency accommodation is not the optimal solution and it is not something we are keen on.  Part of the reason for this is it becomes harder for us to offer the same assessment of vulnerabilities as is available in the standard direct provision centres.  We also had a difficulty in Balseskin in we had a couple of cases of chickenpox, which is a very human situation.  The protocol from the HSE is that we must not put children or women of childbearing age into that centre while a period elapses after the detection of chickenpox for obvious medical reasons.  This has been challenging for us as the numbers of people arriving into the country are increasing year on year, and they have increased by approximately 30% every year for the past while.  The chickenpox protocol has elapsed and we are now able to put people through Balseskin again.  We are giving the necessary vulnerability assessments and health screening through Balseskin for arriving visitors.  The HSE also has an arrangement in place with Safetynet Primary Care, which attends to places such as emergency accommodation centres to ensure medical and other screening can be done there.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is correct that vulnerability assessments extend beyond medical screening.  They need to detect mental health conditions that may not be apparent in the first instance.  It is a necessity that these issues get picked up as time goes by, and every instance where a person interfaces with the RIA, IPO or whatever provides another opportunity for the screenings and assessments to occur.  Our advice to the GPs with whom we interface is that at any point where they detect them they need to feed them back, of course within the confidentiality limits that arise for anybody's medical conditions.  Where they are known to the RIA, we can certainly address them.  We continue to have to work towards making sure we meet the legal requirements.  We believe we are meeting basic legal requirements at present but certainly it is something we need to work towards.  It is not ideal, particularly in a situation when we have so many people in emergency centres.  It is much better for people to be in the direct provision centres, despite the ongoing public discourse about them.<\/p> <p>  As the Senator pointed out, the use of commercial companies in the running of centres on State-owned property and contracting with private companies is a policy decision and this situation will continue.  It is worth saying that we will require everybody we interact with to comply with the law of the land.  For instance, they must have a tax clearance certificate.  The obligation on us is to ensure value for money in the delivery of this demand-led service where there is a significant challenge with regard to the budget for the service, particularly this year.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, the use of commercial companies is a policy decision and not one on which I can comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061900002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I apologise that I must leave a little early.

The talk, the interagency links and engagement all sound good, but time and again, the examples on the ground do not stand up to the presentation from RIA.  In some centres, children are accepted into the local national school, but the support and services made available are very limited.  In other situations, children from direct provision centres are not accepted into the local primary schools.  The protocol should be that local primary schools are obliged to take children from direct provision centres and should not be in a position to refuse.<\/p><p> Today, I want to focus on emergency accommodation.

I spoke directly to the Minister about this, so the Department is not unaware of it.  Last January, people in emergency accommodation were bused for six or seven hours to another part of the country in order to facilitate a wedding in a venue being used for emergency accommodation.  When the wedding was done and dusted, they were shipped back.  They were treated appallingly.

I hope that things will be handled differently in future.  Communication with the coroner's office will be key in that regard.  I will raise two final issues, which relate more directly to direct provision <i>per se<\/i>.  I have previously raised the matter of location.  It is not my view that all centres should be located in Dublin or anything like that.  While I have the opportunity I condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the attacks on proposed direct provision centres in Moville and Roosky.  They were appalling acts which show a disgraceful mindset.  While I do not believe all who present for protection should be accommodated in Dublin, there are issues for the residents arising from the location of some centres.  People accommodated in Moville would have had to travel through the Six Counties, which is not legal, or to take an extremely circuitous route to attend appointments in Dublin.  That would probably not be possible in a single day.  The income given to such people would make the use of public transport very challenging.  Accommodation would also have presented a challenge.  Mount Trenchard is not served by public transport generally.  Travelling from Kenmare would probably involve an overnight stay if one had to spend any serious length of time in Dublin.<\/p><p>I have raised this with the Minister previously.  When people are required to attend appointments in Dublin, insofar as possible, centres should not be located in places that have poor public transport connections.  They should be located in places with transport links that are as good as possible, where there are opportunities to work and good educational opportunities, and where capacity exists in the community to support the centre.  In addition, as much as possible needs to be done to bring the mountain to the centre.  People should be able to attend as many of their appointments as possible and fulfil as many of their obligations as possible within the centre.  The Minister seemed open-minded to that point.  Is it being progressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061900002#L00800","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":631,"content":"<p>It is.  There have been some very positive developments on that front.  Up to the end of last year, people had to be brought to Dublin, in many cases for an overnight stay, for their International Protection Office, IPO, interviews.  At the instigation of the Minister, we have instituted a pilot with the IPO which allows interviews to be held closer to the residents of the direct provision system.  An initial outing was held in our office in Tipperary town.  It worked extremely successively, save that it was in Tipperary town, when it needed to be closer to our population.  We now propose to run those interviews in a more co-ordinated way, in Cork in the initial phase.  As Cork is within an hour of approximately one third of the population of our direct provision centres, it presents a highly achievable way of delivering the IPO interview process.  We are also looking at delivering similar interviews in Sligo, which would be extremely helpful for people in the north west, particularly those living in Donegal.  There is a prospect of delivering services closer to the people.  That is standard for services to Irish citizens but it is not how we have traditionally managed the interview process in the IPO system.  We are working very hard to deliver that over the course of this year.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy about location.  It has been policy for a long time to disperse people across the country so that all asylum applicants are not gathered in, for example, Dublin.  That would be extremely difficult in the context of the current accommodation situation.  It is much better for people to be dispersed across the country.  As a consequence, Ireland has had a great dispersal of people with permission to remain or refugee status.  They are dispersed across all communities.  Every part of the country has been able to accommodate people and to bring them into the system.  The procurement model which has been adopted for direct provision centre means that we accept any centre that is offered to us if it meets our standards.  It is not the case that we choose a particular location but is a case of accepting what is offered to us.  We are very interested in hearing the views of the committee as to whether there should be more direction as to where we locate centres and as to how that might be done.  We will be considering the future of the way in which we procure and select sites for direct provision centres at the interdepartmental group I am chairing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061900002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I will finish on these two points.  I asked a question at the last committee hearing.<\/p><p>I told the witnesses I had a concern about the Department's culture and attitude in respect of INIS and RIA.  When I suggested the system might be too adversarial, Dr. Liam Thornton said he felt I was being generous in so describing the attitude and referred to the existence of a culture of disbelief.  He told the committee that when the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection started to plan for the increases in the direct provision allowance, an official in the Department of Justice and Equality who was asked to offer a comment or express views began by stating they are all working anyway.  A few other examples were given and a few other comments were made during the meeting.  Another witness made the valid point that the Department's responsibility to uphold the security of the State might inform some its attitudes.  I did not detect much disagreement with the view that there is an adversarial attitude to applicants.  It is fair to give the officials from the Department an opportunity to respond to what was said at last week's meeting and give their views on the issues raised.<\/p><p> I have a final question.  There has been a great deal of discussion in recent weeks about the potential to get out of private tendering, which clearly cannot be done overnight.  This is very much in line with my own thinking.  I believe the State should seek to provide accommodation directly or through not-for-profit bodies, approved housing bodies or community and voluntary organisations.  At the same time, an effort should be made to integrate people into the mainstream housing system as quickly as possible.  Is the Department open to that, given how expensive direct provision has been?  I have seen statistics that suggest &euro;1.25 billion has been spent on the system since 2001.  Why has the Department not pursued such an approach since 2001?  We are talking now about trying to get out of emergency accommodation as an immediate response.  In 2001, direct provision was an emergency response as well but 18 years on, we are still with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061900002#L01000","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I will begin by answering the Deputy's question about culture.  As the Deputy may be aware, I arrived in the Department of Justice and Equality relatively recently.  He will know that we are undertaking a substantial reform of the Department.  I believe the Secretary General may brief the committee on that at a future date.  I find the Department an interesting place to work.  I have been a civil servant for a very long time and it certainly has a different culture from any place I have worked before.  When I have spoken to the team who work on the direct provision system - the RIA team - I have been significantly impressed to see that people are treated as individual human beings.  That is what the staff try to achieve.  It is extremely difficult because of the pressure of numbers we are under.  There is very much an attitude of seeing people as human beings.<\/p> <p>  I also was asked about the international protection system and the asylum process.  There is a very legalistic process to go through.  As with any legal process, people can find that very confrontational.  When people come in and set out a series of facts, those facts are challenged and tested as part of a well laid-out process.  The system is carefully monitored by the UNHCR and is extremely fair.  I think the substantial reforms of the international protection system that were done in 2015 have led to a big change in timeframes and the approach to bringing all the decisions together.  I will give an example of that.  One of the McMahon recommendations was that people who had been in the process for more than five years would have their applications reviewed.  Over 1,000 people received permission to remain on foot of that review.  That was delivered quietly and effectively on a case-by-case basis.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that people can have a certain perception of big Departments like the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Department has a security of the State function.  Its work involves ensuring the immigration policy the State has decided on is deployed and enforced.  There is, however, very much a regard for the human being in the middle of that.  We need to keep focusing on that.  Part of the goal of the reforms of the Department is to ensure that system prevails throughout.  Freedom of information requests sometimes reveal that there are robust debates in the Department, as there are in every Department.  Notwithstanding the personal view that may have been expressed by an individual in an email, the reform went ahead and is strongly supported by the Department.  There has been an increase in the allowance for direct provision.  We strongly support the implementation of the McMahon recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061900002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending this morning's meeting.

There were issues with the facility and it eventually closed a number of years ago.<\/p> <p>  This weekend a number of residents, the majority from Dublin, came to emergency accommodation in Carrick-on-Shannon.  Some people in the community were somewhat aggrieved that there was no prior notice and they did not know in advance that these people were coming.  I have learned quite a bit from listening to the interactions so far and it has been explained that, in most cases, the Department tries not to move families into emergency accommodation because it is short term.  For that reason, it was all men who arrived into this particular centre and that will also apply in the future.<\/p> <p>  I would like clarity on some issues.  I met some of the people in the centre in Carrick-on-Shannon the other day.  I understand some of them are doing courses and are involved in education.  Colleges and educational facilities will be closed over the summer but those who are in education will want to return to their courses later.  How will that be achieved given that they are now in emergency accommodation 100 miles or more from where they had been receiving their education?  The situation is similar for those who were in work, as some of them who have been here more than nine months are entitled to be.  That can be difficult.  Having said that, Carrick-on-Shannon is a tourist town and a welcoming place in general.  If they were looking for suitable employment, it is possible they could find it the town.  That issue about the distance from education and employment still exists.<\/p> <p>  I would like Ms Buckley to explain why there is a level of secrecy and communities are not told when people are moving into them because it creates unnecessary suspicions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061900002#N02600","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":681,"content":"<p>I will distinguish between emergency accommodation and direction provision centres.

On at least three occasions, Ms Buckley referred to one direct provision centre by name.  We understand why.  While it has its issues, Mosney is by far the best representation of the current direct provision system.  It is not representative of what is out there, which is part of the problem we see.  We would have an even greater problem, if not even a crisis, were it not for some of the decisions that have been taken which have significantly relived the stress within the system.  I refer to the increase in the weekly stipend which has helped.  However, the much more important decision was the right to access work, to afford people the dignity and self-worth of work.<\/p><p>I say that because I know from my own community and knowledge of the situation that it has made an enormous difference, underscoring the fact that these are human beings just like ourselves who have the right to face a day's work and to come home in the evening, be he or she a single individual or, arguably more importantly, someone who has a family, as many of them do.  These are important decisions.  I would think that the current arrangement post nine months could be looked at.  It would be important to bring that back considerably.  It does not in any way impede the processing.<br\/><br\/>The processing issue is a big issue.  Little of Ms Buckley's opening statement and the focus of the questions related to what can be done.  I understand and appreciate the complexities and the legal elements within the appeals system <i>et al<\/i>.  All of that builds up, but how do we compare in terms of international comparators?  &quot;I do not know,&quot; is my honest answer.  We certainly need to explore the processing of applications with a mind to reaching real and fair decisions at the earliest possible time.  That is essential.<br\/><br\/>I will make a couple of points and invite Ms Buckley to respond in a general way at the end.  It strikes me that it is the Department of Justice and Equality and yet there is this ever present reality presenting here today that it is now, whether one likes it or not, almost a housing authority.  The Department has a cohort of people to provide housing for.  In the health services, people holding up beds have been wrongly described.  Here we are looking at people holding up beds within the direct provision system that might equate with the number in emergency accommodation if one were able to secure them housing accommodation within the wider society.  Are there steps being taken to explore what some of my colleague members have raised, namely, in terms of engagement with the housing associations?  I would echo some of the views of my colleague members in relation to looking seriously at the construction of temporary housing.  What stands out about Mosney as against some of these older buildings, be they whatever in past use, is that many of the latter are not suitable for what they are currently undertaking.  Mosney is quite unique because of its construct and the thought behind it.  Is there the prospect of replicating clusters of such standard?  If it is to be temporary direct provision, the greater number of us in any conversation would think that six months is more than adequate for the processing procedure and accommodation if there were housing provision of that standard that allowed people to cater to their own needs, to cook the food that they are used to, to have access to purchase through local stores, and to be able to perform and operate as a family in many of the instances that they are families.<br\/><br\/>On the concentration of effort on searching out and identifying former hotel properties, etc., the number of such properties is finite.  There is not an endless supply of these anymore than there is an endless supply of former agricultural colleges in my own backyard.  We need to be looking much more seriously because the numbers that present will not end tomorrow or next year.  The situations that have given rise to the growth in numbers are conflict situations that are continuing.  People are genuinely, in the greater number of cases, fleeing very fearful situations.  We need to step up to the plate in a real and serious way.  A serious exploration of that housing provision is the only way that we will move away from emergency accommodation.  I welcome the statement by Ms Buckley here today that we want to get out of emergency accommodation but we need to look seriously.  We cannot be hoping and praying that the numbers will drop and we will cope better then.  It will not happen that way.  We need to be looking at new and imaginative ways of dealing with it.  I underscore once more the need to examine speedier processing.  I would welcome any comment that Ms Buckley might have to make on that before we conclude.  Independent catering and the purchasing of food for meal preparation is such an important need for people and it is not universally the case.<br\/><br\/>It is sad to meet young school-going boys and girls and, as I have in the very recent past, to say to them knowing their school uniform, &quot;Are you looking forward to the holidays?&quot;  I can honestly say to Ms Buckley that not one in the little group that I spoke with was looking forward to the holidays.  For them, the great joy was getting to school every day rather than being in what they viewed as an isolated and limited scope location.  School enthused.  It gave them all sorts of opportunities, and mixing with the school population.  From the very first day of the school summer break, they are looking forward to getting back to school in September.  That is unique.  I guarantee Ms Buckley that was not my children's story or any of their neighbours'.  We need to be cognisant of that.<br\/><br\/>Ms Buckley spoke about health screening in advance of placement.  While RIA has not direct responsibility for health and education provision, nevertheless it states in its outline of responsibilities working with the other services to ensure this.  What of health issues presenting subsequently?  I am aware of situations, not in my own immediate backyard but elsewhere, where accessing a GP is now almost an impossible project.  Ms Buckley spoke of chickenpox.  Perhaps Mr. Sinclair would take a note of the following.  I wrote to RIA on Monday of this week, addressing it without a named official, instancing what I believe to be the case of an unaccompanied child within the direct provision system who is not accessing education and who in the course of the year so far has had chickenpox and could only access calamine.  The child had no access to a GP.  Because the young person is relatively tall for someone of that age, sometimes that child can be viewed as a young adult, which is not the case.  I have seen the birth certificate and I can confirm that the child is not.  The child is unaccompanied and in great distress.<\/p><p>I documented all of that this week and would appreciate it if the particular case was addressed.  It is absolutely imperative that the child and their needs be catered for.<\/p><p> I support the views expressed by Deputies Jack Chambers, O'Callaghan and others on the importance of having an independent audit of the accommodation centres and the needs of residents.  It is not only a case of presenting.  People may say those who are inclined to crib and cry would be the first ones to be heard; that in itself is not a non-Irish thing.  There is an element of fear and distrust among the population in the centres.  They are mindful that they are applicants for asylum and loath to give voice to matters, some of which could be quite simple and easily resolved, but they are fearful and the fear factor must be taken on board.  The people who engage and who would be trusted to carry out an independent audit, as opposed to the visit by the Reception and Integration Agency, vwhether announced or unannounced, need to have the people skills and necessary understanding of those whom they meet and deal with.  That is very important if the truth is to be got to.  It is very important to know the truth.<\/p><p> I have covered several matters in that outline.  People in my home county of Monaghan, a host community not only of direct provision but also emergency accommodation, are horrified by the approach to emergency accommodation.  We are cognisant of the references to moving people with very little notice to accommodate other events.  It offers no understanding whatever of people's dignity and their needs and there is great offence among the overwhelming number of the population of my home county at this.  There is a very strong view that we need to do much better than we are in direct provision centres.  I have indicated some of the issues for the delegates and invite them to make whatever closing comments they wish to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019061900002#O01600","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":698,"content":"<p>If we are to introduce the new standards, we will move to a better accommodation offer across the board.  I agree that the centre in Mosney is the jewel in the crown and offers the model in terms of where we need to get in providing for independent living and so forth.  It is something we are working very hard to try to achieve.<\/p> <p>  It is very hard to compare internationally Ireland's processing system as we have a different legal system and structure for taking decisions.  We treat international protection applicants entirely differently from other European countries.  For example, other European countries detain applicants for asylum, but we do not detain anybody.  We are working very hard to achieve the nine-month median goal.  I would not be thanked by my colleague if I tried to set a more challenging goal for him and his team.  I was head of the Workplace Relations Commission and know that there is a limit to how by much a process can be shortened because people must be given an opportunity to return questionnaires, etc.  There is an absolute minimum that can be achieved.  Mr. Kirrane and his team have been working very hard to introduce a shortened timeframe for applications from applicants from some of the safe countries of origin we have referenced, including Albania and Georgia, in conjunction with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  That will tighten the timeframes in a way that will remain fair to the applicants, but we must still give consideration to their individual application.<\/p> <p>  There was mention of health screening and access to healthcare after screening.  It is unusual that health screening is offered to everybody.  After people join the process, they have the same right to access health services as ordinary members of the Irish population.  The Chairman identified an issue.  We try to work closely with colleagues in the HSE, particularly where a direct provision centre is opening, to allay the concerns of the local population that there will be yet another demand placed on local GP services, etc.  It is a challenge.  There is no doubt that offering health services in any part of the country can present a challenge.<\/p> <p>  A child should not be in a direct provision centre.

On the fear factor mentioned by the Chairman, nothing that happens in a direct provision centre such as the making of a complaint can have an impact on the decision-making process of the international protection office or the international protection appeals tribunal.  They are independent in the operation of their functions.  There is a Chinese wall between the systems in place.  I appreciate that there may be fear, but it may be just as well to say bluntly right now that somebody who complains in a centre about some circumstance within it will see absolutely no impact on the legal consideration given to the application for asylum or protected status.  As well as being able to complain to the RIA about any circumstance, it is good that people have a right of access to the Ombudsman and the children's ombudsman.  We have a system under which people can complain to somebody who is completely independent of the system to have his or her complaints addressed, just as an Irish person can.<\/p> <p>  That covers most of the issues raised.  We would be very interested in hearing any recommendation the committee might wish to present.  We cannot promise that we could change course as rapidly as others might like, but we know we that are moving towards a better system.  We will take on board and consider any recommendation the committee might have to make.  I reiterate that we are really open to considering other models of provision at the centres.

The purpose of this legislation, which is being promoted by the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, is to provide greater protections for people who find themselves in the very unfortunate position of a financial institution trying to gain possession of their property.  Everyone here commends the Minister of State on seeking to improve the situation for people who find themselves in that unfortunate position and are before the courts.  As I mentioned during the Second Stage debate, my party is supportive of this legislation.  I do not know whether it will have a significant impact on the position of the aforementioned people when they are before the courts but hopefully it will.  I had tabled a number of amendments which would have improved the legislation in a number of ways.  First, it is very important that people who find themselves before the courts have the benefit of having the legal protections available to them advocated before the courts on their behalf.  That is why in one of the amendments I tabled, which is similar to an amendment tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, I sought to expand the parameters of the Civil Legal Aid Act so that it would apply to the applications that can be brought under this new legislation.  I also wanted to put forward an amendment that dealt with the situation in respect of a person who is applying for the appointment of a receiver.  The appointment of a receiver is a very complex aspect of our legal system.  Generally, receivers are appointed pursuant to a deed of instrument or a contract.  The provision tabled by myself and Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire aimed to facilitate a change in the law so that a receiver could not be appointed over a certain type of property unless there was an order from the court.  The final amendment I tabled is in respect of what may be a bit of an ambiguity in the Bill.  We all hope that when this legislation is enacted, it will apply to all existing mortgages and will not simply apply to mortgages that are created in the future.  We have a problem in Ireland at present with people who are in mortgage arrears and it is these people this Bill is seeking to protect and that the Oireachtas should be seeking to protect.  In that context, I am concerned that in the future, financial institutions will be able to claim that this legislation does not apply to mortgages that existed prior to its enactment.  <\/p><p>I had an opportunity last night to speak to the Minister of State about these amendments and I am conscious that if I push them, at best the legislation may be delayed and at worst, it my not be enacted.  That is not what I want to do.  My objective and that of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is to improve the legislation.  However, if there is a potential threat of the legislation not being enacted at all, I will withdraw my amendments.  It is preferable to get this legislation enacted and if it is enacted, I hope it will be of benefit to the house owners who find themselves in the terrible position to which I referred earlier.  I have some concerns, as I said, about the civil legal aid system and its application, the appointment of a receiver and the extent to which the legislation applies to existing mortgages.  If the courts interpret this legislation in a negative way once it is enacted, we will have to come back and amend it.  Indeed, we may need to amend it in any event in due course.  I want to see the legislation enacted without delay which is why I am not going to pursue or proceed with any of my amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019061900002#B00600","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.

In a general sense, there is a significant issue in relation to legal aid across a wide range of actions, including serious delays and excessive minimum contributions being requested due to under-funding of the Legal Aid Board.  The cases addressed by this legislation will inevitably involve significant legal argument at the Circuit Court, whereby people will have to have a debate with the financial institutions and their legal teams.  It is only right and proper that people who do not have the means, which will often be the case with people in mortgage arrears, should have access to civil legal aid, where appropriate, in order to make strong arguments on their own behalf in court in order to advance their case.  That is only right and proper.  The amendment providing for same has been ruled out of order because it would involve a charge on the Exchequer but it is a matter for which the Minister can provide on Report Stage.  The Department can try to address it because it is vitally important.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the other amendments, specifically amendment No. 3.  We had a meeting with Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, recently and Deputy O'Callaghan has also had communications with that organisation about an issue it has correctly highlighted.  There are instances, increasingly, of people who due to mortgage arrears have moved out of a mortgaged property, moved back into the family home and rented out the mortgaged property.  They did so in order to meet their mortgage payments and to keep up with their financial obligations in the hope that in the longer term, they would be able to move back into the property.  However, because they are renting out the property, it is possible to appoint receivers without the same court procedures that might apply for a repossession.  The financial institution does not have to go through the repossession process and the additional protections that have been created in that regard do not apply.  Neither would the protections in this legislation apply.  In such cases, we are proposing that applications for receivership should come to the Circuit Court.  Very often these are people who are trying to do the best they can to stay on top of their mortgages in order to get their home back.  That is what they want to do but there is a backdoor there that has been created.  Often it is not the traditional banks but some of the other financial institutions that are using that backdoor and in those circumstances, the people involved need protection which is what the amendment seeks to provide.  <\/p> <p>  The final amendment, to which Deputy O'Callaghan also referred, deals with the issue of retrospectivity and I ask the Minister of State to clarify the position in that regard.  It is not immediately clear that this Bill will apply retrospectively.  It must be the case that the tens of thousands of mortgages that are in arrears and the people who are very worried about repossession are afforded the maximum protection.  The amendments that Deputy O'Callaghan and I have tabled seek to ensure that retrospectivity is crystal clear and to provide a sound legal basis for those people in this legislation.  <\/p> <p>  Generally I do not share Deputy O'Callaghan's view on the amendments, which I communicated to him.<\/p><p>I accept the point, and do not feel any desire to delay this legislation unduly, but this is how the legislative process works.  We have a discussion and we table amendments to try to strengthen the Bill.  I believe that these amendments do strengthen the Bill.  If it is delayed subsequent to that, and people decide to try to slow it down, that is a matter for the Government and the Minister's colleagues.  These are good amendments and it is worth including them in the legislation.  Consequently, I will press them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019061900002#B00900","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming before us.

The basic objective of the Bill is to propose added protection for people in mortgage arrears in respect of their principal private residence.  This amendment will not help such people in any way for the simple reason that the receivers are not appointed to a principal private residence.  Receivers are generally appointed to buy-to-let properties with the purpose of ensuring that any rental income on the property is used to service the mortgage.  In the case of the principal private residence, there is no rental income and so the appointment of a receiver would be of no benefit to the lender.  However, receivers may be appointed to buy-to-let premises on which there is a house loan mortgage where the borrower continues to collect the rental income but is not using it to service the mortgage.  The appointment of a receiver in such a case is fully justified, for the same reason that a receiver may be appointed to receive rent in the case of other commercial properties.  It is not clear why, in such circumstances, the borrower should benefit from the additional protection set out in the amendment.<\/p> <p>  The rationale behind the proposed amendment is to assist certain borrowers who, for whatever reason, rent out their principal private residence with a view to serving the mortgage.  Such an action is itself a breach of the mortgage contract.  It is not clear how often this happens.  However, the proposed amendment would cover all instances where the lender decided to appoint a receiver, which would include all buy-to-let mortgages.  This would invariably cause difficulty for the Courts Service, given the demands on its time and the cost of processing applications for court orders.  Recent figures from the Central Bank indicate that receivers have been appointed to more than 5,600 buy-to-let mortgage accounts, and approximately 300 receivers are appointed to such accounts every quarter.  This requires lenders to apply for a court order prior to the appointment of a receiver and leads to increased demands on the Courts Service's time and cost. <\/p> <p>  I should add that, apart from any statutory power to appoint a receiver, mortgage deeds normally reserve the contractual right for the mortgage to appoint a receiver when conditions such as those in section 108(1) are satisfied.  The amendment seeks to set aside terms that may be contained in the mortgage agreement contract and could lead to a legislative challenge.  If the amendment is passed, the Minister has indicated that it will be necessary to obtain legal advice prior to Report Stage, which would delay the passing of the Bill.  That is why we will be opposing the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019061900002#C00900","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":740,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State clarify whether it would be a breach of the mortgage terms to have somebody other than the person paying the mortgage in the property  paying rent and for that rent to be used to pay the mortgage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019061900002#C01000","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":741,"content":"<p>It is a breach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019061900002#C01100","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":742,"content":"<p>Is the Minister of State also stating that, regardless of whether it is a breach, in circumstances where that is happening it is not possible to appoint a receiver?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019061900002#C01200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":743,"content":"<p>Yes.

The intention behind the amendments is unclear, but may arise from the desire that the Bill should have retrospective effect.  To that end, the amendment seeks to insert a new section with the words \"any proceedings brought by a mortgagee, irrespective of when the mortgage was created\".  I consider the amendment unnecessary, as it is clear from the current wording that the section applies to any and all proceedings brought by the mortgagee for the possession of land to which section 2 applies.  The amendment adds nothing; on the contrary, by departing from the existing wording in section 2 it seems to suggest that the range of mortgages to which section 2A would apply is wider than the range under section 2.  There is a danger that the amendment will create uncertainty on the scope of the Bill.  The current wording is consistent with section 2(2) of the 2013 Act, and amending it in the manner suggested could create confusion as to its scope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019061900002#D00600","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":766,"content":"<p>Can the Minister of State tell us directly whether he is certain that all existing cases are covered by this legislation?

We are about to discuss transport proposals but one glaring omission from the Government's recent publication is the concept of free public transport.  Many cities worldwide are moving to free public transport and Luxembourg is the first country to do so in its entirety.  This is vital if we are to tackle climate change and meet the demand for less carbon emissions.  It would also free up the roads from congestion, which is a major issue in many cities, particularly in the Dublin suburbs where I come from.  Yesterday, it took me about an hour and 15 minutes to get home to Blanchardstown and other people have a longer daily commute.  The Government's proposal largely contains punitive measures such as higher car parking charges for vehicles with higher emissions, but not everyone has the money or the wherewithal to switch to lower vehicular use and we do not have the public transport to allow people to get out of their cars.  That is the reality.  As I have noted previously, there are 110,000 people in Blanchardstown but there is no Luas or metro connection to the area, which is bus dependent.  A rail line serves some of the area but it is inaccessible for most people and the industrial areas.<\/p> <p>  We probably need more than one session on this matter if the committee is serious about contributing to tackling the global emergency that has now been recognised by young people and in the recent election.  We should consider this and there are cities we can look at and expert witnesses we could invite.

In the council's latest report, Climate-Change Policy: Getting the Process Right, we argue that what is required is a mission-oriented approach to climate that will help us to drive the development of actions and solutions that will decarbonise our economy.  That would allow us to capture the full range of positive benefits from what we have seen must be a just transition to a low-carbon future in terms of our economy, health, well-being, air quality and enhanced biodiversity.  However, the council points out that ambitious goals such as these without a rigorous and reflective policy will not be sufficient to deliver a transition to a low-carbon future.<\/p> <p>  What the council has focused on in its report is to ensure that growing ambition is matched by action.  What is required is a process of policy development and continuous improvement, which over time can force emissions downwards at the scale and pace we require.  The system we talk about uses target setting at a specific level, action and review that will ensure ambitious actions on climate, which would often encounter difficulties, costs and contested ideas, need to be grappled with and not glossed over.  We accept that in many areas of climate change policy the precise details about how we will act are not yet fully worked out but progress has still to be achieved in the face of that uncertainty.<\/p> <p>  The council talks about continuous improvement in policy and I will focus on what that means for climate and specifically for transport.  For climate policy, the council strongly supports the Government&rsquo;s proposal to adopt a policy and implementation process modelled on the Action Plan for Jobs.  The process it outlines in its report also bears close similarity to the proposal of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action to establish a climate action implementation board.  Such a process and structure can provide the key mechanism that will allow for intensive reporting and monitoring of action.  However, the existing range of known actions on climate policy, even if fully implemented, will not be sufficient.  The council, therefore, recommends that along with the monitoring process in the Action Plan for Jobs, which rightly focuses on the need to check implementation and deliverables, it should in the case of climate change be enhanced to make sure that Government agencies actively explore, find, trial and cost new solutions for specific contexts.  In doing so, the Government agencies will have to engage and collaborate with each other and with the non-Government actors in their respective networks.  This Action Plan for Jobs plus process at the centre of Government will have a key role in trying to pool the learning from action on the front line in various sectors to prompt co-operation between Departments and sectors to find and exploit the co-benefits for health, well-being and the environment.<\/p> <p>  On transport, the council identifies three key additional activities and processes that would support future climate action.  First, the council strongly supports the role of task forces in searching for appropriate solutions.  The report by Dr. Torney and Dr. Devaney focuses on a low emissions vehicle task force in transport as something that seems to have the capacity to do the key element of grappling with the complexity and uncertainty that characterises some of the actions that are required in the transport sector.  Running such task forces and learning from their work should form a core part of the climate policy and not only be tangential to it.<\/p> <p>  Second, the council highlights the role of departmental and agency-led processes that would support breakthroughs and innovation, and scale-up promising solutions.  They would achieve this by using the full range of tools available, including regulation, acting as facilitator and convenor, and using the traditional instruments that shape behaviour such as taxes, charges and subsidies.<\/p> <p>  Third, the council recommends that an enhanced research and knowledge-generating capacity and capability are required in transport because they are lacking in transport compared to other sectors such as agriculture and energy where Teagasc and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, are key resources.  What the council envisages is a research approach and capacity that are very close to practice and that help in finding new solutions and identifying obstacles and challenges to progress.  Examples we cite are research trials on practical issues such as parking policy, cycling and safety, how we might prioritise pedestrians in urban areas and congestion charges.  The second area is how we engage people and communities in trying to find and see the co-benefits of having a more sustainable mobility system.  The third area is using our research to develop best-practice guidelines and standards, and advisory support where it is needed, for example, in creating safe walking routes in rural areas.<\/p> <p>  These three innovations-task forces, which would move specific issues forward, using more of the co-ordinating force and instruments of the State to increase the pace of change; and an enhanced practice orientated research programme would in the council&rsquo;s view create the means of continuously improving the sustainability and quality of our mobility system and wider climate policy process.<\/p><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present our work.

My colleague, Dr. Laura Devaney, of the School of Law and Government in Dublin City University and I completed this research which was commissioned by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  However, the analysis and conclusions are ours and do not necessarily represent the views of the council or its secretariat.<\/p> <p>  The climate crisis has gained unprecedented prominence in Irish politics, media and society in recent months.  This is not before time but better late than never.  Stark warnings last October from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, highlighted the risks involved if we fail to limit global heating to 1.5&deg;C.  These risks include more extreme droughts and floods, as well as severe impacts on ecosystems and human communities.  The IPCC report was equally unequivocal in highlighting that we are on a dangerous pathway.  The world has already warmed by approximately 1&deg;C and we are currently headed for 3&deg;C of heating.  To have a chance of limiting heating to 1.5&deg;C, we need a radical change of direction that will bring us to zero net greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century.<\/p> <p>  Young people took to the streets across the country in their thousands in March and again last month to put pressure on politicians to tackle the climate crisis which poses a grave threat to their future.  The results of the recent European and local elections illustrated that climate change has indeed moved to the centre of politics.  Momentum for necessary climate action is growing.  However, emissions projections from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, show that Ireland will, in a best-case scenario, achieve a 0.4% reduction in emissions in the sectors of the economy outside the EU Emissions Trading Scheme by 2020.  This compares to a 20% decarbonisation target.  Nobody claims that Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a climate safe future will be cheap or easy.  If it were, we would have done it long ago.  What is beyond doubt, however, is that it is necessary and achievable.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has struggled to decarbonise transport.  Emissions from this sector fell during the recession but have grown significantly since and remain responsible for approximately 20% of our national emissions.  The NESC commissioned Dr. Devaney and I to undertake a study of how governance structures enable or constrain low-carbon transition in Irish transport.  It is important to note that, in focusing on governance structures, our report does not go into detail on what the appropriate balance is between different specific modes of transport or what policy instruments are best placed to spur low-carbon transition.<\/p> <p>  Governance institutions are key enabling factors for decarbonisation across economy and society.  The international literature on governance of low-carbon transition points to the importance of bottom-up innovation and experimentation, as well as top-down direction from central government.  Drawing on desk-based research and interviews with key stakeholders, we show how a low-carbon transition in Irish transport could be better facilitated by modifications to governance institutions and the broader policy system.<\/p> <p>  There are three dimensions to our diagnosis of the challenges facing the transport sector in transitioning to a low-carbon future.  First, the Irish transport sector is inherently complex.  There are tensions between public and private actors in charge of different transport options, rural and urban divides, as well as special interests playing a strong role.  Delivering transport also interacts in complex ways with broader policy systems, including where we locate our housing, schools, hospitals and other facilities.  Second, low-carbon transition is not yet a priority in transport.  Contestation between different players has shaped the development of a carbon-intensive transport system to date.  There is also disagreement over what low-carbon transition might entail across different elements of the transport sector such as between passenger and freight transport.  Third, our system of transport decision-making is deeply fragmented.  Authority is spread among multiple institutions whose mandates often have not kept pace with the urgency of the climate crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Diarmuid Torney"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":812,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Torney.

These recommendations were developed in advance of the Government&rsquo;s publication of its climate action plan on Monday.<\/p> <p>  Building on the diagnosis of the transport sector, as outlined by Dr. Torney, our research identifies recommendations and poses questions for stakeholders who wish to strengthen low-carbon transition in Irish transport.  These align with our three key research themes.<\/p> <p>  First, acknowledging complexities in the transport sector, transport governance should be built on the following principles.  We need to adopt a collaborative, adaptive and reflexive approach to policy making.  This requires input from a diverse range of public, private and civil society actors whose voices are not sufficiently heard.  Stakeholder engagement is essential to enhance transparency, legitimacy and trust in decision-making, along with generating better outcomes.  We should support bottom-up approaches to low-carbon transport.  This approach takes into account geographical and technical variations, as well as the rural-urban divide which results in different transport solutions and investment required in different areas.<\/p> <p>  We need to understand transport as a social practice to promote positive behaviour change.  This means that we must consider the socio-cultural, technical and governance forces that shape our mobility choices.  Designing and implementing appropriate combinations of these interventions will ensure we have the right incentives, options and new social norms to make low-carbon transport easy to choose.<\/p> <p>  Second, challenging institutional priorities that to date have not included a strong focus on low-carbon transition, we propose several recommendations.  Transport policy-making should be aligned with international sustainable mobility thinking that promotes an avoid, shift, improve, ASI, framework for both passenger and freight transport.  For the systemic change required, this would more clearly emphasise a hierarchy which focuses on reducing journeys in the first place through better land-use planning, for example.  It also aims to achieve modal shift, for instance, to public transport, walking and cycling in passenger transport, as well as rail and alternative last-mile delivery options in freight.  Finally, the ASI framework focuses on improving vehicle efficiencies, for example, through using alternative fuels, electrification or enhancing engine efficiencies.<\/p> <p>  The Government needs to provide low-carbon direction.  This will signal a new pathway to investors, consumers and citizens.  This includes leadership from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport but should also be underpinned by a whole-of-government approach to climate action.  The mandates of transport governance actors should be revised to include a statutory commitment to prioritise low-carbon development.  More detailed carbon accounting, along with a heavier weight assigned to this, could feature in project appraisals to inform decisions about transport investments.<\/p> <p>  The public sector should lead by example.  This could include not just central government but also, for example, local authorities switching fleets to electrified alternatives.  The Civil Service should give greater priority to low-carbon transition in its hiring, promotion and travel schemes.<\/p> <p>  Changing who shapes transport outcomes, our research identifies a variety of institutional remedies which can help to advance the low carbon transition.<\/p><p>Focused taskforces could combine insights from public, private, academic and civil society actors around specific transport challenges.  This could build upon the success of the low emissions vehicle taskforce that provided a structured forum and brought together key actors to unblock policy action for electric vehicle incentivisation.  Multimodal transport hubs that connect transport options hold promise for decarbonising Irish passenger transport, along with enhanced redistribution hubs to decarbonise freight.  Public private partnerships may help to progress such low carbon hubs, combining funding and expertise for change.  Forums for peer learning can help villages, towns and cities across Ireland to learn from each other and to scale up innovative low carbon transport solutions.  A variety of settlement sizes could learn from one another&rsquo;s experimental approaches, while recognising important differences across the transport landscape.  Deliberative forums for stakeholder and citizen participation could enhance transparency and moderate the impact of lobbying by special interests.  Public information offices could be established, along with structured citizen assemblies for deliberation and engagement.  Research infrastructure for transport policymaking that supports more diverse and inclusive transport research is needed, as well as channels of communication and absorptive capacity for more evidence-based policymaking.  This includes the potential for intermediary institutions and for enhanced knowledge exchange between academia and Government, as well as participatory backcasting approaches to create implementable transition frameworks.<\/p><p> None of these solutions by themselves are a silver bullet but, together, they can provide a governance framework that adequately addresses the climate crisis.  We need to tackle Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions head on.  The recent declaration of a climate emergency by the D&aacute;il made international headlines but it will be meaningless if not backed up by concrete action.  Transport would be a good place to start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr.  Laura Devaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":815,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their collective wisdom and knowledge and for providing the paper they published some weeks ago.  I asked them to attend when I saw that publication.  In parallel to their thinking, the Government has also issued a plan, and one of the key issues is how we dovetail both.  I like very much the principles that have been enunciated today.  It is up to the politicians, the parties and the public to put practical examples in place that will be successful and will actually work.<\/p> <p>  We move to questions and comments from members.  I call Deputy Troy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#H00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":816,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for giving their time today.  As was rightly said, in the past six months there has been a huge uptick in interest among the public and policymakers in terms of how we tackle climate change.  It is welcome and timely that the witnesses are here, given the Government published its climate action plan earlier this week.  As transport is the second-largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, it obviously has a key role to play in terms of how we tackle this.<\/p> <p>  There is huge emphasis in the Government plan on transferring people from fossil fuel cars to electric vehicles, and it seems to be one of its key points.  In 2010, there was a plan to have 200,000 electric vehicles by 2020 but that was revised downwards in 2014 to 50,000 vehicles and further revised downwards in 2018 to 20,000.  Therefore, despite setting our plans, we have failed abysmally in terms of achievement.<\/p> <p>  As somebody who piloted an electric vehicle for six weeks in the run-up to the local elections, I can see why people would not make the transition.  Our infrastructure is extremely poor, in particular the number of charge points.  I live in a village nine miles outside Mullingar and it has no charge point.  When I come to Mullingar, the provincial town of County Westmeath with a population of 15,000 people, there are six public charge points but no high-speed charge point.  If we are talking about enabling people to make the transition, we have a long way to go.  It is not so much a question of encouraging people because there is a willingness, but there is the practical question of whether people can actually do this.  After six weeks, I found myself asking whether I could survive with an electric vehicle and the answer at the moment, until the range improves, is \"No\".<\/p> <p>  One of the witnesses made the point that while it is welcome there are goals or targets, there are no timelines for implementation of these targets or any precise details.  Page 90 of the Government's climate action plan contains a measure that will \"Require new non-residential buildings with more than 10 parking spaces to have at least one recharging point installed by 1 January 2025\".  Therefore, there might be a car park with 200 spaces that has one charging point by 2025, which is just not ambitious enough.  From what the witnesses have said today, electric vehicles should nearly be the last piece of the jigsaw whereas the Government policy seems to make it the first piece of the jigsaw.<\/p> <p>  To follow on from what one of my colleagues said earlier, it would be great to make public transport free but, even if that was introduced in the morning, we have no extra capacity on very many routes.  Our ticketing system is not even integrated, never mind the system being integrated for users.  That is another issue.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Devaney raised a point on forums for peer learning.  Despite the obvious uptick - the results of the last local and European elections demonstrated there is further acknowledgement and awareness that this is a real issue - there is still huge scepticism on climate change and a huge reluctance as to how we are to make the transition so that it will not cost us.  The Government said this can be done in a nudge, nudge way but I do not think it can be.  Significant sacrifices will need to be made, which will cost money.<\/p> <p>  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views on the Government's climate action plan.  Perhaps I am being unduly hard on it, and coming from the Opposition benches, that may be natural.  I would be interested to hear their views.  I would also be interested to know if the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has had any engagement with the National Economic and Social Council in regard to its research, in particular how it can extract the NESC's key findings and implement them in Government policies.  Given we have failed to achieve all the targets we have set ourselves to date, how would the witnesses prioritise the changes that need to be made?  As an example, if any of them were Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport tomorrow morning, and had an opportunity to make three or four changes with immediate effect that, in their opinion, would give the greatest return in terms of reduction in carbon emissions, what would they be? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#H00300","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":817,"content":"<p>Those are very good questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#H00400","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":818,"content":"<p>I might start before passing to my colleagues.  On whether the Department has been involved in any way with the research, Ms Laura Behan from the Department was on the steering group for the research.  She was supportive and had good input into the work as it was done.  The work has just been published and we have not met Ms Behan since.  I acknowledge that because it was an important part of us commissioning the work.  It was a short piece of research and, therefore, I commend my colleagues on getting under the skin of the transport sector in the way they did.  We wanted to examine a process aspect in respect of institutional governance, which NESC is interested in, along with the specific technical issues that my colleagues will be able to address.<\/p> <p>  On the necessary shift in the system, the individual must be put at the centre of the policy and transport system.  If we are trying to create a system of sustainable mobility, not only do we need to think more about the technical changes to electric vehicles, EVs, as the Deputy mentioned, but also social aspects need to be at the heart of policy-making and planning.  That involves the digital transition as well as the wider issues of the opportunities that stem from a low-carbon transition.  That framing, namely, starting to put the individual at the centre, means that different questions must be asked.  Given that we have thought about how to persuade people not to use their cars, we must ask how we can make the infrastructure supportive of them cycling and walking.  The latter are risky activities in the city centre at present.  We need to think about putting the individual at the heart of the issue, and building out questions and supporting networks to understand how it might be developed.  My colleagues might wish to comment further on some aspects.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the climate action plan and the significant steps towards thinking about the governance arrangements therein, which we acknowledge in our report.  We noted that a climate action delivery board is important for delivering concrete actions.  As Dr. O'Connell stated, our report favours an Action-Plan-for-Jobs-plus type of approach.  As well as the kind of delivery mechanism outlined in the climate action plan, we must ask what kind of process is it necessary to generate, tailor and generalise solutions.  We must also ask what else can be done to try to get under some of the innovative, bottom-up practices that my colleagues have outlined, and how could they be fed into the process.  I welcome the signal that governance is being taken seriously.  My colleagues might comment on how to embed some of those solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jeanne Moore"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":819,"content":"<p>I almost wrote another full opening statement on my reaction to the climate action plan, although I will not bore the committee with it.  Echoing what Dr. Moore stated, I welcome the plan.  It is timely and necessary for the climate to receive such political attention.  Getting the top-down governance right has been an important part of the plan and is welcome in respect of the direction, the carbon budgets, the emphasis on just transition and citizen engagement, all of which are elements the authors got right.<\/p> <p>  On transport, I reiterate that mine is a personal reflection based on my experience from research of various forms of environmental governance and our research did not focus on the climate action plan.  I worry about the overemphasis on the \"I\" part of the avoid, shift, improve framework that we mention in our research.  The \"I\" is about improving efficiencies and, as the Deputy correctly noted, the overemphasis on EVs as being capable of solving everything.  There is a nod to other aspects, such as avoiding journeys by work-from-home models and more compact growth, and there is a bit on the shift to public transport and the establishment of a cycling office.  Unfortunately, however, the predominant focus is on EVs.  I do not agree with that from a progress or transformative perspective.  EVs are part of the solution, however, and they will be important in rural areas that do not public transport or where people cannot cycle to certain places.  In such sprawled settlements, they will have a low-carbon benefit, albeit only if the energy source is decarbonised.  If we move from a low-carbon framing to one for sustainable mobility, EVs have contradictions, such as not addressing issues of congestion or the costs, stress or health implications associated with that, not reducing accidents and not promoting active transport.  There are also social sustainability concerns, even in respect of the sourcing of materials for EVs, as we mention in our report.  There have been cases of increases in child labour, such as in Democratic Republic of the Congo, where cobalt is sourced for EV batteries due to increasing demand.  We must be careful, therefore, to understand the life-cycle analysis aspect of EVs.  That is my reflection on the wider focus of the transport chapter.<\/p> <p>  I have similar questions about the focus on compressed natural gas, CNG, given that it is a fossil fuel, even if it is the only option, such as for freight.  I would be worried about being locked into another fossil fuel in that regard.  Research done in Europe has shown that while there may be carbon savings from CNG, there is a potential for methane leakage, which is a much more potent greenhouse gas emission.  The emissions benefit, therefore, might not be what we expect.<\/p> <p>  Similar sourcing conflicts in the case of biofuels affect food and feed.  The sustainable production of the virgin material is essential.  If using used cooking oil or waste, we should ask whether it is being imported from abroad, what the emissions profile is and whether we are achieving the desired objectives of the plan.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by the neglect of aviation.  Obviously, it is part of a different regulatory scheme.  It can be part of the emissions trading scheme and there are other international regulations relating to it.  However, it is remiss to ignore aviation, particularly as there has been discussion about establishing and investing in Waterford Airport or, potentially, a third terminal for Dublin Airport.  There is no mention of the environmental impact of such decisions relating to infrastructure.  For more cohesive, transformative policy-making, we need to consider aviation with the climate action plan.  In a nutshell, there has been too much focus on technology, EVs or CNG solving everything, whereas there are not many tangible ideas for public transport, such as Deputy Coppinger's suggestion of free public transport.  There was a note on the sharing economy but there has been no progress in respect of, for example, developing sharing schemes for bicycles, electric scooters or cars, which would have a much more positive, sustainable impact on emissions and the necessary social aspect.<\/p> <p>  There is an over-reliance on tax to change behaviour.  From my experience of working in sustainable consumption fields, I know that we need to use tax as the motivation for behaviour change.  I refer to a social practice approach, as Dr. Moore referred to and our report outlines.  As the Deputy Coppinger noted, we should consider the charging network and incentives to buy EVs - both timely issues - but we must also examine the position regarding education and information awareness promotion.  There could be positive incentives if we moved away from punitive measures.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that it is just a plan and that the next step is to implement it and create policy.  Nevertheless, it is important to get the plan right in the first place.  There should be a greater focus on avoiding journeys in the first instance, while shifting to public transport options and alternatives to CNG for freight are essential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Devaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":820,"content":"<p>I reiterate my final question.

My response to the Deputy's final question builds on what Dr. Devaney said about the overemphasis in the transport chapter on technological improvement.  As our report shows, we need to recognise that transport systems vary and there are different challenges in different parts of the country.  There is a place for EV roll-out but one of the main constraints in that regard is the charging infrastructure.  The costs are decreasing significantly.<\/p><p>The action plan makes reference to the fact that Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which has crunched the numbers on this, projects that by 2022 electric vehicles for private transport will be cheaper on a total cost of ownership basis than internal combustion engines.  That means that just three years from now, the combined purchase cost and running cost of electric vehicles over their lifetimes will be cheaper.  They will become the obvious choice but not if the charging infrastructure is not in place.  That is one thing we really need to focus on and prioritise.<\/p><p> To pick up on Dr. Devaney's emphasis on the avoid, shift, improve approach, we need to prioritise public transport to an extent that is not reflected strongly enough in the climate action plan.  I refer to more funding for public transport, cycling and walking infrastructure.  When we were waiting to come in this morning we remarked on the importance of things as simple as traffic light sequences.  Cyclists and pedestrians seem to be an afterthought in the way that we design our public spaces and allocate space to different modes of transport.  I would place a priority on that.

Thought must be put into urban design.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the forum for peer learning, there is considerable motivation to change.  People recognise how serious the situation is with regard to climate action.  Peer-to-peer learning is important.  I am very struck by the example of the sustainable energy communities.  Communities themselves come up with energy solutions and renewable energy planning.  They then talk to other communities about how they did it and the lessons learned.  Something similar could apply to local transport based solutions that would engage public participatory networks at a local level.  The national dialogue on climate action has a lot of infrastructure at community level which could help people to arrive at bottom-up solutions.  The policy system could learn from these and then roll out the approaches that work.

There are much stricter conditions in place now.  We are talking about cities and it is great to see so many cyclists in Dublin.  I live in a rural area.  Carrick-on-Shannon is a central town for north County Roscommon and south County Leitrim.  It would only take 45 or 50 minutes to cycle from Boyle to Carrick-on-Shannon or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Much more can be done, as is shown by the model of Germany, Belgium or the Netherlands.  People could be able to cycle between little villages.  Many things are happening but the infrastructure is still not in place.<\/p><p>Dr. Moore's suggestion of allowing towns and villages to come up with ideas for helping the environment would be a great incentive.  Perhaps those villages and towns could save money or learn from one another.  We are on the cusp of something great.  As I have said, I have seen the approach taken by most local authorities.  They use the funding for cycle routes to build their own infrastructure, which is wrong.  There is a much better way.  <\/p><p>We all want to use public transport.  There is a squeezed middle out there.  I do not have free transport.  Living in Dublin I can get a Leap card and take the bus, which is great and good value.  However, we do not use the trains or buses as often as we might.  Let us suppose there was an incentive.  Let us say &euro;5 was charged for every train journey.  What would that cost the taxpayer?  Would it cost billions or millions?  Is that incentive provided in any other country?  The train service is not as bad in Ireland as in the UK.  Is there any incentive that could motivate people in the middle ground who do not have annual tickets to get off the roads?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#K00300","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":825,"content":"<p>I will come back on that question and also refer to Deputy Coppinger's proposal for free public transport.  The recent Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, conference was attended by the mayor of Vienna.  Vienna did not quite introduce free transport.  Rather, the authorities introduced a pass, costing about &euro;300 for a year, covering all of a holder's public transport needs.  Senator Feighan asked about costs.  It would have to be analysed but the Viennese approach almost paid for itself.  A big subvention was provided by the authorities but the uptake was huge.  It was quite interesting to see what happened when an entry point was provided.<\/p> <p>  The essential issue and the view of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, is that many issues around decarbonising transport will be complex.  We need to get into the detail of how projects work.  I am very interested in public transport.  As was discussed earlier, part of the question is whether there are international examples.  That will get us so far but the specific details will then become complex.  The minute free public transport is offered, we will need much more of it.  We will need more bus lanes.  Then we will encounter the complexities of communities and how they will react.  All sorts of risks will arise.  Ticketing was mentioned.  All of that has to be resolved.  Safety issues arise when many more people are taking public transport or walking in cities.  This is not an argument not to do it.  This question goes beyond transport in a sense.  As has been said, it will create costs for the Exchequer and raise issues around planning and community engagement.  The NESC view is that if we are serious about climate, those are exactly the types of projects the Government must take on and analyse seriously.  This project would be of interest to NESC.  We need to get involved in initiatives with that degree of complexity and ambition.<\/p> <p>  As Dr. Moore noted, that project also depends on community engagement and a process of collaboration.  We recently came across a project in Inchicore where the residents are proposing a contraflow system.  That might allow public transport to operate by having lanes move in different directions at different times.  That is what we want; somebody in the community coming forward with the solution.  We must ask what type of process we need to create in local communities to get solutions on the table early.  When NESC talks about the projects being complex we are not discouraging them.  The question is how to delve into them.  I am very interested in the suggestion of a session of one or two days discussing public transport.  That is something in which NESC would be interested. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Larry O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":826,"content":"<p>I am glad to hear the witnesses are open to the idea of free public transport.  I realise that there is a limit to what academics and NGOs can argue for.  What the witnesses are arguing for is relatively conservative compared with what other cities have done around free public transport.  I am glad the witnesses are open to the idea.  The crisis we have is not an ordinary one.<\/p><p>I am sure everyone knows the now Greta Thunberg's legendary quote that we ought to act like our house is on fire.  What the Government has put out has pushed them a little further than they would have gone a year or two ago.  We can thank the young people who took to the streets and the fright many people received during the elections.  However, we need not just radical changes but also revolutionary ones globally to tackle climate change if we are talking about a window of ten to 12 years.  Governments are still standing with their arms folded.  My ideological view is that as long as the economy and the transport sector are in private hands, it will be extremely difficult to make the changes that are necessary.  <br\/><br\/>It is good that we will have a session on transport.  There was a special conference early last year on free public transport when the figure was about 100 cities.  It has increased and now includes Luxembourg.  Initially, it was treated as if the idea was absurd and it was said there would have to be huge investment.  The Taoiseach said we did not have the capacity.  He was asked about it yesterday by <i>The Journal<\/i>, as was the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, who pooh-poohed the idea even more because he was so committed to private transport.  The Taoiseach and I represent the same constituency.  He has noted that he comes from the commuter belt and that he would be very worried about the impact if we had it straightaway, but nobody is saying we should do it straightaway.  Most countries do it one year after it is announced.  The bus fleet could be increased straightaway, or quickly.  It would also be necessary to examine light rail systems.  I will carry out some research in that regard.  In this country they are not built quickly, but I have seen reports that they have been built in two years elsewhere.  If it is really considered to be an emergency, that is what must happen.<br\/><br\/>Some of the benefits of investing in public transport include reduced numbers of road traffic accidents in all of the cities in question, cleaner air, less noise, faster emergency response times which also save money and the abolition of ticket infrastructure.  People may recall the time when there were toll booths on the M50.  I went through them daily and it added about 30 minutes to journey times.  There is a saving to be made on infrastructure.  There is the use of the free travel pass at limited times, but in these cases more people started to use public transport, which enhanced commerce in cities and businesses started to make more money.  People in parts of Clonee or Mulhudart are marooned and isolated because they cannot get into the city.  When I was teaching in west Tallaght I recall bringing some of the pupils into the city centre which was like a different universe for some of them because they did not spend much time there.  For so long there has been neoliberal concept that everything must be paid for, but in the past many countries had free public transport, which is probably why countries such as Poland have so many cities where it is provided.  It has been introduced in many cities in China.  In Tallinn in Estonia passenger numbers increased eightfold very quickly when free public transport was introduced.  There was also a tourism boom as more people visited the city.  Yes, there would be an initial investment which would require progressive taxation of wealth to pay for free public transport.  It cannot come only from ordinary workers and the working class all the time, which is the Government's default position.  It must come from huge increases in taxation.  As Dublin is now the slowest moving city in Europe, we must examine this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#K00500","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":828,"content":"<p>We agree.

We are very interested in that work.  One of the big challenges is how does one identify who is the most vulnerable and impacted on by the transition.  Transport is one area that arises for consideration in that context.  When one models it, the high-level transport sector emerges in the ESRI's analysis.  For information, one piece of work we propose to do is qualitative research in the transport sector to identify some of the workers who would be most vulnerable in the low carbon transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Larry O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":829,"content":"<p>Does this refer to farmers or people who drive freight vehicles?

Is that not the reality?  That is where we must get to.  I have no issue with these policies, but the problem is that when one tries to put renewable energy infrastructure in place in a rural community, there is absolute war.  Thousands of people object and there is hassle over it.  Therefore, a huge message must be sold.  It must be seen that there is a real economic benefit to the communities in which the infrastructure is placed.

It is also a justice issue.  It is about not only procedural justice - it must be a fair and transparent system - but also distributive justice in the sense that people need to get something back.  It is a broader issue in the decarbonisation of the economy that it is not merely about taking out emissions but also about creating a new social vision of the kind of society in which we want to live.  There is a social aspect to it.  That is why when we consider renewable energy projects, we cannot forget that people must be brought along and that there must be community engagement.  I do not think we would make that mistake now, knowing as much as we do.

First, picking up on this discussion, this is one of the weaknesses or lost opportunities in the climate action plan.  The strength, picking up on what Dr. Moore stated earlier, is the Government's structure.  It is good at putting in place a robust reporting and accountability framework.  The plan is to be updated annually, and reported on quarterly.  There is an implementation board in the Department of the Taoiseach, and a beefed-up climate action council.  All of those are good in terms of the top-down piece but there is a missed opportunity in the report is in respect of the bottom-up infrastructure, and in other ways as well.  The Oireachtas committee report has a chapter on communications and education but that is almost a footnote in the climate action plan.  In various ways, the climate action plan replicates our traditional approaches to policymaking in Ireland, which is a shame.  However, it is a good start, and something to build on.<\/p> <p>   Second, I refer back to Deputy Coppinger's question, where we began, on free public transport.  It is a promising idea, either completely free or not completely free but certainly much cheaper than public transport is here in Ireland.  As Dr. O'Connell said, I was at the EPA conference as well where the mayor of Vienna talked about a cost of &euro;1 a day.   That is worth considering.  I am glad that the committee will discuss that in the future.<\/p> <p>  I would raise one note of caution, which picks up the point about justice and the urban-rural dimension to this.  Often, in climate policy debates, we hear complaints from rural communities saying it is all very well for us up in Dublin to raise the carbon tax because we have the choice of cycling, walking or taking public transport.  My fear with the proposal for free public transport is that it benefits certain parts of the country much more clearly than it benefits others.  That is not an argument for not doing it but it is an argument for taking seriously these questions around justice and how we manage those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Diarmuid Torney"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":836,"content":"<p>Free public transport should be free everywhere.

There was consideration of where people lived and scenario testing, and we examined the worst-case scenario where we were to have higher densities in the city centre and linkages with public transport, and the investment was to be aligned with best case scenario.  Of course, that is not what happened and we are not trying to retrofit some of the mistakes of not designing things in the way that it was hoped.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, I am only looking at one location.  The witnesses are considering places such are Galway, that is choked with traffic, and what is being suggested as the solution.  They are considering Cork and Limerick because there is a dispersed population pattern in the more rural areas.  That is more difficult to deal with from a public transport perspective.<\/p> <p>  I am looking at the plans that have been provided and I want them to work.  We not only want them to work but need them to work.  I know the next generation.  I know their names.  I can see them.  Some of them are my grandchildren.  I am aware of the kind of fallout that they will have to pick up if we do not do our job today.<\/p> <p>  However, I have a significant sinking feeling about the Government's climate plan because I am looking at exactly what is being proposed from a transport perspective.  There is no proposal to review the national development plan.  A climate emergency was declared.  We do not dispute the science but there has not been a shift towards funding public transport over and above the roads projects, which are more heavily funded in the plan than public transport.<\/p> <p>  I have been going on about DART underground or the interconnector for 20 years.  I do not see how one can solve Dublin's transport problems without delivering on major projects such as DART underground, which was part of the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  European funding was delivered in different ways but there was a shift in the early 1990s towards having to make an argument as to why funding should be given.  It is interesting that the argument made to seek European funding was that Dublin, including the outer counties because there is a focus towards the city, had become uncompetitive because of traffic congestion.  We are now, as Deputy Coppinger pointed out, one of the slowest cities in Europe.<\/p> <p>  I am struggling to see the coherence in the Government's plan from a transport perspective.  If it is predominantly about building roads and shifting people from diesel and petrol cars into electric cars or hybrid cars, the State must produce the electricity to start with.  A programme was broadcast in recent weeks on Moneypoint where capacity and making that shift are major issues.  However, there is also a vision.  We will still have traffic jams unless public transport is put in place, but they will be cleaner traffic jams.  That is my feeling on how this will play out.  Unless there is investment in large public transport projects, we will not make the sizeable shift needed.  Until we address the issue of where people will live and where they work, we will be constantly trying to retrofit.<\/p> <p>  I would like this Government plan interrogated.  It is almost like hearing that the Opposition will always be critical.<\/p><p>There is good reason to be critical of this plan.  I want to see that criticism coming from non-political sources, and as heavily critical as it needs to be, because we have to make it work.  I do not see in this plan how we are going to achieve that shift, unless we take the dramatic step of putting our money where our mouth is.  Putting our money where our mouth is means putting money into public transport.  I do not see any other way of doing it.  There is a limit in terms of what can be achieved with electric vehicles, but there is no escaping the big step that is needed to get the attention necessary, which for me is the shift in how we fund public transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#M01000","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":843,"content":"<p>The committee can invite in the Minister to interrogate the 2040 plan.

One of the aspects of the climate action plan that I think is very welcome is the chapter on the public sector leading by example.

There is a risk that that would turn into a green washing exercise.  Public sector bodies - I have none in particular in mind - could see this as box ticking exercise.  The way to counter this is parliamentary scrutiny.  The climate action committee is to be set up as a standing committee under the climate action plan.  Parliamentary accountability would be strengthened if other Oireachtas committees were to do likewise.  In other words, transport bodies would not only have to account to the climate action committee on the low carbon mandate but to the transport committee also.

Dr. Tara Shine referred to us as collaborative humans.  Let us stop talking about detached stakeholders.  We advocate a governance approach that would include these sectors in the decision making and in the solutions.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Catherine Murphy's point regarding the funding of large projects and essential public transport investment, the parliamentary process in holding public sector bodies accountable could also seek to move us beyond short-term planning so that these one-off projects such as BusConnects or MetroLink are connected in the transport landscape rather than considered in isolation.  What emerged in our research from within the sector was that planning in transport was planning on the hoof.  We developed the Luas on two separate lines.  Why was that not connected?  The Luas will be rejigged again in order to facilitate the metro.  There is need for something that takes us beyond the short-term political cycles and this longer-term vision, which is part of the transformative change that Deputy Coppinger referred to that needs to be embedded in the system for sustained climate action and that it is a long-term focus for these big projects and that it is not just in isolation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#N01800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Devaney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560898800,"counter":860,"content":"<p>On that point, colleagues of ours who would be very cross if we did not mention them are working on transport-oriented development and are keen to present to the committee on the issue of linking land-use planning in these projects and transport.

We were the poster children for the touchy-feely bottom-up civil engagement NGO contributory approach being advocated by the witnesses.  It was brilliant because it educated us and we, in turn, educated the system.  It led to better debate and analysis and it really worked.  I agree 100% with the touchy-feely bottom-up engagement approach being advocated.<\/p> <p>  I was slightly disheartened by an approach previously taken.  In the late 1990s, we wrote and were involved in a very good platform for change plan.  It was very well done with good modelling, people and our best engineers.  I will always remember a presentation given to us as the advisory committee in the closing stages of that process.  I do not know whether Deputy Murphy remembers it.  Those presenting told us that, whatever we did, we should build the metro and the DART interconnector first, rather than widening the M50 or investing in roads.  They stated that was what we must do.  The committee decided that it would do so.  I kept telling my wife that Dublin was about to change and it was going to be a cycling city.  We went to Utrecht for weeks and came back with the required information.  Utrecht had been pursuing that approach for 25 years and knew what to do.  What did we do in Ireland?  We widened the M50 and put off the metro.  We have done nothing on cycling or buses for the past 15 or 20 years.<\/p> <p>  I did not give up.  I kept going, got into government and wrote a sustainable transport plan.  I thought we should make the Dublin Transportation Office model bigger and do it all over the country and set up the National Transport Authority, NTA.  What happened?  My party went out of government and the sustainable transport plan was thrown away.  Nothing has happened in respect of the models for what we needed to do over the past eight years.  The NTA was taken over by the National Roads Authority.  We have had a roads-based transport system for the past ten years under that structure.<\/p> <p>  I still did not give up hope.  The recent national planning framework says the same thing we have been saying for 30 years: that we must go back into the centre and the core.  I thought there may still be hope.  I still said to my wife when I got home at night that the situation was about to change and that we were going to move to sustainable transport.  What happened?  The national development plan abandoned sustainable transport.  It is all about roads, as is ever the case.  It states that 50% of new housing will be built outside existing urban areas.  How does one square that with the national planning framework?  This is being run by IBEC.  We have a big industrial base that knows how to make money out of roads.  Even if the roads do not make transport sense, they make economic sense because people are good at making money out of making roads.  I am sorry if that is a cynical attitude, but I am releasing 30 years of frustration.<\/p> <p>  Politics, which trumps everything, is part of the problem.  One may have all the bottom-up touchy-feely approach but it is top-down politics that counts.  According to the NTA household travel survey, some 75% of journeys - 80% nationwide - are by car, while public transport accounts for 5% of trips.  Politicians are not stupid.  Advertising agencies spend millions promising people that if we get another little bit of road, we will finally be free.  Politicians represent the 80% who travel by car and are very sensitive to their wishes, so we steer based on that false promise.<\/p> <p>  Another reason that we have not moved to a sustainable transport system is that doing so is difficult.  The bottom-up touchy-feely approach is needed because this involves reallocating space and it is difficult to do so when 75% of journeys are by car and one wants to reduce that rate.  This is about parking, trucks and winning back space for children, cyclists, elderly persons, blind persons or anyone else who is not involved in the big industrial roads-based system which aims to keep making money out of cars and, as such does not count.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Devaney is correct in her point on framing.  I saw Deputy Michael Healy-Rae with his flat cap on television last night.  I have great time for him, but he was saying that he is not sure about the proposals for sustainability and asking what about the poor people and farmers.  It is the same old framing.  What about the 200,000 people who commute for more than two hours a day, which is injurious to their health?  Some 80,000 of them have young children.  What about the children who do not see their parents?  What about the 80% of Irish children who do not get the recommended level of daily exercise because of the system we have created?  Will that ever be taken into account on a prime time show or in the framing of this debate?  It will not.<\/p> <p>  My hopes were raised by the climate action plan because it seemed that there was some urgency about it.  Officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport appeared before the committee, but their performance was excruciatingly poor.  They did not know what was their ambition for 2030.  Representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland appeared before the committee and were asked - I will never forget it - for their solution to gridlock in Dublin.  The solution they published is to widen the N7 between Naas and Newbridge as well as the N6, the N3, the N2 and the N11.  That was their answer to the question of how to improve transport in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  There is some brilliant stuff in the climate action plan around governance and the action plans approach to beginning to work on this area.  Everything it contains in that respect is right.  However, the section delaying with transport is an utter disgrace.  Deputy Murphy is right that we need other people to start saying that.  I challenge anyone to point out where I am wrong.  The reliance on a McKinsey marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, is so early 2000s in terms of climate change policy that it is embarrassing.  The promise of a cycling office is so 1990s.  We have heard that promise so often that I am tired of it.  The promise of a scrappage scheme that has not even been worked out sounds like it comes from Society of the Irish Motor Industry.  It is ill thought-out and inappropriate.  The doubling of the number of electric vehicles on the back of a McKinsey MACC curve is not good enough, given that we spent two years at this.  The Department should be ashamed if that is the best it can come up with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#O00500","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":864,"content":"<p>I do not wish to interrupt the Deputy's flow of thought, but we would welcome his presence at our meetings to make those points.

I want to pick up on, not the detail but the broad thrust of his intervention.  Our report is very strong on the need for not just bottom-up governance but also top-down direction from central government.  As a result of the fact that such bottom-up collaborative governance is lacking in many cases, we have been drawn to that in our discussion.  However, our report indicates that we see both as crucial parts of the governance jigsaw, both the bottom-up experimentation, learning and collaborative governance, and also the top-down direction from central government.  The Deputy is right to point that out.  Our report endorses that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019061900002#P02100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Diarmuid Torney"},{"type":"speech","time":1560898800,"counter":897,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their contributions.
