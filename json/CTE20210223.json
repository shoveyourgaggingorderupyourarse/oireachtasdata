Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, Members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the convention centre.  I ask that committee members confirm their locations before contributing to ensure they are adhering to this requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin our public engagement, we considered the minutes of our meetings of 4 and 9 February at our private meeting last week.  Standing Order 107(3) requires that the minutes are agreed in public session.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Today we are engaging with officials from Horse Racing Ireland to examine matters relating to its 2019 financial statement.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials: Mr. Brian Kavanagh, chief executive, and Ms Suzanne Eade, chief financial officer.  I welcome them to the meeting and thank them and their staff for the briefing material they have prepared for us.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask that members and witnesses mute themselves when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  I also ask that they use the button to raise their hands to indicate when they wish to contribute and, as usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  When people have finished contributing, they should not forget to use the button to lower their hands.  It can be confusing otherwise.<\/p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Our witnesses have already been advised of this and they may have viewed it as appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask the witnesses to state their names the first time they contribute.<\/p> <p>  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614074400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, was established to provide a statutory basis for the control, regulation and development of the horse racing industry in Ireland.  It operates racing and betting activities through eight subsidiaries.  In addition, it has a one third shareholding in an associated company called Curragh Racecourse Limited, CRL.<\/p> <p>  HRI received State funding of &euro;67.2 million in 2019, sourced from the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  HRI's other main sources of income in the year were contributions from horse owners and sponsors towards racing prize money, totalling &euro;23.4 million; sales of media rights to the value of &euro;6.8 million; registration fee income of &euro;2.6 million; industry contributions to Irish Thoroughbred Marketing of &euro;443,000; and net income of &euro;294,000 from racing activities arising from totaliser betting and HRI-owned racecourses.  On the expenditure side in 2019, HRI paid out &euro;67.6 million in prize money.  Expenditure of &euro;12.6 million was incurred on integrity and racecourse services, mainly comprising grants to the Irish Horse Racing Regulatory Board.  Overall, the HRI group incurred a deficit of just over &euro;1 million for 2019.<\/p> <p>  The 2019 financial statements received a clear audit opinion.  However, without qualifying that opinion, my report drew attention to two matters related to HRI's activity in the year.  First, I drew attention to the fact that the statement of income and expenditure disclosed a group loss of &euro;2.064 million in 2019 relating to HRI's investment in CRL.  This is a company established to provide for the redevelopment and management of the Curragh racecourse.  The redevelopment involved the construction of a new stand and other racing facilities, which opened in mid-2019.  Ownership of the company is split between HRI, the Turf Club and private investors.  Notes Nos. 37 and 39 of the group financial statements explain that HRI had contributed funding to CRL totalling &euro;36 million up to the end of 2019.  This comprised an investment of &euro;23 million in return for an equity share, grant funding of &euro;12.5 million for the construction project, and &euro;500,000 paid for the right to use a hospitality suite at the racecourse for 30 years.  In addition, the group financial statements reflect a loan of &euro;500,000 given by HRI to CRL during 2019 to fund additional works on the racecourse's parade ring.  As at 31 December 2019, HRI held a 35.29% economic share in CRL.  The carrying value of HRI's investment at 31 December 2019 was &euro;18.5 million, indicating cumulative losses incurred by HRI amounting to &euro;4.5 million.<\/p> <p>  Second, I drew attention to the disclosure in the statement on internal control for 2019 of a financial loss by HRI of &euro;389,000 in respect of cash-in-transit services.  The service provider went into liquidation while holding cash relating to HRI's racecourses and its Tote Ireland subsidiary.<\/p> <p>  The chief executive will be able to update the committee on these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1614074400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Kavanagh to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#A00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614074400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to assist with its examination of the 2019 financial statements of HRI.  As members will be aware, HRI is a commercial semiState body responsible to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  HRI is responsible for the overall administration, governance, development and promotion of the Irish horse racing industry and operates a corporate structure that comprises the main body and nine subsidiary companies, one of which is dormant.  Its functions are set out in legislation.<\/p> <p>  As the Comptroller and Auditor General set out, HRI's primary sources of funding are the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, race entry fees from owners, race sponsorship fees through racecourses, profits from commercial subsidiaries, a statutory foal levy on breeders, the sale of media rights, industry contributions to Irish Thoroughbred Marketing and a turnover levy on oncourse bookmakers.<\/p><p> We are based in Ballymany, the Curragh, County Kildare, and including our subsidiary companies, we employ a total of 247 people.  Since the establishment of the Racing Board in 1945, the horse racing and thoroughbred industry in Ireland has been overseen by a State body and has been the subject of legislation.  The reason for this is the unique position which the sector holds in Ireland.  Horses are something which Ireland does well, and for a small country we hold leadership positions in many elements of the industry which makes a valuable contribution to the social, economic and cultural fabric of the country.  This was well summed up recently by An tUachtar&aacute;n, Michael D. Higgins, when he said the horse has a special place in Irish life and culture and, \"A love of horses, their breeding and training, are an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s identity and of our reputation abroad.\"<\/p><p> Supportive Government policy over the years has enabled a significant rural industry to develop, and in 2017, Deloitte issued a comprehensive report on the value of the industry which made a number of important findings. The key findings were that the industry stimulates almost &euro;2 billion of expenditure per annum in the Irish economy.  This expenditure supports a workforce of 28,900 full-time equivalent jobs.  After the United States, Ireland is the second biggest seller of bloodstock at public sales.  In a normal year, 1.3 million people attend race meetings in Ireland.  Bloodstock sales are valued at approximately &euro;438 million per annum, much of which is exported.<\/p><p> The industry operates on an all-island basis, and every four years, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine appoints a representative of the industry in Northern Ireland to the board of Horse Racing Ireland.  The board comprises a chairman and 13 ordinary board members who are a mixture of industry representatives and ministerial nominees.<\/p><p> The industry is multi-layered and comprises much more than just a day at the races.  Despite our small size, Ireland is the third largest producer of thoroughbreds in the world, the second largest exporter of horses to more than 33 countries in terms of value, and arguably the leading country in terms of quality.  In terms of size and scale, the thoroughbred industry is a significant one with a wide geographical reach.  There are breeders in every county in Ireland and most of them, 92%, have five mares or fewer.<\/p><p> In terms of economic value and the value of exports through sales, the industry compares very favourably with other vital agrifood sectors such as fishing, poultry, pigs and sheep.  One feature of the industry is its regional reach, and the Deloitte report pointed to significant economic activity and investment reaching into every county in the country.  A previous industry analysis took the case of Bagenalstown in County Carlow and found that within a ten-mile radius of that town, more than 600 full-time jobs were accounted for through the horse racing and breeding industries and ancillary services.  That picture is replicated in many other parts of the country.<\/p><p> The year 2019 was the last normal year experienced by most businesses.  Ms Eade and I will be happy to deal with any questions the committee may have on our 2019 financial statements.  Since then, much has changed and the industry is currently facing two massive challenges in Covid-19 and Brexit, both of which are having a significant impact.  Covid-19 saw horse racing cancelled for 11 weeks last year and since the resumption on 8 June, racing has been run behind closed doors, under strict protocols, with only essential staff in attendance.  Point-to-point racing is currently cancelled, which is a major problem for the national hunt sector and those whose livelihoods depend on it.  Irish bloodstock sales, at which most of our international trade takes place, were heavily disrupted in 2020 with key sales either cancelled, deferred, or in some cases, moved to England.  The industry is extremely grateful to be able to continue racing and is cognisant of the bigger picture.  However, like many other sectors, the impact of Covid-19 will be felt for a long time.<\/p><p> As I said earlier, Ireland is one of the largest exporters of thoroughbreds in the world and Britain is our main market, which has meant that significant changes and readjustments are occurring as a result of Brexit.  Over the past two years, together with various industry bodies and Government authorities, we have been working through the implications on the movement of horses between Ireland and Britain in the following areas: sanitary and phytosanitary applications, customs and VAT.  Undoubtedly, the situation is more difficult since 1 January.  Much work remains to mitigate the barriers to trade and prevent the industry in Ireland being marginalised as a result of geographical location.<\/p><p> Horse Racing Ireland has ambitious plans for the racing and breeding industry, and in March 2020 we published a strategic plan for the years 2020 to 2024, which sets challenging growth targets.  While the industry is facing up to serious challenges, if properly supported it will play an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic future.  It is a valuable source of employment and investment into rural Ireland, an area in which Ireland has natural advantages of climate and soil structure.  It is one that capitalises on our native skills and has a global reach which enhances Ireland&rsquo;s reputation internationally.  Moreover, it is an environmentally friendly agricultural activity.  The key elements of the strategic plan are increased participation at all levels of the industry thereby increasing employment and economic activity, investment in areas that are critical to the development of the industry, raising the profile and attractiveness of horse racing to all its customers, world-leading standards of integrity and equine welfare, development of people within the industry to support sustainable employment, and securing a sustainable funding model for the future.<\/p><p> The key capital projects under this plan will be the redevelopment of the Irish Equine Centre in Johnstown, County Kildare, and the development of a new all-weather racetrack in Tipperary.  The plan signals ambition to grow the direct and indirect employment in our industry to 35,000 people and the economic activity to &euro;2.5 billion per annum.<\/p><p> The 2019 financial statements are before the committee.  That was a good year for Irish horse racing and breeding, with increases in most of the key industry metrics and continued success for Irish horses on the racetracks of the world.  The year 2019 saw the completion of the long-awaited redevelopment of the Curragh racecourse and the introduction of new broadcasting arrangements for Irish racing.  It was also the year in which the threats to the industry from Brexit began to crystalise.<\/p><p> As requested, we have provided the committee with briefing material on three specific issues.  As I said earlier, Ms Eade and I will be happy to address any questions members may have on those matters or any other aspect of our finances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614074400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kavanagh for his opening statement.

I am sure many people will be impressed to hear about some of the financial benefits from the sector in terms of how it permeates to local communities, which is what I want to focus on this morning.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kavanagh mentioned that 92% of breeders are operations of five mares or fewer, and they are the small operators many of us will be aware of within our own communities.

As the Deputy said, the industry has a strong rural and regional reach and the small breeders, trainers and owners are the backbone of the industry.  Sometimes, the headlines go to the bigger owners.  When one analyses the industry, however, the picture shows a nationwide distribution of activities, full-time, part-time etc.  We put in place programmes to support all levels of the industry.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy mentioned, 92% of breeders have fewer than five mares.  Some 90% of our races are non-black tie races, that is, they are races below the elite level and are available for all small owners and trainers.  I mentioned our intention to build a second all-weather track in Tipperary.  That is to facilitate and replicate the Dundalk experience in terms of creating opportunities for the type of operators the Deputy referred to .  We operate a pyramid-based structure or meritocracy within racing, which leads to the championship races at the top level.<\/p><p> We will shortly launch a new support scheme for breeders, which is a direct response to the Brexit concerns.  Many small breeders feel isolated.  Britain is our main market for horses, with 80% of exports of Irish horses going to the UK, so there is great anxiety with regard to Brexit.  In the past couple of years we have expanded the race programme for horses, particularly at the lower level.  We have introduced specific races, called option races, for horses at the lower level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614074400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>We are tight for time.

It drives rural economic activity, the sales and the decision to have horses in training here.  Regarding the link with the horse and greyhound fund, the Deputy is correct to point out the proximity of the figures, but they are not directly linked.  It is not the case that we get X amount from the Government, so we put X into prize money and offer prize money of X amount.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned, we have other sources of income as well.  Prize money is the subject of competition internationally, particularly at the higher level where one is seeking to attract horses.  We have been quite successful at this over the years, getting international owners to base their horses in Ireland rather than the alternatives there might be in France or the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#C01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1614074400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I am trying to get to the heart of whether Exchequer funding is having the biggest impact.  To repeat Mr. Kavanagh's figures, 92% of horse trainers have five or fewer mares.  Looking at the distribution of the prize money in terms of flat racing, and I believe these figures are from 2019 as well, the top trainer managed to secure 25% of the overall prize money.  The top ten trainers secured 63.29% of the prize money.  In the case of the national hunt, the top trainer drew down 17% and the top ten trainers drew down 63% of the funding.  The flat all-weather did a little better in terms of balance, but the funds were much smaller.  Some 46.23% of owners drew down the overall amount of the money in terms of the top ten.  One can see there is great disparity and understand why some would question whether the model of front-loading the prize money is the best way to make the economic impact Mr. Kavanagh rightly said this money can deliver, if it is utilised correctly.  It appears that the model in place will ensure that the big trainers, who do great work and are great ambassadors, will keep getting bigger while the stables of five or fewer mares will remain very much bit players.  There will not be much scope for them to expand because it is very hard to break into this prize money, which would allow them to have the same resources as their competitors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#C01500","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614074400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I do not think that is a full analysis.  Many of the horses that are winning for the bigger trainers are bred by those breeders the Deputy referred to, the small breeders who are selling their horses to the owners to keep them in training.  The other factor is that many of our top trainers started off as small trainers.  Our two leading national hunt trainers, Willie Mullins and Gordon Elliott, both started with four or five horses in training and have been able to develop their businesses to their current scale.

If we look at racing in the UK today, almost half the horses running will be Irish horses and almost half the jockeys riding will be Irish jockeys who are based in the UK.

That is now gone and Britain has become a third country.  Therefore, the movement of horses between the countries becomes a VAT and customs event.  Under EU animal health law, there are new phytosanitary requirements in terms of veterinary certification and details that need to be checked before a horse can move from a third country into the EU.  We are endeavouring to smooth that passage as much as possible because there are 25,000 horse movements a year between Ireland, Britain and France.

Where stands the conversation with the Government about the resumption of point-to-point racing?  Mr. Kavanagh has previously made the point about running meetings on racecourses.  I speak specifically for Cork.  I do not think it would be practical to run Kildorrery, Killeagh or Dromahane point-to-point meetings in Mallow racecourse at this point in time.  Mr. Kavanagh might have a view on that.  We would like to see a resumption of point-to-point races in their natural state in the locations that the many people who go to point-to-point races would normally visit.  In the absence of people being able to go to point-to-point races, can these races be run in original locations like Kildorrery or Dromahane?

We are all waiting to see what comes out of the news this week.  In response to the second question, these could be turned around with a reasonable amount of notice, perhaps one week or ten days.  There is a great hunger in the point-to-point community to get going again.  I stress that this is all outdoor activity with fewer people involved than at a racecourse.  The racecourses have operated successfully since last June with strict protocols and no issue arising with Covid at a race meeting.  That has enabled the racing industry to keep the wheels turning, which we are appreciative of and grateful for.  The same applies to point-to-point races.  There is the animal aspect too.  These horses are bought and trained to race and they do not have anywhere to go.<\/p> <p>  We made a written submission to the Department last Wednesday and we are in daily dialogue with it.<\/p><p>It could be turned around at ten days' notice, I believe.

My last point is on third party events held at HRI venues, such as Mallow racecourse.  I still call it Mallow racecourse because I am a proud Mallowman.  HRI calls it Cork Racecourse Mallow.  There is a fair at the racecourse, a home and garden fair.  Is it anticipated that third-party events such as that will continue or will be pencilled into the calendar?  I would imagine such events provide vital revenue streams for HRI and the individual racecourses, but they are also vital to the non-horse fraternity or confraternity.  I want to make sure there is proactive engagement to ensure as many people as possible can enjoy the venues and the events held in them.

The types of events mentioned are absolutely vital to any racecourse.  It is a real challenge for racecourses not just to be locations where people come to race and leave.  A racecourse has to engage with its local community and get people to use it.  If it is for purposes other than racing, all the better.  The Deputy will know that Mallow was used as a Covid testing centre.  We were delighted that Galway and Punchestown racecourses were on the list of 37 venues announced as vaccination centres.  The community engagement piece is vital for racecourses.  The most successful racecourses in the country, regarding which I have repeatedly quoted the example of Ballinrobe Racecourse in the west, are those that are absolutely rooted in the local community and seen as the people&rsquo;s racecourse in their area.  That is when one hits the magic spot.

Mr. Kavanagh referred to the publication last March of the strategic plan up to 2024.  I have read that report and it identifies a reliance on media rights as a weakness.  At the moment, based on the accounts, the amount involved seems to be in the region of &euro;7 million.  Will Mr. Kavanagh outline how access to media rights is characterised as a weakness.  What is the outlook up to 2024 for HRI regarding media rights?<\/p> <p>  There has been some discussion in the Oireachtas about controlling advertising relating to gambling.  Has the organisation done any kind of a risk analysis on the impact a ban on gambling advertising would have on its business model?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#K00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614074400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>That is a significant item on our risk register.  There is much more to racing than just gambling.  Interestingly, our research shows that having a bet was only the fourth ranked reason for people going racing.<\/p> <p>  With regard to media rights, the risk in the strategic plan relates to the dependence of racecourses on them, not HRI.  Media rights comprise pictures and commentaries of races and data.  The runners in the newspaper this morning and the data are merged together to provide a single media rights package.  HRI produces those data.  We produce the fields for all races and we have copyright over those data.  As the property owners, the racecourses own the pictures.  The Deputy is right that we said in our strategic plan that the dependence of racecourses on media rights is a challenge and we are always looking for racecourses to broaden their income base.  However, during the Covid crisis it has proven to be a strength because while racecourses have had no commercial revenue from racegoers, as we have had no racegoers at Irish racetracks since last March, they have been able to continue to trade because of the income they get from selling the pictures.  With a combination of Government supports and costs that they have been able to take out of their own business, as they have lower costs because the public are not attending race meetings, they have been able to offset their loss of revenue due to the fact that there is an increased demand for the pictures of Irish races.  The streaming of races is very popular now.  We had an average of 62,000 streams per race at the big Dublin racing festival in Leopardstown two weeks ago.  The way in which racing is being broadcast is changing and there is a concern about that.  As with all analyses, sometimes one will look at something and see it as a weakness but it can also be a strength if dealt with properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1614074400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I suspect I am out of time but I ask Mr. Kavanagh to give me a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer to this.

I have a question on the appointment process for board members.  During previous questions, Mr. Kavanagh distinguished between appointees of the Minister and representatives of the sectoral interests.  Is it the case that while sectoral interests make nominations for the board, it is essentially the Minister who makes the formal appointment?  I would like that to be clarified.  We spoke about the instance where there has been a board member <i>in situ<\/i>since 2008.  I do not personally know that board member and I am sure he is an able representative of that sector.  This committee has long-standing experience of coming across bad practice where executives or board members are <i>in situ<\/i>for long periods of time.  That is the reason the guidelines are in place.  Is it the case that once those sectoral interests or representatives nominate somebody, the Minister has no authority to deny that or what is the process exactly?  I would like a little clarity on that, if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#L01300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614074400,"counter":257,"content":"<p>The Deputy has it spot on.  The board members are all equal and they are all appointed by the Minister.  My clarification in my opening statement was to point out that a number of board members are specified to be put forward from various industry sectors.  For example, the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association and the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association put forward nominations.  There are provisions in the legislation for the Minister to accept or reject nominations or to come up with alternative nomination methods, if desired.  There is a distinction in the 1994 Act and the theory is that there would be various representatives of different parts of the industry and that, on top of that, the Minister would make ministerial nominations.  These board members are no different from other board members in terms of their status but the intention is that the sectors of the industry would be complemented by people from outside the industry or those with other skill sets that might be missing on the board.  They are all ministerial appointees, however, so it is not as if the Minister does not have any say on who is the trainers' representative, the breeders' representative and so on.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Carthy's earlier question, there were 25 overseas winners in Ireland in 2019 and they won &euro;3.4 million.

Apologies have been received from Deputy Stanton and Senator Gavin.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to be able to continue our pre-legislative scrutiny of the competition (amendment) Bill 2021.  The principal objective of the Bill is to transpose the EU&rsquo;s European Competition Network, ECN, directive that will make the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPG, and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, more effective in overseeing and enforcing competition law.  The directive was adopted in 2019 with a transposition deadline of 4 February 2021.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, recently sent the general scheme of the Bill to the committee asking that we prioritise our consideration of this matter. Having received a briefing on the matter from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am pleased that we will develop our understanding of the Bill when we hear from witnesses of the CCPG and ComReg in relation to the proposed legislation.  These bodies will be the two most affected by the directive and proposed Bill.<\/p> <p>  From the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, I welcome Ms Isolde Goggin, chairperson, Mr. Brian McHugh and members of the commission, and from the Commission for Communications Regulation, Mr. Garrett Blaney, chairperson, and Mr. Jeremy Godfrey, commissioner.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today&rsquo;s witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal prosecution from proceedings as a witness physically present does.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such decision.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses&rsquo; opening statements have been circulated to members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite the chairperson of the CCPC, Ms Goggin, to make her contribution.  I remind witnesses and members that when contributing remotely, they should clarify their name for recording purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021022300002#A00400","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I am chairperson of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  I am joined by Mr. Brian McHugh who is a member of the commission with responsibility for our competition enforcement and mergers functions.  I thank committee members for the opportunity to speak to them today and to provide our views on the competition (amendment) Bill 2021.<\/p> <p>  As the primary enforcement body for competition law, both the CCPC and our predecessor, the Competition Authority, used all their powers and resources to investigate suspected anti-competitive practices, and bring those damaging practices to an end.  In doing so, we have built up a strong  record of enforcement.  However, developments in enforcement mechanisms have left Ireland out of step with the rest of Europe.  Our ability to act is grounded in our statutory powers and, therefore, it is essential that those laws provide the CCPC with the right enforcement tools to effectively deter, detect and address white-collar crime relating to competition law.  This Bill provides a significant opportunity for major change and will enable the CCPC to be more effective for the benefit of consumers, businesses and the economy as a whole.  However, the devil is in the detail and the specifics of how this European legislation is transposed will determine how effective it is.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the CCPC&rsquo;s enforcement powers, competition law investigations are built on physical and digital evidence, and they require in-depth economic and legal analysis.  We have consistently used our current powers to challenge anti-competitive practices in a wide variety of sectors.  We secured Ireland&rsquo;s first conviction for bid rigging and we recently referred a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, into potential bid rigging in the procurement of publicly-funded transport services.  Last year, we issued preliminary findings against a number of businesses in the motor insurance sector and most recently we secured a High Court order in respect of a commitment agreement with Ticketmaster.<\/p> <p>  We have a substantial enforcement track record but there are areas where we could have done more if we had the same powers as other competition agencies in the EU.  For example, the most the CCPC can achieve at present, in a significant number of competition cases, is to seek commitments that the business will cease the practice or behaviour and not do it again.  If we cannot obtain commitments ourselves, we can apply to the courts for a declaration that the behaviour is unlawful and obtain an injunction.  In our view, this is not an effective deterrent to practices that harm competition and, ultimately, consumers.<\/p> <p>  Unlike other competition agencies, the CCPC cannot impose financial sanctions for breaches of competition law.  Also, we cannot operate a leniency programme, which would allow for the reduction in fines when a business provides evidence that it has participated in a breach of competition law.  Leniency programmes encourage companies to come forward with evidence and result in more effective, and efficient, investigations and enforcement.<\/p> <p>  I would like to speak about our investigative powers.  Secret cartels are extremely damaging and are therefore considered a serious breach of competition law.  This type of activity has a very harmful effect on consumers and the wider economy, as any or all of the following can happen as a result of businesses coming together to agree prices or to share out a market between them: prices go up while efficiency, innovation and the options available to consumers go down.  They are also the most challenging breaches to detect and investigate as, by their nature, they involve a secret conspiracy.  The parties involved often make a considerable efforts to hide their involvement from their customers and, indeed, from the CCPC.  International experience has shown that cartelists have become more sophisticated in using electronic communications technology and social media apps to co-ordinate their behaviour.  Indeed, many cartelists work diligently to avoid leaving a paper trail and only communicate verbally on their mobile phones.<\/p> <p>  For this reason, the CCPC is seeking investigative and surveillance powers which are appropriate to detect white-collar crime.  We are very aware that the powers we seek must be balanced with safeguards for the rights of the individual.  Currently, for the CCPC to search a premises, we must present sufficient evidence to a judge in order to obtain a warrant and we anticipate this level of judicial oversight will be maintained in our new powers.<\/p> <p>  As regards its implementation, this Bill will allow the use of important enforcement tools commonly used across the EU for the first time in Ireland.  The CCPC believes that giving us these enforcement tools will fill a significant gap in the existing competition law enforcement regime in Ireland.  The detail of how the regime works is crucial in ensuring that the legislation is effective.  From our experience, we know that for there to be a meaningful deterrent, the threat of enforcement must be real and go beyond reputational damage.  The CCPC is of the view that we require the power to: adopt infringement decisions; grant immunity from or reductions in fines; make orders; grant remedies; and impose fines in respect of breaches of competition law, subject to the appropriate judicial oversight.<\/p> <p>  As chair of the CCPC, and previously chair of the Competition Authority over a number of years, I can confidently say that we have spent many years enforcing the law to the best of our ability.  I can assure members of the committee that the views put before them today come from much consideration over this time.<\/p><p>I firmly believe that the competition (amendment) Bill 2021 is a once in a generation opportunity to reform Irish competition law and align our enforcement regime with the rest of the EU, something that is long overdue.  These are major changes and the detail of the Bill will be very important if we are to realise the full potential of these reforms and enable the CCPC to be more efficient, effective and impactful when tackling white collar crime in Ireland. <\/p><p> We recognise the CCPC must play its part in this, and in this regard we have been working very closely with our parent Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, both in terms of working through the detail of the legislation and considering the impact such powers will have on our organisation, particularly in ensuring there are sufficient resources, expertise and oversight.  Our mission is to make markets work better and we are committed to playing our part in ensuring that this legislation benefits consumers, businesses and ultimately the economy.<\/p><p> We are happy to take any questions and further explain our views in more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021022300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>T&aacute; muid bu&iacute;och as ucht an cuireadh a bheith i l&aacute;thair anseo inniu.  On behalf of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, I welcome the opportunity to appear before today&rsquo;s hearing regarding the competition (amendment) Bill.  I am joined by my fellow ComReg commissioner, Jeremy Godfrey.<br\/><br\/>ComReg was established by the Communications Regulation Act in 2002 and is now in its third decade.  As part of our statutory functions and objectives, we promote competition and investment in the telecoms and electronic communications sector.  We uphold end-user rights and we manage the radio spectrum.  Our vision for the electronic communications sector is that consumers and businesses in Ireland have affordable, high quality and widespread access to communications services and applications that support their social and economic needs.<br\/><br\/>European law recognises that there are specific competition issues that arise in the telecoms sector and has established a bespoke regime for regulating the sector that operates alongside general competition law.  The bespoke telecoms regime provides for national regulatory authorities to take <i>ex ante<\/i>action to prevent likely competition problems arising, even before they materialise.  The general competition law regime, which provides for <i>ex post<\/i>enforcement against cartels and abuse of dominance, also applies in the sector.<br\/><br\/>ComReg is the national regulatory authority responsible for implementation of the specific telecoms regulatory regime in Ireland.  Under the bespoke telecoms regime, we have used our <i>ex ante<\/i>powers to promote competition in markets such as broadband, voice telephony and broadcast of television signals.  For example, we require Eir to make its network available to competing providers of broadband services.  As a result, operators such as Sky and Vodafone have been able to enter the market.  Today, around a third of all fixed broadband customers get their service from competitors using the Eir network for the final connection to customer premises.<br\/><br\/>ComReg also shares responsibility with the CCPC for enforcement of general competition law, other than merger control, in the electronic communications sector.  ComReg and the CCPC have in place a co-operation agreement.  This facilitates the performance by the CCPC and ComReg of their respective functions as competition authorities, to avoid duplication of activities and to ensure consistency of approach. In practical terms, notification and consultation between ComReg and the CCPC are promoted.<br\/><br\/>The competition (amendment) Bill will transpose the ECN+ directive into Irish law.  It will only have an impact on ComReg&rsquo;s powers and functions as a competition authority.  Changes to our powers and functions under the bespoke telecoms regime, and transposition of new EU law in that area, require separate legislation.  I will comment briefly on three issues in the Bill: sanctions, investigation powers and administrative arrangements.  The directive requires civil financial sanctions for breaches of competition law.  Ireland is one of only two EU member states that do not already have a system of administrative fines for breaches of competition law.  This means we rely solely on criminal enforcement for financial sanctions of competition law breaches.  However, the evidentiary requirements, the complex economic analysis involved in many cases and the criminal standard of proof mean that criminal prosecution is neither practical nor appropriate in most competition law cases.<br\/><br\/>ComReg therefore welcomes and supports the approach in the general scheme giving the Irish administrative competition authorities - the CCPC and ComReg - administrative fining powers, subject to appeal or confirmation by the High Court.  ComReg believes that the proposed scheme, whereby the Irish competition authorities may, subject to court confirmation, impose fines at levels that are sufficiently high to act as a credible deterrent, is essential for the effective enforcement of competition law.<br\/><br\/>ComReg recognises nevertheless that there is a continuing role for criminal sanctions and welcomes the approach in the scheme for a dual civil and criminal sanction regime.  For the enforcement regime to be as effective as possible, civil financial sanctions need to be complemented by enhanced investigations and enforcement powers and an effective leniency regime that encourages early resolution of cases.  Some of the necessary powers are already available to both ComReg and the CCPC.  We welcome the opportunity to enhance ComReg and CCPC powers so that both authorities have all the powers required by the directive.<br\/><br\/>It is vital for competition authorities to be able to obtain information that is relevant to their investigations, including by way of unannounced inspections.  Information-gathering powers need to be underpinned by an ability to impose sanctions if the information required is not forthcoming.  We welcome proposals in the scheme to enable the CCPC and ComReg to punish non-compliance in the context of an investigation by way of periodic penalty payments.  These will assist a speedy and efficient enforcement regime.<br\/><br\/>It is also necessary for competition authorities to be able to stop egregious behaviours and protect consumers and competitors from harm in the short term by adopting appropriate and proportionate interim measures.  Interim measures are essential to ensure competition law breaches do not profit those responsible pending completion of often complex investigations.  Such measures are therefore a key component of the effectiveness of the enforcement regime and public confidence in it.  In addition to the deterrence of breaches, effective enforcement also involves giving incentives to perpetrators to come forward and put an end to a breach and benefit from reductions in the fines where conditions are met.  ComReg welcomes the proposals governing the establishment of a leniency regime.<br\/><br\/>We recognise the importance of fully and adequately protecting the rights of undertakings that are under investigation.  We consider that competition authorities should have the flexibility to determine the precise administrative arrangements to achieve this in the light of their responsibility to organise themselves and deploy their resources as efficiently as possible.  For this reason, we would urge that the Bill set out the principles about fairness contained in the directive rather than specifying administrative arrangements in detail.  This will allow ComReg and the CCPC to define appropriate internal processes and procedures and to publish guidance for undertakings that provide transparency and legal certainty about how these processes will operate.<br\/><br\/>The transposition of the ECN+ directive paves the way for more effective deterrents to, and sanctions for, anti-competitive behaviour in Ireland.  ComReg believes that the proposals in the Bill will have a positive effect on the effective enforcement of national and EU competition rules.  However, I should emphasise that the Bill&rsquo;s impact on ComReg will be limited to our role as an <i>ex post<\/i>competition authority.  Similar enhancements to our enforcement powers are also required in respect of our functions under the bespoke telecoms regulatory regime if we are to become more effective at promoting competition and upholding end user rights. <br\/><br\/>ComReg has consistently advocated for such powers, for example in our submissions to the Law Reform Commission, LRC, on regulatory issues and corporate offences.  We welcome that enhancement of such powers is also included in the programme for Government.  We are discussing the details with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.<\/p><p>We are discussing the details with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  We have also raised that topic when giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks last December.

ComReg supports the views of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and as a competition authority for the electronic communication sector, considers the sector needs the same competition rules as those applying to other sectors in which the CCPC is the national competition authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021022300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I remind members of the need to focus on the provisions of the competition Bill we are examining as opposed to broader issues relating to ComReg or the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021022300002#C00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I thank our witnesses for their evidence.

The problem with white-collar crime is its degree of invisibility.  There is no dead body or smoking gun.  The existence of the crime has to be proven before proving who did it.

We have a cartel immunity programme that we worked out with the Director of Public Prosecutions for hard core cartels.  <\/p> <p>  The great thing about the leniency programme, as implemented in other member states, is that the competition agency operates it.

We are keen on bid rigging being outlined as an offence in the general scheme.  It is sometimes seen as a form of price fixing.  We are keen on using screening and have been working with our parent Department and others to consider the issue of getting into the data for public procurement in particular.

Most if not all members of the committee have spoken in the past about the need to enhance the authority of agencies to enforce competition law and provide greater protection for the consumers.  There is a need for effective deterrents in order to ensure compliance with competition law.  The power to impose financial penalties is naturally required and very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I believe there is some concern about the proposed additional powers related to video and audio surveillance.  I recognise it is intended that such powers would only be used when investigating serious and criminal breaches of competition law under specific conditions.  It is something that was discussed at a committee meeting a couple of weeks ago when Department officials said that it was not envisaged to have such powers without court involvement and oversight.  Nonetheless, my understanding is that similar powers in other European jurisdictions have been struck down by courts and the European Courts of Human Rights.  I refer, in particular, to a UK case involving the interception of telephone, email and data communications where the European Courts of Human Rights found that there was a violation of Article 8 of the convention as domestic law lacked clarity and did not provide protection against the abuse of power and, I suppose, with the scope or manner of the exercise there was very wide discretion conferred on the authorities.  I would also note that the European Competition Network, ECN, directive does contain provision relating to such powers.  I have one or two question in light of this.  Is it the view that current legislation is sufficiently clear?  From my perspective, the Bill does not seem to provide much certainty about which communications could be monitored.  My reading is that it is intended that these powers would be used at the investigation stage, so at a point when the persons involved have not breached any laws.  Is there a concern that this impacts their fundamental rights at a point when there is no legal charge against them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021022300002#D00300","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":336,"content":"<p>There has been much commentary about the powers proposed in the Bill.  The first point I would make is that serious crime requires serious powers to deal with it.  On the criminal side, these are offences that carry a ten-year jail sentence, prosecution to the Central Criminal Court by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  White-collar crime is crime.  It is up there with other forms of crime in terms of the appropriate penalties.  We would be very used to exercising the criminal powers that we have under the supervision of the courts.  Again, we are a little bit different from some of our counterparts in Europe where they are used to doing things on the civil basis of proof.  We come from the other end of the spectrum where we are used to the supervision of the courts in obtaining a search warrant, and we are used to proving our case in court to that level of proof.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the surveillance powers, they are just used in order to get one to the point where one has evidence to bring to a court or a tribunal.  At the point that one uses the surveillance powers there is no certainty of guilt or otherwise but they are a very important investigative tool.  We have certainly had cases in the past where we have had evidence, for instance, that a group was meeting in an hotel, that a group of businesses engaged in the same trade were meeting, we knew that meeting was going to happen and we had suspicions that it was a cartel meeting but we could not do anything in order to find out what went on at it.  This was somewhat back in the day where, I think, people used to write down what they were talking about during the cartel meetings and one would be able to find stuff in the bin or whatever.  Nowadays, as I mentioned, people are much more tech savvy and so on.  There is a distinction between the powers that are proposed in this Bill, which are very targeted and would be exercised on foot of a warrant versus mass surveillance, which I think was the subject of the UK case that has been mentioned about communications, the retention of data and so on.  We would see these powers as being exercised very narrowly and very much under the supervision of the courts.  Again, I am sure that any input into the details of the legislation that make it clear that this is narrow, targeted and evidence-based would be very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021022300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":337,"content":"<p>To clarify, European law requires any legislation in this area of surveillance to be extremely clear and have strong protections against abuse.

As, increasingly, these become data smart players, they have new sources of power to abuse dominance, to use the term that is used in competition law.  With these new civil powers, will there be an opportunity for either or both of the agencies to develop codes of practice that might set a standard for activities across a range of behaviours that influence competition?  That might help us to get a better handle on this abusive dominance often which can be a little hidden and, I suspect, hard to prosecute and certainly under criminal sanction.  Do we see new codes of practice or standards being promulgated by the agencies, on the back of these changed powers?<\/p> <p>  Ms Goggin said, a bit intriguingly, that the devil is in the detail in terms of how this is transposed into Irish law.

On the point of the devil being in the detail, we really need an holistic view of the process from start to finish where it is clear that whoever grants leniency at the beginning of the process is in a position to implement that at the end of it.  If one is in charge of granting leniency then one is also in charge of developing the level of fines at the end of the process.  That was the difficulty in the system we had previously, or the system that pertains in criminal investigations whereby the investigative agency and the agency that makes the decision on whether an offence has been committed and on the level of fines are separate.  It is strict enough because obviously there needs to be a separation of the investigative and the adjudicative functions in the interests of natural justice, which is very clear.  One cannot have a leniency programme, however, if one is not in charge of determining the ultimate level of the fine.  This was one of our concerns.  We absolutely understand and respect the need for the provisions of natural justice but we are aware that there are lots of agencies in this space in the EU that are not huge.  We would look particularly at the Scandinavian and the Baltic agencies that are relatively small agencies in relatively small countries, and they seem to be able to do this to the satisfaction of the European Court of Justice, ECJ.

We do an amount of this and we publish, as does the European Commission, and we work with the European Commission on that.<\/p> <p>  Another element is that when we do an investigation we try to publish the investigation note by guidance to the industry on what does and does not fall within breaches of competition law.  We believe it is useful to send out a message to industry.  Ultimately, with the new legislation we will have new powers in areas such as the abuse of dominance.  As Ms Goggin has mentioned, if a company is abusing its dominance today there is no financial punishment available from us or from the courts.  This proposed legislation is a game changer for an area of competition law such as abuse of dominance.

It has a separate unit that does nothing but investigations into bid rigging.  I could see us potentially getting to that scale.

International and European agencies commented on this case.  For example, it was stated that in Germany, the fine would have been somewhere between &euro;7 million and &euro;22 million.  I am not suggesting that the case in question will establish a precedent for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission but something of a precedent has been established.  Will the CCPC have the necessary resolve to go hard after the guilty parties and to issue fines in the context of the leniency regime?  Will the fines issued reflect international best practice?

It is up to 10% of annual turnover.  The normal practice is that there are fining guidelines which set out the aggravating and mitigating factors.  Certain factors might result in a reduction in the fine and others might result in an increase in it.  It is important to reiterate that leniency is the way the information is obtained, which leads to the investigation in the first place.  Leniency is an investigative tool used at the start of the process, not a tool of justice used at the end of the process.  The purpose of leniency is not to be nice to parties; it is to get the information that allows others to be pursued.  The pool of those eligible for leniency is quite small.  The idea is that it facilitates the cracking of the cartel.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission has been using this method and imposing fines for years.  Some of the fines imposed in the cartel cases are very substantial.  For example, there was a whole series of related cartels in the car parts industry.  That resulted in fines that amounted to &euro;2 billion.  The Commission has also imposed some very substantial fines for the abuse of dominance on companies in the technology sector.  The levels of fines imposed in this area are certainly a few orders of magnitude higher than the fines imposed in cases such as that referred to by the Deputy.  Again, it comes down to the evidence.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to the point raised about natural justice, we envisage that the fines would be overseen by the courts.

Is there a wider range of areas for which codes of practice could be established?  I am thinking of dominant companies in particular.  I have seen predatory pricing carried out by companies that appears to be wrong.  Could a code of practice on predatory pricing by dominant players be introduced?  Could codes of practice be brought in around the adequacy of complaint procedures and the ability of consumers to contact companies in the event that service is unsatisfactory?  It is a real mark of a dominant player that it can start to become lazy around the provision of service to its consumers.  With this new civil standard, if codes were developed in some of the areas I mentioned, could they become a more effective means of tackling such behaviour?  Ultimately, civil action can be taken if companies fail to comply with what appear to be good codes.

The issues for each company are very detailed, such as whether and how the company is dominant, what the markets are and what the abuse might be.

He wrote that it was impossible for the king to buy anything as cheaply as other men.  It has been around for centuries that once the public purse is available, people seem to get very good at finding ways of exploiting it.<br\/><br\/>I would not consider the CAB-type powers, particularly in the context of the seizure of assets and so on, to be useful to us at this point.  When we talk about competition offences, we look at quite a wide range.  There are matters that we see as clearly in the criminal space, such as bid-rigging, price-fixing, market-sharing and so on, but there are other practices such as vertical agreements and abuse of dominance that are not subject to proof at that criminal standard but which can be proved in other ways.  We think the appropriate step to do in such cases is to investigate those cases and to use the new powers we are being given to do so.<br\/><br\/>Part of the issue of competition investigation is that there are parties that are damaged.  If a criminal offence is proved, according to the current legislation that is <i>res judicata<\/i>.  Anyone who is damaged by the practice can come forward to seek damages, and the case is regarded as having been proved to the extent that the facts are the same.  That is not necessarily the same in the civil arena, but we hope that if the level of enforcement of competition offences, as a public agency, can be improved, that would stimulate an increase in the number of private sector cases, which includes the likes of public procurers.  People who could prove they had been damaged by an anti-competitive practice could go after the company and get damages as recompense for that.<\/p><p>We see companies being pursued and the possibility of damages as being the most valuable ways to deter people from engaging in these practices.

I have worked in research and policy on climate action and sustainability for 17 years.  Currently independent, I am an adviser to the Finland Futures Research Centre and was lead author of the transport chapter in the Environmental Protection Agency's 2020 state of the environment report.<br\/><br\/>It is to be welcomed that the committee seeks to scrutinise action on transport.  The target to reduce emissions by 51% or more by 2030 must focus minds.  Ireland's national transport carbon emissions are <i>per capita<\/i>the fourth highest in the EU.  Emissions have continued to grow even while we require them to decrease rapidly.<br\/><br\/>It is important to understand why we have been going in the wrong direction.  An extensive rail system that existed at the formation of the State was largely decommissioned over the past century.  In more recent decades, we have delivered the perfect conditions for lock-in to a carbon-intensive transport system.  Through urban sprawl, our settlement pattern has increased travel distances.  At the same time, transport policy directed major investment towards roads and motorways and allowed walking, cycling and public transport to stagnate or decline in comparison.  As our wealth grew and increased demand for transport, decades of policy and private choices funnelled passengers into cars and freight onto trucks.  A lock-in to an unsustainable system was inevitable.<br\/><br\/>The Climate Action Plan 2019, initiated by the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, was a laudable effort at progress.  However, it had a problematic relationship with transport.  Key decisions on spatial and transport planning had already been taken in the national planning framework and the national development plan, NDP.  They included modest, shorter term aims for compact growth and for shifting journeys to sustainable modes.  As a result, it became clear that we would miss our 2030 emissions targets considerably.  To plug this gap, the climate action plan was forced to ramp up the goal for the number of electric vehicles to a level that was difficult to achieve.  We now have a far deeper emissions reduction target and it is a risky and potentially costly gamble to rely on electric vehicles to meet it.  More importantly, this would make our 2050 emissions commitments harder to achieve and deepen the many sustainability problems associated with our transport system.  Just some of these include world-leading traffic congestion, damage to economic competitiveness, road traffic accidents and the many impacts of particulate pollution on human health.<br\/><br\/>The commitments in the national planning framework and the NDP must be seen as a floor of ambition rather than a ceiling.  They are not consistent with the scale of the challenge we now face.  In response, the avoid-shift-improve approach is recognised internationally by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, and others as the standard for deep emissions reductions and sustainability.  This transformative approach demands that policy move from short term to long, from marginal tweaks to big vision, and from improving technology to transforming systems fundamentally.<br\/><br\/>&quot;Avoid&quot; means avoiding the generation of more and longer trips by preventing low-density development and repairing our existing sprawl.  It has common aims with providing affordable, high-quality housing in vibrant, well-serviced communities.  It uses spatial planning tools to channel virtually all future development into the existing footprints of our cities and into revitalising the physical core of the villages and towns of rural Ireland.  &quot;Avoid&quot; also includes short-term demand management.<br\/><br\/>&quot;Shift&quot; is the next priority.  It means moving journeys from private cars to walking, cycling and public transport.  It implements the settlement and transport planning necessary to make these sustainable modes the dominant forms of movement in the years to come.  There needs to be a particular priority on rail for passengers and freight.  Rail is the safest and most sustainable option over longer distances and can support greatly increasing walking and cycling.<\/p><p>\"Improve\" means smaller vehicles, better engines and moving to alternatives such as electric.  This will remain a necessary, but not a sufficient approach for a sustainable low-carbon future.<\/p><p> Transformation involves bringing together spatial, transport and climate action policy.  It begins with 2050 goals and implements the short-term plans necessary to meet them.  In Ireland, we have major gaps to address.  Our vision, our analysis and our policy all need a shot in the arm.<\/p><p> To conclude, if our severely congested, emissions-intensive and economically costly transport system were a heart patient, it would be in cardiac failure.  Our policy is providing an aspirin when the patient needs a triple heart bypass.  Making progress will require vision and political leadership.  Through the disruption of the pandemic, we now have a unique opportunity to reset and put ourselves on the right side of history.<\/p><p> I thank the committee once more for this opportunity to speak and I am happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tadhg O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Mahony and now invite Mr. Cussen to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#B00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for the invitation.  I have submitted a statement so I will cover some highlights from it.  The remit of the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, is as an independent overseer of the implementation by planning authorities and by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of the regulatory and policy framework for planning set by the Oireachtas and Government.  I will cover the various topics such as: avoiding increasing energy demands, accelerating the shift towards sustainable travel patterns and diversifying our energy systems.<\/p> <p>  Starting with avoiding increasing energy demands through proper planning, it is fair to say that, historically, our model of development has hardwired us to mainly low-density development dependent on car-based transport, perhaps due to a low awareness of the impacts on the environment and the weakness of sustainable alternatives.  Legislative reforms introduced in 2010 included stricter controls on how, where and how much land would be sold for development but it has been very challenging to implement these reforms which has required dezoning in commuter locations and rezoning land for development in underutilised urban areas.  Today, the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040: National Planning Framework, NPF, commits to securing an average of 40% of the delivery of all new homes on brownfield and infilled development land, rising to 50% in cities and 30% in our towns and villages, through good local authority planning.<\/p> <p>  From our vantage point on the implementation of this we see a mixed picture.  Some local authorities work hard on climate action-centred planning policy despite significant vested interest, political and sometimes public opposition where the link between certain developments and climate are perhaps not fully appreciated.  Other local authorities increasingly point to brownfield and higher density development being much less economic compared to lower density greenfield development and point out that following traditional patterns of development might be essential in meeting housing supply pressures.  Communities often want to retain familiar 19th century skylines as our cities and towns struggle to address 21st century challenges, including an extra 1 million people predicted by the by the national planning framework by 2040.<\/p> <p>  Building upwards and making better use of underutilised urban land, providing attractive, affordable and well-located urban housing and connected communities are many of the antidotes to our historical business-as-usual outwards pattern of energy-intensive urban sprawl.  Yet urban regeneration, as many members of the committee will know, is massively time and resource-consuming, often litigious, and, if one does not have good participatory-based planning, can be locally contentious.<\/p> <p>  As we highlighted in the annual report of the OPR, until the NPF is properly reflected and acted upon, we will continue to approve and develop too much development in locations that continue to hardwire us into increasing energy demand.<\/p> <p>  Turning around the affordability, attractiveness and viability of large-scale housing development within our city and town centres is very critical as will a national brownfield and infill development land register to identify what compact growth means.  Land activation measures such as progressing the Land Development Agency Bill, empowering local authorities to implement the vacant and derelict sites legislation and swift despatch of litigation arising are also vital.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the shift towards active and sustainable travel, all members of the committee will agree that spatial planning policies have a great influence in determining transport patterns.  Technology can break old links between work and mobility.  There is no doubt that Government is making unprecedented investment but we are championing the critical importance of full integration between transport and land use planning, like some of the recent plans such as the local area plan for Athy and the Dingle hub project.<\/p> <p>  We want to engage in skilling programmes for the local authorities in delivering sustainable mobility but in the context of shifting from promoting sprawling estates and scattered housing, which never work from a public transport and active travel perspective.<\/p> <p>  Turning briefly to improving the sustainability of our energy sources, communities want real action on climate.  One of the best ways to tap that desire would be to show how every county in the country could play its part in delivering an estimated extra 4 GW of renewable electricity to 2030 and, indeed, more offshore energy generation to a carbon-free society by 2050.  Yet our assessments of some local authority development plans find effective bans on the roll-out of sustainable energy sources.  On top of the updated Wind Energy Development Guidelines we need a national renewable energy roadmap with county-specific targets and the designation of sustainable energy zones which can be built by the regional assemblies working with the local authority climate action regional offices.<\/p> <p>  The Planning Act under section 10(2)(n) already demands forward planning that reduces future patterns of energy consumption, shifts our present energy needs towards renewable sources and adapts to climate changes already happening.  The pace in implementing this law is quickening since the publication of the NPF, the establishment of our office and the coming into being of local authority climate action plans under the legislation promised.  Local government and local authority planning, however, has a central role to play in the Avoid-Shift-Improve approach I mentioned but it needs clear policy frameworks and resources to work with to ensure that local authority members focus on the task at hand.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding this and our statutory mandate, legislated for by the Oireachtas and supported by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, we will work to ensure that all the constituent cogs in our country&rsquo;s planning process work together in the planet&rsquo;s and not just in local interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cussen for that presentation and call on Mr. Murphy to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#B00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and the members of the committee for the opportunity to attend today's committee hearing on the implications and opportunities in decarbonising Ireland&rsquo;s transport network.  Transport &amp;amp; Environment, T&amp;E, is a Brussels-based European-level NGO, advocating a more sustainable transport network at European and national level.  T&amp;E&rsquo;s vision is a zero-emission mobility system that is affordable and has minimal impacts on our health, climate and environment.  I have been with T&amp;E for almost seven years, focusing largely on the aviation sector.  A graduate of NUI Galway, I have been living in Brussels for ten years, moving there initially to work for the European Commission&rsquo;s transport directorate.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is not alone in witnessing a growth in transport emissions, with this sector now the largest source of emissions across Europe.  However, the absolute growth in emissions from Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector - an increase of 136% since 1990 - is stark compared to an EU average increase of 20%.<\/p> <p>  It would be tempting to ascribe such exceptional growth to Ireland&rsquo;s increase in GDP and population over that period.  However, this would ignore the role that policy decisions at all levels have played.  After all, it is Ireland&rsquo;s choice where we put this population growth and how we invested this wealth.<\/p> <p>  Nearly all aspects of the Avoid, Shift, Improve approach are impacted, directly or indirectly, by European legislation.  How this legislation is amended in the coming years will be crucial to achieving substantial emission reductions in the transport sector.<\/p> <p>  Europe's effort sharing regulation incentivises avoid and shift through target setting for parts of the economy, including transport.  That regulation is, however, under threat.  Vehicle regulations set targets for large and small vehicles, and have been decisive in driving the uptake of both low emission and high emissions vehicles.   The environmental and climate impact of fuels is regulated through the fuel quality and renewable energy directives, shaping the development of biofuels policy in Europe.  Aviation and shipping have to date received only passing interest from European regulators.  That has led to damaging consequences for these sectors' ability to decarbonise.<\/p> <p>  In addition to these regulations, the EU also plays an important role in financing transport infrastructure.  For example, the EIB has in the past lent heavily to carbon intensive projects, especially airports and roads, a position which is evolving as the bank aligns its lending with the goals of the Paris Agreement.<\/p> <p>  European legislation is now starting to pay dividends where, for example, the reforms to car standards introduced in the wake of VW&rsquo;s \"dieselgate\" scandal are driving the deployment of zero-emission vehicles.  The bulk of European legislation is now under review under Europe&rsquo;s Green Deal which will touch on issues in respect of electric vehicles, batteries and biofuels.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy &ndash; Putting European Transport on Track for the Future, published last December, will guide European policy in this area.  It envisages smart and climate neutral cities across Europe, delivered through a range of measures, including shared mobility and increased cycling and walking infrastructure.  There is no one single fix to eliminating emissions from transport.<\/p> <p>  Policy developments are mutually reinforced by technological developments.<\/p><p>Improvements in battery technology, with regard to both range and price, have repeatedly exceeded expectations.  The price of batteries has fallen 85% in a decade and they can now go further and charge faster.  I consider myself one of the strongest proponents of the direct electrification of the transport system via electric vehicles.  We are far from realising the full potential of this area, due in part to some persisting myths regarding battery electrification.  Nevertheless, I have no intention of owning an electric vehicle because I have no intention of owning a private vehicle of any type.  I live in a major city with ample access to cheap public transport and where an increasing priority is given to walking and cycling.<\/p><p> This gets us to the key issue of decarbonising transport.  Stricter regulations and developments in technology mean we can, for most modes, offer people access to low-carbon mobility.  However, the public should always be given a choice and no one should be forced into a 20th century model of private car ownership which continues to have substantial negative financial, social and economic consequences.  A one-for-one switch between internal combustion engines and electric vehicles would be a missed opportunity.  It would undermine the effectiveness of public transport investments, place continued financial pressure on families and would risk putting Irish cities further out of step with their European counterparts.<\/p><p> Our transport policy is linked with our industrial and economic policy.  The right choices in decarbonising our transport sector can have enormous benefits for our economy, creating employment opportunities across the island.  With 97% of our transport energy demand met by imported fossil fuels in 2017, we have an opportunity to switch to developing our own fuels in Ireland, including fuels for the shipping and aviation sectors, through presently untapped offshore renewable energy potential. <\/p><p> I said &ldquo;most modes&rdquo; have an immediate pathway to decarbonisation.  A major exception is aviation which, before Covid, was the fastest growing source of emissions in Europe.  That is not by accident.  Our failure to effectively regulate aviation emissions, and instead to subsidise their growth, has created this situation.  This lack of regulation has consequences.  Measures put in place to decarbonise other sectors, including measures relating to cars, buildings and electricity, are starting to pay dividends.  Aviation is increasingly isolated as a high emitter of carbon, a problem which will return to threaten the sector post Covid.  This lack of regulation does the sector no favours and Ireland&rsquo;s role in resisting such regulation at European level is short-sighted in the extreme.  As an Irish citizen living overseas, I am acutely aware of the role aviation plays in connecting Ireland.  Those who talk up the strategic importance of aviation to Ireland should be equally vocal in ensuring the sector cuts its emissions.  With effort, and in time, we can develop solutions for aviation too.  I look forward to taking members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy and the other witnesses for their opening statements and for attending today's session to inform the committee about the issues at play when considering how best to reduce our national transport emissions, which are the fourth highest <i>per capita<\/i>in Europe and which comprise 20% of our overall national emissions.  This meeting is confined to a maximum of two hours.

While the clerk is noting the order, I will start off the questioning.<\/p><p>Given the scale of the challenge ahead in achieving at least 51% decarbonisation in transport by 2030, there is a fear that our planning policy is not aligned with our ambition.  In other words, is the national planning framework fit for purpose?  As Mr. Cussen pointed out in his opening statement, the national planning framework commits to securing an average of 40% of all new homes on brownfield and in-fill development land, with this average to rise to 50% in cities and to fall to 30% in towns and villages.  However, this indicates that 50% of homes are to be developed around cities and 70% around towns and villages.  This seems to pull against the principles of compact growth and the town centres first approach.  It will also continue our problem of urban sprawl, which beds in dependency on cars.  This dependency is at its worst in towns and villages, given the lack of public and active travel options.  As Mr. Cussen points out, we must away move from promoting sprawling estates and scattered housing which, to quote Mr. Cussen, will &quot;never work from a public transport and active travel perspective.&quot;<\/p><p>All three witnesses mentioned the approach of avoid, shift and improve.  Dr. O'Mahony commented that the commitments in the national planning framework and the NDP must be seen as a floor of ambition rather than a ceiling and that it is not consistent with the scale of the challenge we face.  The highest priority in this approach is given to avoiding, which is to say avoiding the generation of longer trips by preventing low-density development and repairing the sprawl we already have.

I also have a question for Mr. Cussen in particular.  We have seen evidence of local authorities enabling schemes that are quite dependent on cars at the periphery of urban centres through local area plans but it is claimed on paper that they are aligned with the national planning framework, NPF.  As regulator, is Mr. Cussen prepared to intervene in such cases to prevent their development if they will lock in dependency on cars and greenhouse gas emissions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#C00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Would the Chairman like me to address that question now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Yes, if Mr. Cussen would like to go first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#C00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":403,"content":"<p>We work within a regulatory and policy framework that is set by the Government.

A second reason is that it needs to look at alternatives.  Rather than just looking at small changes or redirecting 40% of new developments into existing footprints, it needs to look at the possibilities for approaches that are more transformative and more radical.  If one does not consider radical measures when looking at transformation, one is not seeking transformation.<\/p> <p>  I know the national planning framework was formed a number of years ago, before the real urgency of this issue came to bear, but we do not have analysis available in Ireland which can support choices.

We do not know what would be involved in taking a transformative approach to sustainable modes of transport in order that they dominate mobility in the future.  There would be capital costs and other implications but our current approach is very costly for our economy in terms of competitiveness.  It is widely accepted at this stage that this is not an emissions problem but a sustainable development problem.

It is very near the bottom, perhaps after Malta and Cyprus.  We should also be evidence driven on how much we can actually shift to rail, particularly in a short period like ten years.  Across Europe, we have about 18% of freight transferred by rail.  On a good day, we can get maybe 23% of freight transferred by rail.  There is not going to be an easy solution to shifting to rail.  That is why it is important to drive forward electrification in those sectors which cannot be so easily changed by a switch to public transport or planning changes.<\/p><p> Both the 2019 climate action plan and the programme for Government are either quite weak on the application of freight transport or they pursue some of the wrong solutions, such as using natural gas or using biogas for freight transport.  To some extent that is understandable.  The technology in this area is moving fast.  Just this month, Scania ditched plans for hydrogen-powered trucks and instead is going all out on battery electric vehicles.<\/p><p> When we are talking about this, we need to be clear on what we can achieve through changes in planning, the shift to rail and what needs to be electrified.

It is obviously an obligation on the planning authority to address those.<\/p> <p>  Public awareness is important in terms of what compact growth means and how we can achieve that in practice.  We are very engaged around that.  We have published toolkits for public engagement.  We sponsor the \"Eco Eye\" series and there is a programme airing tonight on the very topic the Deputy has raised.  I would recommend it as good viewing.<\/p> <p>  This is about raising public awareness about the urgency of this issue and its connectedness to other challenges that we face as a society, whether they are climate, economic, social, mobility and so on.  We are also engaged in training programmes with elected members.  To date, we have had seven events with an eighth one coming up this Friday.  We have had hundreds of engagements with the 949 councillors the length and breadth of the country.  They tune into our monthly webinars on these very matters.  There is strong evidence of elected council members becoming much more aware around these issues and indeed understanding some of their cruxes and the trade-offs which have to be addressed in securing compact development.<\/p> <p>  To help get things moving, we will have reviews of local authorities.  We are a statutory reviewer of local authorities, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We have a pilot programme with four local authorities being reviewed this year.  We will be building up to a series of six per annum thereafter.  We will be looking closely at local authority policies and programmes regarding active land management.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised a point about local area plans being adopted and particular opportunity sites identified.  What has been the progress since the last plan adoption and moving matters forward?  We will be asking straight questions on capacity and agility.  In fairness to our local authorities, having much experience of working in them myself over recent years, they are extremely hard pressed.  They need to be supported, resourced and funded appropriately to take on these functions.

We are tight for time so I will focus on electric vehicles, EVs.  Dr. O'Mahony made some interesting comments in his opening statement.  He said that because of the deeper emissions reduction target, it is a risky and potentially costly gamble to rely on electric vehicles to meet that target.  Our target is for 950,000 EVs by 2030.  It is obvious we have not had a very good track record in rolling out EVs or the infrastructure for same.  We are still struggling on that front, with only 7.4% of new passenger sales in 2020 being EVs.  That compares with 74.8% in Norway or indeed 18.1% in Finland.  If the target of 950,000 by 2030 is not achievable, what kind of target does Dr. O'Mahony think is feasible?  What are the kind of changes the Government would need to put in place to ensure the target was met, because meeting even a significantly reduced target would be difficult at this stage?<\/p> <p>  I am also interested in Dr. O'Mahony's opinion on using EVs to meet that target and how cost-prohibitive they are.  Is there a risk there will be a whole section of our community who cannot afford to use this technology and therefore, when it comes to a just transition and ensuring everyone can play their part the cost will exclude them from that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#E00500","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":416,"content":"<p>On the achievability of the electric vehicles target, I would not say it is not possible to do it with electric vehicles - it certainly is - but it relies on a number of things.  It relies on the supply of minerals required to make the batteries being constantly available globally, including sufficient supply to manufacture the vehicles that would come to Ireland.  That is not guaranteed.  It also means we have a system that just requires more technological change overall.  That already becomes more costly.  It is the wrong approach to start at 2030.  We must always start with 2050 and with the preventative approaches of avoid and shift, only coming to improve at the end.  I would not say it is not possible, but our target in the climate action plan to move up to 936,000 electric vehicles is the same diffusion rate as Norway's.  Norway is the world leader and that has cost a lot in terms of public subvention.  If we are relying on the cost of electric vehicles coming down, we are taking a little bit of a risk that it will happen on an expected timeline.  It also embeds the other sustainability issues.<\/p> <p>  Electric vehicles cannot deal with the issue of particulate matter completely.  A total of 50% of emissions will remain because they come from tyre and break wear.  It affects cognitive development of the unborn child, mental health and cardiovascular disease.  There are a whole range of human health impacts so, again, relying on that is ceding ground to an approach to transport systems which is not sustainable.  That being said we should still do it.  We should still pursue EVs and alternative drivetrains but not prioritise them.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has hit on a really important issue of people who may not be able to afford this.  If we rely on EVs and potentially on retiring cars before their usual end of life and give public subvention to help people to do that - scrappage schemes and other things, that is a direct transfer of wealth from the State to people who are usually wealthier.  It leaves out people who may be on the minimum wage or may be earning less.  To provide a mobility system, not a transport system, that serves all is another reason from a just transition equity perspective to prioritise avoid and shift and not just improve in EVs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tadhg O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Mr. Murphy may wish to address that question as well as it is relevant to his area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#E00700","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":418,"content":"<p>Fundamentally, the next ten years will be extremely different from the past ten years where the deployment of EVs is concerned.  The primary reason is that the range of cars available in a showroom and their prices are largely decided by EU legislation.  This legislation forces manufacturers to lower the CO2 produced by those vehicles and therefore puts more electric vehicles on the road.  In the last quarter of 2019 and 2020 there was an uptick in sales of EVs in Ireland.  They were offered at lower rates to encourage uptake.  On the issue of cost, those who have bet against the cost of EVs declining have lost every time.  Batteries have reduced in price by 85% in the past decade and have decreased by 17% in the last year alone.  Batteries are one third of the cost of electric vehicles.  Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which is among the most optimistic about the cost of EVs, upgraded its forecast for price parity between EVs and internal combustion vehicles to between 2023 and 2025.  EVs are cheaper to produce, maintain and power.<\/p> <p>  The next ten years will be very different.  People point to Norway and say we will need Norway-type subsidies to ensure the deployment of EVs but that is not necessarily the case.  If they are going to become this cheap, they can be deployed.  However, I would stress, and this is very evident in yesterday's figures on the sale of EVs of Ireland, that there is a big difference between battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.  The Irish taxation regime needs to be amended to reflect some misleading figures by manufacturers and the European legislation needs to be amended to fix some of the loopholes which are emerging with EVs.  Targets for Ireland refer to zero or low-emissions vehicles.  We need to drop the reference to low-emissions vehicles and just go all in on zero-emissions ones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I thank the contributors today.

I wish to address specifically a project near me which the contributors may be familiar with, which is the Galway ring road.  One of the arguments there is that it would increase emissions by 37%.  Electric vehicles address some of that issue.  Dr. O'Mahony talked about urban sprawl and the increased travel distance.  In some parts of that proposal, it would increase what is a 5.5 km journey to 22 km.

It is ten years since I left Galway but when I last lived there, the outer bypass was a major issue and it is still being debated.  I remember reading the impact assessment for the proposed bypass ten years ago.  The evidence then was pretty clear that building the road would cause more cars to be used in Galway and would make the city more car dependent.  Is our vision to have electric buses stuck in traffic behind electric cars?  That is what we will get if we pursue both the electrification of vehicles and the construction of more roads.  When we talk about the electrification of cars, we always talk about Norway and how great it is but we should look at what Oslo is doing.  Oslo as a city is being very aggressive in getting cars out of the city.  It has been closing streets to cars and removing on-street car parking.  Supporting the electrification of vehicles is not the same as supporting endless road building.<\/p> <p>  To touch on the mineral issues which were raised by Deputy Whitmore, there is a problem with the minerals used in battery production.  Last December the EU proposed the world's first law to regulate the mineral content of batteries, including enforcing social conditions for extraction and recycling targets for some of those minerals.  Obviously, the more vehicles we have to produce, the more challenging it is to ensure that production is done sustainably.

Instead of taking the possible expansion of rail off the table, we should look at it.  Just because we look at an option does not mean that we go down the road of taking it.

It is important to remember that as with local authority development plans, the national planning framework is a cyclical plan that will have to be reviewed or revisited by the Government in conjunction with all stakeholders on a regular basis.  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 established the legislative basis for the national planning framework and its renewal out into the future.  That will ultimately be a matter for the Government and the processes are laid out in the legislation, including Oireachtas scrutiny of the preparation of revisions to the national planning framework.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned in my paper, a very important starting point would be the compilation of a national brownfield land register or database.  As it stands, with regard to the laudable objective of 30% for villages, 50% for cities and 40% in overall urban terms, it is actually very hard for us to monitor the effectiveness of development plans in a very precise way.  It is very important that we start down the road of having those strong objectives in planning frameworks but the measurement of it, in terms of how it is actually being achieved on the ground, is still somewhat uncertain.  That is an issue that we are continuing to research and to engage on with our parent department and the local authorities more generally.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to the Senator's point about tweaking the framework while taking on board the latest scientific evidence and the evolving climate action objectives, that will naturally come in the round in terms of the evolution of the national planning framework.  We need to think through the unintended consequences of having extremely ambitious targets for brownfield development without considering the deliverability and affordability of same.  As Deputy Farrell mentioned earlier, in many cases local authority development plans will include brownfield regeneration sites and yet members will see, some years later, that progress towards getting those activated is slow.  The effectiveness of our vacant and derelict sites legislation is an issue.  The mechanisms and the tools that are available to local authorities to get brownfield development sites into production so that they provide sustainable, high-quality and affordable options for people are very important.

There may be a risk of a false dichotomy being created between electrification versus compact development.  The reality is that we need both.  In terms of compact development, at best 1% of our housing stock is built each year.  We would like to be at 2% but that is still a small proportion that will be delivered by 2030.  Obviously, as Dr. O'Mahony said, by 2050 the number will be bigger and will have much more impact.  Our entire car fleet will change over the next decade so there is an opportunity to have a significant influence on the fleet that is purchased over that period.  That will have an immediate impact.  Dr. Murphy is right that electrification is an available and usable option.  We must bear in mind that 90% of journeys over 8 km in Ireland are driven journeys and it is difficult to replace a lot of them with public transport, no matter how ambitious we become.  We have an immediate problem as well as a long-term one.<\/p> <p>  As we move from the climate action plan, which was built around a 30% target, to a 51% target, what changes would the witnesses propose we make to that climate plan?  In that context, how do we measure the cost-effectiveness of interventions?  I speak from experience with the national broadband plan, which was expensive but, in my view, absolutely essential.  I found it very difficult to get public support for that within the system because the tendency is to look at the short-term costs.  How do we deal with the issue of the choices that have long-term benefits but high short-term costs?<\/p><p>How important do the witnesses believe pricing is in achieving the objectives of transition?  Carbon pricing has its supporters and its opponents.  I refer to road pricing.  How important will they be as we move towards the 2050 target?<\/p><p> My final question relates to compact development.  Do we need to move to some sort of planning gain model whereby communities in which high density development is taking place get something back?  Do we need to see deeper integration of the local development plan with the national plan?

We can improve the climate action plan through more focus on freight.  It is suggested that there are no low-emission freight vehicles in the climate action plan but technology has changed rapidly in two years.<\/p> <p>  In terms of cost-benefit, I would drop the increase in the biofuel lending rate.  If we look at where we are getting the ethanol from and the competition we have with land, the most recent National Oil Reserves Agency report on the sourcing of biofuels in Ireland, be they advanced biodiesel or bioethanol, raises some flags regarding origins of such fuels.<\/p> <p>  On where else we can increase ambition, the T&aacute;naiste has launched his working-from-home proposal, which will study the potential benefits of working from home.  We should await that study but that is another obvious way to increase ambition.<\/p> <p>  Carbon pricing is not the most effective way of reducing transport emissions because the consumer is forced into a particular model and if the price goes up, he or she is not necessarily able to then switch out to a different model.  The Deputy mentioned that carbon pricing has supporters and opponents.  The big supporters of carbon pricing are car manufacturers who would rather shift the burden onto the consumers and individuals as a way of having to do less themselves.  We think of car standards at European level.  Carbon pricing always involves a social equity issue.  If there are ways to address the social equity issue but there will not be a big climate benefit from engaging in carbon pricing why go to the hassle of the potential risk of social inequity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Does Dr. O'Mahony want to go next?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#G00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Yes.  I will try to be brief.  On the climate action plan, in terms of short-term actions progress has already been made on spending almost &euro;1 million per day on cycling and walking.  That needs to be embedded further.  In addition, demand management and the result of the pandemic in terms of working from home, as Mr. Murphy mentioned, is very important.  It is important because it has been acknowledged internationally that looking at 2030 is not the right way forward.  We need to look at 2050 and look at 2030 and 2040 as the way-posts to decarbonisation.  To do that, we will need better evidence of what we can do with avoid and shift.  The estimates in the literature vary from a 20% to 50% reduction in emissions in terms of avoid and shift.  There is potential that that will be higher in Ireland because our population growth is estimated and it is the higher population projection of 6.7 million.  That could be higher.  We do not know.  We do not have the evidence.<\/p> <p>  In terms of cost-effectiveness analysis, relying only on such an analysis is not appropriate to understanding systemic transformations.  It gives one the results and the implications in terms of the cost per unit carbon that is reduced but it does not answer any of the equity questions.  It usually involves a forecast rather than alternative scenarios that explore avoid and shift so it is necessary but not sufficient.<\/p> <p>  In terms of pricing, I agree with Mr. Murphy.  There is a conclusion in the literature that pricing is not enough.  Carbon pricing is a supplemental measure that can prevent rebounds if the price of fuel comes down but the conclusions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its transport chapter were very clear.  We need to do the systemic long-term changes, with 2030 and 2040 changes supporting that, and carbon pricing can assist.  It is not one's first measure no more than electric vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tadhg O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Mahony.

That is important to address.<br\/><br\/>Pricing is very important in terms of shifting behaviour.  In terms of the way we build housing currently, the cost on the development side in respect of greenfield land can be much lower than in an urban or brownfield context, even though, in a greenfield context, it costs the State and the taxpayer a lot more to service it from an infrastructural perspective.  Brownfield locations very often having access to existing infrastructure.  Pricing and the price of land and how we get that shift towards brownfield development are important instruments.<br\/><br\/>With regard to compact development, I agree absolutely with the Deputy that community benefit and, indeed, development contribution schemes are mechanisms in the planning Acts that could be used more in the context of ensuring that local communities see the benefit from the regeneration of their areas.

I ask him to speak to his powers of enforcement or the opportunity to improve the policy or regulatory or legislative tools available to deliver on the national planning framework or the compact proposals.

He touched on the national brownfield and infill development land register, the Land Development Agency Bill, the vacant and derelict sites legislation and also the dispatch of litigation.  He might comment on those matters.<\/p> <p>  Finally, will he expand on the point in terms of renewable energy?

We are using discount rates that are very high for a wealthy country.  What that means in terms of an actual cost benefit analysis is that it will devalue the benefit of a mitigation project, which is something that improves a situation and reduces emissions, and also devalue the cost of a project such as a road that increases emissions.

Regarding our powers of enforcement, the way the legislation works is that we independently assess the plans of the local authorities by reference to the requirements of the legislation, the national planning framework regional and spatial economic strategies, and various guidelines and policies set out by the Minister and the Government that are relevant to planning.  At a strategic level we determine the fit between what the local authorities set out in their plans and that broader context.  If we feel they are broadly up to the mark, we will support those plans.  If we feel there are gaps or breaches of that regulatory and policy framework, we will set that out in our statutory observations, which include recommendations and which effectively have to be followed through, and other observations, which may cover more detailed points.  If the local authority does not follow our recommendations, we have the option to recommend to the Minister the use of his or her power under section 31 of the Act to direct the local authority to take such steps as are necessary to close that policy breach.  That is just how the enforcement process works.  As for some of the references in my statement to, for example, the brownfield register and some of the other areas such as that, we are engaged in research programmes and in constant dialogue with our parent Department and local authorities on how that can be done, particularly regarding the use of cutting-edge geographic information systems, GIS, and we have some ideas about that.<\/p> <p>  Yes, it is very important to progress the wind energy guidelines.  From constant engagement with both the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I understand that is a top priority, and I think that will be seen before too long.  The addition of the roadmap in terms of how the RES-E targets will be delivered and the relevance of that at a local authority level also create the opportunity for community participation in some of those projects.

I think many people who choose, in effect, the rural settlement option are often very interested in the option of being able to locate in a smaller town or village, particularly if self-build site options etc. are available at modest cost with the infrastructure laid out.  Going back to our public awareness brief, we raised this in our sponsorship of one of the \"Eco Eye\" series which looked at this very topic and how some local authorities, especially Tipperary County Council, have been very proactive in this space.

I will try to get through them as quickly as possible.  The first is to Dr. O'Mahony.  In his opening statement I think one of the very first sentences concerned the decommissioning of our rail system throughout the 20th century.  Part of that happened where I am from.  I am from west Cork and I represent Cork South-West.  There was the west Cork railway, as it was called.  It went from Cork through to Bandon and Enniskeane and on to Bantry and extended right out to the west, with branches off to Clonakilty, Courtmacsherry and other areas.  It must have been an amazing thing to witness.  However, if I were to stand up in the D&aacute;il tomorrow and call for a return of the west Cork railway and ask for it to be rebuilt, I would be laughed out of the Chamber.  A lot of the old rail lines - in this instance almost 100% - have been taken back into farmland, so the process of starting up a project such as this would be described as pie in the sky by many.  My question for Dr. O'Mahony is this: how do we get to a point where this becomes a more real conversation that is not one of dreams and unachievable aspirations but one that may be achieved?  As he has rightly stated, we have a road network but the N71 is not fit for purpose.  In non-Covid times it is absolutely logjammed because of the amount of vehicular traffic on it.  A railway would go a long way towards relieving that pressure and reducing carbon emissions.  What is the best approach in that regard that would make this a more realistic proposal?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Dr. O'Mahony as well.  He mentioned roads and road building, but would he not agree that certain road infrastructure does have a place in terms of the vibrancy of our towns and villages?  Mr. Cussen spoke a lot about \"Eco Eye\".  It recently featured a piece on Clonakilty and how it was held up as a model for how things should be done in terms of public realm works and giving people back public spaces.

That is a really important question.<\/p> <p>  I have one more question for Dr. O'Mahony about schools.  The busiest time in most of our towns and villages is school time, when there is mayhem and traffic runs.  Can public transport play a role, even within our smaller towns of 5,000 or 6,000 people, in the form of pickups in different estates to take that volume of traffic away from towns?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#H01000","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":452,"content":"<p>The rail question is an interesting one.  It is a reflection of where we are that it sounds outlandish to propose something that could be hugely beneficial to the public good.  That is because we have essentially run down the system for decades upon decades, and it is now almost a cultural thing that it is not regarded as a viable option.  I would suggest that in the climate action plan we need to see a commitment to a study on transformation of spatial planning and of mobility to see what is plausible and to see all the implications and costs.  Then a politician can make a claim of a desirable policy without it being pie in the sky because there is some evidence and analysis to back it up.<\/p><p>It is very important that in the next climate action plan we look not just at short-term measures but also at really improving our evidence base.<\/p><p> Of course roads have a role.

I am old enough to remember when I used to always walk and cycle, partly because there were fewer cars on the road.  It is also important to think of how we would look at active modes, which are good for children's health, whereby we have segregated cycle lanes in all towns that children can use to get to school and then also look at the public transport options.

As a representative of an urban area, I want to ask Dr. O'Mahony and Mr. Murphy about the Dublin bikes scheme, which was referenced in the opening remarks.  It has been a great success and it has provided that shift.  Unfortunately for the region of Dublin, there has not been a bike sharing scheme to cover the entire area.  This presents limitations to the benefits one can enjoy from this type of scheme.

I thank him for his opening statement and remarks.  With regard to the guide to the planning process and the document he gave to us in advance of this meeting, I compliment his office on the information that has been given to the public about the planning process.  The new leaflets are very beneficial and I compliment everyone involved.  In saying this, recently we have witnessed a large volume of strategic housing developments, which I hope will come to an end quite shortly.  Mr. Cussen spoke about sustainable planning.

Taking in context the role of the regional assembly, and of the councils with regard to the climate action plans that each local authority is working through, what is Mr. Cussen's view of how we could reform or strengthen their role in all of this?  At times, local authorities, particularly in Dublin, have their own individual climate action plans and on top of all of this is a regional strategy.

Specifically on the Dublin bikes scheme and car sharing, car sharing has usually been private so local authorities can assist in support of it but in practice it has been more private.  The Dublin bikes scheme is a little bit different from the schemes in other European countries because we have basically required it to pay for itself.  If we look at the emissions reduction per euro spent on it, it is very low.  It has all sorts of public good benefits because cars are taken off the road and public health is improved.  It is a very cheap way of getting around.  I was quite sceptical of it at the time.  I remember people saying they expected the bikes to end up in the Grand Canal.  It has been fantastically successful and must be applauded, and it needs to be extended.<\/p> <p>  Many of these measures, and this is also true of rail, and Mr. Cussen mentioned serviced sites and achieving compact growth, have a cost element.  We need to look at what these potential costs are and come up with innovative arrangements to finance them.  Finance is very important and was given a section of the transport chapter of the EPA's report.  I agree with the Deputy 100% that we should be looking at regionalising a bike share scheme and pushing car share schemes.  They are very sensible measures that do not have a huge financial or fiscal footprint but in some cases we may need to look at whether it is possible to give more public subvention or whether we can look at innovative financing arrangements.  It is also important that there is leadership from politicians to push and say that it is hugely beneficial to the public good and that they want it for the people of wider Dublin, Limerick or Cork.   We must ask whether we can push this through, such as through drawing down new funding to support walking and cycling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tadhg O'Mahony"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I am delighted that Deputy Devlin found our guides helpful.  That is great feedback and I appreciate it.  I will pass it on to the team.  We hope to do a lot more on this, including videos.  We will do further leaflets.  Many ordinary people often find it somewhat difficult to understand or fathom the workings of the planning process.  What we want to try to do in terms of our public awareness is to dispel some of those myths and put better information into the public's hands on how they can really influence the planning process.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a number of questions.  It is fair to say the strategic housing development process has put all the various strands, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the local authorities, under a lot of pressure, particularly in terms of resources.  Perhaps it was an initiative to jump start the assembly of planning consents, which had almost completely withered away after the banking crash.  As the Government has clearly signalled, it will run its course in the very near future.  This may allow some reorganisation of resources.  To this point, the Deputy mentioned the regional assemblies.  Certainly they have more potential in delivering a shared service or a collective approach in co-ordinating the work of local authorities.  There is some evidence of this already happening through the climate action regional offices, which, in effect, work across a number of local authorities.  There is certainly a very strong case for more on this, as is referenced in my statement.<\/p> <p>  To clarify one point on the brownfield register, it is something for the Government to progress.

This means reducing a lot of congestion and reducing the amount of air pollution that comes from freight, which is powered by compressed natural gas.  It also means looking at the issue of night flights in Dublin airport, which are under consideration, and the impact they will have on people living in these urban areas.<\/p> <p>  On the point on rolling out rail, we should always analyse various scenarios of what might be beneficial in terms of the climate benefit and the benefit to the Exchequer.  As I understand it, Irish Rail has an ambitious plan to expand many suburban connections throughout the country.  They need to be pursued as quickly as possible.  We also have the need to roll out charging infrastructure as quickly as possible, particularly to decarbonise freight which, as I said, cannot be switched to public transport.<\/p><p>An additional level of investment in expanding rural rail should be examined but we should be prepared to not like the answer much if it comes back that electrification of the car fleet is cheaper.

On overall strategy and thinking, has there been examination of the general outlook as a result of the pandemic?  Anecdotally, there is a suggestion that people want to live in less densely populated areas.  According to the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, people seem to want to move from the more densely populated urban areas to more rural areas.

It seems to me, from talking to local authority members, that they are now starting to realise the implications for them and for the work they have to do.  Can Mr. Cussen give the committee some measurement of where they are at in terms of their acceptance of it or otherwise?  Notwithstanding what we have to do on the transport side, there are real concerns - returning to Dr. O'Mahony's point on the quality of life issue for people, which is what we need to be about and should be the central focus - about what those homes of the future will look like.  <\/p> <p>  The witnesses should comment on the lack of willingness by local authorities to invest more heavily in addressing the dereliction that exists in rural villages and towns.  I see local authorities across the country which would much rather buy a site on the edge of a village or town and build 20 or 25 local authority houses - this is not coming from private investors, but local authorities - rather than looking through each village and realising that there are 35 or maybe 40 derelict buildings that could be brought back to use.

There have often been up to 200 members tuning in on webinars and staying for the duration of the two hours or two and a half hours.  There is certainly an appetite out there.  It is an appetite that one can find articulated more among the urban members and younger members, that is, some of the newer entrants into the ranks of local government members.  There are 949 councillors and in the last local election in 2019, there was a turnover of just over a third.  There is a section among the members which is still coming to grips with this and trying to work through its implications.  I am strongly of the view, however, that the continued rolling out of our training programme, as well as that of the climate action regional offices, which is under way at present, is crucial in reaching out to each and every member.  The last analysis by the Association of Irish Local Government, which represents councillors across the country, showed that in some local authority chambers, there is participation by up to 80% of members in at least one of our training sessions.  These are positive indicators of the level of engagement but we have a lot of progress to make, particularly in respect of understanding some of the practical issues the Senator raised.  That sense of a lack of willingness by local authorities to tackle dereliction goes to the very heart of the matter.  There is criticism of the slow pace of progress in the housing capital programme but when one looks more closely at some of the questions which the parent Department often asks of local authorities about why they are progressing in a particular way, it can be because the Department is raising the very point the Senator has raised.  Sometimes, the questions that come down from the centre to the local authorities, as a means to perhaps try a bit harder, are sometimes taken as criticism of the four-stage housing programme.  However, there are some local authorities which are very proactive in this space.  Members should consider Monaghan County Council and the Dublin Street regeneration in Monaghan town.  That is a local authority that really has started to look much more assertively at how it can itself be an agent of regeneration and renewal in its towns.  That is something about which our reviews programme will examine and disseminate a broader awareness across the sector.  The Senator also raised an important point about quality of life and what the villages and towns of the future could and should look like.  Some of the media pieces we sponsored are trying to highlight that.  We will do more work on that and I will be very happy to follow up with the committee on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>We would appreciate that, I thank Mr. Cussen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#K00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Senator Dooley has pointed to some very interesting issues.

We need to consider how the cores of villages can provide all the services, potential employment opportunities and provide affordable housing and affordable rents.  These are the big issues that we need to deal with to get a handle on this because otherwise, we will feel as though we are taking things away from people.

I know Mr. Cussen only has an oversight role.  The planners in Kildare County Council were interested in this as well.  When we are planning cities and villages, we should not hand all of the power to developers.  Local authorities could plan how a town or city is going to expand and ensure every road goes somewhere.  We are trying to introduce permeability into estates, but no estate wants to have a breakthrough.  They do not want lanes and so on.  I appreciate that Mr. Cussen has an oversight facility and I know there are difficulties in terms of joined-up thinking.

Those figures come from the national travel survey from the CSO.<\/p> <p>  The points the Deputy has raised are important in respect of how residential areas are laid out.  As somebody who is familiar with the north Kildare area and the issues she has raised, I can also point to examples of sophisticated thinking about permeability, the provision of pedestrian access and creating shorter routes to walk children to school rather than a family member feeling he or she has to drive because it is the only way round.  I know of places where that was achieved, permitted, approved and developed.  As soon as such places opened up, things became very contentious.  They are sometimes politically contentious issues. <\/p> <p>  It is important that the political process shows leadership at local and national level on how things are connected.

We have discussed our current model.  We can sum it up by pointing out that we import most of our energy from abroad for our transport system and we concentrate most of our employment in big cities.  If we do things right in transforming our transport system, we will be able to upend that in two ways.  First, we can move a lot more manufacturing, even for batteries, to Ireland.  Science Foundation Ireland is sponsoring some exciting work via Advanced Materials and BioEngineering Research, AMBER.  Battery factories are opening up in other parts of Europe that previously lost employment.  We should be targeting that in Ireland.  Second, we will have an abundant amount of renewable electricity in Ireland.  From 2030 onwards, the SEAI suggests that we will have more than enough for what we need in Ireland.  It is not inconceivable that from the 2030s onwards we can produce zero-emission jet and shipping fuels in Ireland.  That can take place in areas around the Shannon which have had low employment in recent years.  This is what we should be looking for when we talk about transforming our economy and transport system, and doing both together.  This can be a powerful driver of employment across Ireland.  In our next economic recovery, we should always prioritise a model which disperses employment across Ireland as much as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#L00600","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.  I thank the witnesses for their brilliant contributions . Most of my questions are for Mr. Murphy.  He referred to Scania and its move away from fuels towards electric freight, and the fact that the EU has a new hydrogen strategy.  From an Irish perspective, should we consider hydrogen from an energy storage basis rather than for freight, rail or anything like that?  Would it be misguided to go down that road?<\/p> <p>  I refer to shared mobility services.  As someone who spent a lot of time in Brussels and Europe for five years, I realised that one can get from a train to a bus and park one's bike.  One of the issues in Ireland is that we do not have a joined-up approach.  In Ghent or Leuven one will see hundreds of bikes.  People are able to cycle to a point and then get a train to the city to go to work.  We always hear that cities like Dublin are very old.  There are lots of older cities in Europe that have such schemes.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Murphy could give us some examples of cities which have done shared mobility really well.  Even though we have a history of one-off developments, perhaps people can drive a car to a point and park and then get public transport or live close enough to work to be able to cycle.

We should ramp up it up.  Green hydrogen should be produced from excess renewables in Ireland.  The question is where we put hydrogen once it has been produced.  I am not an expert on electricity grids or heating.  There is a role there.<\/p> <p>  In terms of transport, it does not make sense in cars and vehicles.  It is too expensive - it is more costly than batteries.  It makes a lot of sense in shipping and aviation because those modes of transport do not have low-carbon alternatives.  One cannot put a battery in a plane because it would be too heavy.  Likewise, they are too heavy for ships.  We are an island, and rely on shipping and aviation to remain connected.  We are an island which can have abundant offshore wind.<\/p> <p>  Other European countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands, are moving ahead with a hydrogen strategy which is producing fuels for their shipping and aviation sectors.  I wonder why we are not doing that in Ireland.  As I understand it, the programme for Government has a commitment to a hydrogen strategy.  It is very important that this is set up.  It is important that we are incredibly optimistic about the employment potential that can bring to all parts of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's final point on shared mobility, it comes back to not seeing this as a case of public transport versus private cars.  There is a grey space in between where, as she said, there is shared mobility.  Twenty years ago, we did not have the option of using an app or a website to book time in private cars and book cars in advance.  It is now possible to do so.  The International Transport Forum said two years ago that Dublin can meet most of its mobility needs with 2% private car ownership.  We can be a lot more exciting.<\/p> <p>  I share the Senator's enthusiasm for how Brussels has evolved over the years.  There are ample examples of such development around Brussels.

We often call it the first, last or only mile because it links up directly with public transport.  With regard to the examples of Vienna, Copenhagen and Amsterdam, there are lots of more established cities as well.  The sustainable urban mobility plan process can be used to really empower that kind of positive change.  It comes back to an issue to which Deputy Cronin referred a moment ago.  Is it something that is not relevant or possible now?  Transformation is fundamentally about thinking about how we get to desirable outcomes.  It is not about predict and provide or saying there is a problem and let us react to it.  We need to think long term, have 2030 to 2040 as the way-post to that and then consider how we can really ramp up walking and cycling and how one links that with public transport, which was also mentioned by Mr. Murphy, because public transport can facilitate walking and cycling and <i>vice versa<\/i>.

Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan said earlier that if he stood up in the D&aacute;il and called for the reinstatement of the west Cork railway, he would be scoffed at.  I would applaud him because I think that is the future, particularly for long-term planning and freight.  We have so many trucks on our roads - dirty, big, smelly and dangerous vehicles that go up and down our roads all the time.  Back in the day, everything from coal to Guinness was transported on trains but we hardly use them for freight today.  We must think about this.  As one of the witnesses noted, we should look at financing freight and transport by railway and price and study it.  This is really important.  I do not think we should frame this as a question of whether railway is better than electric cars.  That is the wrong way to go because what we are looking at here is not just managing costs but the price we will pay if we do not get it right in terms of climate chaos.

Since public transport is free and frequent and people can use it conveniently, they use it both with their bicycles and when they are walking.  They get on and off it.  This is removing cars from the roads.  To come back to cost, whatever we would pay to introduce that would be worth it given the outcome.

It is the political process that needs to make those value-based decisions after we have appropriate analysis that can inform it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tadhg O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Does Senator Higgins wish to contribute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#M01000","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Yes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#M01100","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":485,"content":"<p>There is a total of two and a half minutes remaining so if she could squeeze her contribution into that time-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#M01200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I might ask for written answers because I would really appreciate that.  One question is on the review of the TEN-T programme - the idea of funding new projects and looking to engage with Europe on the western rail project and those kinds of large-scale projects - while another concerns land use by local authorities and how we can look more at funding.  Again, when we look at the recovery and resilience strategy, it concerns the idea of giving local authorities not just the power but the funding they need to directly develop.<\/p> <p>  My three questions are really about permeability.  When we talk about compact growth, does that need to be reimagined so it is not technical density of office buildings, empty or not, but a liveable space in our cities?  It concerns the idea of the 15-minute city, about which there were comments, and permeability in terms of better use of public rights of way.  Can public rights of way - the network of laneways in our towns and the network of connections in estates that were built before intensive car usage - be reimagined so that we are not just talking about cycling and walking on the sides of roads but around other networks in respect of walking and cycling?  Could the witnesses comment on better use of that public right of way infrastructure and the possible formalisation of that?  <\/p> <p>  Should there be better use of environmental impact assessment and social impact assessment at a much earlier stage in the planning process so that these issues get caught, we do not have a backlog later at the judicial review level and better quality decisions are made at an earlier point?  Those are the key points I wish to make.<\/p> <p>  Could the witnesses comment on the sustainable development goals, SDGs, which are now mandated in local development, specifically SDG 11 around sustainable cities and communities and how that might be one of the imperatives or mandates for change in how we approach liveable and walkable cities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#M01300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":487,"content":"<p>The Senator indicated she would be happy to receive written responses from the witnesses so if our witnesses-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#M01400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":488,"content":"<p>If they have time to comment, it would be great but I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#M01500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, I cannot allow it.

In this regard, I ask all members to confirm prior to making a contribution that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.  For those watching the meeting online, the Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.

I am accompanied in this virtual setting by: Ms Martina Mannion, assistant secretary and head of inclusion in the Department; Mr. Eamonn Murtagh, director in the planning and building unit; and Ms Shirley Kearney, acting principal officer in the school transport section.<\/p> <p>  The breadth of my responsibilities and those of the officials concerned reflect the breadth of the issues highlighted by the committee in its invitation but also, perhaps more importantly, the importance that I and my Department give to the delivery of education to children with additional needs.  As Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, I am committed to making a difference for students who have additional needs as part of an inclusive education system.  The Department has well-established structures for engaging with the partners in education and I wish to ensure that students and their families are at the heart of the education system.<\/p> <p>  I was pleased to see that the committee in its invitation referenced the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and how our education provision for children with special and additional educational needs sits with the convention.  I have no doubt that committee members will be aware that on 3 December 2020, International Day of Persons with Disabilities, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, published a consultation draft of Ireland's first report to the UN under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  There are education-specific references in the draft report regarding Article 24, which sets out the principal education content, and also, under the heading of Covid-19, responses to the education response to Covid-19 for school students with additional needs.  Submissions on the draft report can be made to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth until 3 March 2021.  With just a week to go until that deadline, I encourage all those with an interest in this area to offer their views and perspectives.  The report will then be finalised and submitted to the United Nations committee for the convention.<\/p> <p>  In recent weeks, my Department has provide this committee with several submissions in response to its request for regular briefings.  I am, of course, always happy to facilitate this and my officials will continue with this briefing until we see a full return to school for all students.  Of course, the reopening of schools remains a priority for my Department.  The first steps in the phased return of schools took place on 11 February, with special schools reopening on a 50% basis.  This was followed yesterday by the return of children in special classes at both primary and post-primary levels, comprising approximately 10,300 pupils.  This is a significant and welcome development which saw more than one third of primary schools and a quarter of all post-primary schools open for children with special education needs in special classes.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Foley, and I are committed to the full and safe return and sustained reopening of all schools at the earliest opportunity and we are working tirelessly with stakeholders and public health officials to make this happen.  As the committee is aware, the Government is currently finalising the living with Covid plan which will place children's education at the core of our priorities.  It is essential that, as a society, we continue to make progress in curbing the spread of the disease in order to allow all children to return to school as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Foley, and I, along with all in the Government and our officials, know that the return to classrooms for students with additional needs and their families is much more than just a return to learning.  We know that some families will still have concerns about the return, and so too will school staff, but all of the decisions made by the Government since last March have been about achieving a balance between the overarching aim of protecting the health of our people and the need, among other things, to deliver services such as education in the most appropriate way for all students.  We may not always agree in politics, but I know Deputies and Senators across both Houses share the objective of wanting to see our country emerge from Covid-19 restrictions successfully and as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  The Government has prioritised the provision of education and, specifically, in-class provision.  This prioritisation was not just in terms of funding the return to school last autumn, but also in strengthening school support teams following the October mid-term break to ensure schools remained open during level 5 restrictions up to the Christmas break, as well as issuing revised guidance to schools prior to Christmas in terms of supporting remote teaching and learning.  The intensive engagement with the education partners since January, when it was not possible to return to school, demonstrates the desire of the Government to see all students return to their classrooms at the earliest opportunity.  The decision last week in respect of the leaving certificate and the fact that school-related construction has been able to continue, which will ensure crucial additional capacity will be available for the new school year, are practical demonstrations of the priority and commitment this Government gives to education.<\/p> <p>  While ensuring that the return to in-school learning for pupils with special educational needs, SEN, can happen as quickly as possible in recognition of the fact that such pupils may find it more difficult to engage in remote learning, my Department has also put in place a supplementary support scheme to provide for home-based, one-to-one support for such pupils.  In addition, I am committed to supporting an enhanced summer programme for children with SEN in summer 2021 that is as successful as the programme provided last year.  It provided a strong basis to support students on their return to in-school learning in September 2020 following the long summer break.  It also allowed schools and educationalists to target learning loss in their students in a way that made the transition back to school easier for these students and their families.<\/p><p>Since my appointment, we have successfully run that expanded summer provision programme, secured a record budget of &euro;2 billion for special education, provided the resources for the creation of 1,200 additional special class places this year, and worked to put special education first as part of our school reopening.<\/p><p> Challenges remain and I am determined to tackle them.  The committee has highlighted a range of issues on which it would like to focus today.  My officials and I are happy to hear, at first hand, members' perspectives on these issues and to provide updates or further information where we can.  The fully remote nature of today's session is a first for me, so I hope we can work together to make the best use of our time.  I apologise in advance for any technical limitations, although I hope there will not be any.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#B00200","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I wish to raise two issues with the Minister of State and hope to have an opportunity before the end of the meeting to discuss them with her.

Over the past 48 hours in particular but throughout recent months, we have received emails that share how difficult it is for parents at home to cope with children with special educational needs.  There has been a cycle of expectation whereby children were going back to school and then not going back to school, and that has been a difficulty.  I am delighted, therefore, that the Government concluded its negotiations in this regard yesterday.<\/p> <p>  For children, there have been both setbacks to their development and regression.  It is difficult to read about children self-harming or engaging in aggressive behaviour, let alone to experience it as a parent.  One of the emails to which I refer cites an example of photographs of the child at school having to be put away because it was just too traumatic for the child to look at them.  Next week will see the return to mainstream schools of children from junior infants to second class.  Ideally, we would have a timeline of when we can expect the same for those in third class to sixth class.  Could they be brought back in order that there could be special education provision for third class to sixth class in mainstream schools?<\/p> <p>  Finally, the 50% capacity has been difficult for parents to manage.

It has been extremely difficult for them and we can all share that concern.  I appreciate the Senator's acknowledgement that children in special classes, a total of 10,300, returned to school yesterday.  It was not before time but they have got back and that is a positive development.  The Senator mentioned that special schools are at 50% capacity.  We want to get them back to 100% at the earliest opportunity.  While I am not a member of the Cabinet and cannot make those decisions, I imagine that will happen in early March, although no decision on that has yet been made.  I hope that will be the case.  Further light may emerge following the Cabinet meeting later; that remains to be seen.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime, it is important that we try to look after children with special educational needs, SEN, who are in mainstream classes.  The Senator mentioned junior infants, senior infants, first class and second class.  Children with SEN within those class groups will return to in-person learning next week but there is a cohort of children who will fall outside that.  She referred in that context to third class, fourth class, fifth class and sixth class.  Again, I am not in a position to give any definitive information on when those classes will return but we hope it will be sooner rather than later, and there may be some clarity on that later from the Cabinet.  Suffice to say, the industrial relations team within the Department, under the remit of the Minister, has been in continuous engagement with our education partners, namely, parents, schools, boards of management and the unions.  One of the priorities of the Government since the outset of the pandemic has been that children with special needs will get back to school as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#C00400","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Last year, there was a programme of supports over the summer.

Regression has really adverse consequences for children with special needs and the summer provision is a way for them to reintegrate into a school environment.  Last year, in line with the criteria we used, pupils included those with a diagnosis of autism or of severe and profound learning difficulties, those who were in a special school or special class, those who were transitioning into a special class from early years settings to primary school, those in primary school mainstream classes who presented with Down's syndrome or who were severely hard of hearing or had a severe visual impairment, those who had a moderate general learning difficulty and those with severe emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Approximately 24,000 children were eligible for the scheme and it was its most successful year ever.  It is crucial that it go ahead this year, and it will do so.

As a parent of a child with special needs, I have the personal experience that has led many constituents in my county of Clare to reach out to me.

I appreciate that there have been many challenges in this sector, not least in the context of the reopening of schools.<\/p> <p>  My questions relate to the cohort of special educational needs students who still have not returned to school.  The issue was mentioned in regard to those who are in mainstream school but who are not in special classes.  I had been seeking a little more clarity on that but the Minister of State said she is not sure at this time and that the issue is involved in the review.<\/p><p>I want to ask specifically about meetings the Minister of State may have had with unions representing special needs assistants, SNAs, between June and December 2020.  For example, can she outline how many meetings took place between June and December 2020?

Is there provision there should the case numbers increase again?<\/p><p> My other question concerns supporting therapists in the school inclusion model and the delivery of wraparound supports mentioned by the Minister of State in the briefing document.  Specifically, it concerns speech and language therapists who have been reassigned to other duties, including contact tracing and testing.

Can she outline how the challenge arising from this reassignment will be dealt with?<\/p><p> Following on from that, regressional behaviour has already been mentioned.

I hope that I have taken a note of all of them but if I have not, she can come back to me later.  There were quite a few there.<\/p> <p>  First, on contingency planning for the future, since the beginning of the pandemic there has been and is consistent engagement with our education partners at all times, including teacher and SNA unions.  The Department's actions are always guided by public health advice and obviously from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC.  The Department of Education is a member of the Government task force on emergency planning.  It is also a member of the national emergency co-ordination group, which is the central Government platform for emergencies.  That puts it into context.<\/p> <p>  There are structures in place for remote learning.  However, it is important to acknowledge, as we all would, that for some students, nothing can replace in-person, in-school education.  That goes without saying.  The Deputy mentioned regression.  One area at which the Department is looking consistently is a post-Covid world and trying to deal with the regression that students have suffered.  Obviously, the summer provision will help students with special educational needs, SEN, in particular.  None of us can escape the fact that many students have suffered adversely in the pandemic.  It is an issue the Department is looking at consistently to see if there is something we can do about it.<\/p> <p>  On the school inclusion model, we are looking at a wraparound service and a tailored therapeutic support.  It will involve occupational and speech and language therapists, as well as behaviour and crisis practitioners.  It will revolutionise the process for children with special needs within the school environment.  We have secured funding of &euro;2 million for the service this year, and we hope to expand it to two community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas.  The pilot was based in CHO 7, covering south-west Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  There is funding in place to secure 80 speech and language and occupational therapists and 30 educational psychologists.  We are not going to step on the toes of the HSE in any way and we are working with the HSE at the moment.  This wraparound service is not in lieu of HSE therapy which falls under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  It is a complimentary service.  We are currently recruiting the therapists for this service.  Obviously, the process has been slowed down, to a certain degree, by Covid-19.  We must be careful that the Department and the HSE are not recruiting from the same pool of therapists.  We want to ensure that there are enough therapists for everybody.  I believe that answers most of the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#D00200","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I am in Leinster House.  Hopefully I have good coverage.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State.  I too welcome her today.  We are all particularly glad to see children with additional needs going back to school, whether it is for education, social needs, routine or inclusiveness.  It is important that we are on the right track.  That is something we need to build on.  I know we are all waiting for the living with Covid-19 plan. However, it is important to provide communication and give correct dates, and ensure that there is no confusion.  I know last time there was a bit of confusion over dates. <\/p> <p>  I welcome the dates that the Minister of State has announced today because it is important.  Originally, when the schools were ready to go back, we saw that within a few hours of the announcement of the reopening of applications, they were oversubscribed by a ratio of approximately 2:1.  As many parents and children were glad to get back into their normal routine, it is important to make sure that we have communications and that we open them as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  Some special education settings have only ten or 12 students.  It occurs to me that partial reopening was geared towards large schools and no autonomy was offered to smaller schools.  The Minister of State might come back to me on that.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to raise what I am sure is a huge issue for many of us.  Parents have contacted me about SNA allocations.  It has become a huge issue, even for children going to mainstream schools who attend an autistic spectrum disorder, ASD, unit.  At present, I am working on cases from County Carlow.  We need to make sure we have enough units.  I acknowledge this is something to which the Minister of State is committed but at present, even in my area of Carlow, there are not enough places for children who need to go to school, particularly in respect of one school.  We need to find a solution to this issue and I will provide the Minister of State details of the cases I am dealing with to see if she can help me with them.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to discuss with the Minister of State the issue of school transport, particularly in my own area.  Holy Angels Day Care Centre is a special education school in my area.  The HSE used to insure vehicles for this facility.  It would also provide help in that if something happened with the bus, for example, it would replace it.  However, this all changed in 2009.  Since then, the cost has been borne by the facility.  The cost of insurance surprised me, as it costs approximately &euro;5,000 per year to insure one of these buses.  No additional funding or supports are given.<\/p> <p>  Last year, Holy Angels had to launch a fundraising appeal to add to the Lotto funding to replace its bus.  This is unacceptable.  However, even these types of issues are not just about the actual vehicle.  Individual seating for each child, which must be replaced by the children using these buses when they grow and move on, costs more than &euro;100 per seat.  Again, that is another cost these schools simply cannot afford.  Funding for escorts for these types of transport is not covered by a section 39 grant.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of that.  During the Covid-19 pandemic in particular, schools had to employ additional escorts and funding was not provided.  My understanding is that no extra funding is now being given for escorts for these buses.  I ask the Minister of State to look at this.<\/p> <p>  The final issue is about school transport.  It is important, particularly for children who are attending mainstream schools.  Buses now pass the doors of homes with children who are in a unit in a mainstream school and who are just not getting on board.  I also the Minister of State to work on that for me.  Perhaps she could revert to me with the answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#D00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murnane O'Connor for her comments.

That is great.  It is also great to be able to ask questions today.  The matter has been discussed a lot by the D&aacute;il and in the media, but I hope the committee can bring a unique focus on rights.  The Minister of State mentioned the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities at the outset.  Inclusive education is included in the convention but unfortunately, as we all know, that right has not been met, especially since Christmas.  We are all aware that the reality is that online learning is not suitable for most students who attend special schools.  In light of that, I welcome the return of classes and schools.<\/p> <p>  Families need absolute assurance on any delays or disruptions such as those that happened in January.  I will not go into transport because Deputy Murnane O'Connor touched on it sufficiently.  It probably goes for most areas in rural Ireland but parents and support organisations in my constituency of Cork South-West are concerned about the absence of services.  For example, in my constituency, people must travel for up to two hours to access basic essential services such as speech and language therapy.  The people who are availing of the service cannot stay in a closed space for a long period, so a two-hour journey becomes much longer.  They could be travelling for an essential service that takes 20 minutes, such as speech and language therapy.<\/p> <p>  In response to a question from Deputy Wynne on the plan to revolutionise services, the Minister of State referred to speech and language therapy as one of them, but she also referred to south-west Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  Is it just in those areas?  How was that decision made?  How were the areas chosen?  At the moment it is basically a geographical lottery for services such as speech and language therapy.  How was the decision made on where the revolutionary programme would be rolled out first and last?  Is geography considered in those decisions?  I ask the Minister of State to prioritise that question and if she has time, I have a similar question about wraparound supports.  What will the roll-out be for such services in rural areas?  The Minister of State referred to recruitment for speech and language therapy.

That was only one community health organisation area.  In the budget last year, I secured money to be able to extend that to the nine community health organisation areas.  The plan is to try to roll out the programme in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked how it is decided where the next expansion will be.  Cork is a particular area of concern for the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  It is a very high-density area and there is a lack of places.  We have to do a lot of joined-up thinking there.  Cork may well be a runner but, obviously, I cannot say that.

Parents are raising a number of issues with me, one of which is contingency planning.  We had the initial lockdown last year and when the children went back there was the summer programme.  Parents are of the view that there was no contingency planning at that time for further lockdowns.  We saw this coming to the fore in January when the services were supposed to open but did not open.  Contingency planning is required in all aspects of Covid but particularly for special educational needs.  What kind of contingency planning is being done now for this year so that if another lockdown were to occur, we could see that there is a plan in place?  We have enough experience now to know what to do and how to do it.<\/p> <p>  Many parents have also told me that there has been very little real engagement with them.  While organisations may speak on behalf of parents, we find that parents themselves are not involved in the system.  At one of the first meetings of this committee, someone stated - I cannot recall who it was - that the lack of engagement by the Department on children with special needs and their parents had created a lot of problems.  That was probably last July or August.  At that time, the parents asked that this would not happen again but it seems to be happening again.<\/p> <p>  I welcome that there will be 1,200 additional school places for next year.  That is fine.  I am, however, concerned about the reassignment of staff involved in special educational needs to contact tracing.

We all agree that we do not have a reference point for this.  However, many parents are very angry because they are not being listened to.

There is weekly engagement with all of our education partners and updated guidance on remote learning.  Remote learning is not ideal but there is no choice when the child is not back in an in-person environment.  This is why we put forward the supplementary in-home provision which will provide five hours per week over a four-week period - 20 hours in total - to try to supplement that.  This can be provided at evenings and weekends, as I mentioned.<\/p> <p>  It is important to remember that the Department makes decisions with its education partners, boards of management, schools, and parents representative bodies, based on public health advice.  It is not just one person making a decision.  There are many constituent parts in the education sector and we must bring everybody on board and give everybody confidence to move forward.  Obviously, people have concerns and those concerns must be addressed.  I meet AsIAm, Down Syndrome Ireland, Inclusion Ireland, Family Carers Ireland and many parental representative bodies on an ongoing basis to make sure their voices are heard.  It was very important to me, as the very first dedicated Minister of State with responsibility for special education, that the voices of children with special needs would be heard in a way that they had not been before.  I believe they have been now.  Proof of that is the fact that the special schools and special classes are open.  Obviously there is more to do.<\/p> <p>  We spoke about regression earlier.

However difficult this has been for all of us, as public representatives, for the families of children with special needs it has been immeasurably more difficult and challenging for them.  That is what motivates all of us, even everybody on this committee, so that we can be a voice for them.<\/p> <p>  I referred earlier to timelines and deadlines.  What I can say about special schools, and obviously subject to the Cabinet making a decision on it later, it is likely that they will move to 100% in early March.  That seems to be the indication but I add the caveat that it is a decision that the Cabinet must make.<\/p> <p>  On section 37A, we wrote to 39 schools last June and 14 of them were withdrawn on the basis that there was consideration of their representations, submissions and there were on-site inspections.  Those 14 schools would not have been taken off the list unless there were very extenuating valid and exceptional reasons that they could not facilitate a special class.  The schools often genuinely do not have the space, particularly in high-density areas.  Ten schools remained and they have received a third notice that was issued on 14 December of last year.<\/p> <p>  Since the introduction of section 37, 21 additional special class cases have been confirmed and there is a potential for another 66 special class cases by September 2021.  For the first time I secured a specific commitment from the building and planning unit of my Department, when I was recently appointed, concerning every new school.  Sometimes I think that the significance of this has not got the attention that it should because it is a really big decision that the Department made, and the right decision.  One might ask why was the decision not made before but at least it has been made.  I secured that every school from now on will have special facilities and special education needs, SEN, rooms unless local circumstances dictate otherwise and that there is no need.  That is a really big commitment because we want to get out of a situation where we are perennially trying to scramble for special class places.  The forecasting model will help as well.  As the Deputy will know, we announced the opening of Scoil Colm in Crumlin that will help towards the development of special schools as opposed to special classes.

I refer to a ten-year-old in an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit in Cavan.  He has an occupational therapist report that recommends a laptop with the very specific software of Englishtype junior and Clicker 8.  However, the special educational needs organiser, SENO, has refused to recommend this to the Department, which I think directly contravenes Article 24.2(e) in that the supports this child needs are being denied.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the role of a SENO. Should it be to ensure that the educational needs of children are met or somehow safeguard the Department in terms of spending money?  I ask because this is not the only instance but one example.  Perhaps I can personally raise the issue with the Minister of State after this meeting, if possible, to further the process.<\/p> <p>  Children in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and, indeed, elsewhere are forced to travel out of their areas to attend schools that meet their needs whether that is a special school or an ASD unit.  Earlier Deputy Higgins mentioned the section 37A process.  Under that process schools are asked to indicate if they have space for a unit.  I know that many schools have space but they do not want to countenance having a unit in their school so are not indicating that they have space.  Can the process be strengthened to ensure that all schools seriously consider having a unit in their schools?  My colleague, Deputy Chris Andrews, has raised the issue of the lack of special class places and ASD unit spaces in the south Dublin area, which is very stark.  The Department spends hundreds of thousands of euro every day transporting students from their localities to schools that are perhaps half an hour or an hour's journey away.  That money would be better spent providing additional units.  As the Minister of State knows and we all know, we need additional units in schools but many schools have refused to countenance this.  Is the Minister of State working directly with, say, the Catholic patron bodies?  Many of our schools still operate under a Catholic ethos and many of our schools that have units are community or DEIS schools, but many of the Catholic schools are not.  Has there been an increase in the number of schools that will include a unit?<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that all new builds require an ASD unit.  Will that be sufficient to meet the need?  I would love all siblings to attend at the same school, where possible, but if there is not a unit or special class to meet the needs of those with additional needs then that may not be possible so new schools might be needed.  I am in contact with Enable Ireland that has said it has been inundated with the number of new assessments being requested.  That indicates, in terms of planning for the future, that there will be a huge need for more units at both primary and secondary schools and, indeed, for services post-secondary school as well so a lot of planning is needed.<\/p> <p>  The forecasting model has been mentioned.  What is the latest National Council for Special Education, NCSE, prevalence rate?  In 2016, it was 1.55%.  Is there an up to date figure available?  It is 3.3% in the North so there is quite a difference, which I wonder about.<\/p> <p>  Will Down's syndrome children be included in the summer provision?

There is a process outside of the section 37A.  The National Council for Special Education liaises and engages with schools on special classes and all of the time outside of the section 37A.  The section 37A process is a very valid mechanism and has its benefits but it should only really ever be used as a last resort.  However, I will use it if I have to.  There will be 1,200 places next year.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Tully mentioned a particular ASD unit.  Earlier I mentioned that there has been a considerable growth of 235% since 2011.  There will be 189 ASD special classes this year and that is out of 197 new special classes in total.  As I said, there will 1,200 special class places but 189 of those are for ASD pupils, 12 are early intervention, 113 are primary and 64 are post-primary.<\/p> <p>  The culture and ethos of a school is really important.  It has been hard to determine, I think historically, whether it is simply a lack of places or whether schools do not want to take a class.  That culture and ethos is changing slowly.  Obviously we try to encourage patron bodies and other organisations and schools to voluntarily open a special class where it is needed rather than trigger the section 37A mechanism, which we only want to do where we absolutely have to.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned the technology, I think, for a ten-year-old boy.  There is an assistive technology scheme.  Some &euro;100 million has gone into that.  There are ICT grants available for schools as well.  The SENO can liaise through the NCSE, which, in turn, engages with the Department if there are any particular issues.

With regard to the 50% capacity of special needs schools, is it possible to get an update on when they will return to 100%?  Will it be in line with the mainstream schools?<\/p> <p>  Will there be a sector-specific educational, social or even medical study done of the impact of school closures and the not-full opening of the special schools and classes looking back on all we have learned?  Going back to what Deputy Canney spoke about, how do we catch up?  Is there a plan on how we will catch up?  How will we assist families whose children have regressed so badly?  How do we increase the supports of children with additional needs?<\/p> <p>  I certainly am always learning in this pandemic.  It has highlighted the areas where we all need to learn as a society and how people with disabilities have been affected disproportionately.  We have to learn and move on to a rights-based approach to our disability services.  That, I suppose, is the aim of this committee.  It is to implement the UNCRPD.  How does the Department learn from the pandemic?  Is it the case that special needs schools and classes need to be reclassified under law as essential services to make sure that they remain open?<\/p> <p>  Finally, the Department of Education funds the National Parents Council.  Is it possible that the Department would fund a dedicated parents council for the parents of children with special needs and additional needs, or has that been thought about?  We all are aware that children with additional needs and special needs have specific and different needs from mainstream children.  Such an advocacy group for these families would be welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#H00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McGreehan for her questions.  Of course, another advocacy group could be formed.  Parents form them all the time.  There are many different parental representative bodies and groups already.  I do not see any reason another cannot be set up by the parents at any time.  It would not be something for the Department to do as such but I understand what the Senator is talking about in terms of a point of contact for parents.  We liaise with parents all the time.  I suppose another role of the NCSE is to liaise at a grassroots level with parents of children who are struggling with their needs and, indeed, the other advocacy organisations I mentioned earlier, AsIAm and Down Syndrome Ireland, and other representative groups.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the 50% capacity returning to 100%, I will welcome the decision when it happens.  Hopefully, it will happen sooner rather than later.  As I said earlier, it will be subject to Cabinet approval but we are hoping that it will be in early March.  It will be an important development for students in these schools, because they have the greatest level of need, if we can at least get them back to a full routine and a full structure.<\/p> <p>  In terms of regression, as I mentioned earlier, the summer provision will help.  That is a practical support.  There are other supports that we give from a financial perspective but that is a practical support.  The summer provision is primarily about the children but it also allows some sort of respite for the families, particularly when they have had extended periods at home looking after their children.  I must emphasise the supplementary programme also because that is a radical new departure for the Department.  It never existed previously.  It is one-to-one home support which will supplement any other learning they are getting.  It is five hours per week for four weeks, which is 20 hours.  Any unused hours can be used by 30 April, including during the Easter holidays.  There is scope there for families.  It is open to all students in special schools and in special classes who are those with the greatest need.  That should be of assistance also.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, in terms of it being an essential service, it is something I considered.  The reality is providing education is an essential service.  The difficulty is that it is not only the Department that makes the decisions.  It is everybody who makes the decisions and until all concerned are assuaged, there is no reality in going back.  The Department and everybody else takes its advice from public health advice.  The Deputy is correct that it is an essential service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#H00300","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister of State a good afternoon.  I have three different areas I want to get to if possible.  First, for those students who are not in a special class but who are in a mainstream class and receive resource hours, could the Minister of State outline what supplementary supports such children, for example, a child with a visual impairment or a deaf child in a mainstream class, are in receipt of?<\/p> <p>  Second, I want to return to the issue we talked a little about today, namely, early intervention and the lag that we might experience due to Covid.  The Ombudsman for Children's Office, OCO, report, which I am sure the Department is aware of, which outlined issues around unmet needs included a concern around access to early intervention.  Due to Covid disruption, there would be a significant cohort of students who may age-out of early educational intervention.  This is partly because referring a child for an assessment of need with educational issues is hampered by a difficulty as regard the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004, in that some of the Act's provisions have not commenced.  I understand that overlaps a little with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte's area but it also relies on school principals to do much of the referring.  The report states some of those gaps are being met by the use of the National Educational Psychological Service.  My questions in that area are as follows.  What actions are the Department taking to address the issues with and access to that early educational intervention?  What are the plans as regards children who might age-out of it due to the disruption due to Covid?  In this committee, we talk a great deal about the optional protocol, but that report also outlines that there is a lack of a robust mechanism to complain or raise concerns around issues when it comes to referring for educational early intervention.  Could the Minister of State speak to that, perhaps around what we could put in place to allow parents or the schools to report on it?<\/p> <p>  Could we get a brief update on those children in secondary education who are facing into the junior certificate or leaving certificate, and the supports that might be in place for them?  I am particularly thinking of those students would have been struggling with online learning already and how that might interact with State examinations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#H00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":536,"content":"<p>On the State examinations, there are accommodations in place for the children to whom the Deputy referred.  They are called special arrangements or reasonable accommodations.  There are, therefore, supports in place for children with special needs who are doing the leaving certificate this year.  The junior certificate does not apply this year.  I am not sure if the Deputy mentioned the junior certificate but she may have mentioned the leaving certificate.<\/p> <p>  While remote learning and not attending school are not optimum for children, there are supports in place.  I mentioned these earlier and they include the supplementary programme, which will provide significant help.  This involves in-home tuition and takes place on a one-on-one basis in the evenings or at weekends.  Other than that, updated guidance has been given to schools on some of the issues that children will need assistance with.  There are key themes in the guidance documents around the role of schools, teachers and school leaders working with children with special educational needs on all of their needs.<\/p> <p>  It is important that schools reach out to parents and let them know what is available.  There has to be regular engagement with pupils and students.  There is a blend of guided and independent learning and tasks.  There is two-way feedback between the home and school and supports for students with special educational needs.  We are looking at focusing on special education teaching hours for students who are not going back yet.  I also mentioned the summer programme.<\/p> <p>  On early intervention, while this issue is not under my remit, I have raised with the Minister of State at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, the concerns the Deputy mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#J00100","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak and ask questions of the Minister of State.  Other members covered a number of the issues raised with us in emails by parents of children with additional needs.  They have expressed to us their immense frustration and told us of the terrible impact the prolonged school closures have had on their children and the regression they have seen.  They are seeking clarity and certainty about schools reopening and classes restarting.  They are also looking, as the Minister of State knows, for a commitment that there will not be any more on-off school closures.  I know the Minister of State has already responded on some of those issues but I would like to get greater clarity on dates and to ensure that once schools open fully - and we appreciate that special schools are already open - that children with additional needs will be able to stay in school and there will not be any more on-off approaches.<\/p> <p>  I ask specifically about a Labour Party proposal for a catch-up for children scheme.  We have proposed that the Government allocate &euro;100 million to structured and targeted interventions so that once schools reopen and we are, hopefully, moving out of Covid restrictions, we will need to first establish precisely what the impacts of prolonged school closures have been for children.  We must then enable structured interventions at all stages, for example, additional tuition for children whose literacy or learning has fallen back or who gave regressed in other ways.  We have seen a similar scheme in place in the UK.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, announced a welcome plan this week for the reopening of pubs and nightlife after Covid.  We need to see a similar plan to address the impacts on children of prolonged school closures and the losses of everything else, such as sport, extracurricular activities, over the course of the pandemic.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies in England has suggested that the costs have been immense for children.  We have not seen anything like the level of discourse we need on that in Ireland.  I have been attending some webinars organised by the Children's Rights Alliance, which have referred to that issue but we need to see more intervention from the Government to address it.<\/p> <p>  I make an appeal on behalf of one specific group of parents and children I met earlier today, namely, those involved in Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland.  There are children, young adults and older adults with this condition across Ireland who have many needs.  I promised the group that I would raise in particular the needs of children with spina bifida and hydrocephalus who are seeking to access education.  There has been a real difficulty for many children in this situation who not only require SNA support but also require additional physical support such as nursing support, which has typically been provided by the HSE.  Can the Minister of State confirm that a scheme is in place to meet both the physical needs of these children, in addition to their need for an SNA, and their need to access education?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#J00200","speaker":"1631"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I took a note of the Senator's comments.  On the on-off approach, as the Senator described it, I cannot give any guarantees about anything because the Department takes its advice from the public health authorities.  I cannot give confirmative information about dates either.  I said earlier that the Cabinet is meeting today and there is an indication that special schools will go back to 100% capacity in early March.  That is the extent of my knowledge because I am the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion and my I am limited to that area.  The other decisions are not made by me.<\/p> <p>  On a catch-up scheme, one of the reasons we put in place the supplementary programme, which will be hugely beneficial, is to provide for the catch-up that children with special needs, in particular, will badly need.  Practically every member of the committee has mentioned regression.  It is a huge issue for children without additional needs, never mind for those with additional needs, and we are conscious of that.  We will probably be in a position to expand that supplementary programme at a later stage.  If it is the case that schools have to close before the end of this term or in the next term - we hope that will not happen but cannot be sure - it may well be of assistance then.  We also have the summer provision under which every child receives a progress card.  These progress cards are given to the school and when the children go back to school their teachers then know what skills they have and do not have.  That should be of significant benefit to them.<\/p> <p>  I understand what the Senator is saying about spina bifida and hydrocephalus and she is right that the nurses' list is provided by the HSE.  We are developing a nursing programme through the school inclusion model at a cost of &euro;1.3 million.

The Minister of State will probably think I am following her at this stage because I have been plaguing her in recent times.  I have a number of points and questions I would like to raise rather than giving a speech.  I am seeking clarification on a number of issues from the Minister of State and her officials.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the negative impacts all children, particularly those in special education, have experienced during lockdown and Covid.  Has there been any analysis of that in the Department or has any report been drawn up to analyse the empirical data and the impact in order to quantify that regression?  If such a report exists, could the Minister of State elaborate on it and, if one does not exist, is it worth giving consideration to compiling one?<\/p> <p>  In the case of students who, for health reasons or due to underlying health conditions, choose not to return to special education in the coming weeks, will the Minister of State clarify specifically what supports they might receive?<\/p><p>The Chairman mentioned in his opening comments that we are reasonably well catered for at primary level with ASD units and special education provision, but when children hit second level many parents speak of the delivery of supports almost falling off a cliff.  I recognise the massive investment that has happened over the last decade, to which the Minister of State alluded in her opening remarks.  The numbers of teachers, SNAs and ASD classes have dramatically increased.  Obviously, there is a massive demand there and I am concerned that we are not catering for it.  Deputy Cairns and Senator McGreehan mentioned facilitating ASD units.  What is the Minister of State's policy in that regard?  I can only speak about Cork county and city.  There is one suburb in Cork with a population of 20,000, which has three secondary schools and not one ASD unit.  New schools are being asked to provide ASD units but existing schools have to pick up the slack and if they are not willing to do that voluntarily we have to consider a change in policy or direction.  That is just one example of one suburb in Cork with a population of 20,000 and no ASD unit in place.<\/p><p> My final question relates to school transport and buses.  We have a particular issue in the Cope Foundation in Cork, where buses provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann are facilitating three schools on one campus.  Those children go into their bubbles in class and remain in them, but as soon as they come back out to the buses, three cohorts of students go on the same bus.  Will the Minister of State, or one of her officials, clarify if that is still supposed to be happening?  I do not think it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#J00400","speaker":"1521","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments and questions.  We will consider putting together a report but at the moment we are dealing primarily with getting all our children with SEN back to school.  That is the priority right now but it may well merit some sort of report.  I do not believe in having reports just for the sake of them but if we felt it would achieve something and we could learn from it into the future, it is something we would consider.  I thank the Deputy for raising that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding supports for children who are not back in school at the moment, the supplementary programme I mentioned provides one-on-one teaching outside of school hours and at weekends.  The inspectorate also has a Covid-19 helpline, which is available for schools.  The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, has published a document on supporting the well-being of students with SEN returning to school, which is being revised and is a very comprehensive resource.  People can contact NEPS psychologists or the NEPS office directly because the well-being of children with special needs is crucial at the moment, more so than for other children.  The NCSE has a dedicated phone line and the NCSE adviser will support SEN access during this period.  Special educational needs organisers, SENOs, are also available to support parents where children are experiencing challenges in returning to school.  Those supports will be important.<\/p> <p>  I will call Ms Kearney in a minute to answer the Deputy's question on the Cope Foundation transport issue.  He and I have spoken many times about Cork.  The NCSE is aware of 20 children in Cork who are not in school and who require a special school place.  They are currently availing of the home tuition scheme.  Some 116 children in the Cork area have a recommendation for a special school placement but the majority of those are currently in a special class placement.  There is much engagement going on between the Department, the NCSE, school management, the Cope Foundation and the patron of Scoil Aislinn about expanding - or not, as the case may be - to provide further places in that area.  There were a number of meetings last autumn, as the Deputy knows, and a further meeting with the Cope Foundation is planned as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#K00200","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":542,"content":"<p>We have engaged with the Cope Foundation in Cork regarding specific concerns it had about transport.

The Minister of State has already outlined the steps the Department is taking in the area of regression and the supports being provided for children with special educational needs in order to get back to school.  One of the key messages is that the Department is acutely aware that being out of school has an impact on all children, but has a particular impact on children with special educational needs.  In returning children to school, getting those children in special schools and special classes back has been the priority.<\/p> <p>  As regards regression, when schools reopened in September, the Department worked very closely with stakeholders to provide guidance documents and supports to schools about how best to provide for children on their return to school and to support any learning loss that had been identified.  There are over 13,000 special education support teachers across our school system and children with special educational needs have learning plans that identify their particular learning needs.  Those teachers have worked closely with the class teachers and the special education teams in the schools to ensure that children who had particular challenges on return to school could be best supported by the allocation of those teachers to the children who most needed them.  That, supplemented by the programme the Minister of State has identified as the supplementary programme and our summer programme, is what we can do currently to support those children in the area of regression.  As the committee has clearly identified, this is an area of which we are acutely aware and we are working very closely with the stakeholders to get everyone back.  Once they are back, we are targeting learning loss in particular.  Members will also be aware that when children first returned in September, our strategies were very much about settling back in, targeting areas of particular loss and picking up on key skills to allow children to bed that in before they moved on to building on that learning.  That will be the focus again when children in special schools, special classes and mainstream schools return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Martina Mannion"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I missed a short period in the middle of the meeting so these questions may have been dealt with.

In many cases, the priority for the family is that the child return to school, but there are situations where the family wants to access remote learning to keep the connection with the school with a long-term view to moving back there, not moving to home schooling but looking at remote linking with the school over the next few months.  There is a concern about children being marked absent in those circumstances.  The problem is it seems to be very much on or off.  One is either in or out of school, either home schooling or in full education.

The key messages for those schools and children is that once the control measures are in place, it minimises the risk of transmission in those children.  The best thing for those children is to return to school to have the benefit of the school provision and to put in place the mitigation measures to minimise the risk of transmission.  We are aware that is a difficult decision for families dealing with the competing risks in a family situation.

I, for one, as a public representative have encountered some difficulties over the past number of months in relation to school transport and people opting for one aspect of school transport, such as the taxi, then seeing it does not work out for their circumstances, changing to the grant-based model and having huge difficulty in engaging with the Department on it.<\/p> <p>  I and many public representatives have been dealing with the Department on a long-running issue.  It is where a student with complex and special needs opts for a school thinking it the most appropriate for their needs at the beginning of their school journey.  The student finds out that school is not appropriate for him or her and switches to another school after much consultation, then find they are doing well in that school and it is the best environment for them.  There is some issue in the Department's regulations stating that, because it was not named at the time of their first application, they cannot be granted funding or support for transport to the second school, even though it has been universally deemed by psychologists and everybody else as the appropriate setting for the student.  There needs to be flexibility on that.  I cannot understand why it should be the terms from six or seven years ago that determine whether the family can avail of school transport.  In many instances, one or other of the parents would have given up their job to become the full-time carer.<\/p><p>There is a major issue with no places being available for pupils entering second level education and with children of 14 years of age whose primary schooling might have been delayed because of illness and other issues.  There needs to be some flexibility in this regard also.  My suggestion for the Minister of State is that, rather than having hard and fast rules on difficult and challenging cases of people with complex medial and educational needs, there should be a lot of flexibility in the Department.  I can follow up with the Minister of State on the specific cases because I do not want to go into them in a public forum.  There needs to be a lot more flexibility.  Many public representatives and I have tried with might and main to resolve issues faced by parents and children but to no avail because of the strict interpretation of rules within the Department. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#L00800","speaker":"1456","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

There are also dedicated induction activities during the first week of term.  There are organised meet-and-greet sessions for parents of first-year pupils to share information.  The National Council for Special Education also has guidelines on transition.  The Department provides continuing professional development, CPD, for staff regarding special educational needs.

We believe it is well recognised that, for the past 50 years, the regional technical colleges and subsequently the institutes of technology have delivered an excellent service in providing vocational, technical, technological and professional skills and qualifications to generations of students.  The strengths of the sector also reside in its strong links with local and regional business and enterprise and their practical approach to teaching and learning, informed by applied research.  These institutions provide pathways for progression into higher education which, through either geography or circumstance, may not otherwise have been within the reach of many young and not so young people.<\/p> <p>  The next step in the evolution of the higher education journey is a step change, which will build upon the strengths of the sector and ally them with the strengths of traditional universities, like more theoretical research, state-of-the-art facilities and international research.  We are endeavouring to afford everyone the opportunity, wherever they are located, to avail of the best that higher education has to offer.  When it comes to technological universities, this applies across the entire range of the national framework of qualifications from level 6 to level 10, with apprenticeships also a vital component.<\/p> <p>  Fundamentally, this is all about the type of tertiary education system we should aspire to and how we ensure we nurture the skills and qualities needed to survive and thrive in an increasingly globally competitive, digitised and automated world.  Technological universities are rooted in their communities and that connectedness on a range of levels is their strength.  I emphasise this is not simply about a skills pipeline of talent to rejuvenate regional development and socio-economic progress.  Although those are necessary objectives, we also want to nurture genuine learning environments that are welcoming and student-focused and which enable each person to fulfil their potential and to avail of academic freedom, a lively spirit of inquiry and personal development, which are the hallmarks of true university level education.<\/p> <p>  Much has been achieved since the enactment of the Technological Universities Act 2018 almost three years ago.  At that time, there were 14 institutes of technology of varying sizes on the higher education landscape.  In that very short space of time, relatively speaking, we have consolidated the technological sector to nine institutes alongside two technological universities of far greater critical mass and capacity.  Technological University Dublin vies with UCD to be the largest higher education institution in the state.  Together, more than 43,000 additional students are receiving university-level education and hopefully will graduate in due course with university qualifications.<\/p> <p>  We received another application for technological university designation last November, from Athlone and Limerick institutes of technology.  They have just been through the advisory panel process element of the prescribed legislative assessment and decision-making process.  If ultimately successful, this would see university education provision introduced and expanded in the midlands and mid-west, opening up opportunities all along the Shannon.  On the first day of this year, Munster Technological University, MTU, was formally established, marking the establishment of the second technological university in the State, the first outside the capital, and an important milestone for higher education in Ireland and, in particular, for the south west.  We anticipate, all things being equal, receiving two more applications for technological university designation in the next number of months, which will seek to replicate the achievements of Dublin and Munster in the west, north west and south east.  By this time next year, there is every possibility, without prejudice to the legislative process, that the landscape could have shifted radically once more and we could potentially have five technological universities and two stand-alone institutes of technology.<\/p> <p>  The Government has invested heavily in the technological university agenda with over &euro;65 million invested through landscape and transformation funding.  The transformation fund will expend &euro;90 million up to 2023, with &euro;34.3 million allocated in the first tranche last October.  In total, over &euro;120 million will have been invested in technological university development and progression.  We can assure the committee of our strong commitment to ensuring that all areas can benefit from the advantages of a region-centric, multi-campus technological university, with the opportunity to increase capital investment, including foreign direct investment, skills creation and retention, higher education access and increased research capacity, enabling people everywhere to be empowered to play to their strengths regionally, nationally and internationally.<\/p> <p>  I refer to some issues raised recently in relation to the efforts of the Technological University of South East Ireland consortium, where IT Carlow and Waterford IT are doing incredible work to finalise the application for designation.  It is vital to the nature of this project that we do not allow a divisive campaign to develop, which would be grossly unfair to both institutes and to the staff, students and other stakeholders who are working so assiduously to create something of real benefit to the entirety of the region.<\/p> <p>  The concept of a technological university is founded on a merging of equals and parity of esteem, and we hope that everyone would seek to assist and advance technological university proposals positively.  Technological university establishment in the south east will bring significant higher education and regional development opportunities to the entire region, together with the prospect of prioritised capital investment attaching as recommended by the seminal 2019 TU Research Network, TURN, report.<\/p> <p>  We stress that it is our clear intention to use technological university establishment to expand and improve higher education in Waterford and regionally to increase investment, attract more students and offer more people an opportunity to study in a university campus in their county or region.  We want to see expansion and a larger footprint for higher education in Waterford, and the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have also been clear on this point.  We thank the Deputies and Senators for their kind attention and look forward to the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#C00300","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I proposed for our work programme that we examine the developing links between Irish third level education institutions and Chinese institutions.  The Minister will be aware we passed a motion unanimously in the Seanad in November calling on the Government to use its diplomatic and trade channels to pressurise China over its abuses of human rights, particularly regarding the Uighur community.  However, there is significant concern among the staff of various third level institutions in Ireland about the developing links.  I am thinking, for example, of UCC's proposed joint college arrangement with Minzu University of China.  There is also the question of the Confucius institutes established in UCD and UCC.  Some countries have withdrawn from such arrangements.  I am thinking of Sweden, the University of Chicago and Penn State University severing links with the institutes because they are seen as China projecting its power and there are significant human rights and human dignity concerns about the freedom particularly of Chinese staff and students coming to countries from China.  For example, do they have the same freedom within and outside the curriculum or are there fears for their welfare, safety and freedom of thought and expression because of the Chinese Government&rsquo;s wolf warrior diplomacy these days?

I acknowledge the correspondence from the committee and, from my recollection, the fact the Senator raised this matter again in Seanad yesterday.  I certainly read comments about that yesterday evening.  I would make a few points.  Regarding the specific institutions referenced in the correspondence, I have been in touch, through my Department, with the three universities.  The presidents of those universities have confirmed to me this issue will be raised at their next governing authority meeting.  My intention was to then send the committee the correspondence I receive from universities, which might allow the committee to decide in its deliberations what actions it wishes to take.  I should add that national policy is supportive of educational engagement with China and other partner countries, but there is also a strong commitment to ethical internalisation.  At a national level, Ireland places significant importance on our educational relationship with other partner countries, including China.  Our national strategy identifies a range of benefits from international collaboration for a small globalised economy such as Ireland.  These partnerships create links and relationships for Ireland and for many partners at individual, institutional and country level that will bring further engagement and economic activity into the future.  There is also significant benefit for international students who come to Ireland or who study in institutions with a strong Irish connection.  This engagement is particularly important in building relationships with countries like China where we do not have strong historical diaspora relationships.  I should advise the committee and Senator Mullen that I plan to develop a new international education strategy and to publish a review of the existing international education strategy.  I hope to bring both proposals to Cabinet probably within the next month.  Of course, I would be very happy to engage with this committee.

We should have positive relationships, educationally, with China but we need to have ethical considerations.<\/p> <p>  This discussion is on the future of the technological sector and, unsurprisingly, I will start by raising an issue of regional focus and move on to the broader issue.  I welcome the commitment made by Minister of State, Deputy Collins, and referenced in the opening statements by the Minister and the Minister of State, on the broad ambition for a university for the south east, which the Minister, Deputy Harris, might outline.  He spoke about prioritised capital investment, but what we do not want to see in the south east is simply a name change.  When we consider a multi-campus university with campuses in Waterford, Carlow and Wexford, it is crucial there would also be significant investments to allow the technological universities to be able to complete not only internationally but nationally.

First, on the regional matter, I reaffirm to the Senator and the committee my commitment and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, and the Government to provide a site for, let us call it, the Wexford campus of the technological university for the south east, TUSE.  I am limited in what I can say other than there is active engagement on it.  When people in Wexford hear that, I am conscious they will have heard there has been active engagement for many years.  Let me say there is active engagement that I expect to be brought to a fruitful conclusion shortly.  There is an absolute concrete commitment, pardon the pun, from the Government to delivering a Wexford campus for the TUSE.  I want to assure the Senator of that.  I want to acknowledge at this committee the assistance of Wexford County Council, particularly its chief executive, in that regard and also the major work being done by IT Carlow.  In terms of time, I will not go further than that, but I reiterate that commitment.<\/p> <p>  On the statement of strategy, it is timely the Senator referenced it as I signed off on it in recent days.  I intend, subject to the agreement of the Cabinet secretariat, to bring it to the Cabinet next week and to publish it shortly thereafter.  I would be delighted to engage with the Senator individually and with the committee on the statement of strategy, which sets out our plans for the Department for the next number of  years.  There are some quite exciting pillars in it on which I would like to build.<\/p> <p>  The Senator's third question on capital investments and research capacity are interlinked.  My short answer is that the national development plan presents a major opportunity for the Government and the Taoiseach, who had the ambition to establish this Department, to firmly show their commitment to transforming the higher education sector through investment from a capital point of view in order to meet demographic needs and to transform infrastructure, including in the further education, innovation and science, FEIS, training, space and from a research point of view.  We are not funding research adequately in this country.  Considering the level of public spending on research compared to the European average, we are not where we need to be but we could close that gap and could make serious inroads into closing that gap in the lifetime of this Government.  I am involved in very active discussions, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, on these matters in the context of the review of the national development plan.<\/p> <p>  I should also say we are developing our new research policy for the country.  Obviously, we need funding and a policy.  We will basically use this year to kick off a national conversation with civic society and stakeholders on research, in terms of what should Ireland be good at, what is Ireland good at and what are the priority areas for investment for the next number of years, and develop the successor strategy to Innovation 2020 during the course of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#D01200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I appreciate that but if the Minister's Department, and I have said this to him previously, becomes purely an administrative Department for higher and further education, I argue the Department in its concept will have failed.

I would like to find out how we will ensure the balance of lecturers to students as we are reducing the number of students per lecturer in our colleges.  The technological universities are focusing on the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, levels 6 to 10.<\/p> <p>  I was happy to hear about the international review of the Athlone Institute of Technology and Limerick Institute of Technology, AIT-LIT, consortium.  What are the next steps?  The Connacht Ulster Alliance was one of two mentioned as coming in shortly.  Senator Cummins asked me to raise the TU in the south east and the importance of that.  I suppose that application will be coming in soon.<\/p> <p>   Embedding with industry is crucial, especially in regional areas.  I would like to ask about Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, and the Irish Research Council, IRC, two agencies under the remit of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  How will they engage with technological universities?  I refer to start-ups and SMEs, in particular.  Does the Minister have foresight on how it will work?  I refer to Enterprise Ireland and the research offices and commercialisation.<\/p> <p>  Last week, the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, spoke to us about sustainability and the reference in the Cassells report to Exchequer and EU funding in relation to sustainability.  Solidarity with the community is also key.  It is something we want to see with our technological universities.  The key part is human capital.  How will we ensure the people we hire within these technological universities have dedicated research time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#E00100","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":590,"content":"<p>Senator Dolan may have to recap on some of those questions.  There are many areas to cover.  I thank her for her interest and work in this area.  The digital skills piece is key, and not just digital skills but literacy, numeracy and digital skills.  Approximately 50% of adults lack digital skills.  They will be locked out of society and our economies if we do not rectify this.  We have tasked SOLAS with preparing Ireland's first adult literacy, numeracy and digital skills plan.  It is due to come to me around Easter.  I will publish it shortly thereafter.  We are eager to engage with this committee on how we can make that document a living document that makes a meaningful difference in towns and villages across our country.<\/p> <p>  On the AIT-LIT development, I am pleased to say it submitted an application for designation on 20 November.  I appointed an international advisory panel in December.  The panel is currently undertaking an assessment and concluded its meetings on 10 February.  It will then submit its report to the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  I should hear back at the end of March.  We will finalise the specific designation date depending on how that goes.<\/p> <p>  The Connacht Ulster Alliance has informed my Department that it is likely we will receive its application in March.  We will then follow the same statutory process.  My understanding on the south east technological university, TUSE, is that the consortium hopes to have the application to me around the end of April.<\/p> <p>  On Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, the Irish Research Council, IRC, and the higher education institutions, HEIs, and I ran out of time on Senator Byrne's question, now that 50% of our public research budget is under the remit of one Department, we are trying to avoid a situation where the SFI strategy over here, the IRC over there and the HEIs are doing their own thing.  I assure Senators Dolan and Byrne that it is way more than being administrators.  We have a chance to have one national research plan for Ireland.  We have to involve civic society in that.  It has been done in the Netherlands and other countries.  Covid-19 provides us with that opportunity.  People are excited about research and science.  Perhaps it is a once in a generation opportunity, so we want to use this year.  The Taoiseach will begin a national conversation shortly on research and innovation, involving our technological universities, higher education institutions, schools and broader civic society and, by the end of the year, we will have one national research plan in which all our agencies play a part and have clear responsibilities.<\/p> <p>  As was rightly said, it will also have to tackle the issue of human capital.  I have already tried to make progress on that.  We increased the stipends for researchers with the Irish Research Council as a first step.  I also want to have discussions on career pathways.  Not every researcher will work in academia forever.  Many researchers will need to transition from academia into industry.  I will be interested in engaging, and keen to continue to engage, with the committee on this.<\/p> <p>  Research and innovation is where the future of our economy's and society's well-being is at.  This Department is asked many questions about other burning issues of the day and rightly so.  However, the long-term strategic benefit of this Department must be the proper funding of higher education and getting research and innovation where it needs to be from a funding and policy point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#E00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I refer to progression on the Connacht Ulster Alliance.

The Minister mentioned a new national literacy, numeracy and digital strategy that will come out at Easter.

This needs to be challenged with regard to how effective we can be as a political entity and an Oireachtas in tackling literacy issues if it is so dispersed.  There is a section in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and another in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

He has been talking to me about this for a long time.  We got the public consultation results back.  What was so concerning to see was that for all the people participating in the consultation, the biggest barrier to rectifying their literacy, numeracy or digital skills issue was a sense of shame and embarrassment.  As I keep on saying, and I mean it, the shame is on us and not them.  The shame is on us as a society that we have let these people down and have left people behind.  I would love to come back to this committee when the plan is published.  The big challenge is how we get the plan alive and turn it into something meaningful across our country.  All Departments have been involved in drawing up the plan.  I have been chairing an interdepartmental group - I hate that phrase - consisting of loads of Departments and agencies.  I have an open mind on the one agency but perhaps we could have a look at that when the strategy is published.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the leaving certificate, I can provide the Deputy with some assurances.  The previous budget provided funding for about 2,000 additional places.  I have set up a working group in my Department to meet with the Irish Universities Association, the Technological Higher Education Association, which represents the institutes of technology, the CAO and others to identify what more we can do.  Not all places are about money.  Some places also have to have matching placements, so we will also engage with the Teaching Council of Ireland, the Department of Education and the Department of Health.  There could be a once-in-a-generation opportunity here if we can find more placements as well as places to try to address some of the shortfalls in terms of the number of graduates we have for our public services.  Two numbers I always look at with regard to the leaving certificate are 50 and 80.  Every year, about 50% of students who pick a level 8 honours degree get their first choice on CAO offers day while around 80% get one of their top three choices.  That is the metric I am trying to measure myself against this year.  That metric held up last year and I am trying to make sure it holds up again this year so that a student this year has as much of a chance on average of getting his or her first choice or top three choices as students would have had in previous years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#F01100","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I have a short amount of time and a number of questions so I will rattle through them as quickly as I can.  Along with other Members of the Oireachtas in Waterford, last week I would have met a number of groups.<\/p><p>The groups included the Technological University for the South East Project and Waterford Chamber.  The meeting was to discuss concerns around the TUSE project.  There are three recurring concerns that each group discussed.  I will ask the Minister to address them in turn, if I can.  They are the location of the headquarters, the application of capital funding and the composition of the governing body of the eventual technological university of the south east.<\/p><p> I agree with the Minister that some of the local commentary on the headquarters issue has been unhelpful.  It has helped to fuel anxiety.  The Minister's statement as well as those of the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have helped to allay some of those fears and they were welcome.  It is my opinion that any objective assessment of the national planning framework or the regional spatial strategy would suggest that the headquarters be located in Waterford, but I want to afford the Minister an opportunity to lay out his thinking on the issue.<\/p><p> My next question is on capital funding.  Despite accounting for almost 9% of the national population, the south-east region accounts for 5% of the Higher Education Authority spend or 3.2% of HEA research income.  The capital side is even worse.  Since 2004 the south east has accounted for only 1% of capital investment in the sector.  The existing Waterford Institute of Technology main campus is at capacity and creaking at the seams.  The built stock is depreciating.  We urgently need to expand the footprint of the campus in Waterford.  We have to acknowledge that a university of substance requires substantial investment if it is to be meaningful.  I call on the Minister to briefly outline capital investment plans.<\/p><p> My last question is on the composition of the governing body.  The 2018 Act stipulates a board of between 14 and 22 people.  Can the Minister comment on the criteria that will be used to appoint the president?  What criteria will be used to appoint the three external members appointed by the Minister?  Can the Minister clarify which education and training boards will in fact be entitled to nominate to the new technological university board?

Some are choosing to do different things.  That is their democratic right and we wish them well.  We are going to deliver a technological university for the south east.  There will be more students in Waterford.  There will be more funding in Waterford.  The footprint of the campus in Waterford will be larger.<\/p> <p>  Where is the headquarters?  The honest-to-God answer to that question is that the headquarters will be decided by the governing body of the new technological university.  There was misinformation, disinformation and downright nonsense put out around Kilkenny over and over again.  No matter how many times I called it that, some people continued to go with it.  No decision has been made and there is no proposal in respect of Kilkenny.<\/p> <p>  The first job in even getting a university is to get an application in.  We need the application in quickly.  We need it in by the end of April so that we can meet our date of 1 January 2022.  That is when we are going to do this, despite the naysayers.<\/p> <p>  Capital funding is essential.  I believe this is even more essential, frankly, than the headquarters decision.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have said they want to dramatically expand the physical footprint of what is now Waterford Institute of Technology and what will soon be the TUSE in Waterford and I have said it as well.  That means development and growing the site.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh will know some of the sites in question and so do I, but let us not name them here.  Processes need to be gone through, but I am 100% committed to that, as are those in my Department at official level and the whole of Government right up to the highest level of the Taoiseach.<\/p> <p>  I have a long note on the governing body, but I probably will not have time to read it out.  I will send it to the committee.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh rightly says, I will appoint the first governing body, which is made up of the chairperson, two external members and one member nominated by the ETBs in whose area the technological university is situated.  Frankly, I will need to set out the criteria to do that.  With the Munster Technological University I have publicly advertised for the post of chairperson.  I imagine running a similar expression of interest process.

I have had conversations with the Minister on this issue directly in the past.  I am an enthusiastic supporter of a technological university for the south east.  I want it to happen.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to drive this over the line and make it happen as quickly as possible.  It would be exciting for the south east if this were to happen on 1 January next year.

Obviously, an extraordinary amount of work is to be done.<\/p> <p>  I wish to come back to some of the issues raised by an Teachta &Oacute; Cathasaigh and seek some more clarity.  I welcome the fact that the Minister said additional funding will be made available to increase the footprint of the campus in Waterford.  I welcome that the Minister wants to use the TUSE model to expand third level education in Waterford and other areas of the south east.  I am a supporter of the multi-campus solution.  The Minister said that would be in the context of the national development plan.  Will we see the colour of that money before the designation of the university?  People would be comforted if they knew that were to be the case.  I know that both institutes have made applications under the revised national development plan.  We want to see, as soon as possible, the total quantum of money over a 20-year period that will be invested in what will be a new university from next year.  What is the amount?<\/p> <p>  The second question relates to the headquarters.  This is something that has come up.  It came up strongly in the meetings that we held with the Waterford Chamber and a campaign group called the friends of the technological university of the south east.  It is not an unimportant matter.  I agree that funding is a big issue and I accept what the Minister is saying in respect of the government body ultimately making the decision.  What criteria will the governing body be working to when it makes or assesses that decision?  Would that decision have to be in line with the national planning framework?  We know considerable work was done to ensure that we get regional development and the national planning framework right.  Waterford city was to be seen as the catalyst for growth right across the region.  I hope the Minister will bear with me in terms of how I am putting the question.  Will the issue in respect of the headquarters be consistent with the national planning framework?  I am putting that question constructively to the Minister.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask about the composition of the board.  My understanding is that a limited number of appointments are made first.  Then those appointed have to oversee the election of other positions and there are further appointments.  In the short time the Minister has, perhaps he can respond to that as well.<\/p> <p>  These two critical issues will give confidence to people in the south east and deal with some of the issues that the Minister raised.  There are people who have a different opinion and believe Waterford can go it alone, but I do not believe that.

I reiterate what I said last week about technological universities having the potential to be a transformative development in Irish society in general and not just in Irish education.  When we look at the 2011 national strategy for further education, the Technological Universities Act 2018 and the TURN report, it is evident that we are doing something transformative.  That is why the new Department of the Minister and the Minister of State is so important.<\/p> <p>  The Minister will be aware that universities can have an enormous impact on their surrounding regions.  Moving UCD to the new campus at Belfield many years ago had an astonishing impact not just on the south of Dublin but on the entire Dublin area.  I have no doubt that technological universities can have such a transformative effect on the regions in which they are based.<\/p> <p>  Funding will be a big issue.  The Government will be required to provide capital funding.  Realistically, these technological universities are not going to succeed unless private investment can also be attracted.  This is not an argument for the privatisation of education.  We must ensure that industries, such as those involved in innovation in areas such as technology and pharmaceuticals, are linked to and provide funding for these technological universities.  I ask the Minister to outline any existing plans on how to encourage the private sector to engage in a symbiotic relationship with the technological universities to ensure a secure source of funding comes from the private sector, as well as the State funding for the primary purpose of technological universities.<\/p> <p>  The decision regarding who will be on the board of a university that is just starting is very important.  That selection has an enormous impact on whether a technological university will succeed or fail.  We try to ensure now that every form of appointment to a board is done meticulously and we do not seem to favour any particular individual over another.  I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State, both of whom have good knowledge, awareness and judgment of who is effective on boards, to use their own judgment and to not just become a concierge for the Public Appointment Service, PAS, to just announce whomever has been recommended.  We really need to go out and attract people and ask them to take on this exciting role in technological universities.  By doing that, it will be possible to appeal to a broader range of people than by simply placing an advertisement in the newspapers.  I hope the Minister and the Minister of State might have a minute or so to address those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#H00300","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  The point he made about boards is interesting.  We must be honest about this.  People who serve on boards are undertaking public service and it is often hard to attract good people to these posts.  That is no reflection on the people serving now.  Fewer people are putting up their hands these days to serve on boards and those of us involved in politics must reflect on this issue.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy's point regarding the potential of the technological universities to transform regions.  The idea is prevalent that all roads must lead to Dublin or other massive centres of population.  We can change that notion.  This will not only have an educational benefit but will also have broader planning, housing and societal benefits.<\/p> <p>  Turning to partnerships with industry, this aspect is one of the reasons the Taoiseach decided to establish this Department.  It is intended to be an education Department, but also one which will interact with the areas of research, innovation and science.  In the short time available, I point out that the regional skills forums are how we want to engage in this regard.  Every region now has a regional skills forum in which the education partners and representatives from industry meet to decide what needs to be done for that region.  Ireland is doing well in attracting foreign direct investment.  We are not doing nearly as well in attracting the research and innovation functions of those companies and that is next big challenge for our economic well-being.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#H00400","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#H00500","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":619,"content":"<p>Does Deputy O'Callaghan have any further questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#H00600","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":620,"content":"<p>No, I do not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#H00700","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":621,"content":"<p>That is fine.

Given what has been said throughout this meeting, there is no doubt that this technological university have a transformative effect on the region and that is not before time.  As someone who once protested and shut down traffic on the bridge in Waterford city many years ago when we were fighting for a library, I am very pleased to see further capital investment in WIT.  I hope that investment will continue in the new technological university, regardless of its name.<\/p> <p>  The Minister and the Minister of State will understand that most of the questions about the technological universities project have been asked and well answered.  Therefore I will take this opportunity while they here to address issues such as apprenticeships, further education and training and the opportunities presented by those facets of the education system.  The incentive scheme for apprenticeships was touched on by the Minister in his responses to previous questions.  I am interested in hearing about future plans for this area and the physical infrastructure necessary to meet the ever-increasing demands of our student population.  It will be understood that third level is not for everyone.<\/p> <p>  I would like more information concerning the university places provided by the Minister last year.  He referred to that aspect in the context of trying to cater for demands which may well be met.  The Minister mentioned that a report is due to be published on this area imminently, as early as next month.  This will be an important consideration for those students who now have choices regarding their leaving certificate and what may flow from those choices in September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#H00900","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Farrell for his questions.  I will begin by picking up on his last point.  We must reform the CAO process.  In saying that, I mean no disrespect to a body which does a very good job.  It does not fall under the remit of my Department.  It is unfair to young people that we narrow the conversation about their educational choices at such a young age.  Those young people often only get to see the other choices available to them if they do not get the points required for a certain college course.<\/p> <p>  Far too often, the culture of conversations about the future of young people in Ireland focuses on what institutions they will be going to and not on they want to do with their life and the four or five ways of achieving that ambition.  An apprenticeship is not a lesser way of studying; it is just a different way of studying.  Doing a post-leaving certificate, PLC, course and then moving from that to UCD is not a lesser way of studying; it is just a different way of studying.  I will come back to the committee on this issue shortly, but the Minister of State and I are working on plans to reform the process for school leavers.  I think we can do something exciting in this space during the life of this Oireachtas and I am eager to work with people on this issue.<\/p> <p>  I am confident that we can provide extra college places this year.  We have already allocated funding from the budget for approximately 2,000 extra places.  We have set up a working group to see if we can do more.  I reiterate that every year some students do not get their first choice and instead get their second or subsequent choice.  This year, I am trying to maintain the ratios, so that at least on average a student will have as much of a chance as they would have had last year or in previous years.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State and I are working hard on the matter of apprenticeships.  The apprenticeship action plan will go before the Cabinet in March.  It focuses on several areas, including what we can do to incentivise and support employers, what we can do to streamline the bureaucracy and procedures in place and what we can do to bring more apprenticeships on stream.  Craft apprenticeships are important, but so are apprenticeships in a wider range of areas.  We are also looking at what we can do to encourage gender diversity and inclusion.<\/p> <p>  I met the 1,000th female apprentice to be registered in Ireland, Zoe Fitzgerald, some weeks ago.  I was delighted to meet her because she is a brilliant young woman embarking on an exciting career.  The briefing note I got on that occasion stated that we had 26 female apprentices in 2015.  I genuinely thought it was a typographical error.  I thought at least one zero was missing, but the figure was correct.  The number has now reached 1,000, but we have more work to do in this area.<\/p> <p>  We also need to invest more in the physical infrastructure in the area of further education and training, as the Deputy said.  He has some exciting thoughts in that regard for the Fingal area.<\/p><p>When Covid allows us to move around, I will be happy to come out and visit the Deputy's constituency and see what we can do in that regard.  We have put a lot of funding into providing extra training places to try to prepare for a life post Covid.  There will be a life post Covid when people get back on their feet, but that does require infrastructure.  We have seen significant increases in our capital budget and we are ambitious to put that money to good work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#H01000","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for joining us again today.  It is very much appreciated.  Much of the conversation has been about the south east, which is correct given what is happening there at the moment.  There is much concern in that regard and it has been outlined very well by the previous speakers.  When we met with THEA and other representatives last week we heard that funding remains a concern.  I know the Minister has addressed that to an extent and said that he will come forward with plans.  One of the concerns that has been alluded to is that we need more private investment.  We also have a concern about the legislative ability of technological universities and institutes of technology to borrow.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about how we protect the fundamental core values of technological universities and institutes of technology given the value they have.  It is not just about providing opportunities in terms of jobs; it is also about the well-being of particular sections of society and of regions.  I think in particular of Donegal and what that does for North-South co-operation.  How does the Minister want to address both of those issues to ensure we do not look back in five years or at the end of the Government's term and say that we got the funding but ask whether we changed the very nature and core values of technological universities and institutes of technology?<\/p> <p>  The Minister also referred to the milestone of reaching 1,000 female apprentices.  It could seem like something of a celebration when one looks at the number of women in apprenticeships, but in the programme for Government the target is a bare minimum of 10,000 a year.  We are well off where we need to be and that is also the case in terms of the greening of the economy.  When the education and training boards, ETBs, were before the committee, they spoke about how they were introducing sustainability and climate into every course.  I will be checking to see if that is the case.  I asked the same question of THEA last week.  The approach seems to be on an institution-by-institution basis.  What will the Minister do to ensure that it is not just apprenticeships or courses that have green in their title that look at climate, but that every young person who goes through a third level institute has a foundation in climate and biodiversity because that will be needed regardless of where people end up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#J00200","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Reilly for her question.  She put it very well when she spoke about the core values of technological universities.  The first part of my answer is that they need to be owned by the regions.  I keep on having these conversations with the regions.  The Government can set up a technological university in Dublin, but we then need to have the infrastructure in place for the regions to benefit.  I will give an example of what I mean by that.  We have been talking about the technological university in the south east for most of the meeting.  We set up a regional enterprise engagement group, and we now have the chambers of commerce involved.  People are talking about what they can do if there is a university in a region and how they can put it to work.  They are asking what skills are needed, what jobs there will be in the future, what they want young people in Wexford, Waterford, Carlow or Kilkenny to be working on in the future, and how they can keep people in their communities.  Equally, we need to go into schools and tell people that they can now get an education in County Wexford that can keep them living in their community and they do not have to head to the big city in Dublin or somewhere else.  We have a transformation fund and we want to put that to work to try to excite the regions.  Even in a small country like Ireland, every region is different in terms of its jobs and skills needs.  If we get this right, when we look back at the end of our term in government or in a decade it will mean more young people being able to stay in their region.  We know that the longer people stay in their region when they leave school, the more likely they are to buy a house, have a family and stay there.  That will help repopulate and regenerate parts of the country.<\/p> <p>  I know Senator O'Reilly is passionate about the greening of the economy, as I am.  The Department has a major role to play.  We can have all of the ambition we want in the programme for Government, and it is good that we do, but if we are to turn that into practical results on the ground, as the Senator rightly said, we must use this sector.  I will give a quick example of one action that we have taken.  We set up four centres of excellence for retrofitting.  We need an awful lot more as we have a hugely ambitious programme for the retrofitting of homes, but we do not have the people to carry it out at the moment.  Those four centres of excellence will see a very significant increase in the number of people trained in retrofitting and providing good jobs but also good, green, sustainable jobs as well.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will make sure of this, but we will see positive discrimination through the capital plan and research funding in favour of projects that help to bring about climate action.  One of the big costs we will face as a sector, which could be viewed more as an investment rather than a cost, is making all our buildings carbon-neutral.  I was looking at the figures on that the other day.  It is a massive project.  I accept the challenge.  I take Senator O&rsquo;Reilly's point that we need to bed it into programmes for all students.  I will follow that up with the HEA and I would be happy to correspond with her on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#J00300","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":627,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the Minister of State.

We all acknowledge that there are deficiencies in terms of research funding in this country.  The Minister acknowledged that we are currently well below the EU average.  Does he favour a single research funding model for the higher education sector or would he envisage that we would have a number of research agencies, as is the case currently?

We have three research funding agencies within the remit of my Department.  We have Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, the Irish Research Council, IRC, and then we have each of the individual higher education institutions, HEIs, which I will group together as HEIs.  The current thinking of the Department is that we will try to get our hands on the funding programme for research and then we will provide it to the agencies and individual institutions in line with fulfilling a commitment or aim in the national development plan.  In other words, the Department would not be passive in this regard, but we would set out what we want to achieve as a Government and as a country regarding research, and the plan identifies which agency is the best to do it.<\/p> <p>  I have an open mind on creating an umbrella structure over that.  The first challenge is to secure the funding in the national development plan.  I am very hopeful on that.  The Taoiseach is very supportive of it and he has done a significant amount of work on it.  By the end of the year we want to put in place Ireland's new national research policy, which will clearly define what each agency does.  The collaboration is largely through the regional skills forums and through the strategic dialogues with me and the Department.  I note that in Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan's part of the world there is a really good example already in UCC, which has very much welcomed the MTU and is working with it.  They see each other as collaborating and complementing each other rather than being competitors and providing the full spectrum.<\/p><p> On the funding model, I am going to share my thinking, although I cannot say it is Government thinking because I have not been to the Government on this yet.  I do not favour student loans.  I think they are a bad idea and have a detrimental effect on people from lower socio-economic backgrounds in terms of taking on debt and so forth.  I expect to have the output of the economic evaluation around May.  It is my preference that we would publish that and have an informed debate or discussion on it.  There are basically three components to the proper funding of the higher education system.  One is the core funding deficit.  What is that level?  I have an idea but I will wait for the report to tell me.  The second bucket of funding is what is required to have an adequate, fit-for-purpose SUSI fund.  The third element is what is required if we wish to reduce or abolish the registration fees.<\/p><p> If we take those three buckets or clusters of funding and add them up, that is the totality of funding required.  I do not think it is impossible over the lifetime of the Government to really chip away at this and make very serious progress.  Again, I know the Taoiseach is really committed to this and that is why we established a Department with a focus on these issues.  I would expect that by the summer months we will be having some really interesting conversations about this but it must be about inclusion.  It has to be about realism but it must also be about inclusion.  Accessing an undergraduate degree, if that is what one wishes to do, should be a continuum of one's education in Ireland.  Indeed, it has been for many people but there are still too many barriers to it.  I will be back with the evidence and the economic input from the European Commission around May of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#J00500","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":630,"content":"<p>Deputy Dillon is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#K00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee secretariat for giving us the opportunity to discuss the technological universities at today's meeting.

What type of skills audit or labour analysis has the Department done on the regions in order to ensure that the Department gets the course options right, especially for multi-campus sites like the Mayo campus for GMIT?  There will be a school of nursing there but there is also an opportunity to ensure that we have business, life sciences and tourism courses to reflect both the labour market and the local industries in the area.

I am really excited about it.  In many ways, Castlebar and Mayo are well placed geographically in what will be a very large geographic area being covered by the new Connacht-Ulster technological university.  I am expecting the application in March although it is up to the consortium to decide when to submit it to me.  The latest information I have is that the consortium intends to submit the application some time in March and we will act quickly on receipt of that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the learnings, we have a pretty good template, not just in terms of the legislation which we obviously have to follow, but also on a practical level.  The Department and the HEA are getting pretty used to receiving these applications, appointing panels, considering the information, QQI inputting and so forth so I would hope that the process will be smooth.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Dillon has spoken to me on numerous occasions about regional skills, how we decide what courses to run and where best to run them.  I met IDA Ireland recently to discuss the need for a skills audit.  What are the skills we need in Deputy Dillon's part of the country or in my part of the country now and over the next ten to 15 years?  I am hoping that my Department and IDA Ireland can do some work on fleshing this out.  Let us call it a national skills audit which will look at each of the regions.  The Department is also looking at the skills infrastructure that we have in place.  We currently have very good regional skills forums.

I will read out the questions and ask the Minister to provide replies to the committee secretariat.<\/p> <p>  Last week Senator Flynn mentioned the importance of access programmes which are the only route to third level education for many marginalised groups.  The current crisis is adding to the extremely challenging obstacles faced by marginalised students.  The digital divide, for example, means that many people in marginalised communities do not have adequate access to ICT and digital resources.  In light of this, will there be any attempt by the Department to ensure that special provisions are made for access routes into the technological universities?  Access routes should not be the only avenue for marginalised students to enter third level education.  Senator Flynn mentioned at last week's meeting that apprenticeships and vocational education are also important education routes for marginalised students.

I wish to ask about the proposal for a technological university involving the amalgamation of Limerick Institute of Technology and Athlone Institute of Technology which would, of course, have a campus in both Limerick and Athlone.  However, of most interest to me and the people I represent is the campus in Ennis.  We really look forward to a technological university in the mid-west, adding to what is already there with the University of Limerick and Mary Immaculate College, which will be of enormous benefit.  Figures suggest that the economic benefit of this amalgamation and the higher status of education could be in the region of &euro;420 million, supporting 800 jobs on top of the 1,200 already employed in those colleges.  I ask the Minister to outline briefly the status of that project.

It was an incredible, fantastic three weeks.  People come home with a skill set of Irish they would never acquire from a textbook but it is also about camaraderie and acquiring those skills as a teacher.  Many students from Hibernia College have been in contact with us in recent weeks.  This may not fall perfectly into the Minister's Department but he is responsible for higher education.  It is morally wrong that they are being charged extortionate fees for a programme in which they will sit in front of a laptop.  When I was in college we walked the highways and byways of the Gaeltacht.  We had an immersive experience of the language and it enriched us as teachers.  I ask the Minister and others to engage with Hibernia College in particular.  There is a more substantive point to be made here.  Students are grappling with their second semester of this academic year.  I acknowledge that the Minister cannot intervene in all cases but colleges also need to reflect deeply on whether it is right to charge the same fees when the students do not have an on-campus experience.

Somewhat surprisingly, I am told that it remains a matter for the Department of Education but I have been engaging with that Department on it.  I am not trying to pass the buck.  The State has a moral responsibility and obligation to its students, and to everybody, during the Covid crisis.  I accept that and the State is doing quite a lot.  There is a &euro;163 million Covid package for higher education, including for laptops.  The student assistance fund has been doubled and there is extra funding for mental health.  We want to do more.  We have set up a student well-being and engagement group, which is chaired by the president of the USI, to identify more issues on which we we can work together.  I fully accept that we have a job of work to do but as the Deputy quite rightly hinted in his question, others have a role to play as well.

A significant capital investment will be required for the construction of the Wexford campus.  I do not want the Minister to comment on that now but I wanted to bring it to his attention that this will be needed.<\/p> <p>  The conversation about the governing body and the new headquarters for the TUSE in the past number of weeks has annoyed me.  I hope the Deputies from Waterford will not mind me saying this but a number of people in Waterford have been highlighting this issue.  Nobody else in any of the other counties, that is, Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny, is speaking about this but a number of people are doing a considerable amount of damage to the TUSE by talking about where the headquarters will be.  No one has stated any reason it should not be in Waterford but that is up to the new governing body.<\/p> <p>  I thank the presidents of both institutions, Dr. Patricia Mulcahy and Professor Willie Donnelly, as well as the chairs of the governing body, Councillor Jim Moore from Wexford and John Moore from Carlow, for the fantastic work they are all doing.  This matter has received some media attention in recent weeks and some staff in Waterford have been talking about the lack of a funding model.  I know this is of concern to the Minister and that he wants to make sure significant investment goes into the TUSE.  THEA specifically referred to the inability of the sector to access the same borrowing capability as other universities because of legislation that needs to be enacted to give the TUs this entitlement.  Does the Minister intend to expedite this legislation as an urgent priority in order that there is a level playing field for the TUs and the universities?  There has to be a level playing field.  There has been competition between universities in the past number of years and decades and we would not like to see that happening with the technological universities.<\/p> <p>  There is a need to encourage the uptake of STEM subjects, by females in particular.  How can the Department support the TUs in this endeavour?  Does the Minister intend to engage with the Department of Education to ensure there is a more joined-up approach?  Schools should encourage STEM talent, specifically the female cohort, from a young age in order that they can seamlessly move into third level STEM to see if it is an attractive field of study.  There are excellent career opportunities and options there for people to go forward.<\/p> <p>  This committee intends to undertake a comprehensive body of work on leaving certificate reform later this year.  At last week's meeting with THEA, its representatives expressed an interest in being involved in these discussions, which I welcome.  One point raised by THEA was that any reforms should ensure students are not categorised or do not have avenues of study closed off early in life.  What are the Minister's personal thoughts on this matter?  Does he advocate for more continuous assessment, as distinct from the straight examination we currently have?  How can reform ensure greater equality of opportunity?  I would be interested in the Minister of State's views on this matter as well.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has done great work with the hospitality sector.  There have been a number of announcements in the past few weeks because the sector is struggling.  I would be the first to admit that.  I heard some people in the hospitality sector on national radio this morning dismissing the work the Minister is doing, saying the sector does not need more training courses but more money from the Minister for Finance.  Leaving that aside, I have spoken to the Minister personally about this issue.  There is a great opportunity within the hospitality sector if we go back to the way it was with the certificates in Shannon College a number of years ago.  I thank the Minister for his work, which is the beginning of greater work that he and his Department can do in the hospitality sector.  It is going to be very important for the future of our economy when we recover post Covid.  We have seen the opportunities within the hospitality sector and I thank the Minister for that work.  I was very disappointed this morning by some people at a senior level in hospitality totally dismissing the work the Minister is doing and the opportunities he is offering the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#L00700","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":645,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and echo his thanks to the presidents, chairs and members of the governing authority, as well as all the staff of Waterford IT and IT Carlow.  While we are moving to a new landscape in the south east, that does not in any way take away from the incredible work both institutions have done.  In many ways we are trying to build on that success for the new model.  I am taken by the Chairman's comments about the speculation, idle comments or loose talk from people.  Establishing a university involves a lot of hard work by many people and a huge number of people in the south east are working day and night to make this happen.  This is what we have to do according to the law the Oireachtas passed, namely, the Technological Universities Act 2018, which sits on my desk.  The amount of work we have to go through is very prescriptive and detailed.  The first thing we need to do is get the application in.  Then, subject to designation, we appoint a governing authority.  We then appoint a president and the governing authority picks the headquarters.  There is much granular, difficult work to do.  It is not easy sometimes for a Government and, indeed, responsible Opposition Members, to compete with a quick sound bite.<\/p><p>However, if we do this right, we are going to deliver it and do so on time as well.<\/p><p> On the matter of borrowing, we are going to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on that.  I take the point about the level playing field and have spoken to THEA about it as well.<\/p><p> The Chairman is entirely right about the STEM subjects, this must be integrated between my Department and the Department of Education and this is something I have discussed with the Minister, Deputy Foley.  Some people from DCU were telling me they had done some research on this.  When one goes into a school and asks if anyone in a class is interested in science, a few students will of course put up their hands, but if one asks if anyone in the class is interested in coming up with a vaccine or tackling climate action, then more hands go up.  That is science; that is research.  Therefore, some of this is about how we present the information to our kids at a very young age and indeed how we present the options from a career guidance point of view as well.<\/p><p> I have strong views on leaving certificate reform but I do not want to get into the Minister, Deputy Foley's space.  There is an OECD report on it and we can do better as a country but there is no easy option.  However, what I can do, working with the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, in the Department is look at how we bring about the CAO reform.  This is the single portal I was talking about where young people can see all their options.  Other aspects include ensuring we have a career guidance strategy in place and how we create an integrated tertiary system.<\/p><p> On the hospitality sector, I am very conscious of the stress and strain everyone in it is under.  The courses we are providing were developed with the Irish Hotels Federation.  It was not a case of a Minister or the Government saying \"Here are some courses\".  We actually sat down with hotel owners and asked them what it would be useful for us to do for them so their businesses can prepare to reopen.  Similarly, I had a great meeting with the Restaurants Association of Ireland, RAI, as did the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, on how we can help it remove some blockages in the area of apprenticeships, particularly for chefs.  Our Department wants to be an enabler.  It wants to help enable businesses to get back on their feet post Covid and help enable employees use this time to acquire any skills they may require.  We want to help anyone who, during the pandemic, has been wondering what is next for them.  That is the job of work we must do and we will do it in collaboration with business owners and the people on the ground, because they know what they need much better than I or any other Minister does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#L00800","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I really encourage the Minister to continue his work with the hotel and catering sector.

People may differ from me on this even within the hospitality sector but a majority agree with me that there is huge scope here, especially in areas like hotel management, catering, hospitality, cheffing and everything like that.

I am concerned that some media outlets in the south east have been facilitating the naysayers a little bit too much.<\/p> <p>  I echo the remarks by the Chairman, who is a County Wexford colleague, about the hospitality sector.  I do have a concern around the Erasmus programme, however.  A significant number of students in the hotel and catering area used to go on Erasmus to Britain and particularly to hotels in London.  That is a problem as the UK has left the programme.  I encourage the Minister to look at say, the Turing scheme, to develop closer links.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to my earlier question on the scale of the challenge we are going to face and the key role of the technological sector, especially the pace of technological change we are going to face over the next decade, we are going to see increased automation in a whole variety of fields.  One of the challenges we are seeing at the moment with Ulster Bank is because of the shift to digital banking.  There is a crucial role here around dealing with all of that technological change and upskilling and reskilling all our citizens and it is that leadership role which the Minister's Department must take.  My question earlier was around the scale of the capital and research investment which will be necessary to ensure we are equipped for that.  What is happening in banking at the moment is in many ways only the canary in the mine.  We are going to see huge technological change and this sector must play a crucial role in that.  That is why I am concerned about not just the scale of the investment but also that there is an understanding at the heart of Government about how important it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#M00300","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I must cut the Senator off because Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh wants to come in and I want to give the Minister an opportunity to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021022300002#M00400","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I am going to give the Minister and Minister of State a break from the south east for a moment.

We might then be looking not just at retrofitting our building stock from the 1950s or 1970s but also the renovation of our older town centre stock, much of which requires that heritage skills aspect.

We will collaborate very closely with this sector which has been so badly hit.  I could not agree with him more on developing closer links with the UK.  We have had the Scottish-Irish review across Government and I have had a meeting with the deputy First Minister of Scotland to talk about how we can advance some of those areas in the research space but also in the potential scholarship type space.  They are not in Erasmus but there may be opportunities to do things bilaterally.  I had a meeting with the UK universities minister as well and there will also be comments shortly on Wales and Ireland working together, so I will keep in touch with the Senator on that.<\/p> <p>  I really take the point on the scale of ambition.  It needs to be massive, both from a policy point of view and a funding one.  One of the things I and the Minister of State did was convene a group of IBEC, AmChams, the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce and others to ensure there is a shared understanding of the scale of this.  I mention also ISME and Chambers Ireland.  Whether one is a small business in a provincial town or a massive multinational, we as a Government want to be ready for the changes which are coming.

It is not helpful to have a bun fight going on in one part of the country with regard to where the corporate headquarters will be located.  There will be a headquarters in every part of the region being served by virtue of the presence to which I have referred.  That is what is important.  The location in which the president in question sits and has his or her corporate team is actually irrelevant.  It is about the students, engagement with the region and embedding it into the region.  When I am asked in Limerick and elsewhere in the mid west about where the headquarters for the Limerick-Athlone project will be located, I say that is a matter exactly for the incoming president and the board.  It is really a secondary matter.  <\/p><p> On the issue of hospitality and tourism, as members are aware, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and I launched an initiative last week.  It was made possible by virtue of collaboration with the industry representative organisations, but also the regional skills forums.  The people working and engaging in hospitality and tourism have told us that they wish to skill up their critical and key employees in order to retain them in their employment in the sector such that when the country eventually opens up again and the economy gets running, those people will be there and will not have to be replaced by others who would have to be retrained or upskilled into those particular situations.<\/p><p> The Chairman asked about leaving certificate reform.  It is my personal view that there has to be reform of the leaving certificate.  All present have been through the leaving certificate process in their lives and education.  Having so much riding on one written exam is very onerous.  It can be a daunting task for many people.  The whole country will, ultimately, move away from that process.

We are joined remotely, first by representatives of the Financial Services Union and then by representatives of Ulster Bank itself.  The opening statements are taken as read.  They will be published on the committee's website.  The witnesses will have an opportunity to make some short comments before we begin our questioning of both groups.<\/p> <p>  First, from the Financial Services Union, we have Mr. John O'Connell, general secretary, and Mr. Brian McDowell, head of communications and public affairs.<\/p> <p>  I wish to explain some of the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses with regard to reference that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute.  If, however, they are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings a witness physically present would.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are covered by privilege if they are in Leinster House, but if they are outside it, they do not enjoy the same privilege.  I invite Mr. O'Connell to contribute and to note that because of time constraints we want to finish this session as close as we can to the half hour scheduled for it.  Then we will move into the second part of the meeting, as per the notification received for the next part of the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#A00400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for allowing us to address it today.  I also take the opportunity to thank the committee for its interim report, which resulted in us being here today.  I welcome the opportunity to address the committee today, although I truly wish the circumstances were different.  I believe that for years to come the Ulster Bank withdrawal from the Irish market will be a case study in how not to do change.  Rarely, does one have a situation where customers, businesses, trade unions, politicians and whole cross-sections of society concur on their unbelievable treatment by one of the so-called pillars of the banking world, NatWest-Ulster Bank.<\/p> <p>  It would be a disservice to our staff today if we ignored the behaviour of NatWest towards them in the past six months.  There were significant media reports on five key occasions which provided an opportunity for the bank to come clean with staff.  That was the case right up to last Thursday morning when the bank issued a report to staff to state that no decision had been taken.  It is not conceivable in our minds that the bank was in that position at that time, but that is what was stated to staff.  Staff took that information and went home, only to hear the next morning that the bank was leaving Ireland.  This behaviour is not acceptable, and it should never be acceptable to any organisation, but that kind of behaviour is continuing from NatWest-Ulster Bank today.  A statement from the bank last Friday said there would be no compulsory redundancies in Ireland.  Today, 40 staff are fighting for their jobs and trying to stop NatWest-Ulster Bank from making them compulsorily redundant.<\/p> <p>  The bank was also far from clear with our colleagues from Northern Ireland on the impact of the changes on them.  Senior management in Northern Ireland wrote to all staff stating there would be no impact, yet we had to push the bank to make clear to staff that they too would be impacted.  A total of 600 jobs in Belfast are affected, which is &pound;25 million out of the local economy.  Let us put ourselves in the shoes of those staff last Friday morning.  They did not know whether they were coming or going.  Their bosses told them that there was no impact, yet they were being told that the bank in Dublin was telling people that those jobs were gone.<\/p> <p>  We have three asks of the committee.  Jobs must follow the work.  We must have a situation coming out of this so that when loan books are sold, there is no equivocation or dilly-dallying and it is clear to staff their jobs are safe and they will travel with their work.  As I said, there were to be no compulsory redundancies.  What does that mean?  It does not mean much to the 40 staff in Ulster Bank.  We need the bank to confirm today there will be no compulsory redundancies in Ireland full stop.  In terms of branch closures, we want the moratorium on branch closures extended.  We are in the middle of a pandemic.  The UK regulator has called on British banks to stop closing branches.  Our regulator needs to stand up and state clearly it will not tolerate branches being closed on the Irish public in the middle of a pandemic.<\/p><p> In its annual report, the bank stated it is considering options with regard to the implementation of a phased withdrawal strategy.  We want the bank to make clear what this means.  We want people to leave today with absolute clarity as to the bank's intentions.  The Financial Services Union, FSU, will be publishing a document on the establishment of a banking forum within the next fortnight.  We are doing so because we believe the only way forward for us, as a society, is to have proper debate on what the future of banking holds.  We cannot and will not allow banking to be dictated by a number of senior bankers, having no regard to the impact on our society and our communities.  We will share that with the committee in advance of publication.  Having reviewed it, we would like the committee to be in a position to support it.<\/p><p> There is a lot of change afoot in banking.  KBC closed 25% of its branch network within two months.  Staff and customers were compulsorily disengaged.  AIB has announced cuts to jobs and staffing levels but is engaged in constructive dialogue with us.  The sale of hundreds of ATMs to the highest bidder has recently been announced and it has also been announced that banks may start charging customers for the privilege of having their money held.  What is missing from these announcements is any prior dialogue with consumer, staff and business representatives.  Change can be positive, but it must be agreed change.  That is why we believe a stakeholders' forum is vital.<\/p><p> I will bring one final thing to the attention of the committee, the media reports circulating about significant branch closures in Bank of Ireland.  That is why we are calling for a moratorium.  Bank closures should be paused for the duration of the pandemic.  It would be of great benefit to staff and customers if the committee could consider inviting Bank of Ireland to a meeting at a future date to explain its rationale.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":667,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connell for his opening remarks and for the statement he provided to the committee prior to this engagement.

I hear what Mr. O'Connell is saying in that regard.  I have been contacted by a number of people who work in Ulster Bank and the big concern they have raised with me is that there will be compulsory redundancies rather than voluntary redundancies.  I would be interested to hear if this is also the sort of feedback the FSU is getting from its members.  Mr. O'Connell mentioned this issue in his opening statement but I would like to know if it is a concern that is coming through from the union's members.<\/p> <p>  Another issue Mr. O'Connell has mentioned is that this has been worrying staff for a number of months.  He was before this committee previously and we had that level of engagement but the reality is that this has had a great impact on staff mental health.  Is that something Mr. O'Connell has also come across?  What impact has the lack of engagement prior to this announcement had on the staff?

What sort of representation or guidance is it providing not only for staff generally but for contract staff in particular who may be affected differently from full-time staff?

This has been an absolutely devastating period for Ulster Bank staff, who have had the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads for many months.  It is quite frankly outrageous that staff had to learn of their fate and that their jobs were at risk of coming under threat from media reports.  I notice that Ulster Bank's own statement, which it will make later on and a draft of which we have seen, makes reference to media speculation last September.  It is clear that somebody must have been briefing the media for the story to have appeared about the future of Ulster Bank and consideration of its operations in this country.  Ulster Bank has to take responsibility for that.  I am absolutely amazed that staff are expected to accept the notion that a decision on the future of Ulster Bank had not been taken until last Thursday and early Friday morning.  As my wife would say, I am not the most organised person in the world but even I try to organise what I might wear the following day the day before.  Nobody should be expected to accept the notion that a major bank of this scale would make a decision of this magnitude literally overnight.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a couple of questions, if I may.  The first relates to the conduct of the Central Bank.  Will Mr. O'Connell elaborate on any contact he may have had with the Central Bank regarding any advice and support the FSU might have tried to obtain with regard to contact between Ulster Bank and the Central Bank on the Central Bank's consideration of Ulster Bank's next steps in advance of the announcement made last Friday?<\/p> <p>  I welcome the FSU's commitment to the concept of a banking forum.  Would it agree that this should operate along the lines of the retail consultation forum established by Government in 2014, in which I had some involvement myself?  Would it agree that it will be important to include not only bankers and experts, but also experts drawn from the workforce in banks across the State, who could contribute enormously to the future banking landscape of this country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#B00600","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connell very much for his presentation.

I note that he has stated he believes they have been treated shabbily.  I have to agree with what he has said.  His statement was very clear in setting out the FSU's asks of this committee and what it would like us to put to Ulster Bank.  These include that jobs must follow work, that there must be no compulsory redundancies and the issue of bank closures.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a more general question on the future of banking in Ireland.  It is of concern that we have lost a competitor in the banking sector in Ireland and that, once again, the State will become an even more dominant player in that sector because of the assets it holds in AIB, Permanent TSB and Bank of Ireland.  What does Mr. O'Connell think can be done to make Ireland more attractive to banks that may wish to open here?  I have no doubt that one of the arguments banks will make is that the exceptionally high levels of capital that banks are required to hold against mortgage loans deters banks from setting up or remaining here.  I know it is not the function of a union representative to answer such questions, but I would be interested to hear what Mr. O'Connell believes are the barriers to banks remaining in and entering the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#B00700","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connell for coming before the committee again.  It is very clear that all of the issues he had previously flagged to us have come to pass.  I also agree that it is clearly not plausible that this decision was only made last week.  I was struck by the fact that Ulster Bank disbanded its sustainable banking committee in December.  This really points to the idea that sustaining the business has not been a priority since December and that it was really more the manner in which it would withdraw.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. O'Connell elaborate on a couple of key issues?  He mentions his concern that there may be compulsory redundancies this year.  Will he clarify what he needs as regards assurances on the question of compulsory redundancies, how they might be avoided and how it can be ensured that any redundancies in the future are proper redundancies?<\/p><p>I know there had been plans regarding senior executive accountability but it has not progressed.  What should we be driving forward in that senior executive accountability regime, specifically the question of responsibility mapping for senior decision-makers and governance?  Do the witnesses have a sense of transparency about where responsibility for decision-making is in Ulster Bank?<\/p><p> Another concern which we will be discussing with Ulster Bank is about non-performing loans and distorted figures being used when addressing the question of non-performing loans.  Have the witnesses concerns about a skewed assessment of the viability of different branches based on assessment over the past year with regard to transferring branches as viable businesses?  Will they speak to what they think is important to ensure a picture skewed by the pandemic does not inform the decision-making and options presented for workers and the area?  I say this as somebody who, very recently, perhaps coincidentally, was contacted by a polling company to ask how often I use my local branch of Ulster Bank.  I said I use it once a month and the company asked if I do that right now.  I said maybe not right now.  It is an interesting point because we need to look to viability wherever possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#B00800","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connell for his presentation.  I appreciate it is a difficult time for the Financial Services Union and the more than 3,000 members and staff when one includes those in the North, whose futures are not secure.  In his opening statement, Mr. O'Connell said that NatWest and Ulster Bank's recent actions in this context are a humanity failure, decency failure and respect failure.  It would be hard for any of us to disagree with that with regard to the way it handled this announcement and indeed the communication sent to members of staff, which clearly was not an accurate reflection of what was happening at the time.<\/p> <p>  Where do the witnesses think the best outcome lies to secure the three points they have raised with regard to staff, no compulsory redundancies and the maintenance of as many branches as possible?  There is a proposal that Permanent TSB would become a third force in Irish banking.  It is a small bank relative to AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Does Mr. O'Connell see that or any other option as a better option to try to secure the three outcomes he has suggested?  Regarding the memorandum of understanding we understand has been entered into by Ulster Bank and AIB, it is suggested there are 300 staff who would be aligned with that memorandum.  Has the Financial Services Union had any engagement with Ulster Bank to confirm the number of staff who would be assigned to any portion of loans that would be sold to any other banks?

It is shocking, given what the workers in Ulster Bank have done over the difficult past ten years to keep the show on the road when the bank was under such pressure, that the workers have been kept in the dark.  It went on until the last second and it is outrageous.  For me, this is part of the dysfunctional banking market we have.  The fact we have a duopoly in this country is making it increasingly difficult for workers and customers.<\/p> <p>  Have there been any negotiations with NatWest to date?

I fully support having no compulsory redundancies because they should not be necessary.  If services are going to be carried on in the future, I do not see why staff should not have a safe place to go to carry on with the business they did before.<\/p> <p>  What does \"phased withdrawal\" mean?  That is a dangerous term because it could mean a piecemeal reduction in staff and services over a period of time, after which there would be few options left for the staff or the bank to function.  I draw attention to the pivotal nature of the services provided by Ulster Bank right across the midlands, a significant area with a branch network providing lending services.<\/p> <p>  Other speakers referred to the non-performing loans.  By whose definition are they non-performing?  In my experience, the non-performing status was determined by the bank.  That allowed banks to put such loans into a package.

Those proposals would allow us to retain as many jobs and branches as possible in Ireland and the skills that go with a bank like this.  Ulster Bank in particular is known for its skilled lending staff in respect of the SME sector and so forth so we need to hold on to these skills.<\/p> <p>  I answered Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's point about the Government.  We had an initial meeting with the bank today and made our position very clear, particularly with regard to those 40 individuals who heard the first announcement last Friday and felt they got a reprieve only for that to be dashed on Monday.  Those staff are in everybody's thoughts and the bank must do the right thing by them.<\/p> <p>  In terms of removing bank branches, we are in the fourth quartile of digital maturity in Ireland.  We are not there yet.  We are trying to develop broadband in rural areas.  The reason put forward for closing branches, namely, that people go online, is not relevant to the communities that will be hit by branch closures.  It is not city centres and areas where there is good broadband coverage that are under threat - it is rural areas.  The members saw the reports last week about east Clare and so forth in respect of places under threat.  To go back to Deputy Doherty's point, it is a very delicate situation but we believe the best outcome involves the Permanent TSB-AIB-type proposals that solidify banking, create a third force and give a future in terms of competition.<\/p> <p>  We have a very strong position on vulture funds - no more than all the members.  Our experience is a very bitter one and we do not want it repeated in Irish banking.  We see no reason it would be repeated.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the 300 staff, we did not put the figure at 300 staff and I do not know who is pushing that number.  It is not helpful at this stage to push numbers when we are at the preliminary stages of a change programme.  This is why the bank making it clear what the options are, as it says in its annual report, would be really beneficial to this process.  Our position is quite simple.<\/p> <p>  In respect of a senior executive accountability regime and timelines, our view is that the sooner it happens the better.  Fining banks is irrelevant.  All studies have shown that in respect of culture change.  Fining bankers has an effect but fining banks has no effect on changing bank culture.  A senior executive accountability regime is an important part of that.  It is interesting to note that the banks did a survey through the Banking Federation of Ireland that showed that post pandemic, significant numbers of people will return to branch banking.  One of the most interesting facts is that the younger generation by a percentage of 83% would return to branch banking.  This is the banks' own survey so why would they close branches when they have that information in terms of surveys?<\/p> <p>  We believe that now is the time for a debate on the future of banking.  In respect of Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's question on what would make it more attractive, this is why we need a full debate on what model we want and what we want to attract.  There are other models of banking out there that do not strive to make profits over profits.  They look to have a sustainable banking system.  We want a debate in Ireland with all stakeholders around the table and, as Deputy Nash said, modelled on the retail consultation forum that would provide it with a bit of order and allow for a discussion.<\/p> <p>  In respect of Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell's points, the orderly wind-down is something we will work with as long as the bank changes its behaviour.  The behaviour displayed right up to and beyond the announcement is not acceptable.  We will commit to an orderly wind-down.  We are not interested in causing any disruption to the banking system but this is contingent on the banks behaving in a manner that is reflective of us as a society and not just driving on with change regardless of the impact on communities and jobs.  One of the points made by Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell is probably one of the most relevant and one I understand the bank will confirm today.  It relates to the impact on the mental health of staff.  Week after week, staff asked questions.  They were given information to give to customers that they told us they did not even believe so how could we expect the customers to believe it?  As time went on and the questions grew louder, people were impacted.  I believe the bank will confirm that today.  There are regulatory authorities in terms of how health and safety at work is governed and they should seek a copy of this committee's deliberations in that regard in respect of staff's health and safety.  It is a really important issue.  It was clear that the way the bank decided to do this and the behaviour it displayed was all about protecting the bank and that staff and customers were left hanging out to dry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connell.

There will be no immediate change for customers, with full banking services continuing across all channels for existing and new customers.  We will not be closing any branches this year on the back of the announcements.  There will be no new compulsory redundancy departures this year.  We have announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding with AIB for the sale of the portfolio of performing commercial loans of about &euro;4 billion and the transfer of colleagues who are wholly or mainly assigned to this loan book.  We have also confirmed that we are in discussions with PTSB, among other strategic banking counterparties, regarding certain retail and SME assets, liabilities and operations.  Our preference is to continue to focus our discussions with counterparties that can provide customers with full banking services in the Irish market.<\/p> <p>  The past five months have been very difficult and upsetting for our colleagues and our customers.  The uncertainty that the review has brought, combined with the ongoing pandemic have been extremely challenging.  Speculation appeared in the media in September and we were left in the difficult situation of not being able to update colleagues, which would be our preferred way of doing things, due to the fact that the review was under way and not completed and its outcome was uncertain.  There was a requirement to conduct discussions in a manner that ensured commercial sensitivity and confidentiality.  In the latter stages of the review process we were subject to additional restrictions that prevented us from discussing the review further until there was a board decision that could be publicly announced to the market.<\/p> <p>  I thank the members of the committee and we are now happy to take questions.  I caution the members, however, that some matters that may be raised might be commercially sensitive and could impact on negotiations which are under way regarding the transfer of parts of our business.

I put on the record that I think the way workers have been treated is outrageous.  They were not engaged with until the last moment and were kept in the dark.  We were told some 40 workers are fighting for their jobs and against compulsory redundancy.  Will the witnesses enlighten the committee about the status of those workers and perhaps give a commitment that there will be no compulsory redundancies in their case?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the withdrawal of NatWest Bank from the Irish market, in the past decade the bank sunk a great deal of money into bad loans and capital write-offs and losses and invested in technology and corporate restructuring.  Why was a decision made to withdraw now?  Is it a case of NatWest Bank believing there will be future losses?  Are the prevailing interest rates and current financial structure of the market prohibitive for continued engagement?  Has the Irish Government worked with the bank in any way to try to provide some level of structure to make continued engagement in the Irish market possible?<\/p> <p>  We have heard from the representatives of the workers regarding the virtual wholesale reduction of the physical presence of Ulster Bank in the State, especially branches in regional and rural areas.

Regarding engagement that may have taken place with the Government, how many times did the CEO of NatWest Bank meet with representatives of the Central Bank of Ireland in the past year?  Were they able to discuss this matter and address concerns?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the staff and the treatment of workers, I am concerned about the pensions of those staff who have already retired from Ulster Bank and how current staff may be impacted in this regard.  Another important point was brought to my attention by an 85-year-old resident of Dundrum who contacted me because she was wondering if her ATM card will continue to work next Monday in the bank.  People are also wondering, more forcefully, what will happen to their mortgages and business accounts.  What is Ulster Bank doing now in respect of those who want to switch?  How is that process being facilitated, how is Ulster Bank working with those customers who have very understandable concerns about the future of their bank accounts and what more can be done?<\/p> <p>  Like everyone else, we are extremely disappointed by this move.

They had to read about the potential risk to their jobs in the newspapers as far back as last September.  Over the past ten to 15 years, Ulster Bank staff have experienced what could be termed restructuring fatigue.  The witnesses will be aware of this situation, given all the processes which the bank instituted in recent years regarding consolidating the business.<\/p> <p>  Reviews and strategic reviews generally involve the whole of the business.  It is clear to those of us who have been following this matter closely, and of course to the FSU, which represents the bulk of Ulster Bank staff in Ireland, that there was no engagement worth the name with the staff of Ulster Bank.  They are the people most immediately affected by the decision NatWest has made to exit this market.<\/p> <p>  Frankly, the way the parent organisation, NatWest, and the witnesses, as direct employers, treated staff in Ulster Bank was an insult.  The staff deserved better.  I hope the witnesses will acknowledge that point and that the staff do deserve better.  I also do not accept that the staff should be expected to accept the statement made by the bank last Thursday regarding no decision having been made.  That statement came only a matter of hours before the formal announcement of NatWest Bank's decision to exit the market.  That is regrettable, and the witnesses might address this matter in detail when they respond.<\/p><p>Would Ms Howard agree that for the duration of the pandemic, there should be no bank branch closures for the reasons outlined by the UK regulator, which regulates the parent organisation NatWest?  Given the bank's attitude to its staff and customers and the way it has behaved in recent months, it is fair to say that the organisation is paying lip service to any attempts we are making to change the culture of banking in this country.  In that regard, does Ms Howard believe she should resign from the Irish Banking Culture Board given the experience in recent months?<br\/><br\/>What kind of engagement has Ulster Bank had with the regulator in recent months when it was considering this decision, which appears to have all the hallmarks of a <i>fait accompli<\/i>?

As well as being a great disappointment and a cause of strife for the staff and customers of Ulster Bank, this is also a very significant decision from the point of view of the Irish public and indeed banking in Ireland.  We will now have a banking sector that is less competitive and has more dominance by the State within the three banks in which the State has shareholdings.<\/p> <p>  I ask this question of Ms Howard.  Why does Ulster Bank believe it is necessary to leave the Irish market?  I know that the chief executive of NatWest, Ms Rose, stated that the bank was unable to generate sustainable long-term returns for its shareholders.  I suppose being blunt, that means it was not satisfied with the level of profits that could be made by Ulster Bank.  Why was NatWest in the UK able to deliver a return of 9.4% on equity across the group and yet Ulster Bank in Ireland was only able to deliver a return of 2.3% on equity in 2019?  Is the high level of capital that banks in Ireland are required to hold against mortgage loans a factor in Ulster Bank leaving the Irish market?  Was the elevated level of risk-weighted assets required for Irish banks a factor that contributed to Ulster Bank's decision to leave the Irish market?<\/p> <p>  Does Ulster Bank believe that another recession may be coming and is it concerned about its loans in the Irish market because of the historical failures with loans made here previously?  I would appreciate an honest assessment as to why Ulster Bank is leaving.  Ulster Bank has been in Ireland for 170 years.  Why do banks that come to Ireland or stay in Ireland seem to find it more difficult to make profits to the same extent that banks in the UK or in other European Union countries can?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#F00200","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I apologise for being slightly late and this question might have been asked.

The treatment of customers and staff has been unacceptable.  I question the idea that a final decision had not been made because it is very clear that many decisions were being made.  I ask Ms Howard to comment on the withdrawal from the sustainable banking forum and the disbanding of Ulster Bank's sustainable banking committee in December.  Was it at that point that it became clear that sustaining of banking services in Ireland was no longer on the table?  Over the past two or three years Ulster Bank has sold a substantial number of its loan books.  In particular, &euro;800 million in non-performing loans were sold to the US vulture fund, CarVal.<\/p> <p>  Ms Howard spoke about the performing loan book.  My concern is over what gets categorised as non-performing.  In the case of that loan book, some of the properties that were categorised as non-performing had been non-performing for just 12 months.  Given the pandemic, is there a danger of a large number of loans being categorised as non-performing?  Is Ulster Bank considering selling the non-performing loans to vulture funds?  What screening will it apply to ensure it does not skew the assessment of non-performing loans?<\/p> <p>  I am also concerned about branch closures.  We have heard of listening exercises.  The bank needs to engage with a number of people and not simply listen to them.  In those smaller decisions along the way, how does Ulster Bank plan to be more active in engaging on decisions before decision points?  For example, Ulster Bank customers have been told that if their mortgages are being transferred to a new provider, they will be told in advance by letter and email.  How far in advance will they be told?  Will there be a mechanism to allow them to transfer their loan if they would prefer not to have it transferred to a provider of Ulster Bank's choosing? <\/p> <p>  I am also concerned about loan schemes, including the micro credit guarantee scheme, the Covid-19 guarantee scheme and business loan schemes, where the State has supported Ulster Bank's lending.  Is that something that has been looked at and engaged with? <\/p> <p>  Ulster Bank has very significant landmark properties in a number of parts of Ireland, including Sligo, Letterkenny and Kilkenny.  Is there engagement with local authorities as well as with banks on those properties?  We hope those branches will remain active as bank branches.  There are many decisions within these decisions.  It would have been constructive if there had been engagement on the many decisions that led us to this point.  It is important to have engagement with all relevant stakeholders in the decisions that come next.  I ask Ms Howard to address that.  I also ask her to address how non-performing loans will be approached.  Is it Ulster Bank's intention to engage with vulture funds? <\/p> <p>  Ms Howard said there would be no new compulsory redundancies.  As others said, I hope that Ulster Bank will give us a commitment not to carry out branch closures during the pandemic and not to have compulsory redundancies during the pandemic especially given that we know there are limits on redundancy entitlements during this time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#F00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Howard to the committee.  We are meeting under very difficult and disappointing circumstances.  I echo the sentiments of my colleague and I think the committee speaks as one.  What NatWest and Ulster Bank did to its staff was deplorable and unacceptable, and it should not have happened.  Can Ms Howard give the committee an assurance that Ulster Bank is not in negotiations or discussions with any so-called vulture fund on the sale of any of the loan book in the Ulster Bank portfolio?<\/p><p>Can she give us a commitment that will continue?  Will the bank management also outline to us the composition of the Ulster Bank loan book and in particular what portion of it is tracker mortgages?  The figures we are trying to put together indicate that the loan book is in the region of &euro;21 billion with &euro;14.5 billion of that being mortgages, of which &euro;6.5 billion are tracker mortgages.  I see some of the witnesses are nodding.  If those are the figures, are there any discussions on the tracker mortgage book, which may not be the most sought-after book in the market?  Can the management give us any breakdown, perhaps subsequently in written form, on the composition of the loan book both in terms of mortgages but also the business loan book and what portions of it are performing and non-performing?<\/p><p> I understand that the memorandum of understanding the bank has entered into with AIB concerns &euro;4 billion of the loan book.  I would like to hear some detail about the composition of that.  From the figures we have, the business book breaks down into just over &euro;6 billion with &euro;3.4 billion being corporate, &euro;1.3 billion specialised and &euro;1.6 billion in SME lending.  Is AIB just looking at the cream, the corporate and specialised business, or does this involve some of the SME lending as well?  I would appreciate getting some of the figures on that, where the memorandum of understanding is concerned.<\/p><p> Ulster Bank's decision to withdraw is a terrible one for staff, for customers and for the regions dependent on its branches, but it is also a terrible one for banking in this State.  It is a great decision for the investors in NatWest because they will now reap &euro;4 billion of freed-up capital, which is going to see dividends to shareholders increase at the expense of the banking system in this State, and at the expense of the people who fattened up this bank for over 160 years and who made millions and billions of euro in profit during the period for its shareholders, investors, senior staff and all the rest.  It is going to be a very difficult time.  Has there been any initial assessment within the bank of the competition issues which may arise, particularly from the memorandum of understanding with AIB?  I ask because AIB and Bank of Ireland will now have over 90% of SME lending in the State and challenges could arise from there.<\/p><p> On the staff, has an assessment been done within the bank of the portion of staff who can be assigned to each of the loan books?  I refer, in other words, to the portion of staff who would be assigned to the &euro;4 billion which is under consideration by AIB and the portion who would be assigned in relation to the tracker mortgage book and other books.  Has the bank given an undertaking that it will sell those loan books in accordance with the current transfer of undertakings legislation, under which staff follow the loan books?  I ask the management to outline to the committee what will happen to the 600 staff in the North who are servicing the workings of the bank in the South.<\/p><p> Finally, Ulster Bank had significant problems.  We dealt with the bank as part of the tracker mortgage scandal.  It was probably the worst in the class when it came to putting money back into people's accounts, making the payments and so on.  That has now been dealt with.  There were also huge technical glitches with the bank.  The bank had a larger risk-weighted assets ratio than any other bank in the State and therefore it was obliged to carry a huge amount of capital.  Is that not the core reason the bank is withdrawing from the State?  If we had capital ratios which were close to the European norm or indeed to what is happening in Britain, would NatWest's decision on Ulster Bank have been any different?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#F00500","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I wish to ask questions on three topics: profits and profitability, the vulture funds, and the workers and their treatment.<\/p> <p>  On profits and profitability, is the bank withdrawing from the Irish market because it is unprofitable - profits are not being made in the market - or is it withdrawing because sufficient profits are not being made from Ulster Bank's operations in Ireland?  I understand a sum of &euro;3.5 billion in surplus capital has been transferred by the bank to NatWest over the course of the last four years, approximately.  I would like to hear how the management justifies the exit from the Irish market and all that means in terms of precarity for over 1 million customers, the communities serviced by 88 branches and nearly 3,000 workers.  How can the pressure being placed on all those people - customers, communities and workers - be justified when &euro;3.5 billion in surplus capital has been transferred to the UK operation over the last four years?<\/p> <p>  What discussions have been had or contacts made with the vulture funds concerning the sale of the bank, or any portion of it, since the process began?  I have a very specific question.  Whatever discussions have taken place in the past, I ask for a commitment that from this point on the bank will give a commitment to the people that it will not sell the bank, or any portion of the bank or its operations to a vulture fund or funds.  Are the management willing to give that commitment to the committee today?<\/p> <p>  On the workforce, the 2,800 affected workers have been treated appallingly by the bank.  One level upon which the appalling treatment can be measured is the negative impact of recent events on the mental health of the workforce.  Would the management accept and will it comment on the adverse mental effects this saga has had on those workers?  Does the management accept that the way this is playing out has had an adverse effect on the mental health of those workers?

They should not feel aggrieved.  This is not a personal issue; it is something that concerns banking facilities in the country.  We appreciate that some of the witnesses may themselves be negatively affected by the proposals as well.  We appreciate also that 40 or so people were identified as being redundant from the start and we sympathise.<\/p><p>I know sympathy is not a great deal of benefit to anybody but let it be restated that we, the humble representatives of the people, have two gripes, for want of a better description.  The first concerns the reluctance of NatWest and Ulster Bank to speak to this committee beforehand.  This is something that could easily have been done.  Even if it was only a public relations exercise, it would have been an indication that they were human, concerned and willing to meet the representatives of the people in order to reassure them, but that was not the intention.<\/p><p> I raised the notion of a \"phased\" and \"orderly\" withdrawal with the unions earlier.  I do not believe there is such a thing.  I believe the intention is much more harsh than that and I am concerned about it.  It will create serious problems for industry, for banking and for a resolution of this particular issue.  If possible, I want to identify the witnesses' interpretation of a phased, orderly withdrawal.  I am not so sure that is possible or even intended.  I ask that there be no progression of branch closures during the Covid pandemic, which is both a health and economic crisis.  We can ill afford to have to deal with yet another problem at this time.<\/p><p> The Central Bank has been raised on a number of occasions.  This committee met representatives of the Central Bank which seemed to be, like us, unable to engage resolutely with NatWest or Ulster Bank in terms of identifying how best to transfer.  A lot of my constituents are customers of Ulster Bank.  There is a huge network of branches across my constituency.  From the east coast of Ireland, through the centre of the country and across to the west coast, Ulster Bank has a significant presence and there is enormous dependency on it.  Where is that business going to go now?  My worst fear is that the business will be broken up under various headings, some of which will be saleable and some not.  It may be possible to create a third banking force within the country which, in turn, will be able to carry on business in the same way that Ulster Bank did in the past.<\/p><p> Finally, I wish to refer to the administrative changes taking place and the move towards centralisation.  This situation may well be seen by the other pillar banks as an opportunity for increased emphasis on centralisation, with everybody moving to a national hub and speaking from there, out to the people.  That would be a bad decision in my view.  Withdrawing from the people from whom the banks gain their profits is not a good thing to do.  It is highly suspect and I would have a strong objection to it.  Perhaps an orderly, phased withdrawal will result in an attempt to make an alternative banking system available to the people who were previously served by Ulster Bank.  The same provision should also apply to the staff of Ulster Bank who have faithfully discharged their duties in this country and will continue to do so in an any entity that is found to be fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#G00300","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":704,"content":"<p>There were a number of speakers before me and if there is one thing I dislike, it is repeating questions that have already been asked.  I will try not to do that.  I welcome the fact that the witnesses have come before this committee today.  I know this is something that we had asked for.  The witnesses acknowledged that in their opening statement.  We had been asking that they appear before us for some time because this has been a very worrying time for staff who have been dealing with a huge amount of uncertainty.  In our engagement earlier today with the unions, I referred to the very real impact this must have had on the mental health of staff and the unions agreed.  The fact that there was not earlier engagement and that information was being leaked to the media has had a huge impact on the mental health of staff.  It is outrageous that they were hearing about their livelihoods from the media.  This should never have been the case, especially in these already uncertain times, both economically and personally for everyone.<\/p> <p>  Some staff have raised with me their concerns in relation to compulsory redundancies, which was also raised earlier.  The opening statement refers to the fact that the risk ratios and capital requirements inhibited the bank's ability to make a profit.  Would the witnesses argue that the risk ratios and capital buffers, which I am not suggesting are not necessary, put the bank at a competitive disadvantage relative to other banks who did not have such requirements?  I would also be interested to hear who, apart from the two main pillar banks, the witnesses would have seen as Ulster Bank's biggest long-term competitor if it had stayed in the Irish market.  <\/p> <p>  I have been contacted by a number of people who have mortgages with Ulster Bank and they are very concerned.  What is the status of customers who have been given mortgage approval in principle?  What is the situation with regard to switching lenders for those customers who do not want to have their mortgages sold to a purchaser of Ulster Bank's choosing?  Will such customers have to pay switching costs or will those fees be waived?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#H00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I wish to add a few more questions to the list.  Goldman Sachs apparently had a role in this decision.  What were the terms of reference given to Goldman Sachs?  What was it asked to investigate?  What was its role?  Is it too late to reverse this decision?  Do the witnesses think the decision was the correct one?  Do they have a view on it?  Do they have a view on the work undertaken by Goldman Sachs?<\/p> <p>  I wish to turn now to the meeting with the Minister for Finance in October 2020 and the meeting between Howard Davies of NatWest and the Minister on 17 December.  At each of those meetings, the importance of the staff and of the bank to the Irish economy was stressed by the Minister.  The decision that has been made is an appalling one that will have wide-ranging effects on the Irish economy and the SME sector.  The next steps that Ulster Bank takes will decide the future of many businesses in this country.  Therefore, the Government should have been far more vigilant.  I would like to have further engagement with the witnesses on those next steps and how the bank is going to deal with these matters.  What is the nature of the understanding with AIB?  I note that it is a non-binding understanding; likewise with Permanent TSB.  What does the bank intend to do about its difficult loans?  Will it enter into discussions with the likes of iCare Housing or Home For Life?  Will it enter into discussions with those that are broadly accepted as ethical funds?  When I say \"ethical funds\" I do not use the same definition as AIB because it dealt with a fund recently that is far from ethical.  What plans have been advanced to deal with distressed loans in Ulster Bank?  In the last few weeks we have received emails from customers of the bank about home possessions.  The legal firm representing the bank has been contacting various customers.<\/p><p>Some of those customers are elderly and others are sick.  Some of them believed they already had an engagement with the bank and an agreement in terms of how they were dealing with their distressed loan or mortgage.  Indeed, one of the customers committed suicide and that has to be taken into account.  We are talking about mental health here; not only the mental health of staff, but the mental health of customers with whom the bank is dealing.  There is no doubt that the actions of the bank have caused further difficulty for some customers.  What does the bank do with that cohort of people?  It has managed to speak to AIB and PTSB.  I hope it has reached out to the ethical funds that would assist in the restructuring of these loans to allow people to get on with their lives.<br\/><br\/>An article written by Brian Carey and Niall Brady was published in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>last week.  Its description of how Ms Howard was treated at the most recent meeting of the committee which she attended was interesting.  The journalists suggested that the behaviour of the committee and the rough discourse of the parliamentary engagement may have contributed to the wind-down of Ulster Bank.  I would like Ms Howard to call out that nonsense.  The committee was doing its job and defending the bank's customers and staff at that stage.<br\/><br\/>My next question relates to Ulster Bank and the properties.  The bank owns various branches around the country.  Does it actually own the properties or is it leasing them?  How are they to be offloaded?<br\/><br\/>I ask Ms Howard to comment on the issue of commercial mortgages.  I understand that, according to the Central Bank, they are included in the tracker scheme.  If that is a fact, enforcement proceedings should not commence in respect of those loans.  I ask for an update on the general process of legal proceedings within the bank.  Will those enforcement proceedings for commercial trackers be stopped?  How will the bank engage with that cohort of customers?  How will it deal with the legal cases currently under way against the bank, of which there are several?  How will that be dealt with?  Will it be dealt with by NatWest or by some other part of the organisation?<br\/><br\/>On the issue of vulture funds, when Ulster Bank sold various loans to vulture funds in the past, was the bank paid hard cash for those loans or does it have an ongoing benefit from the process in terms of a share of profits or whatever arrangement that might be?  The committee needs to hear from Ms Howard on that issue because of the numbers now involved.<br\/><br\/>I call Ms Howard to field those questions.  Any member of her team may answer the questions.  I ask that the answers be delivered as precisely as the questions were delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#H00300","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":707,"content":"<p>I apologise, but I have not seen the article to which the Chairman has referred.  However, it can be put on record that I was treated very respectfully by the committee the last time I appeared before it and I have no problem at all with the way questions were addressed to me or anything else.  I am sorry that I was not aware of the article, but I think I have made clear that I was treated very respectfully.<\/p> <p>  I will be joined by my colleagues in responding to the questions.  Several of the questions referred to colleagues.  On the issue of communication and the reference to how colleagues have been treated, the way this was communicated was not the way that anybody would have wanted.  I have personally apologised to our colleagues for the fact that they have had to live with this uncertainty for five months while dealing with a pandemic and trying to serve our customers in the best way possible.  During that time, I have met many colleagues and listened to their concerns.  Where we have been able to address those concerns, we have done so, but the biggest concerns most people had related to wanting to know the outcome of the decision.  It was that uncertainty that was causing challenges for people, as well as stress in many cases.  I absolutely understand how difficult that was for our people.  We have got the outcome of that decision.  We got it on Friday, 19 February.<\/p> <p>  When the decision was announced, I announced three things on Friday to try to address some of the uncertainty: first, that there will be no new compulsory exits this year; second, that there will be no branch closures this year; and, third, that under the memorandum of understanding we reached with AIB, although it is only a memorandum and needs to become binding when we get to that stage, colleagues will travel with the work, to use that expression, as long as their role is mainly or wholly associated with it.  That gives some degree of certainty, but I am very aware that it does not give all the certainty that people need.  We are in the very early days in terms of conversations with Permanent TSB and others.  Similarly, the memorandum of understanding is in its early days.<\/p> <p>  We will be engaging fully on this issue.  We do not yet have all the answers, but we will be engaging with stakeholders in the coming weeks and months as we work through how to withdraw from the markets carefully and in an orderly way.  Now that we have a decision, we have established regular communication sessions with colleagues.  These are two-way engagement sessions.  We have large-scale communications through which everybody can hear a consistent message and ask their questions.  Obviously, we also have smaller groups because many people prefer to have conversations in a smaller group.  That is what we have done.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely recognise how difficult this has been and still is for those affected until they understand what it means for them.  One of our core objectives is to minimise the number of job losses.  That is why we have reached the memorandum of understanding with AIB.  It will be core to any negotiations we have with banking counterparts here.  On that note, I will see if Ms McDonagh, our director of HR, wishes to add anything in terms of the welfare of our colleagues in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane Howard"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I will pick up on the issue that has been raised about the 40 compulsory redundancies that exist today.

Some of those colleagues have secured other jobs in the bank, while others have left the bank on a voluntary basis.  Several colleagues remain at risk of compulsory redundancy.

I will move on to customers, where there were a number of issues raised that will impact them, including things like branches, poor-performing loans, switching, and customers who have got a mortgage which may be in the process of being dealt with.  I am going to seek to address those ones now.<\/p> <p>  Speaking first about our branches, I appreciate that some of this relates to the buildings, although clearly service matters as well to our customers.  We are in the early days of conversations with Permanent TSB and the other banks, and this is really about retail banking and our smaller business customers.  When I described retail banking in my opening statement, it includes things like mobile banking, online branches, telephony and the services we offer such as current accounts, deposit accounts, mortgages and so on.  All of those aspects would be discussed as part of any negotiations.  We are only in the early days at the moment.  I am conscious this is a very difficult decision on many fronts, especially branches.  I know there are certainly two areas where we would have the last branch in a particular town, so that is something that we are very thoughtful about.   As I say, it is early days.  In terms of our branches and discussions, it is something we would want to be negotiating on because we know how important the branch service is, particularly to customers who may have different vulnerabilities.  We are in discussion and engagement, and this point was made very clearly.  Now that we have a decision,we will be engaging and it is in our interests to engage on the difficult parts of this decision as well so that we can, where possible, work with and alongside stakeholders to come to an acceptable decision.<\/p> <p>  As to our branches, some are leasehold and some are freehold, and it will be part of our negotiations also.  We are very aware that there are a couple of places at least where our presence there is the last bank, so this is very important.  We are in the early days and there are things that will be taken into account and, ultimately, as somebody said already, they may want us to come back.  We would be more than happy to come back as and when we work our way through negotiations and come to a point where we have a memorandum of understanding and ultimately arrive at a final decision.<\/p> <p>  Is there anything Ms Arnett would like to add to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane Howard"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Howard.  One of the committee members raised the point of the customer protection code and how it comes into play in the announcement and communications that we have right now.  It is important to say that we would prepare for any of these types of announcements on a scenario basis so that we are ready to engage very quickly with customers to ensure that, in line with the code, we are acting very fairly and communicating very professionally and honestly, etc.  The code specifies very clearly the sort of standards that the Central Bank would expect in our communications with customers.  In preparing for any of a range of announcements, that clarity is extremely important, as is being very clear with customers from the get-go that, today and in the immediate future, there is no change in respect of the services we are providing to customers.  If a person is, for example, under offer for a mortgage and about to sign off for a new home etc., then that product is still available to him or her.  That continuity beyond the announcement is there for customers, which is of great importance.  No action needs to be taken immediately on that.<\/p> <p>  Equally, on Friday we commenced a process of proactive outreach to vulnerable customers.  This is something we have done quite a bit during the Covid-19 period and have become quite efficient at because of everything that has happened in recent months.  We commenced that process because one of the things that always concerns us is frauds and scams.  It is very important we have begun that outreach to customers because, with the best will in the world, when it comes to emailing or writing letters directly to a million customers, it takes about a week for that kind of activity to drop, which is really pushing it.  Over the weekend we put some adverts in the broadsheet newspapers with that very clear customer message.  The vulnerable customer outreach activity of is of great importance to the activity we have and will continue along that vein.  When there is information, we will proactively engage with customers in the clearest way we can, especially paying extra attention to our vulnerable customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Arnett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I wish to pick up on the question about customers who have what may be described as non-performing loans or who have financial difficulties.  Our number one priority in supporting these customers is to help them get onto a sustainable solution.  That has been and remains our priority.  I have quoted in the past that, where we are able to engage with customers, then in four out of five cases we can find a solution that works for that customer, but it is very much an individual case because people's cases are very different.  We want to and will continue with that because it is good for customers and for the bank.  We are keen to do that, in particular because Covid-19 has caused challenges for almost everybody, but we have had to help customers with payment breaks.  Fortunately, many of those customers have been able to return to paying but some have not.  We very much want to continue what we are doing today, and to any customers who may be listening, I urge them to contact us.  We look at each customer on an individual basis, we understand his or her circumstances, and we look for solutions that mean we will keep the customer in his or her home and with a solution that works for him or her.  That is our priority and does not change.  The fact this is a phased withdrawal over a number of years means we can continue to support in that way.  That is the priority for our customers who find themselves in financial difficulty.<\/p> <p>  One of the other questions raised was about switching.  I will touch on that briefly and one of my colleagues may want to add something to that.  One of the things we are quite concerned about with mortgages is that we have had some low rates and still have some of the lower rates.  We have communicated as clearly and as consistently as we could that there is no need for customers to take any action.  There are no immediate changes, whether to the branch network or the fact we offer a full service and will continue to do that.  Therefore, all contracts that are in place remain in place.  We do have some of the lowest rates, and customers who are in the fortunate position that they can overpay on their mortgage can do so if they have a mortgage with us.  We need to ensure customers do not move and potentially make a decision which means they will be worse off.<\/p><p>That is why we have been quite clear that there is no need for anybody to take any action.  We will be communicating with customers.  As, if and when we do sell the mortgage portfolio, customers are protected under the consumer protection code, which was touched on a moment ago in response to a question.  So all protections will travel with customers on to a third party.  As I said earlier, our preference is absolutely to work with banks that offer a full banking service here in Ireland.  So there is no need for customers to take action.  We have tried to make that as clear as we can.  We want to make sure that customers realise that.  As and when the decisions are made, all of their protections will travel with them.<\/p><p> There is also another aspect on the switcher, making it a phased withdrawal, and our discussions with Permanent TSB and others.  One of the things that we are starting to turn our attention to is how we make switching as easy as possible.  There are other countries such as the UK and the Netherlands, in particular, where they have a switching capability that is easier.  So we started to look at that this week to understand what could be done in this country to make switching easier for customers.  The message is that people do not need to take any action.  It is business as usual, and we will be writing out to all of our customers - we have already started that - to support them as we go forward.  I hope that answers the questions that we have in terms of the switcher.<\/p><p> On mortgages, I know there is a concern about customers who may be actually in the process, if I can use that phrase, who may have come to us for a mortgage and not yet completed it.  As I have made it clear, it is business as usual.  We continue to offer a full service, and we will be supporting our customers through that process until their mortgage completes.  I think I have answered most of the customer questions.  Have I missed anything?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane Howard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":716,"content":"<p>Will Ms Howard comment on the Goldman Sachs issue, and on the ethical funds?

In terms of the reviews that we have conducted, there is a strategic review and it is a continuous activity, not just in our banks but, I would imagine, in all industries when the pace of change is so fast.  Goldman Sachs acted as an adviser to NatWest.  I do not have much more detail than that on it.  I do know that the strategic review considered a range of strategic options.  Now that we have a decision, my purpose, as the CEO here, is absolutely on ensuring that we withdraw safely and in an orderly fashion, and help two core objectives.  One is to help our customers to move to a new bank as safely and as seamlessly as possible.  Two is to minimise job losses, and where we cannot, to support our colleagues with reskilling on an individual basis in terms of what is right for them.  Goldman Sachs acts as adviser to NatWest to support it in the strategic review.<\/p> <p>  The decision was made because Ulster Bank is not able to generate long-term returns at an acceptable level, and I recognise that.  That is not a new thing.  It has been a challenge for us over recent years.  One of the biggest factors is negative interest rates and low interest rates which make it a bigger challenge in terms of income.  Also, on the costs side, we are competing with new entrants and it is important that we have things like a mobile app, the ability to purchase a home online, and other technological capabilities to compete with those dimensions.  As I would see it, one of the bigger issues we face is the income challenge, which is not helped in an environment with very low and negative interest rates that looks like it is going to continue over the longer term.

It might be worthwhile looking at a report the Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, issued last week.  That, rather than me going through the details of it here, explains better how Ireland stands in that regard.  The levels are quite in excess.  In the UK, mortgages with risk weighted assets are sold in the mid-teens whereas here we are probably heading to near 40%, and that gives a flavour of the amount of capital in that.

Quite a number of Deputies and Senators raised the question of capital and risk weighted assets, and they are one in the same.  The high level of risk weighted assets drives the amount of capital.  It is not just Ulster Bank that is required to keep, but other banks in the domestic market as well.  As one of the Deputies said, those levels are certainly higher than in the UK and, indeed, higher than many countries in Europe as well.  That impacts obviously on a shareholder's return on capital.  I pointed out that the BPFI issued a report last week, and a number of members will probably have seen it or been through it, that highlights the causes of the difference and shows the comparisons across Europe.  I suggested to the Chairman that it is probably worth, through the BPFI, getting more in-depth feedback on the issues there and what is happening.  It certainly is a feature of the levels of returns not just with Ulster Bank but indeed other Irish banks in the market here.<\/p> <p>  There was a reference to the dividend paid and it is probably worth clarifying this point.  On the &euro;3.5 billion of dividends that have been paid back to the shareholder, and the Deputy is quite correct about the level paid back, as I have described previously when I have been in front of the committee, those are not related really to the levels of profit that the bank is generating.  A point was made by Ms Howard earlier that the levels of profit are very low.  Again, one of the highlights from the previous committee meeting was that the 2% or 2.3% returns on equity and the levels of profit the bank is making did not drive those dividend payments.  What drove those redistribution payments was the &euro;15 billion of capital that came in from UK taxpayers into Ulster Bank to stabilise the bank during very difficult times.  Helpfully, the amount of capital that was needed in that regard, as it has turned out, is probably less than was anticipated at the time.  Those excess levels of capital are what will allow that distribution to take place, not the actual earnings of the bank itself.  I have said this before when I have been in with the committee, so just to clarify that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Stanley"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":723,"content":"<p>A number of members have indicated that they have further questions so, with the limited time left, I am going to go back to the members.

My concern is that 2020 or a 12-month period which includes the pandemic could be used to categorise either SME loans or mortgage loans as non-performing.

I am not asking the witnesses to disclose who the interests are at this point in time.  Where do they see that going?  Some would argue that the tracker mortgages are loss-making.  They are not loss-making but I ask them to comment on that because there are many people out there with mortgages.<\/p> <p>  Ms Howard said nobody should panic, and I agree with that, but there are 1.1 million depositors within Ulster Bank.  There is much talk of negative interest rates being applied.  Ulster Bank applied negative interest rates last year and AIB and Bank of Ireland are applying negative interest rates on higher deposits of &euro;1 million and above.  There are now discussions about negative interest rates on smaller deposits, particularly given that &euro;21 billion will need to find a home shortly.  Can Ulster Bank give any reassurance to depositors that it is engaging with other lenders, in order that their deposits will not end up in negative interest accounts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021022300002#M00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":727,"content":"<p>Ms Howard might just give a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer to this.

I am joined online by my colleagues, Professor Rose Anne Kenny, Professor J.B. Walsh, Dr. John Faul and Dr. Martin Healy.<br\/><br\/>There is now an extensive body of international research showing the protective role of vitamin D against Covid-19 and supporting the need for population supplementation at higher doses than those currently recommended.  For example, very large background studies pooling data from dozens of individual trials have described an approximately 10% reduction in risk of respiratory infection among people taking vitamin D supplements, and a more than 50% reduction in risk among those with low vitamin D levels to begin with, especially if taking supplements daily.  Therefore, there is very robust evidence that vitamin D protects against respiratory infections in general.  That is not in question.<br\/><br\/>Since May 2020, geographic studies have shown that Covid-19 incidence and mortality are higher in countries that are far away from the equator and in countries with confirmed low vitamin D status.  Furthermore, the population groups who are most likely to be vitamin D deficient are the same groups who have suffered the worst effects of Covid-19.  These include older adults, those from black, Asian and minority ethnic, BAME, communities and those who are obese or who have pre-existing diseases, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.  The unifying characteristic of these different groups is that they are all much more likely to be vitamin D deficient.  It is also clear that the pro-inflammatory blood profiles seen in vitamin D deficiency foretell the aggressive, overwhelming so-called cytokine storm that has claimed the lives of so many Covid-19 patients.<br\/><br\/>Long before we had any data showing a direct relationship between low vitamin D levels and Covid-19 incidence and severity, we already had strong evidence to support the likelihood of such a relationship.  From May 2020, data showing a direct relationship between low vitamin D status and increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe disease and death began to emerge.  These studies included work by Dr. Faul in Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, which clearly showed much higher ICU admission rates in patients with low vitamin D levels.<br\/><br\/>Are these relationships causal?  There are now several studies published showing lower rates of ICU admission, ventilation and death in those given vitamin D during their admission.  There is also an unpublished public health initiative in Andalucia, Spain, which has demonstrated a remarkable reduction in Covid-19 mortality since vitamin D supplementation of vulnerable older adults started there in mid-November.  Yet, despite the now dozens of positive studies including tens of thousands of participants, there has been no policy change in Ireland to advance what we believe to be an extremely low risk, readily implemented, cheap and potentially highly effective intervention to mitigate this public health crisis.  While some have called for randomised, placebo-controlled trials to prove definitively the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and reduced risk, these are now ethically untenable, they are often imprecise and they are wholly impractical in the current crisis given the time required to execute them properly.  They are also unnecessary.  One need only think of the spectacular success of the workplace smoking ban to realise that not every effective public health intervention requires a placebo-controlled RCT behind it.  As Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO stated early in the pandemic:<\/p> <blockquote> \tBe fast, have no regrets.  You must be the first mover.  The virus will always get you if you don&rsquo;t move quickly.  If you need to be right before you move, you will never win.  Perfection is the enemy of the good when it comes to emergency management.  Speed trumps perfection. <\/blockquote> <p>My colleagues, who the committee will hear from today, are not just the top clinicians in the country, they are people of international stature in their specialist fields.  Just as importantly, though, they are leaders who have had the integrity, the moral courage and the ethical compass to pursue this issue and to advocate for policy change in this area which will protect the Irish public.  They have weighed the pros and cons of changing current policy on vitamin D supplementation and they are in unanimous agreement that the benefits of a new policy will far outweigh the very minor costs.<br\/><br\/>We are very privileged to share with the committee today this information that has the potential to save many lives over the coming months, but we also must recognise that we are all standing in a moment.  As domain experts, we can provide the committee with the information and the context, but the political decisions and recommendations which flow from today&rsquo;s meeting must be the right ones, and the policy actions into which they translate must be delivered swiftly and decisively to alter the trajectory of this pandemic and to save lives.  The imperative to act quickly and courageously has never been more profound nor the rewards greater.  What we are asking of the committee today is leadership, the leadership required to enhance vitamin D policy as a central element of our living with Covid-19 strategy, and to steer us a better course out of this crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Daniel McCartney"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":755,"content":"<p>Thank you.

With regard to the condition known as Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, where the immune system attacks the nervous system, would a supplementation of the immune system lead to a greater chance of that condition occurring?  I happen to know of at least five people who have suffered from that condition in the past two years.

We have data from geographic studies, laboratory studies and observational clinical studies where we look at people who have SARS-CoV-2 infection and evaluate their clinical course.  Latterly, we also have information coming from intervention trials with vitamin D supplementation so there is much evidence there that suggests that at least in the context of immunological problems that could predispose somebody to worse infection, vitamin D confers an advantage.  Is there is a down side?  I will bring Professor Kenny in on this.  There are certainly situations where one needs to be careful with vitamin D but for most people, this is extremely safe.  I will bring Professor Kenny in to talk more about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Daniel McCartney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":759,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to respond.  In respect of his first question, there are no symptoms of deficiency as such, unless the vitamin D deficiency is very low, so the Deputy will not know whether or not he is deficient as I speak to him now and I certainly do not know by looking at him.  However, in the TILDA study, it was found that 60% of middle-aged adults and older persons in Ireland have insufficient vitamin D in winter.<\/p> <p>  There is no downside to taking vitamin D up to levels of 4,000 international units.  Our request and recommendation is for 800 to 1,000 international units so that is the next thing.  It has not been reported that Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is a side effect of taking vitamin D.  Whether or not Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is associated with severe deficiencies has not been reported to my knowledge.

The safety of vitamin D is well recognised.  She said that we recommend 800 to 1,000 international units.  That is what we give to our bone patients but it is recognised by the Institute of Medicine that safe levels can be up to 4,000 per day.  This is really to emphasise what Professor Kenny said.  In addition to the recent longitudinal study with which Professor Kenny was involved and which she quoted to the committee, we  also have the study involving 36,500 people in the Dublin metropolitan area published last August that showed that 70% of people living in the Dublin metropolitan area, Kildare and Wicklow are insufficient or deficient in vitamin D during the winter, which is a significant percentage, and 30% are insufficient or deficient all year round.

Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome was mentioned.  There are neuropathies and, as we know, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is a post-viral-type neuropathy so there are main neuropathies.  This is not to say we have strong evidence that vitamin D affects that but we know the severity of disease with people who get Covid is more severe among those with very low levels of vitamin D.  It is important they have vitamin D normalised a long time before they get Covid.  One does not shut the stable door after the horse has bolted.  We are still waiting for the evidence that this may be of value but we know that people with the severest form of the disease have the lowest levels of vitamin D.  We have seen this in the BAME community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Professor James Bernard Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":762,"content":"<p>Dr. Faul would like to comment on this as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Daniel McCartney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":763,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for an astute question.  The effects of vitamin D are essential.  It is a vitamin, which is a vital amine.  It is required for someone to be alive.  The original studies, which we cannot do in humans, were done in animals at the turn of the century and involved withdrawing animals from sunlight and nutrient vitamin D.  One of the problems with human studies is that even if we tell people not to take vitamin D supplements, if they go out in the sunshine, they will get vitamin D.  Dr. McCartney said that what is done in animal studies would be unethical in human studies.  If one withdrew animals from sunshine and gave them a particular diet such as that the famous single-grain experiment, which involved giving animals either corn, oats or wheat, they would not survive.  The animals who did the best were those fed corn.  It was worked out by scientists at the time - Steenbock <i>et al<\/i>in Wisconsin, details of which I can share with the committee - that it involved ultraviolet radiation of the food itself.  Even irradiating the food with ultraviolet light let the animals survive and thrive.  If one did not do this, the animals would be infertile and would not thrive.<br\/><br\/>The effects of vitamin D are thought to be beneficial in humans.  In fact with regard to the entire cereals industry in the US involving companies like Kellogg, Quaker Oats bought the patent for irradiating cereals so it could say there was vitamin D supplementation of its cereals.  As the members are aware, Quaker Oats is a well-known cereal manufacturer in the US.  It was based on that scientific knowledge that vitamin D is good for us and people should take it on a daily basis.  <br\/><br\/>Regarding the question about Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, I agree with my colleagues that we do not have enough data on that.  What we can tell the Deputy is that in the case of animals, on whom we can do experiments, animals that are vitamin D-deficient or vitamin D knockout mice have enhanced autoimmune encephalitis, an immune response that leads to a form of neurologic disease, which is the classic model.  We would guess from the models of animals that it would be worse if one was vitamin D-deficient.  Obviously, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is uncommon and is very difficult to predict but that is what we would say.  <br\/><br\/>We would also say that multiple sclerosis is similar to vitamin D deficiency and has been associated with it.  I can send the members papers on this.

We think that a recommendation and explicit guideline for adults in the Irish population to supplement 20 to 25 mcg per day, or 800 to 1,000 units per day, is absolutely essential.  We also feel that higher supplementation may be required under medical supervision in at-risk groups, such as people from the BAME communities, people who are overweight or obese, which comprises 60% of the adult population, and older people or people in nursing homes, in particular, who have notably lower vitamin D levels than the rest of the population.<\/p> <p>  The other question that may arise is whether we give vitamin D free, as is happening in the UK, to specific at-risk groups.  Do we supplement people in nursing homes, prisons or other long-term care institutions where their vitamin D levels are likely to be compromised?  There are a number of discrete populations which can be supplemented, such as, for example, people in nursing homes.

We are saying between 800 international units and 1,000 international units daily so there is not much difference.  The other reason is that our emphasis is slightly different.  A level of 30 nmol per l is a blood level for deficiency and 50 nmol per l is what we normally take as a sufficient level.  At 30 nmol per l, there is still a level of secondary hypoparathyroid and the body is struggling to raise the level.  We have 7,000 people attending our bone health clinic annually.  We aim to get everyone up to 50 nmol per l or even slightly higher because as people get older, we like them to be at a level of between 60 nmol per l and 70 nmol per l because there is a slight reduction in falls as well.  The Department recommends 600 international units daily to bring a person up to a level of 30 nmol per l.  What we are saying is take between 800 international units and 1,000 international units.  Dr. McCartney spoke of how for 800 international units one might see 20 mcg and for 1,000 international units one will see 25 mcg.  The are written in two ways but we should think of units because they are very straightforward and that is how clinicians think.  Nutritionists often think in milligrams but both measurements are often printed on bottle labels.  Between 800 international units and 1,000 international units daily is simple.  As Professor Kenny says, there is good evidence showing that people go up to 4,000 international units per day.  We do not come near that.  Having said that, I take 2,000 international units a day and I do not apologise for that.  <\/p> <p>  Fortified milk is one source.  Taking a half litre of super milk provides 400 international units in a day.  Cereals are also fortified.  Other than fortified milk and cereals, there is very little food available that provides vitamin D.  Wild salmon is a source because they feed on plankton but farmed salmon do not get that opportunity and have only one-quarter of the amount of vitamin D that wild salmon have.  That was the other source of vitamin D mentioned.  The limited number of food sources of vitamin D is the reason people are vitamin D deficient.  It is a problem for young people working in factories and hospitals.  Paradoxically, the study found a higher level of deficiency in the 36,500 younger people than in many of the older people.  We can also consider the potential level of deficiency that has arisen in recent times, with people now indoors, whether for work reasons or in environments such as nursing homes.  The study we published recently covered a five-year period.  It showed total consistency every year, with levels increasing in summer, although there was still a level of insufficiency or deficiency of 30%, and deficiency of 70% in winter.  It is a real epidemic.  We have observed the highest incidence of deficiency and insufficiency in the black, Asian and minority ethnic, BAME, communities and seen how they have been so badly struck down with Covid.  These are the kinds of issues that worry us and that is why we are here today.  We are saying this is a simple solution.  It is just giving a bit of sunshine in winter when we do not have any.<\/p> <p>  Incidentally, vitamin D supplementation is totally safe.  Of the 36,500 people in our study, only 21 patients had a level over 250 nmol per l and all of them had normal calcium.  No one had any side effects.  As regards safety, it is very rare to get high levels unless people are taking, say, 5,000 international units or 7,000 international units daily.  It is very rare to come across that.

Second, they will comply with the recommendations because, being healthcare workers, they see the value of doing that.

I had some IT problems at the beginning of the meeting so I apologise in advance if any of the points I raise have been covered.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned that there is no clear advice and no recommendations from NPHET on vitamin D supplementation.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on this in recent months, most recently a couple of weeks ago.  The Minister told me that the existing guidance on vitamin D, which was updated in November, advises adults over 65 years to take 15 g per day for bone and muscle health.  I was disappointed that the Minister for Health did not inform me of any advice in relation to Covid and the role of vitamin D in supporting a strong immune system.  The reply went on to say that NPHET had considered this matter in January and agreed that efforts should be made to increase awareness of existing guidance and that adults spending increased time indoors, etc., are also recommended to take a vitamin D supplement.  The Minister is saying that a small amount of vitamin D supplementation is recommended for bone health and NPHET is repeating the advice and saying the recommendations for vitamin D are being incorporated into wider messaging on Covid.  I have not heard that wider messaging from NPHET - I do not know if others have - but it is really important that we get that messaging very clear.  What engagement, if any, has the group had with NPHET?  This issue needs to be pursued actively by the committee.  We have seen how NPHET, while it is doing great work, can be a bit behind the curve.  It was certainly behind the curve on face masks and ventilation and it seems that is also the case with regard to the role of vitamin D.  That is a matter the committee will take up and pursue with NPHET.<\/p> <p>  Is there a country that the group would hold up as the best model in relation to the importance it attaches to vitamin D in the context of Covid specifically?

That is well worth pursuing to see if we can get better interaction there, particularly on messaging.  While direct provision of vitamin D among the population might happen in due course, these supplements are very cheap and readily available.  If the public get a clear message that they should be supplementing at X dose in the current context, they would follow up on that.<\/p> <p>  I will talk a little about Finland.<\/p><p>Certainly they have done very well on food fortification and supplementation.  We have seen the effect of this in terms of population with low vitamin D levels.  We know Finland has got many other things right in terms of public health policies and health protection.  I do not think it is any coincidence that Finland has shown not just the lowest mortality rates for Covid-19 throughout Europe but also some of the lowest incidence rates.  They are quite considerably lower than most other countries.  This is a country to follow if we can but we are some way off food fortification.  It is not something that will be done this month or this year as it is something that takes a long time to do, so supplementation is the answer.  This goes into the next question on whether fortification or supplementation is required.  At current levels of fortification, which Professor Walsh spoke about in answering the previous question, we cannot reach sufficient levels of vitamin D intake to reach optimum blood levels for immune health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Daniel McCartney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":788,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Shortall for her question.  The bottom line is that it would be very valuable in the context of today's discussions if NPHET did more than recommend raising awareness with respect to vitamin D and if there was a much more secure recommendation along the lines we have been discussing with respect to vitamin D.  Individuals in NPHET are aware of the value of vitamin D and the science behind it but we have heard nothing consistently solid from NPHET in terms of a public statement with respect to this.  To give committee members an idea of how difficult it is to get sufficient vitamin D from foods, there was one Norwegian study where participants ate salmon for five days a week for a considerable period and despite this were unable to reach the sufficient levels we are discussing this morning, which is 50 nanomols per litre and above.  It is very difficult to get it from food alone.  We do not get it in Ireland from sunshine at this time of the year or, indeed, during most of spring and some of autumn.  This message needs to get out there.  I say this because I have heard scientists speaking on radio saying there is no need to supplement because people get sufficient from food and sunshine in Ireland.  This is very incorrect and it needs to be said.<\/p> <p>  Some people ask whether we should be measuring vitamin D levels in everybody and then we would know.

She has been tremendous.  With regard to food fortification, I want to add to what I said earlier and to what Professor Kenny said.  I mentioned the only two foods that show some degree of fortification.  These are fortified milk and cereals.  With regard to ordinary milk, cows are no different from humans and do not get much sunshine either in winter.  It takes 40 L of ordinary milk to equal 1 L of super milk so there is a significant degree of fortification in it.  Half a litre of super milk has 400 units and there are also cereals that will bring up people's levels.  If children take fortified milk in the morning, they will get some supplementation but it takes a long time to build up.  It is not an insignificant amount, as people can imagine, but other than this there is not really much fortification.  Most farmed fish will not get much vitamin D either.  This is very important.<\/p> <p>  We have all been in communication individually with individual members of NPHET, almost all of whom we know quite well.  They know of our concerns.  What they say is we must wait for the randomised controlled studies of the intervention of vitamin D but the trouble with this is we would have to give a large population enough vitamin D for a year and have another controlled population not being given vitamin D.  It would be like giving one group parachutes and not giving parachutes to the other group.  This is what we are speaking about.  We are not speaking about something that will do harm.  It is something that has been proven to be effective.  The only reason we do not have sufficient levels is because of the fact we live here.  With regard to fortified food, the US and other places have reduced incidence of severe rickets.  I still get people coming in with severe bone disease and osteomalacia in the Irish culture.

I hope that as the science catches up with the information that is out there we will know more and more.  We are beginning to learn that more supplementation is better.

There should also be direct provision of vitamin D supplementation to healthcare workers, the institutionalised elderly and our communities if possible, with nursing homes a priority.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about countries that do things differently.  There is a geographic difference in vitamin D status.  We see it.  Generally, vitamin D status is worse the further away one gets from the equator.  There are exceptions, though.  For example, in Italy and Spain we see much poorer vitamin D status than one would expect because people avoid the sun.  They go in away from the sun during the daytime and their levels are lower for that reason.  We also see much higher levels in some Scandinavian countries because their governments have been proactive in putting in place robust food fortification programmes and very well-communicated messaging on vitamin D supplementation, so they are getting it right.  Finland's population has very good blood vitamin D levels and very low levels of infection and mortality from Covid-19.  Norway and Sweden are also doing well on food fortification.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the prison population.  I would absolutely put that population in among the vulnerable people who are much more likely to be vitamin D-deficient.  The UK has said it will provide free vitamin D supplementation to the prison population there over the winter months this year.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to Dr. Faul to respond to the Deputy's question about depression and seasonal affective disorder as they relate to vitamin D.

I have been taking Seven Seas capsules for many years as well as vitamin C so I hope I will be immune to all the different conditions.  I can afford those things, thankfully.  There are many more disadvantaged communities where families cannot afford supplements and perhaps would not have the level of disposable income to be conscious of these things.  Therefore, any actions that could be taken for these communities would be important.  Would that be worth investing in for the sake of the health of those who cannot buy supplements?  I also have high cholesterol and I take tablets for that, as do many people.  When the doctor takes my bloods during regular check-ups, I often get results relating to liver function and so on.  Are vitamin D levels routinely taken by GPs for any age cohort?  If not, should they be?  Is it easy to do so?  Is it easy to get a test analysed?<\/p> <p>  Secondly, Covid can impact the lungs and breathing.  Does vitamin D have any other positive roles in other conditions in keeping people fighting fit?  For example, we have not had the winter flu this year, thankfully.  Obviously, that is related to Covid and all that has gone on in that regard.  Could vitamin D be beneficial in keeping people fit enough to fight a winter flu?  Is there any evidence for that?  We are talking about the long term, but should milk or certain foods be fortified?

The evidence from all the studies that were pooled together - 42 randomised trials involving almost 48,000 subjects - clearly showed a significant reduction in acute chest infections, be they viral or bacterial, with regular, daily maintenance supplementation but not with intermittent high-dose boluses.  This, we proposed, may be why there is confusion out there among academics about vitamin D.

It is interesting that in the past GPs did not really request vitamin D that much and there was no great demand for it but, in the current climate and with Covid and many of the issues surrounding vitamin D in the media, requests for vitamin D have gone through the roof.  Practically every patient who goes to a GP now will ask to have vitamin D added to his or her test, even though GPs would not normally do so because they would look at the patient and, as someone said earlier, one cannot tell by looking at the patient whether or not his or her vitamin D level is low.  If the patient walks in, sits down, stands up and walks out, his or her vitamin D might be okay, but the issue of the Covid connection with vitamin D and other issues have driven vitamin D requesting significantly higher, so we are now measuring far more vitamin D than we did in the past in GPs' samples.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martin Healy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":803,"content":"<p>With regard to respiratory infections, I want to back up what Professor Rose Anne Kenny said.  It has been looked at in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, in detail in large studies which showed that it is protective, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis who respond better after an exacerbation if they are vitamin D deficient and the vitamin D is supplemented.  Cystic fibrosis is a particular problem because they have malabsorption of vitamin D.  It is routine for cystic fibrosis patients to take vitamins A, D, E and K on a continual basis because of malabsorption.  Without vitamin D supplementation they do worse after an exacerbation of cystic fibrosis.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, we would not be here to talk about asthma, COPD or cystic fibrosis.  It appears to be a specific thing for the infection with SARS-CoV-2 and vitamin D deficiency has a powerful impact.  That is what we are stressing.  I do not think we are here to say that if we give vitamin D supplementation it will cure all ills and fix everybody with every respiratory condition but it is crucial in the current pandemic because of the lack of resources, lack of ventilator beds and the crisis in the hospitals right now.  If we can reduce the severity of people's disease, and it must be remembered that pneumonia is the number one killer in Covid and it is taking up our ventilators and people are in hospital for long periods of time, and if vitamin D supplementation can help that I believe we should do it.  Within the area of respiratory conditions Covid appears to have a very specific problem in terms of vitamin D deficiency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Faul"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":804,"content":"<p>Could I make a quick comment?  To follow up on what Professor Kenny said, there are other health benefits from vitamin D apart from this well-established reduction in and risk of respiratory infection.  We are seeing it in testimony from Professor Carlos Camargo in Harvard University.  Professor Camargo is perhaps the world authority in this area as it relates to respiratory infection and vitamin D.  In a large meta analysis, which Professor Kenny referred to, of 48,000 patients they discovered that when they parsed this and looked just at people who were getting vitamin D supplementation on a day-to-day basis rather than these large bolus doses, there was a 25% reduction in risk of acute respiratory infection.  On that basis alone and on the assumption that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not differ in any huge way from these other acute respiratory infections that would be included in that, we could argue that we should be supplementing vitamin D.  There are other benefits also.  Some studies suggest, for example, much lower cancer rates in people who are vitamin D replete over time.  I refer to osteoporosis and also heart failure, which is responsible for one in four accident and emergency admissions in this country.  In all the areas of cardiovascular health vitamin D seems to be beneficial.<\/p> <p>  I would like to touch on the affordability of vitamin D also because the last two members, Deputy Kenny and Senator Kyne, focused on that.  We see approximately half of the rate of supplementation - this is in young women, and I have done research in this area - in people in the lower socioeconomic groups.  Anything we can do, therefore, whether that is a VAT exemption for vitamin D or any other intervention we can do to make it more affordable would be very beneficial.  We have to embed it into the culture so that, as one of our colleagues mentioned, it becomes well known across the population like folic acid supplementation in pregnancy, for example, but any assistance in terms of affordability, particularly at this time, would be very useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Daniel McCartney"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":805,"content":"<p>Has Senator Kyne concluded?

We know that it is safe.  It is like if one is thirsty one takes a drink of water or if one is hungry one eats a bit of bread.  We do not need it.  We know that it is extremely safe.  As we re-emphasised in our study of 36,500 people, we did not have an existential level.  From that point of view, therefore, the level we are recommending of 800 to 1,000 international units is totally safe and will bring people up into normal levels.  That is all it will do, and one can take it.  In winter time, 70% of people of all ages in the Dublin metropolitan area will be deficient in vitamin D, and there is not too much difference with the rest of the country, but all they need do is take it.  We only do levels in other people if they are required in particular cases but, ultimately, it is not an essential point.<\/p> <p>  I dealt with the issue of fortification of food already.  We know that Finland has done so and where it has done that it has made a difference in the severity of rickets and the severity of cases.  Even with fortification we have not got over the insufficiency levels that we have in Dublin.  That is okay.  As I said, GPs can prescribe vitamin D so that is something.  People have medical cards and that would help to get over the cost issue.  The GPs can add it to the prescriptions of people with GMS cards but people must be aware of the fact that GPs have that power.  For others, it is very cheap to buy not only in a chemist but even in a supermarket.  Good quality vitamin D is very readily available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Professor James Bernard Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":808,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for an extremely informative discussion.

We need to focus on getting out that message.<\/p> <p>  It is essential that we introduce a fortification and supplementation policy urgently to combat the deficiency in the hopes of saving people from experiencing more severe Covid-19 symptoms.  Last November, we were aware that the UK introduced free vitamin D supplements to those who were at risk of Covid.  People could apply to the NHS for free daily supplementation.  We might need to look at introducing a similar model, particularly for those who are at risk and also for members of society who are more likely to suffer from vitamin D deficiency such as the elderly and people with more melanated skin.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the growing evidence and reports that study the correlation between iron and the efficacy of the vaccine.

We know that iron deficiency is very common in the Irish population, particularly in young women.  We know that around 50% of young Irish women do not have sufficient amounts of iron in their diet.  The research I have conducted with the Coombe Hospital suggests that about 3% to 4% of those women when they present for their first antenatal visit in early pregnancy have frank iron deficiency.  That is worrying because it has an impact on the outcome of those pregnancies.  There are other reasons, apart from the immunity aspect, that are important in terms of iron nutrition across the population.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of Professor O'Neill's study and perhaps Professor Kenny will comment on it too.  A number of nutrients are suspect across the Irish population so while we are talking about vitamin D today, Dr. Healy for example will tell us that magnesium is a very important nutrient in terms of biologically activating vitamin D in the body.  A proportion of people have low magnesium levels in the population, including people who over-consume alcohol, some older people and hospitalised patients.  That might be an issue as well.  Zinc and selenium are also important nutrients for immunity.<\/p> <p>  To focus in on vitamin D and iron, we see a high prevalence of deficiency in vitamin D right across the population, in men and women, young and old, among immigrant populations and populations of Irish ethnicity.  Vitamin D deficiency is ubiquitous but I take the Senator's point that iron deficiency is an issue that needs to be addressed among our female population in particular and also among our elderly.

It is important to point out that we do not often see iron deficiency in men.  It is not often that one would see such a nutritional deficiency.  Obviously with malabsorption syndromes iron deficiency would be a feature but in the absence of malabsorption syndromes, the ordinary run-of-the-mill person, apart from pre-menopausal or pregnant women, will not run into this problem.  In fact, if a person is iron deficient, it is very important to look into it and exclude things like bowel cancer and other cancers that cause a person to lose iron.  When we meet patients with iron deficiency, we focus on whether there is an underlying medical cause for it.  We ask whether they are passing blood in the urine or rectally.

This is really why we need explicit guidance for the population on vitamin D.  There is lots of justified discussion on the role of vitamin D in immunological health as it relates to SARS-CoV 2 and what we need from the Department of Health are explicit guidelines on the appropriate level of supplementation so that people do not over-supplement and put themselves at risk.  We heard today that a number of agencies including the European Food Safety Authority, the Institute of Medicine in the US and the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in the UK, are all unanimous that oral intake of vitamin D up to 100 mcg per day is safe.  We have very large population studies of people who have been supplemented at 50 to 100 mcg over extended periods of two to five years which have shown no instances of toxicity.  Professor Walsh's work is also relevant.  Of the 36,000 people whose blood levels were evaluated in the Dublin region over the past five years, only 21 had levels over 250 nanomillilitres per litre and none had high calcium levels in their blood, which is the tell-tale sign that one has too much.  Vitamin D toxicity is extremely rare.  One can encounter it in some clinical conditions like sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, lymphoma and other granulomatous diseases but those hazards, or potential hazards, with vitamin D will be telegraphed to such patients by their primary physician.

We may get somewhere along the line to adequacy by developing more coherent and effective food fortification policies but we must recognise that in the absence of sunlight exposure it is very difficult to add sufficient amounts to food to make a manifest difference that will get people up to the blood levels required for immunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Daniel McCartney"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":824,"content":"<p>The general consensus is that too much exposure is bad for a person, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#J00900","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":825,"content":"<p>Absolutely so and we are not advocating that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Daniel McCartney"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":826,"content":"<p>Therefore, while I take on board Dr. McCartney's point that the reason levels of vitamin D have dropped is because of the lack of exposure to sun, avoiding excess exposure has been done for other beneficial health reasons around skin cancer and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#J01100","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":827,"content":"<p>We absolutely would not argue with that advice.

Before Finland went into food fortification only a third of the population was vitamin D sufficient.  By 2011 that figure was 90%.  The good thing about it was that when they measured, the average level was 75.9 nmol\/l.  That is exactly the kind of level that would be optimal.  Therefore, we have a country which became proactive with the fortification of food and did not run into any toxicity levels either.  They are the kinds of things which are crucial.  It can be done and done safely.  Going back to what Dr. McCartney said, the sun is where a person will get 90% of his or her vitamin D.  Twenty minutes of exposure to a person's hands is all that is really required to keep a person optimised.  However, in this country we do not get any vitamin D from the sun from October to April.  It does not happen.  Even the little bit of sun that is out there is very low in the sky, and hence food fortification.  Vitamin D is stored if a person gets a lot of it but there is a limit to how long that storage lasts.  That is why we in Ireland have 70% insufficiency or deficiency levels in winter time, as mentioned earlier.  That is why supplementation in tablet form of 800 to 1,000 units per day is important for people if they are not getting a very comprehensive food intake, which we know the majority of us are not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Professor James Bernard Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":829,"content":"<p>I thank the consortium.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#J01400","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":830,"content":"<p>Deputy Shortall is looking to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#J01500","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":831,"content":"<p>I just have a few additional questions.  Firstly, what would be the consortium's explicit guidance to the population on the level of daily supplements they should be taking?<\/p> <p>  Secondly, given the data the consortium has provided showing 70% of people, especially in Dublin, are vitamin D deficient, how long would it take a person taking their daily dose to sufficiently build up his or her immunity?<\/p> <p>  My third question relates to a point Professor Kenny made earlier which I did not fully follow.  The other day I happened to meet somebody who was coming from having his prescription filled for a monthly capsule.  I was surprised by this as I had not come across monthly capsules.  Has the consortium a view on daily, monthly or weekly supplements?  Is there any difference?  Furthermore, is there any difference between tablets and capsules?<\/p> <p>  I will finish by making two points.  The point about wild versus farmed salmon is very interesting and certainly news to me.  There are not many people who have the opportunity to eat wild salmon these days.  It is thus important to get across the message that people are not getting vitamin D to any extent from farmed salmon, which is standard.<\/p> <p>  The other point is positive.  I was in a Boots branch recently stocking up on vitamin D for myself and my family and I had difficulty getting it at sufficiently strong doses.  The shop assistant told me it is flying off the shelves and they cannot keep it in stock.  This is a very good sign.  People will often just vote with their feet; they can be very sensible about being active in maintaining their own health.  Of course the point has been made by many people that much of the population does not hear those health messages because they are not coming out clearly enough.  Equally, much of the population is not in a position to afford it.  We must therefore be very clear that there must be Government intervention as well as strong public health advice.

Generally, we would say that if one impacts one's immune system severely - for example with a high dose of steroids - it takes about three months for one's lymphocytes to recover from that.  If one has, say, a death in the family, then three to six months later one gets shingles, it means one's immune system is hit in some way.  We think the same is for recovery.  When one tries to boost someone's immune system - say, the person comes off chronic steroids - one's immune system only really recovers three to six months later.  It is at least three months.

The witnesses are saying there is no real downside to taking vitamin D.  They are also asking for the opt-out model, particularly for nursing homes.  Their figures suggested that one in four of us are vitamin D deficient, particularly in winter.  One cannot really overdose on vitamin D.  It was suggested there would be clearer messaging coming from NPHET.  The committee has invited NPHET to come before us and we will raise with it the whole issue of vitamin D.  We will also have the Minister for Health.  Again, we can look at that.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about a dosage of 800 to 1,000 mcg a day.  The point was made that many people are actually being proactive about their own health and shelves being emptied of vitamin D.  While people are acting on this themselves, we need that public messaging and explicit guidelines.<\/p> <p>  Vitamin D is one of the building blocks of our immune system.  Several years ago, the view on cancer was that one's immune system was not really important.  We know now from evidence that it is vital and our immune system breaks down cancers every day.  We all have cancers in our systems which one's immune system breaks down.  It is important having one of those building blocks in relation to that.<\/p> <p>  Is there anything else the witnesses want this committee to look at?  We will make recommendations.  Vitamin D deficiency is common across all age groups in the Irish population.  Up to 47% of 18 to 39-year-olds are deficient.  Up to 60% of 50 to 59-year-olds are deficient and 64% of over 80s with 80% of those in nursing homes.  That is the evidence of the importance of nursing home residents getting vitamin D.  Up to 94% in dark skin or Irish BAME, Black, Asian and minority ethnic, communities are vitamin D deficient.  The groups with the highest prevalence of vitamin D deficiency are those with obesity, dark skin and the older population, the very groups with the highest risk to Covid-19.  The witnesses pointed out recent studies have also shown the significantly lower risk of ICU admission and deaths among Covid-19 patients who were supplemented with vitamin D.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses want to reiterate any of these points?  Is there anything they want to ask of the committee?  We all accept there needs to be clear messaging.

Professor Kenny's work with the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, shows a similar result for the whole of Ireland.  That is what we are talking about.  We should talk about sufficiency.

We did not find this among the 36,500 cases.  That is important.  It must not be forgotten that what we are recommending is 800 units to 1,000 units.  As people have repeatedly said, internationally up to 4,000 units a day is considered safe.  We are not going near that.  We are way down at a fraction of that.

There is a condition called hypervitaminosis D.  People who have this condition have excessively high levels of vitamin D in their blood.  This is not caused by eating vitamin D supplements but the processes about which we were talking such as sarcoidosis, some lymphomas and so on.  The classic example is sarcoidosis.  This is an inflammatory condition where the body creates an enormous amount of vitamin D and it is not regulated by calcium in the blood.  Normally, calcium in the blood stops this.  It is not regulated, even locally, by vitamin D levels.  It is an automatic production of vitamin D by inflammatory tissue.  The treatment for it is steroids and anti-inflammatory therapy.  Just for clarity, the hypervitaminosis D about which one hears and which can be toxic is not caused by eating supplements but an underlying condition.

There are other supplements which act faster but they are only used in acute situations such as in the ICU when a person's level must be increased very quickly.  When one takes a supplement, one may be anxious to see if one's levels have gone up, but a repeat test cannot be carried out within three months.  One must wait three months before a repeat test can be carried out for the level of vitamin D in the blood.  This is because of the way vitamin D is handled in the body.

There is good research behind that which suggests that melatonin is suppressed by the exposure of the back of the eye, the retina, to that white light.  It is very well established that the physiological response to that white light is responsible for some of those better outcomes in persons with SAD.<\/p> <p>  I would like to follow up on a number of questions or issues raised in summation.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe raised the issue of opting in.  Under the UK scheme, even though, in theory, vitamin D supplementation is being provided free to 2.7 million of the UK's most vulnerable citizens, it is being provided on an opt-in basis.  That is an example we should not follow.  It must be operated on an opt-out basis if we want supplementation to be effective for vulnerable groups, such as people in nursing homes, our black and minority ethnicity, BAME, communities, our front-line healthcare professionals and people arriving to test centres.  We cannot rely on people having the knowledge to know that they need vitamin D and to take the appropriate action.  It needs to be provided on an opt-out basis.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I will raise is that we have borrowed a lot of the guidance from the UK in this area and a lot of the evidence our statutory agencies have reviewed in this regard has also been from the UK.  That evidence has focused on musculoskeletal health.  It is really important that the committee understand that the thresholds for blood vitamin D that must be achieved for some of these skeletal benefits are much lower than those to be achieved for immunological function, including for defence against Covid-19.<\/p><p>Were NPHET to review this evidence, we would need a specific review of the evidence on immunological health as it centres on Covid-19.  Reviewing the evidence of vitamin D in respect of musculoskeletal health does not bring us any further along.<\/p><p> The other thing to realise here in the context of that information is that the randomised control trials that many people have requested and that we would all like to see in this area may never happen.  Professor Kenny will say that the biggest of those studies is in C&oacute;rdoba in Spain where some 1,000 individuals have been targeted.  They are on 300 at the moment after the elapsing of nine months in that study and may never reach the 1,000 patients.  <\/p><p> We cannot wait for those randomised control trials. There is a model or paradigm called the Bradford Hill criteria for causality and the evidence that we have in relation to vitamin D and Covid-19 already meets those Bradford Hill criteria.  These are the same criteria that anti-smoking interventions have been based on, which as we said earlier have been very effective.  <\/p><p> Finally, on the issue of our population, we mentioned obesity.  Obesity affects approximately 60% of our adult population, who are either overweight or obese.  The dosage of vitamin D one requires if one is overweight, that is a body mass index, BMI, of between 25 and 30, is about one and a half times what a person of ideal weight would require to raise their blood levels by the equivalent amount.  When one gets into the obese category, that is a BMI above 30, then one may be looking at a dosage of about two to three times to achieve the equivalent level of increase in the blood.

Our proposed amendment provides that consideration would be given to what documented steps were taken to avoid the commission of the offence; the existence of internal controls and processes within the body corporate to avoid the commission of an offence; and any other relevant actions.  We are not opposed to a defence in itself but our concern relates to the wording of the defence as contained in subsection (2).  There has been a difficulty with that issue in recent years, particularly with white-collar crime.  If it is spelled out more, we hope companies would be incentivised to put in place proper processes.  The wording in this Bill is also contained in the Counterfeiting Bill and the proposed money laundering Bill.  Also, the Department of Justice has a view regarding the strict liability for bodies corporate being potentially unconstitutional.  However, we note the OECD stated this defence has not been invoked yet, and the courts have yet to interpret it.  The OECD also stated it was not a defence envisioned by it and that it needs more detail.  That is the gist of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021022300002#A01000","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":868,"content":"<p>Before I call the Minister of State, does any other Deputy want to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021022300002#A01100","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":869,"content":"<p>It is usually the Minister who speaks first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021022300002#A01200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":870,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021022300002#A01300","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":871,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their reasoned and constructive amendment and I appreciate the intent and spirit of it.  Section 5 inserts a new section into the principal Act and this provides for the liability of offences for a body corporate.  This is in accordance with article 6 of the directive.<\/p><p>The approach taken in the section reflects the general approach that is consistent with similar provisions in other recent legislation, for example, the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018, the Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Act 2017 and the Counterfeiting Bill 2020.  That Bill was recently brought through Second Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The provisions are not word-for-word identical but they are similar and they follow a similar pattern.<br\/><br\/>In this case, criminal liability is imposed on the body corporate for offences committed by an employee or other officer where the corporate body failed to exercise the requisite degree of supervision or control.  This is subject to the defence under subsection (2), which requires the body to prove that it took all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence to avoid commission of the offence.  The onus is very much on the body corporate.<br\/><br\/>Before I come to the specifics of the Deputy's amendment I am keen to mention several points.  First, the liability of the corporate body is in addition to that of the person committing the offence.  Second, depending on the circumstances, managers may also be personally criminally liable, whether as perpetrators, insiders or accessories.<br\/><br\/>I recognise and appreciate that the amendment is well-intentioned in clarifying what is meant by &quot;reasonable steps&quot; and &quot;due diligence&quot;.  However, my concern is that a suggested definition of those terms may not always be appropriate.  I would argue respectfully that this is better dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  Otherwise, the section may inadvertently be weakened by suggesting that there is a formulaic approach to these terms.  I prefer to see the matter left to the courts.  I do not believe the defence weakens the section.  Rather, it reflects that if we are to impute criminal liability, then there must be some culpable wrongdoing on behalf of the person, in this case the legal person, who will be punished.  The requirements of the section are strong.  The body corporate must prove that it took all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of the offence.  To successfully raise the defence, the court would have to see evidence.  I expect that it would be difficult for the body corporate to prove that it took reasonable steps in the absence of having documented them.  If internal controls and processes were not in place, I imagine it would be difficult to prove the exercise of all due diligence.<br\/><br\/>This question has been examined recently in great depth by the Law Reform Commission in its 2018 report on regulatory powers and corporate offences.  I refer in particular to two statements from that report.  The first is in paragraph 10.04 of the report and it refers to due diligence in general by reference to section 78 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>\t...a corporate defendant will need to produce evidence of the systems and procedures it had in place to avoid the commission of the offence, and that these included all steps that should reasonably have been taken to avoid its commission.  The mere production of policies and procedures, without effective implementation, monitoring, communication and oversight, will not suffice. <\/blockquote><p>The second statement is contained in paragraph 10.17 of the report and is in respect of the type of defence that arises here and which combines requirements for reasonable steps and due diligence.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe elements are distinct but related.  As already seen, reasonable steps or precautions refers to setting up a system.  Due diligence is ensuring that the system is working as intended.  To establish the defence, therefore, an appropriate system must have been put in place, there must have been effective measures or controls implemented to monitor the effective operation of the system and it must be demonstrated that the system was operating at the time the offence was committed. <\/blockquote><p>Finally, the report notes in paragraph 10.03 that due diligence has been recognised as being a concept not susceptible of precise definition.  This is the nub of the issue.  What reasonable steps and due diligence are can only realistically be assessed on the facts of each case.  I suggest that task should be left to the courts based on the facts of the particular case in question.  In the circumstances, unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment but I accept the good intentions of the Deputies concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021022300002#A01400","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":873,"content":"<p>Does any member wish to comment on this?

As he will know, today's Cabinet meeting had a delayed start time and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, thought it better that I attend the committee meeting to ensure members are updated on the review of the NDP.  The Minister sends his apologies and is happy to appear before the committee at the earliest opportunity.<\/p> <p>  I am joined by my colleagues, whom the Chairman has named, and I confirm that we are all present on the grounds of Leinster House.  We are in the one room but appropriately socially distanced.  I am not joined by any colleagues from the Minister's other Department, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  I will try to help as much as I can on matters pertaining to that Department but I may have to revert on some matters the committee may wish to raise relating to it.<\/p> <p>  A review of the NDP is timely in view of the events that have taken place, and which are still taking place, since its launch in 2018.  As part of the review, the specific remit given to the Department of Transport was to examine the Department&rsquo;s NDP investment plans in the light of the new programme for Government, the completion of regional spatial and economic strategies, climate action commitments and the impacts of Brexit and Covid-19.  The review is broad and wide-ranging.<\/p> <p> To be successful, a transport development plan needs to have a clear focus on long-term goals but must also be flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances.  The national development plan, which is built around outcomes rather than specific projects, gives us the necessary flexibility and adaptability.  The primary focus of the NDP is to absorb the estimated 1 million additional citizens who will live in this country by 2040 and to cater for everyone in a sustainable manner.  Our Department&rsquo;s priorities are to ensure investment is geared to support the mobility needs of an increasing population, to decarbonise public transport, and to provide appropriate supports and incentives in decarbonising the private transport element of the economy.  There is an excellent opportunity in the review of the NDP to accelerate decarbonisation of the transport sector and pivot strongly towards compact growth targets while also building on the progress made to date on improving regional connectivity.  I look forward to engaging with the committee today on these interlinked ambitions for transport.<\/p> <p>  Our Department&rsquo;s submission examines the NDP at a policy level to identify revised strategic priorities rather than entering into a discussion of particular projects.  The submission is underpinned by the draft national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI, which replaces the strategic investment framework for land transport, which had been in place since 2016.  The primary purpose of the NIFTI will be to support, in a cost-effective and evidence-based manner, the attainment of the national strategic outcomes set out in the national planning framework.<\/p> <p>  The NIFTI sets out principles, priorities, and an evidence-based framework to inform transport investment decision-making.  It sets out our four unranked priorities for transport: decarbonisation, protection and renewal, enhanced regional accessibility, and the sustainable mobility of people and goods in urban areas.  These unranked priorities, which I emphasise are all of equal priority, are accompanied by modal and intervention hierarchies to assist in project identification and sequencing and in comparing projects across different transport modes.  They are not, however, a substitute for the existing decision-making processes in themselves.<\/p> <p>  In shaping the Department&rsquo;s budget and investment strategy, our focus will be on ensuring that Ministers have the support and resources they need to focus on delivering the national planning framework&rsquo;s national strategic outcomes, particularly where climate change, land use and transport integration are concerned.  The research makes it clear that the most productive strategy the Department can pursue, when the goal is to absorb sustainably a rapidly growing population, is to expand sustainable mobility capacity within our major cities and towns.<\/p><p>This primary goal of compact growth inherently complements three other key national strategic outcomes: sustainable mobility; high quality international connectivity; and transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient society.  The mantra of this is first and foremost that we must redouble our efforts to improve the mobility of people and goods within cities, and within towns and villages.<\/p><p> What does compact growth mean in practice when combined with sustainable mobility ambitions?  For areas with poor transport connectivity, it may mean adapting existing rail networks to open up neighbouring land banks, and properly integrating housing and land use.  It may mean retrofitting roads to implement improved bus services, to provide a fast, reliable, comfortable and sustainable bus and associated cycle network in our major cities and towns.  It means that roads are not built just to deliver private vehicle traffic but are evaluated for public transport and active travel capabilities too.  Road design and retrofitting will be focused on moving several modes of transport, including cycling and walking, not just on moving cars.<\/p><p> We will improve sustainable access to our city centres.  It is very possible this will move away from intense nine to five rush hour peaks to smaller peaks and sustained all-day use, due to the acceleration of remote working during the pandemic.  We will align investment to encourage the concept of 15-minute neighbourhoods, so that it will be possible to safely walk or cycle to school, to the shops, or nearby places of employment in the largest cities and smallest urban settlements without relying on a private car.  We will improve access to our international gateway airports and ports, which are all located in large conurbations.  We will replace our public transport petrol and diesel fleets with low emission vehicle fleets.<\/p><p> As we increase population densities within cities and towns, we will continue to reinforce the need for more efficient inter-urban connections between our towns and cities, and provide the population base and density to develop improved high-quality inter-urban road and rail connections for passengers and freight.  We will attract business investment and create jobs as we will have the population densities and ready-made work force to support businesses and enterprise.  Rural transport between towns and villages will increasingly become more viable, with key pick-up and drop-off points along the way.<\/p><p> Decarbonisation is of overriding importance right across Government.  It is clear decarbonisation, while rightfully seeking to arrest and redress climate change, has become an industrial revolution in its own right.  It is as profound as the move from coal and steam power to oil and petrol power.  It is about the most productive use of energy.  Historically, industrial revolutions were the biggest drivers of productivity.  When linked to open trade, they are responsible for increasing living standards in an economically sustainable manner.<\/p><p> The end of a primary energy system which is heavily reliant on fossil fuels is in sight.  If we do not pursue sustainable technologies and a sustainable State, and devote significant public resources to this end, we will find ourselves steadily sliding down international productivity and economic rankings sooner rather than later.  We will be overtaken by more enterprising countries and lose touch with developments within the EU.  We have a duty of care and binding legal commitments as a country to manage our share of the biosphere, to stabilise climate change and mitigate the damage being done by carbon and other polluting emissions.<\/p><p> How will all of this be financed?  The scale required to achieve our ambitions will be significant.  The most important challenge is, perhaps, not how much we invest, but how we invest it.  Our main concerns at this point are as follows: to support our Ministers in ensuring our investment strategy for transport is broadly aligned with the national planning framework, NPF, and the draft national investment framework for transport\u00a0in Ireland, NIFTI; to support our Ministers in ensuring that within our investment strategies decarbonisation ambitions are built into every aspect of them; to ensure decarbonisation ambitions are measurable and quantifiable; and to ensure that at an executive level our programme governance and selection processes are robust, that they are risk managed in such a way as to identify the right projects, and that they accurately estimate and tightly manage the costs and delivery time frames of these projects.<\/p><p> A key task for me is to work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform during phase 2 of the national development plan, NDP, review to ensure the budget and the capital ceilings for the next five to ten years of project delivery are broadly in line with the cost estimates of projects which we expect to come on stream over this period.  At a figure of &euro;2.5 billion for 2021, the present base level of the budget is very good, on paper.  However, there are three extremely important caveats to this.  The first is that we only reached this level within the last two budgets after a decade in which we invested far below the rate required commensurate with the growth in population and economy.  We are, therefore, playing catch-up.<\/p><p> The second caveat is that the annual required baseline share of the budget for protection and renewal of our road and rail networks, which involves the maintenance of assets at a level where they do not deteriorate, is around &euro;1 billion.  In practice, this reduces the allocation available for investment in network expansion.<\/p><p> The third caveat is that we know in its present published form the capital budget is not enough to deliver the planned investment programmes coming down the tracks.  When we enter discussions on capital ceilings for the next five to ten years, the way in which we address these three caveats will be instrumental in determining the right capital ceilings for network improvement and expansion.<\/p><p> Turning to the main NDP item at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the national broadband plan, NBP, together with continued investment by commercial telecommunications operators is creating a more digitally connected Ireland.  The national broadband plan will ensure that no premises, regardless of how remote it is, will be left without this vital service.  Economic growth, jobs and competitiveness, balanced regional development, social inclusion, and environmental protection are all supported by high speed and robust telecommunications networks, which also provide a more equitable and sustainable future allowing rural communities to avail of the opportunities presented by the digital economy.<\/p><p> Data from the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, published late last year showed a year-on-year increase of more than 80,000 subscriptions to fibre-to-the-premises broadband services in Ireland in 2020.  This is clear evidence of the demand Irish consumers have for high-capacity connectivity once these services are available.  The pace of growth in data usage is set to continue which reinforces the need for high-speed, high-capacity infrastructure.  The need for access to high-speed broadband by all people has never been clearer.  Recognising this, the programme for Government specifically commits to seek to accelerate the roll out of the national broadband plan.  Work is under way to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP roll-out to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in later years of the current plan to an earlier date.  Any change requires detailed technical, commercial and financial analysis.<\/p><p> I hope my remarks have thrown some light on our thinking within the Department of Transport on the review of the NDP.

There are a few key priorities in my county in terms of the national development plan.  I want to put some of them to Mr. Spratt.  If he does not have time today, he may come back to me in due course.  These priorities include the Shannon town flood embankments and the Killaloe bypass.  A contractor has been appointed there but people want to know if it will progress.  It got &euro;4 million funding last week.  How will it progress and be built?  Blake's Corner and the Ennistymon inner relief road are awaiting An Bord Plean&aacute;la approval but I am anxious to hear how Mr. Spratt's Department proposes to advance it.<\/p> <p>  I refer to a crucial project.  Mr. Spratt mentioned airports and the need for better connections with the existing infrastructure in the country.  Quite incredibly, there is only one lane of carriageway on the N19 in and out of Shannon Airport.  A large scale emergency or anything requiring evacuation is impossible.  It is one of the only airports in Europe in that situation, so a dual carriageway right up to the airport terminal is needed.<\/p> <p>  The N85, which is identified as being of strategic importance in Clare, particularly the stretch around Kilnamona, is awaiting funding from Mr. Spratt's Department.  It is on the desk of the Minister, Deputy Ryan.

The first relates to Moyross and the Limerick northern distributor road.  While Moyross could act as the first phase of such a road, they were separate schemes.  Moyross was designed and approved back in 2011 or so.  It has now gotten approval to go to construction.  The other northern distributor road is at a much earlier stage and it needs to await the outcome of the ongoing Limerick metropolitan transport study.  It will give sight of whether a roads or a public transport solution or some combination is needed in terms of the line protected in the development plan.  It is at a much earlier stage.  It is important for Moyross to proceed at this time and the other one will continue through the ongoing consultation process.<\/p> <p>  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has different phases for projects.  The M20 is considered as phase 2.  Consultants are appointed for phases 1 to 4.  Consultants have been appointed for the M20.  They are at phase 2 which is the options selection phase.  Obviously, it involves ongoing consultations.  The most up to date estimate, any new information coming to hand and the option expected to be chosen have to be checked in terms of the national development plan, NDP, review of these projects.  It has not gotten to that point yet.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy rightly said, a preliminary contract of approximately &euro;1 million was approved for the Killaloe bypass.  Early works have been carried out and fencing works are ongoing.  Once that and the contract documentation are completed, I expect the council to seek approval to go to tender.  It has not gotten to that stage yet.  However, there is no indication the project will not go to tender.  It will be confirmed, or otherwise, in the NDP review but it is well advanced and the expectation is it will proceed.<\/p> <p>  Blake's Corner was mentioned.  As the Deputy said, it depends on a Bord Plean&aacute;la decision, so TII is the relevant party in terms of progressing it.  The N19 to Shannon was reclassified as a national road only a few years ago.  The last bit was designated as such.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is considering that to see what type of works are required to upgrade it.  It is not as advanced as other projects mentioned.  <\/p> <p>  The N85 was the last one mentioned.  I am not familiar with that project.  It does not feature in terms of the NDP project.

Mr. Spratt sent the committee two letters, the first on 18 February and the second on 23 February.  The committee had asked Mr. Spratt about the review mechanism for the NDP and how it had changed.  I draw his attention to the second paragraph on page five of the letter dated 18 February.  It reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe public consultation on draft NIFTI [the national investment framework for transport in ireland] is expected to launch in the coming months, with publication of the final framework to follow in Q2 or Q3.  However, the framework is sufficiently progressed to have played an important role in the Department&rsquo;s engagement with the NDP Review to date.  The Department and its agencies are considering investment with reference to the four priorities and two hierarchies, as well as in relation to the 10 wider National Strategic Outcomes. <\/blockquote> <p>That national investment framework for transport in Ireland is to replace the current strategic investment framework for land transport which went out to public consultation in August 2014 and was approved by Cabinet on 15 April 2015.  Does the national investment framework for transport in Ireland require approval from Cabinet before it can be regarded as the document to look at projects under the NDP?  <\/p><p>Furthermore, Mr. Spratt's response in the letter we received today appears to contradict what he said in the letter of 18 February.<\/p><p>It reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \tPending public consultation and finalisation of NIFTI, the investment hierarchies are not currently being applied as a requirement of transport project development.  If the final version of NIFTI keeps the hierarchies in a similar form to the draft framework, the updated CAF will detail what the future requirement to consider apply the hierarchies in project development will entail.  For current purposes, as part of the NDP Review, the use of the hierarchies is simply to capture similar information in a consistent way for a diverse range of projects across the land transport sector. <\/blockquote> <p>What is the current status of the strategic investment framework for land transport approved by Cabinet on 15 April 2015?  What is the current status of the draft investment framework for transport in Ireland that is to replace it?  Has a steering group been established and who is on it?  I note the steering group for the previous strategic investment framework for land transport had among its members Mr. Dominic Mullaney who is with Mr. Spratt today.  When was it set up and what were its findings?  When is it going out to public consultation?  Will it require Cabinet approval?  <\/p><p>I note the NDP is currently under review and it is hoped to have it finalised in the summer.  We could have a situation where the NDP is finalised prior to the national investment framework for transport in Ireland going out to public consultation, being finalised or being approved by Cabinet.  What is the status of the strategic investment framework for land transport document approved by Cabinet on 15 April 2015?  What is the status of the national investment framework for transport in Ireland?  Does it require Cabinet approval before it becomes part of the process by which the Department of Transport reviews projects under the NDP?<\/p><p>These are technical questions, but Mr. Spratt will appreciate that they are critical to how the NDP will look in the context of projects, the changes under the reviews and the hierarchies.

I thank Mr. Spratt for his presentation, which was important.  In the context of priorities for investment in transport and projects generally, there are various frameworks and I am starting to lose track of all the acronyms around government at the moment.  It is mind-boggling, but I understand they must exist in order for a strategic approach to be taken.<\/p> <p>  It is worth remembering that, already, 5 million people live in the State, and we are seeking over the next 20 years to prioritise investment to accommodate an increase of 1 million, while also recognising the necessity to decarbonise.  I am somewhat concerned that the shift is wholly towards public transport.  I accept that is not the case but we must be mindful of communities that already live and exist in the way they do.  When we decarbonise and move from petrol and diesel to electric, those communities will still need significant roadways.  The current crop of population, in many cases, will not move to public transport.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the patterns of development from here on will be in higher densities and brown-field sites in larger urban areas, with the capacity to utilise public transport, but we must also be mindful in our priorities of some of the projects in the more rural areas, where people live in a dispersed pattern and in villages and towns.  Their experience at the moment is relatively poor in some cases, although there have been some tremendous advances.  We cannot concentrate everything on the increase of 1 million citizens and forget, to some extent, about the difficulties that the existing 5 million have.<\/p> <p>  My colleague and others talked about the bypass of Killaloe, which is one such really important project.  We all have concerns that it might just slip off the desk.  When the current vehicular traffic is taken off the existing streets, these villages and towns will be given a chance to breathe, which will encourage more people to come back and to live within the villages, and will to some extent reduce the vehicular traffic.  There is a chicken-and-egg scenario and we have to be careful with it.

First, we have to get the virus under control not just in Ireland but throughout Europe and the world in a way that will allow international travel to restart.  Thankfully, we have the vaccination programme and will be able to make significant progress over the first, second and third quarters, but it will be quarter 3, or at least towards the end of the second quarter, before we start to see some sort of pick up in international travel.

We must get the virus under control.<\/p> <p>  The second thing we must do, as the Senator quite rightly pointed out, is to ensure that our airports continue to be fit for current but also for future purpose.  We have made some investments and have committed to making quite significant investments in the airports in Cork and Shannon, which the Senator mentioned.  We are keeping a very close eye on that.  If it is the case that additional investment is required, that is something that we are happy to consider.

I have a question that I am not sure if Mr. Spratt is necessarily going to be able to answer but, in fairness, he brought the issue up.  It relates to the national broadband plan.  We all understand the importance of it, particularly in the context of Covid-19, etc.  I met National Broadband Ireland, NBI, within the last fortnight and I raised this issue as part of a Topical Issue debate in the D&aacute;il.  I asked NBI to provide me with a note.  It said that there are specific issues, some of which relate to local government, which need to be dealt with in order to facilitate an acceleration.  I gave a copy of this note not only to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications but to the T&aacute;naiste who said he was going to be having a meeting with NBI in the near future.<\/p> <p>  These are issues that need to be dealt with as quickly as possible and I restate them here.  Some of them are very simple.  There was an issue in respect of Safe Pass but I believe that has now been dealt with.  This was holding up contractors from abroad from coming in.  There may be a wider issue in that we are taking contractors from abroad.  I was led to believe that they were going through quarantine.  If, however, there is a skill set shortage, that is also something that we need to look at in our planning for the future.<\/p> <p>  Like every other part of society, there was an issue where teams were held up due to Covid-19.  This slowdown means they need some form of a moratorium as regards tree or hedgerow trimming.  There may be options within the Wildlife (Amendment) Act which will allow for this.<\/p> <p>  NBI needs clarity on this but one of the big issues it had was that it needed a faster roll-out of the section 254 guidelines on the erection of poles, which is something that must be issued to all local authorities and which allows for a speedy planning process.<\/p> <p>  On road opening licences, NBI said it has difficulties in that it may have an initial plan and everything has been allowed for, but that a route may need to be changed.  Changing a route could mean a new permission needs to be applied for which can take anything from days up to eight weeks.  That is an issue both with local authorities and with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  What it is really talking about is a permitting or licensing system that will allow for this to happen in real time and that will allow NBI to sign off with the local authority or TII towards the end of the process.  <\/p> <p>  We are dealing with something people and the Minister are talking about as being as important as rural electrification, so anything that needs to be done has to be done.  We are told that all areas of Government are willing to put their shoulders to the wheel to deliver on this, so we need to ensure it happens.  All I need to know is that this is being dealt with and that there will be some sort of streamlined process to deal with it.  This is probably not the place to deal with it and nor is the D&aacute;il but we have the tools.

There is no doubt about it.  While we in this country were getting Brexit-ready for approximately two years, and while every politician was trying to ensure his or her constituents were alert to what needed to be done to get Brexit-ready, it is very clear that the same message was not being given in GB.<\/p> <p>  We have found that GB exporters into the European Union were not at all prepared, or at least the vast majority were not prepared, for what emerged on 1 January this year.  It is the case that Irish exporters into Britain were very well-prepared and knew what they needed to do in terms of complying with the new customs requirements over there.  However, GB exporters into the European Union and into Ireland were not ready for the application of the European Union customs code.  That gave rise to all sorts of problems in that people did not have the required Revenue documentation prepared, which prevented them from actually boarding ferries.  It meant that hauliers and trucks were refused access and refused boarding onto ferries.  The preparations that were put in place by the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the ports here in Ireland meant that problems were identified in GB rather than at our ports.<\/p> <p>  We are continuing to engage with the ferry companies, hauliers and logistics companies to see how we can ensure we make the importation of goods from GB as smooth as possible.  The hauliers and logistics, freight and ferry companies understand this inside out.  They really understand their business and have been trying as best they can to engage with the GB exporters.  It is still the case, however, that some of the GB exporters have not got the expertise in place from a customs clearance perspective.  It is still the case that freight movements from the island of Britain to Ireland are significantly down on what they would normally be.  We are, however, continuing to engage as best we can.  Government is encouraging the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to engage and liaise as best they can with the hauliers, freight and logistic companies and exporters to try to get that back to some sort of normality.  I have to say, however, that the Revenue Commissioners have an obligation to ensure they protect the Single Market and apply the European Union customs code.

We have agreed to that and it is in the programme for Government.  Many governments throughout Europe have agreed to and are following the science on that.

As they come through the project decision gates, the business cases that are developed for each of our projects are required under the public spending code and the common appraisal framework to demonstrate and quantify their carbon emission savings.  The earlier stage may be somewhat linked to some of the Deputy's thoughts in his question.  This is where we would see elements of the national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI, coming into play because it allows us to take a whole-of-transport perspective on various issues and to consider within a common framework what various interventions could do in those investment hierarchies.

To go back to earlier comments about rural transport, investment in rural transport is critical and it requires compact growth of these towns so we have the ability to provide viable services.  We cannot leave rural Ireland as car dependent and locked into car use.  We need to have compact growth in our towns and villages so that rural bus services and linkages to other transport hubs become viable.  This requires action at local level on zoning when local authorities carry out their planning processes.  This is critical.  There needs to be common purpose between transport planning and land use planning.  My feeling is that while perhaps they have not gone in separate directions in the past they have not always spoken to each other.  I saw it in Wicklow recently with regard to the regional spatial economic strategy, when we could not include the railway in how we would look at the N11 upgrade.<\/p> <p>  Bypasses will be necessary because they can bring a bit of life and vitality and put people first in town centres where we can remove the traffic that is choking town centres.  Where they are necessary, the current model seems to be the type 2 dual carriageway bypass.  Would the Department consider that there might be a requirement to look at others such as type 3, which is the 2+1 carriageway method, that might have slower speeds but would include a safety measure and would be cheaper?

The difference between a type 2 bypass and the 2+2 is 4 m or 5 m of cross section.  A lot is lost by going to the 2+1.  The 2+1 was used in certain situations when retrofitting certain roads but I am not sure it will be the preferred type in future.  We have to look very closely at whether a single carriageway is sufficient before we go to a 2+2 or a dual carriageway.  Perhaps we have to look at the ultimate capacity of a single carriageway because there are towns that would benefit from a bypass but it does not have to be a new dual carriageway or motorway from end to end along a route to give relief to a town.  This is something that will have to come into the equation when considering the scope of a road project.  Perhaps we also have to worry that if we provide a dual carriageway to cater for future capacity there is the old adage that traffic will always come along to fill what is built and it is self-fulfilling.  It is only when projects are individually examined and local needs are looked at that we can make decisions on these.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021022300002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dominic Mullaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":972,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mullaney and I get what he is saying with regard to the 2+1 meaning a reduction of only 5 m.

Even if we were to reduce the cost of a bypass by 20%, there would be an accumulative saving.  Slowing down speeds is not such a bad thing either in terms of emissions.  As Mr. Mullaney pointed out quite rightly, we have to be aware of induced demand.  If a big flashy two-lane dual carriageway is built, it will induce demand.  It will not achieve the purpose of reducing emissions, but will encourage more car usage.  I suggest even those smaller savings could be invested in public transport systems for the rural areas and rural towns we will be bypassing, which would serve a greater population and would be of better benefit in the public interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021022300002#J00700","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":973,"content":"<p>To pick up on the Deputy's remarks on the importance of land use, planning and transport planning, it is the case that quite a lot of our development is road-led development.

Several weeks ago, we heard from the Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA, which made the point that last year was extremely difficult for the aviation industry and a second year with very little revenue coming in will be fatal for the industry.

I ask Mr. Spratt has he had engagement with the airlines in this regard.  To what extent will the Department capitalise airlines to make sure they survive because they are in terminal decline and are burning cash?

There has been no formal request for our thoughts on the proposal other than the engagement at ministerial level with Sir Hendy.<\/p> <p>  As I said earlier, we are about to launch a strategic review of the rail network of the island of Ireland.

I heard quite a bit of the earlier contribution on the rail review.  It will be quite interesting.  As Fianna F&aacute;il transport spokesperson, I suggest that the prospect of utilising the review to link our rail network to that of the UK should be considered strongly.  There were strong proposals on Beaufort's Dyke in the Irish Sea.  I am aware issues arise there over the dumping of munitions from the Second World War and the dumping of hazardous waste.  The infrastructure project is a very significant one, and we should not waste an opportunity to have eventually a direct connection between places such as Edinburgh and Glasgow and the rail network here in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Doocey, if that is acceptable to Mr. Spratt.  Does the Department feel it is sustainable to continue having a rail network that is divided in that passengers who arrive by train in Heuston from all over the south and east cannot connect directly with Connolly Station?  That is a major stumbling block.  It does not make a great deal of sense to me if we are to be considering the possibility of having high-speed rail connections.  Would it not make sense to have a multi-city system whereby a passenger could get on a train in Cork and go all the way to Belfast directly without having to change or get a Luas across the city?  There were plans for an interconnector based on the DART.  There has still been no redevelopment despite plans to go back to the drawing board in this regard, but I would not mind hearing the Department's thoughts on having a direct connection between the Heuston and Connolly lines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021022300002#L01400","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":1001,"content":"<p>There are two aspects to the question.  We consider those sorts of issues to fall within the strategic rail review, which we hope to launch this year.

Regarding a connection between Heuston and Connolly, the Luas line is already in place, obviously, but I realise that is not exactly what the Deputy was talking about in outlining his concept of interconnectivity.

In the context of future high-speed rail development, however, we cannot avoid this conversation.
