Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, Members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the convention centre.  I ask that committee members confirm their locations before contributing to ensure they are adhering to this requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin our public engagement, we considered the minutes of our meetings of 4 and 9 February at our private meeting last week.  Standing Order 107(3) requires that the minutes are agreed in public session.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Today we are engaging with officials from Horse Racing Ireland to examine matters relating to its 2019 financial statement.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials: Mr. Brian Kavanagh, chief executive, and Ms Suzanne Eade, chief financial officer.  I welcome them to the meeting and thank them and their staff for the briefing material they have prepared for us.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask that members and witnesses mute themselves when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  I also ask that they use the button to raise their hands to indicate when they wish to contribute and, as usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  When people have finished contributing, they should not forget to use the button to lower their hands.  It can be confusing otherwise.<\/p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Our witnesses have already been advised of this and they may have viewed it as appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask the witnesses to state their names the first time they contribute.<\/p> <p>  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614074400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, was established to provide a statutory basis for the control, regulation and development of the horse racing industry in Ireland.  It operates racing and betting activities through eight subsidiaries.  In addition, it has a one third shareholding in an associated company called Curragh Racecourse Limited, CRL.<\/p> <p>  HRI received State funding of &euro;67.2 million in 2019, sourced from the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  HRI's other main sources of income in the year were contributions from horse owners and sponsors towards racing prize money, totalling &euro;23.4 million; sales of media rights to the value of &euro;6.8 million; registration fee income of &euro;2.6 million; industry contributions to Irish Thoroughbred Marketing of &euro;443,000; and net income of &euro;294,000 from racing activities arising from totaliser betting and HRI-owned racecourses.  On the expenditure side in 2019, HRI paid out &euro;67.6 million in prize money.  Expenditure of &euro;12.6 million was incurred on integrity and racecourse services, mainly comprising grants to the Irish Horse Racing Regulatory Board.  Overall, the HRI group incurred a deficit of just over &euro;1 million for 2019.<\/p> <p>  The 2019 financial statements received a clear audit opinion.  However, without qualifying that opinion, my report drew attention to two matters related to HRI's activity in the year.  First, I drew attention to the fact that the statement of income and expenditure disclosed a group loss of &euro;2.064 million in 2019 relating to HRI's investment in CRL.  This is a company established to provide for the redevelopment and management of the Curragh racecourse.  The redevelopment involved the construction of a new stand and other racing facilities, which opened in mid-2019.  Ownership of the company is split between HRI, the Turf Club and private investors.  Notes Nos. 37 and 39 of the group financial statements explain that HRI had contributed funding to CRL totalling &euro;36 million up to the end of 2019.  This comprised an investment of &euro;23 million in return for an equity share, grant funding of &euro;12.5 million for the construction project, and &euro;500,000 paid for the right to use a hospitality suite at the racecourse for 30 years.  In addition, the group financial statements reflect a loan of &euro;500,000 given by HRI to CRL during 2019 to fund additional works on the racecourse's parade ring.  As at 31 December 2019, HRI held a 35.29% economic share in CRL.  The carrying value of HRI's investment at 31 December 2019 was &euro;18.5 million, indicating cumulative losses incurred by HRI amounting to &euro;4.5 million.<\/p> <p>  Second, I drew attention to the disclosure in the statement on internal control for 2019 of a financial loss by HRI of &euro;389,000 in respect of cash-in-transit services.  The service provider went into liquidation while holding cash relating to HRI's racecourses and its Tote Ireland subsidiary.<\/p> <p>  The chief executive will be able to update the committee on these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1614074400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Kavanagh to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#A00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614074400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to assist with its examination of the 2019 financial statements of HRI.  As members will be aware, HRI is a commercial semiState body responsible to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  HRI is responsible for the overall administration, governance, development and promotion of the Irish horse racing industry and operates a corporate structure that comprises the main body and nine subsidiary companies, one of which is dormant.  Its functions are set out in legislation.<\/p> <p>  As the Comptroller and Auditor General set out, HRI's primary sources of funding are the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, race entry fees from owners, race sponsorship fees through racecourses, profits from commercial subsidiaries, a statutory foal levy on breeders, the sale of media rights, industry contributions to Irish Thoroughbred Marketing and a turnover levy on oncourse bookmakers.<\/p><p> We are based in Ballymany, the Curragh, County Kildare, and including our subsidiary companies, we employ a total of 247 people.  Since the establishment of the Racing Board in 1945, the horse racing and thoroughbred industry in Ireland has been overseen by a State body and has been the subject of legislation.  The reason for this is the unique position which the sector holds in Ireland.  Horses are something which Ireland does well, and for a small country we hold leadership positions in many elements of the industry which makes a valuable contribution to the social, economic and cultural fabric of the country.  This was well summed up recently by An tUachtar&aacute;n, Michael D. Higgins, when he said the horse has a special place in Irish life and culture and, \"A love of horses, their breeding and training, are an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s identity and of our reputation abroad.\"<\/p><p> Supportive Government policy over the years has enabled a significant rural industry to develop, and in 2017, Deloitte issued a comprehensive report on the value of the industry which made a number of important findings. The key findings were that the industry stimulates almost &euro;2 billion of expenditure per annum in the Irish economy.  This expenditure supports a workforce of 28,900 full-time equivalent jobs.  After the United States, Ireland is the second biggest seller of bloodstock at public sales.  In a normal year, 1.3 million people attend race meetings in Ireland.  Bloodstock sales are valued at approximately &euro;438 million per annum, much of which is exported.<\/p><p> The industry operates on an all-island basis, and every four years, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine appoints a representative of the industry in Northern Ireland to the board of Horse Racing Ireland.  The board comprises a chairman and 13 ordinary board members who are a mixture of industry representatives and ministerial nominees.<\/p><p> The industry is multi-layered and comprises much more than just a day at the races.  Despite our small size, Ireland is the third largest producer of thoroughbreds in the world, the second largest exporter of horses to more than 33 countries in terms of value, and arguably the leading country in terms of quality.  In terms of size and scale, the thoroughbred industry is a significant one with a wide geographical reach.  There are breeders in every county in Ireland and most of them, 92%, have five mares or fewer.<\/p><p> In terms of economic value and the value of exports through sales, the industry compares very favourably with other vital agrifood sectors such as fishing, poultry, pigs and sheep.  One feature of the industry is its regional reach, and the Deloitte report pointed to significant economic activity and investment reaching into every county in the country.  A previous industry analysis took the case of Bagenalstown in County Carlow and found that within a ten-mile radius of that town, more than 600 full-time jobs were accounted for through the horse racing and breeding industries and ancillary services.  That picture is replicated in many other parts of the country.<\/p><p> The year 2019 was the last normal year experienced by most businesses.  Ms Eade and I will be happy to deal with any questions the committee may have on our 2019 financial statements.  Since then, much has changed and the industry is currently facing two massive challenges in Covid-19 and Brexit, both of which are having a significant impact.  Covid-19 saw horse racing cancelled for 11 weeks last year and since the resumption on 8 June, racing has been run behind closed doors, under strict protocols, with only essential staff in attendance.  Point-to-point racing is currently cancelled, which is a major problem for the national hunt sector and those whose livelihoods depend on it.  Irish bloodstock sales, at which most of our international trade takes place, were heavily disrupted in 2020 with key sales either cancelled, deferred, or in some cases, moved to England.  The industry is extremely grateful to be able to continue racing and is cognisant of the bigger picture.  However, like many other sectors, the impact of Covid-19 will be felt for a long time.<\/p><p> As I said earlier, Ireland is one of the largest exporters of thoroughbreds in the world and Britain is our main market, which has meant that significant changes and readjustments are occurring as a result of Brexit.  Over the past two years, together with various industry bodies and Government authorities, we have been working through the implications on the movement of horses between Ireland and Britain in the following areas: sanitary and phytosanitary applications, customs and VAT.  Undoubtedly, the situation is more difficult since 1 January.  Much work remains to mitigate the barriers to trade and prevent the industry in Ireland being marginalised as a result of geographical location.<\/p><p> Horse Racing Ireland has ambitious plans for the racing and breeding industry, and in March 2020 we published a strategic plan for the years 2020 to 2024, which sets challenging growth targets.  While the industry is facing up to serious challenges, if properly supported it will play an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic future.  It is a valuable source of employment and investment into rural Ireland, an area in which Ireland has natural advantages of climate and soil structure.  It is one that capitalises on our native skills and has a global reach which enhances Ireland&rsquo;s reputation internationally.  Moreover, it is an environmentally friendly agricultural activity.  The key elements of the strategic plan are increased participation at all levels of the industry thereby increasing employment and economic activity, investment in areas that are critical to the development of the industry, raising the profile and attractiveness of horse racing to all its customers, world-leading standards of integrity and equine welfare, development of people within the industry to support sustainable employment, and securing a sustainable funding model for the future.<\/p><p> The key capital projects under this plan will be the redevelopment of the Irish Equine Centre in Johnstown, County Kildare, and the development of a new all-weather racetrack in Tipperary.  The plan signals ambition to grow the direct and indirect employment in our industry to 35,000 people and the economic activity to &euro;2.5 billion per annum.<\/p><p> The 2019 financial statements are before the committee.  That was a good year for Irish horse racing and breeding, with increases in most of the key industry metrics and continued success for Irish horses on the racetracks of the world.  The year 2019 saw the completion of the long-awaited redevelopment of the Curragh racecourse and the introduction of new broadcasting arrangements for Irish racing.  It was also the year in which the threats to the industry from Brexit began to crystalise.<\/p><p> As requested, we have provided the committee with briefing material on three specific issues.  As I said earlier, Ms Eade and I will be happy to address any questions members may have on those matters or any other aspect of our finances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614074400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kavanagh for his opening statement.

I am sure many people will be impressed to hear about some of the financial benefits from the sector in terms of how it permeates to local communities, which is what I want to focus on this morning.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kavanagh mentioned that 92% of breeders are operations of five mares or fewer, and they are the small operators many of us will be aware of within our own communities.

As the Deputy said, the industry has a strong rural and regional reach and the small breeders, trainers and owners are the backbone of the industry.  Sometimes, the headlines go to the bigger owners.  When one analyses the industry, however, the picture shows a nationwide distribution of activities, full-time, part-time etc.  We put in place programmes to support all levels of the industry.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy mentioned, 92% of breeders have fewer than five mares.  Some 90% of our races are non-black tie races, that is, they are races below the elite level and are available for all small owners and trainers.  I mentioned our intention to build a second all-weather track in Tipperary.  That is to facilitate and replicate the Dundalk experience in terms of creating opportunities for the type of operators the Deputy referred to .  We operate a pyramid-based structure or meritocracy within racing, which leads to the championship races at the top level.<\/p><p> We will shortly launch a new support scheme for breeders, which is a direct response to the Brexit concerns.  Many small breeders feel isolated.  Britain is our main market for horses, with 80% of exports of Irish horses going to the UK, so there is great anxiety with regard to Brexit.  In the past couple of years we have expanded the race programme for horses, particularly at the lower level.  We have introduced specific races, called option races, for horses at the lower level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614074400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>We are tight for time.

It drives rural economic activity, the sales and the decision to have horses in training here.  Regarding the link with the horse and greyhound fund, the Deputy is correct to point out the proximity of the figures, but they are not directly linked.  It is not the case that we get X amount from the Government, so we put X into prize money and offer prize money of X amount.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned, we have other sources of income as well.  Prize money is the subject of competition internationally, particularly at the higher level where one is seeking to attract horses.  We have been quite successful at this over the years, getting international owners to base their horses in Ireland rather than the alternatives there might be in France or the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#C01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1614074400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I am trying to get to the heart of whether Exchequer funding is having the biggest impact.  To repeat Mr. Kavanagh's figures, 92% of horse trainers have five or fewer mares.  Looking at the distribution of the prize money in terms of flat racing, and I believe these figures are from 2019 as well, the top trainer managed to secure 25% of the overall prize money.  The top ten trainers secured 63.29% of the prize money.  In the case of the national hunt, the top trainer drew down 17% and the top ten trainers drew down 63% of the funding.  The flat all-weather did a little better in terms of balance, but the funds were much smaller.  Some 46.23% of owners drew down the overall amount of the money in terms of the top ten.  One can see there is great disparity and understand why some would question whether the model of front-loading the prize money is the best way to make the economic impact Mr. Kavanagh rightly said this money can deliver, if it is utilised correctly.  It appears that the model in place will ensure that the big trainers, who do great work and are great ambassadors, will keep getting bigger while the stables of five or fewer mares will remain very much bit players.  There will not be much scope for them to expand because it is very hard to break into this prize money, which would allow them to have the same resources as their competitors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#C01500","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614074400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I do not think that is a full analysis.  Many of the horses that are winning for the bigger trainers are bred by those breeders the Deputy referred to, the small breeders who are selling their horses to the owners to keep them in training.  The other factor is that many of our top trainers started off as small trainers.  Our two leading national hunt trainers, Willie Mullins and Gordon Elliott, both started with four or five horses in training and have been able to develop their businesses to their current scale.

If we look at racing in the UK today, almost half the horses running will be Irish horses and almost half the jockeys riding will be Irish jockeys who are based in the UK.

That is now gone and Britain has become a third country.  Therefore, the movement of horses between the countries becomes a VAT and customs event.  Under EU animal health law, there are new phytosanitary requirements in terms of veterinary certification and details that need to be checked before a horse can move from a third country into the EU.  We are endeavouring to smooth that passage as much as possible because there are 25,000 horse movements a year between Ireland, Britain and France.

Where stands the conversation with the Government about the resumption of point-to-point racing?  Mr. Kavanagh has previously made the point about running meetings on racecourses.  I speak specifically for Cork.  I do not think it would be practical to run Kildorrery, Killeagh or Dromahane point-to-point meetings in Mallow racecourse at this point in time.  Mr. Kavanagh might have a view on that.  We would like to see a resumption of point-to-point races in their natural state in the locations that the many people who go to point-to-point races would normally visit.  In the absence of people being able to go to point-to-point races, can these races be run in original locations like Kildorrery or Dromahane?

We are all waiting to see what comes out of the news this week.  In response to the second question, these could be turned around with a reasonable amount of notice, perhaps one week or ten days.  There is a great hunger in the point-to-point community to get going again.  I stress that this is all outdoor activity with fewer people involved than at a racecourse.  The racecourses have operated successfully since last June with strict protocols and no issue arising with Covid at a race meeting.  That has enabled the racing industry to keep the wheels turning, which we are appreciative of and grateful for.  The same applies to point-to-point races.  There is the animal aspect too.  These horses are bought and trained to race and they do not have anywhere to go.<\/p> <p>  We made a written submission to the Department last Wednesday and we are in daily dialogue with it.<\/p><p>It could be turned around at ten days' notice, I believe.

My last point is on third party events held at HRI venues, such as Mallow racecourse.  I still call it Mallow racecourse because I am a proud Mallowman.  HRI calls it Cork Racecourse Mallow.  There is a fair at the racecourse, a home and garden fair.  Is it anticipated that third-party events such as that will continue or will be pencilled into the calendar?  I would imagine such events provide vital revenue streams for HRI and the individual racecourses, but they are also vital to the non-horse fraternity or confraternity.  I want to make sure there is proactive engagement to ensure as many people as possible can enjoy the venues and the events held in them.

The types of events mentioned are absolutely vital to any racecourse.  It is a real challenge for racecourses not just to be locations where people come to race and leave.  A racecourse has to engage with its local community and get people to use it.  If it is for purposes other than racing, all the better.  The Deputy will know that Mallow was used as a Covid testing centre.  We were delighted that Galway and Punchestown racecourses were on the list of 37 venues announced as vaccination centres.  The community engagement piece is vital for racecourses.  The most successful racecourses in the country, regarding which I have repeatedly quoted the example of Ballinrobe Racecourse in the west, are those that are absolutely rooted in the local community and seen as the people&rsquo;s racecourse in their area.  That is when one hits the magic spot.

Mr. Kavanagh referred to the publication last March of the strategic plan up to 2024.  I have read that report and it identifies a reliance on media rights as a weakness.  At the moment, based on the accounts, the amount involved seems to be in the region of &euro;7 million.  Will Mr. Kavanagh outline how access to media rights is characterised as a weakness.  What is the outlook up to 2024 for HRI regarding media rights?<\/p> <p>  There has been some discussion in the Oireachtas about controlling advertising relating to gambling.  Has the organisation done any kind of a risk analysis on the impact a ban on gambling advertising would have on its business model?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#K00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614074400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>That is a significant item on our risk register.  There is much more to racing than just gambling.  Interestingly, our research shows that having a bet was only the fourth ranked reason for people going racing.<\/p> <p>  With regard to media rights, the risk in the strategic plan relates to the dependence of racecourses on them, not HRI.  Media rights comprise pictures and commentaries of races and data.  The runners in the newspaper this morning and the data are merged together to provide a single media rights package.  HRI produces those data.  We produce the fields for all races and we have copyright over those data.  As the property owners, the racecourses own the pictures.  The Deputy is right that we said in our strategic plan that the dependence of racecourses on media rights is a challenge and we are always looking for racecourses to broaden their income base.  However, during the Covid crisis it has proven to be a strength because while racecourses have had no commercial revenue from racegoers, as we have had no racegoers at Irish racetracks since last March, they have been able to continue to trade because of the income they get from selling the pictures.  With a combination of Government supports and costs that they have been able to take out of their own business, as they have lower costs because the public are not attending race meetings, they have been able to offset their loss of revenue due to the fact that there is an increased demand for the pictures of Irish races.  The streaming of races is very popular now.  We had an average of 62,000 streams per race at the big Dublin racing festival in Leopardstown two weeks ago.  The way in which racing is being broadcast is changing and there is a concern about that.  As with all analyses, sometimes one will look at something and see it as a weakness but it can also be a strength if dealt with properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1614074400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I suspect I am out of time but I ask Mr. Kavanagh to give me a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer to this.

I have a question on the appointment process for board members.  During previous questions, Mr. Kavanagh distinguished between appointees of the Minister and representatives of the sectoral interests.  Is it the case that while sectoral interests make nominations for the board, it is essentially the Minister who makes the formal appointment?  I would like that to be clarified.  We spoke about the instance where there has been a board member <i>in situ<\/i>since 2008.  I do not personally know that board member and I am sure he is an able representative of that sector.  This committee has long-standing experience of coming across bad practice where executives or board members are <i>in situ<\/i>for long periods of time.  That is the reason the guidelines are in place.  Is it the case that once those sectoral interests or representatives nominate somebody, the Minister has no authority to deny that or what is the process exactly?  I would like a little clarity on that, if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021022300002#L01300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614074400,"counter":257,"content":"<p>The Deputy has it spot on.  The board members are all equal and they are all appointed by the Minister.  My clarification in my opening statement was to point out that a number of board members are specified to be put forward from various industry sectors.  For example, the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association and the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association put forward nominations.  There are provisions in the legislation for the Minister to accept or reject nominations or to come up with alternative nomination methods, if desired.  There is a distinction in the 1994 Act and the theory is that there would be various representatives of different parts of the industry and that, on top of that, the Minister would make ministerial nominations.  These board members are no different from other board members in terms of their status but the intention is that the sectors of the industry would be complemented by people from outside the industry or those with other skill sets that might be missing on the board.  They are all ministerial appointees, however, so it is not as if the Minister does not have any say on who is the trainers' representative, the breeders' representative and so on.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Carthy's earlier question, there were 25 overseas winners in Ireland in 2019 and they won &euro;3.4 million.

Apologies have been received from Deputy Stanton and Senator Gavin.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to be able to continue our pre-legislative scrutiny of the competition (amendment) Bill 2021.  The principal objective of the Bill is to transpose the EU&rsquo;s European Competition Network, ECN, directive that will make the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPG, and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, more effective in overseeing and enforcing competition law.  The directive was adopted in 2019 with a transposition deadline of 4 February 2021.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, recently sent the general scheme of the Bill to the committee asking that we prioritise our consideration of this matter. Having received a briefing on the matter from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am pleased that we will develop our understanding of the Bill when we hear from witnesses of the CCPG and ComReg in relation to the proposed legislation.  These bodies will be the two most affected by the directive and proposed Bill.<\/p> <p>  From the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, I welcome Ms Isolde Goggin, chairperson, Mr. Brian McHugh and members of the commission, and from the Commission for Communications Regulation, Mr. Garrett Blaney, chairperson, and Mr. Jeremy Godfrey, commissioner.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today&rsquo;s witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal prosecution from proceedings as a witness physically present does.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such decision.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses&rsquo; opening statements have been circulated to members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite the chairperson of the CCPC, Ms Goggin, to make her contribution.  I remind witnesses and members that when contributing remotely, they should clarify their name for recording purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021022300002#A00400","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I am chairperson of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  I am joined by Mr. Brian McHugh who is a member of the commission with responsibility for our competition enforcement and mergers functions.  I thank committee members for the opportunity to speak to them today and to provide our views on the competition (amendment) Bill 2021.<\/p> <p>  As the primary enforcement body for competition law, both the CCPC and our predecessor, the Competition Authority, used all their powers and resources to investigate suspected anti-competitive practices, and bring those damaging practices to an end.  In doing so, we have built up a strong  record of enforcement.  However, developments in enforcement mechanisms have left Ireland out of step with the rest of Europe.  Our ability to act is grounded in our statutory powers and, therefore, it is essential that those laws provide the CCPC with the right enforcement tools to effectively deter, detect and address white-collar crime relating to competition law.  This Bill provides a significant opportunity for major change and will enable the CCPC to be more effective for the benefit of consumers, businesses and the economy as a whole.  However, the devil is in the detail and the specifics of how this European legislation is transposed will determine how effective it is.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the CCPC&rsquo;s enforcement powers, competition law investigations are built on physical and digital evidence, and they require in-depth economic and legal analysis.  We have consistently used our current powers to challenge anti-competitive practices in a wide variety of sectors.  We secured Ireland&rsquo;s first conviction for bid rigging and we recently referred a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, into potential bid rigging in the procurement of publicly-funded transport services.  Last year, we issued preliminary findings against a number of businesses in the motor insurance sector and most recently we secured a High Court order in respect of a commitment agreement with Ticketmaster.<\/p> <p>  We have a substantial enforcement track record but there are areas where we could have done more if we had the same powers as other competition agencies in the EU.  For example, the most the CCPC can achieve at present, in a significant number of competition cases, is to seek commitments that the business will cease the practice or behaviour and not do it again.  If we cannot obtain commitments ourselves, we can apply to the courts for a declaration that the behaviour is unlawful and obtain an injunction.  In our view, this is not an effective deterrent to practices that harm competition and, ultimately, consumers.<\/p> <p>  Unlike other competition agencies, the CCPC cannot impose financial sanctions for breaches of competition law.  Also, we cannot operate a leniency programme, which would allow for the reduction in fines when a business provides evidence that it has participated in a breach of competition law.  Leniency programmes encourage companies to come forward with evidence and result in more effective, and efficient, investigations and enforcement.<\/p> <p>  I would like to speak about our investigative powers.  Secret cartels are extremely damaging and are therefore considered a serious breach of competition law.  This type of activity has a very harmful effect on consumers and the wider economy, as any or all of the following can happen as a result of businesses coming together to agree prices or to share out a market between them: prices go up while efficiency, innovation and the options available to consumers go down.  They are also the most challenging breaches to detect and investigate as, by their nature, they involve a secret conspiracy.  The parties involved often make a considerable efforts to hide their involvement from their customers and, indeed, from the CCPC.  International experience has shown that cartelists have become more sophisticated in using electronic communications technology and social media apps to co-ordinate their behaviour.  Indeed, many cartelists work diligently to avoid leaving a paper trail and only communicate verbally on their mobile phones.<\/p> <p>  For this reason, the CCPC is seeking investigative and surveillance powers which are appropriate to detect white-collar crime.  We are very aware that the powers we seek must be balanced with safeguards for the rights of the individual.  Currently, for the CCPC to search a premises, we must present sufficient evidence to a judge in order to obtain a warrant and we anticipate this level of judicial oversight will be maintained in our new powers.<\/p> <p>  As regards its implementation, this Bill will allow the use of important enforcement tools commonly used across the EU for the first time in Ireland.  The CCPC believes that giving us these enforcement tools will fill a significant gap in the existing competition law enforcement regime in Ireland.  The detail of how the regime works is crucial in ensuring that the legislation is effective.  From our experience, we know that for there to be a meaningful deterrent, the threat of enforcement must be real and go beyond reputational damage.  The CCPC is of the view that we require the power to: adopt infringement decisions; grant immunity from or reductions in fines; make orders; grant remedies; and impose fines in respect of breaches of competition law, subject to the appropriate judicial oversight.<\/p> <p>  As chair of the CCPC, and previously chair of the Competition Authority over a number of years, I can confidently say that we have spent many years enforcing the law to the best of our ability.  I can assure members of the committee that the views put before them today come from much consideration over this time.<\/p><p>I firmly believe that the competition (amendment) Bill 2021 is a once in a generation opportunity to reform Irish competition law and align our enforcement regime with the rest of the EU, something that is long overdue.  These are major changes and the detail of the Bill will be very important if we are to realise the full potential of these reforms and enable the CCPC to be more efficient, effective and impactful when tackling white collar crime in Ireland. <\/p><p> We recognise the CCPC must play its part in this, and in this regard we have been working very closely with our parent Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, both in terms of working through the detail of the legislation and considering the impact such powers will have on our organisation, particularly in ensuring there are sufficient resources, expertise and oversight.  Our mission is to make markets work better and we are committed to playing our part in ensuring that this legislation benefits consumers, businesses and ultimately the economy.<\/p><p> We are happy to take any questions and further explain our views in more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021022300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>T&aacute; muid bu&iacute;och as ucht an cuireadh a bheith i l&aacute;thair anseo inniu.  On behalf of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, I welcome the opportunity to appear before today&rsquo;s hearing regarding the competition (amendment) Bill.  I am joined by my fellow ComReg commissioner, Jeremy Godfrey.<br\/><br\/>ComReg was established by the Communications Regulation Act in 2002 and is now in its third decade.  As part of our statutory functions and objectives, we promote competition and investment in the telecoms and electronic communications sector.  We uphold end-user rights and we manage the radio spectrum.  Our vision for the electronic communications sector is that consumers and businesses in Ireland have affordable, high quality and widespread access to communications services and applications that support their social and economic needs.<br\/><br\/>European law recognises that there are specific competition issues that arise in the telecoms sector and has established a bespoke regime for regulating the sector that operates alongside general competition law.  The bespoke telecoms regime provides for national regulatory authorities to take <i>ex ante<\/i>action to prevent likely competition problems arising, even before they materialise.  The general competition law regime, which provides for <i>ex post<\/i>enforcement against cartels and abuse of dominance, also applies in the sector.<br\/><br\/>ComReg is the national regulatory authority responsible for implementation of the specific telecoms regulatory regime in Ireland.  Under the bespoke telecoms regime, we have used our <i>ex ante<\/i>powers to promote competition in markets such as broadband, voice telephony and broadcast of television signals.  For example, we require Eir to make its network available to competing providers of broadband services.  As a result, operators such as Sky and Vodafone have been able to enter the market.  Today, around a third of all fixed broadband customers get their service from competitors using the Eir network for the final connection to customer premises.<br\/><br\/>ComReg also shares responsibility with the CCPC for enforcement of general competition law, other than merger control, in the electronic communications sector.  ComReg and the CCPC have in place a co-operation agreement.  This facilitates the performance by the CCPC and ComReg of their respective functions as competition authorities, to avoid duplication of activities and to ensure consistency of approach. In practical terms, notification and consultation between ComReg and the CCPC are promoted.<br\/><br\/>The competition (amendment) Bill will transpose the ECN+ directive into Irish law.  It will only have an impact on ComReg&rsquo;s powers and functions as a competition authority.  Changes to our powers and functions under the bespoke telecoms regime, and transposition of new EU law in that area, require separate legislation.  I will comment briefly on three issues in the Bill: sanctions, investigation powers and administrative arrangements.  The directive requires civil financial sanctions for breaches of competition law.  Ireland is one of only two EU member states that do not already have a system of administrative fines for breaches of competition law.  This means we rely solely on criminal enforcement for financial sanctions of competition law breaches.  However, the evidentiary requirements, the complex economic analysis involved in many cases and the criminal standard of proof mean that criminal prosecution is neither practical nor appropriate in most competition law cases.<br\/><br\/>ComReg therefore welcomes and supports the approach in the general scheme giving the Irish administrative competition authorities - the CCPC and ComReg - administrative fining powers, subject to appeal or confirmation by the High Court.  ComReg believes that the proposed scheme, whereby the Irish competition authorities may, subject to court confirmation, impose fines at levels that are sufficiently high to act as a credible deterrent, is essential for the effective enforcement of competition law.<br\/><br\/>ComReg recognises nevertheless that there is a continuing role for criminal sanctions and welcomes the approach in the scheme for a dual civil and criminal sanction regime.  For the enforcement regime to be as effective as possible, civil financial sanctions need to be complemented by enhanced investigations and enforcement powers and an effective leniency regime that encourages early resolution of cases.  Some of the necessary powers are already available to both ComReg and the CCPC.  We welcome the opportunity to enhance ComReg and CCPC powers so that both authorities have all the powers required by the directive.<br\/><br\/>It is vital for competition authorities to be able to obtain information that is relevant to their investigations, including by way of unannounced inspections.  Information-gathering powers need to be underpinned by an ability to impose sanctions if the information required is not forthcoming.  We welcome proposals in the scheme to enable the CCPC and ComReg to punish non-compliance in the context of an investigation by way of periodic penalty payments.  These will assist a speedy and efficient enforcement regime.<br\/><br\/>It is also necessary for competition authorities to be able to stop egregious behaviours and protect consumers and competitors from harm in the short term by adopting appropriate and proportionate interim measures.  Interim measures are essential to ensure competition law breaches do not profit those responsible pending completion of often complex investigations.  Such measures are therefore a key component of the effectiveness of the enforcement regime and public confidence in it.  In addition to the deterrence of breaches, effective enforcement also involves giving incentives to perpetrators to come forward and put an end to a breach and benefit from reductions in the fines where conditions are met.  ComReg welcomes the proposals governing the establishment of a leniency regime.<br\/><br\/>We recognise the importance of fully and adequately protecting the rights of undertakings that are under investigation.  We consider that competition authorities should have the flexibility to determine the precise administrative arrangements to achieve this in the light of their responsibility to organise themselves and deploy their resources as efficiently as possible.  For this reason, we would urge that the Bill set out the principles about fairness contained in the directive rather than specifying administrative arrangements in detail.  This will allow ComReg and the CCPC to define appropriate internal processes and procedures and to publish guidance for undertakings that provide transparency and legal certainty about how these processes will operate.<br\/><br\/>The transposition of the ECN+ directive paves the way for more effective deterrents to, and sanctions for, anti-competitive behaviour in Ireland.  ComReg believes that the proposals in the Bill will have a positive effect on the effective enforcement of national and EU competition rules.  However, I should emphasise that the Bill&rsquo;s impact on ComReg will be limited to our role as an <i>ex post<\/i>competition authority.  Similar enhancements to our enforcement powers are also required in respect of our functions under the bespoke telecoms regulatory regime if we are to become more effective at promoting competition and upholding end user rights. <br\/><br\/>ComReg has consistently advocated for such powers, for example in our submissions to the Law Reform Commission, LRC, on regulatory issues and corporate offences.  We welcome that enhancement of such powers is also included in the programme for Government.  We are discussing the details with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.<\/p><p>We are discussing the details with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  We have also raised that topic when giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks last December.

ComReg supports the views of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and as a competition authority for the electronic communication sector, considers the sector needs the same competition rules as those applying to other sectors in which the CCPC is the national competition authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021022300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I remind members of the need to focus on the provisions of the competition Bill we are examining as opposed to broader issues relating to ComReg or the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021022300002#C00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank our witnesses for their evidence.

The problem with white-collar crime is its degree of invisibility.  There is no dead body or smoking gun.  The existence of the crime has to be proven before proving who did it.

We have a cartel immunity programme that we worked out with the Director of Public Prosecutions for hard core cartels.  <\/p> <p>  The great thing about the leniency programme, as implemented in other member states, is that the competition agency operates it.

We are keen on bid rigging being outlined as an offence in the general scheme.  It is sometimes seen as a form of price fixing.  We are keen on using screening and have been working with our parent Department and others to consider the issue of getting into the data for public procurement in particular.

Most if not all members of the committee have spoken in the past about the need to enhance the authority of agencies to enforce competition law and provide greater protection for the consumers.  There is a need for effective deterrents in order to ensure compliance with competition law.  The power to impose financial penalties is naturally required and very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I believe there is some concern about the proposed additional powers related to video and audio surveillance.  I recognise it is intended that such powers would only be used when investigating serious and criminal breaches of competition law under specific conditions.  It is something that was discussed at a committee meeting a couple of weeks ago when Department officials said that it was not envisaged to have such powers without court involvement and oversight.  Nonetheless, my understanding is that similar powers in other European jurisdictions have been struck down by courts and the European Courts of Human Rights.  I refer, in particular, to a UK case involving the interception of telephone, email and data communications where the European Courts of Human Rights found that there was a violation of Article 8 of the convention as domestic law lacked clarity and did not provide protection against the abuse of power and, I suppose, with the scope or manner of the exercise there was very wide discretion conferred on the authorities.  I would also note that the European Competition Network, ECN, directive does contain provision relating to such powers.  I have one or two question in light of this.  Is it the view that current legislation is sufficiently clear?  From my perspective, the Bill does not seem to provide much certainty about which communications could be monitored.  My reading is that it is intended that these powers would be used at the investigation stage, so at a point when the persons involved have not breached any laws.  Is there a concern that this impacts their fundamental rights at a point when there is no legal charge against them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021022300002#D00300","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>There has been much commentary about the powers proposed in the Bill.  The first point I would make is that serious crime requires serious powers to deal with it.  On the criminal side, these are offences that carry a ten-year jail sentence, prosecution to the Central Criminal Court by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  White-collar crime is crime.  It is up there with other forms of crime in terms of the appropriate penalties.  We would be very used to exercising the criminal powers that we have under the supervision of the courts.  Again, we are a little bit different from some of our counterparts in Europe where they are used to doing things on the civil basis of proof.  We come from the other end of the spectrum where we are used to the supervision of the courts in obtaining a search warrant, and we are used to proving our case in court to that level of proof.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the surveillance powers, they are just used in order to get one to the point where one has evidence to bring to a court or a tribunal.  At the point that one uses the surveillance powers there is no certainty of guilt or otherwise but they are a very important investigative tool.  We have certainly had cases in the past where we have had evidence, for instance, that a group was meeting in an hotel, that a group of businesses engaged in the same trade were meeting, we knew that meeting was going to happen and we had suspicions that it was a cartel meeting but we could not do anything in order to find out what went on at it.  This was somewhat back in the day where, I think, people used to write down what they were talking about during the cartel meetings and one would be able to find stuff in the bin or whatever.  Nowadays, as I mentioned, people are much more tech savvy and so on.  There is a distinction between the powers that are proposed in this Bill, which are very targeted and would be exercised on foot of a warrant versus mass surveillance, which I think was the subject of the UK case that has been mentioned about communications, the retention of data and so on.  We would see these powers as being exercised very narrowly and very much under the supervision of the courts.  Again, I am sure that any input into the details of the legislation that make it clear that this is narrow, targeted and evidence-based would be very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021022300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":336,"content":"<p>To clarify, European law requires any legislation in this area of surveillance to be extremely clear and have strong protections against abuse.

As, increasingly, these become data smart players, they have new sources of power to abuse dominance, to use the term that is used in competition law.  With these new civil powers, will there be an opportunity for either or both of the agencies to develop codes of practice that might set a standard for activities across a range of behaviours that influence competition?  That might help us to get a better handle on this abusive dominance often which can be a little hidden and, I suspect, hard to prosecute and certainly under criminal sanction.  Do we see new codes of practice or standards being promulgated by the agencies, on the back of these changed powers?<\/p> <p>  Ms Goggin said, a bit intriguingly, that the devil is in the detail in terms of how this is transposed into Irish law.

On the point of the devil being in the detail, we really need an holistic view of the process from start to finish where it is clear that whoever grants leniency at the beginning of the process is in a position to implement that at the end of it.  If one is in charge of granting leniency then one is also in charge of developing the level of fines at the end of the process.  That was the difficulty in the system we had previously, or the system that pertains in criminal investigations whereby the investigative agency and the agency that makes the decision on whether an offence has been committed and on the level of fines are separate.  It is strict enough because obviously there needs to be a separation of the investigative and the adjudicative functions in the interests of natural justice, which is very clear.  One cannot have a leniency programme, however, if one is not in charge of determining the ultimate level of the fine.  This was one of our concerns.  We absolutely understand and respect the need for the provisions of natural justice but we are aware that there are lots of agencies in this space in the EU that are not huge.  We would look particularly at the Scandinavian and the Baltic agencies that are relatively small agencies in relatively small countries, and they seem to be able to do this to the satisfaction of the European Court of Justice, ECJ.

We do an amount of this and we publish, as does the European Commission, and we work with the European Commission on that.<\/p> <p>  Another element is that when we do an investigation we try to publish the investigation note by guidance to the industry on what does and does not fall within breaches of competition law.  We believe it is useful to send out a message to industry.  Ultimately, with the new legislation we will have new powers in areas such as the abuse of dominance.  As Ms Goggin has mentioned, if a company is abusing its dominance today there is no financial punishment available from us or from the courts.  This proposed legislation is a game changer for an area of competition law such as abuse of dominance.

International and European agencies commented on this case.  For example, it was stated that in Germany, the fine would have been somewhere between &euro;7 million and &euro;22 million.  I am not suggesting that the case in question will establish a precedent for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission but something of a precedent has been established.  Will the CCPC have the necessary resolve to go hard after the guilty parties and to issue fines in the context of the leniency regime?  Will the fines issued reflect international best practice?

It is up to 10% of annual turnover.  The normal practice is that there are fining guidelines which set out the aggravating and mitigating factors.  Certain factors might result in a reduction in the fine and others might result in an increase in it.  It is important to reiterate that leniency is the way the information is obtained, which leads to the investigation in the first place.  Leniency is an investigative tool used at the start of the process, not a tool of justice used at the end of the process.  The purpose of leniency is not to be nice to parties; it is to get the information that allows others to be pursued.  The pool of those eligible for leniency is quite small.  The idea is that it facilitates the cracking of the cartel.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission has been using this method and imposing fines for years.  Some of the fines imposed in the cartel cases are very substantial.  For example, there was a whole series of related cartels in the car parts industry.  That resulted in fines that amounted to &euro;2 billion.  The Commission has also imposed some very substantial fines for the abuse of dominance on companies in the technology sector.  The levels of fines imposed in this area are certainly a few orders of magnitude higher than the fines imposed in cases such as that referred to by the Deputy.  Again, it comes down to the evidence.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to the point raised about natural justice, we envisage that the fines would be overseen by the courts.

Is there a wider range of areas for which codes of practice could be established?  I am thinking of dominant companies in particular.  I have seen predatory pricing carried out by companies that appears to be wrong.  Could a code of practice on predatory pricing by dominant players be introduced?  Could codes of practice be brought in around the adequacy of complaint procedures and the ability of consumers to contact companies in the event that service is unsatisfactory?  It is a real mark of a dominant player that it can start to become lazy around the provision of service to its consumers.  With this new civil standard, if codes were developed in some of the areas I mentioned, could they become a more effective means of tackling such behaviour?  Ultimately, civil action can be taken if companies fail to comply with what appear to be good codes.

What has tended to happen, quite successfully, is that precedent is set as cases are taken and won or lost and as competition agencies and courts make decisions on different cases.  The issues for each company are very detailed, such as whether and how the company is dominant, what the markets are and what the abuse might be.

He wrote that it was impossible for the king to buy anything as cheaply as other men.  It has been around for centuries that once the public purse is available, people seem to get very good at finding ways of exploiting it.<br\/><br\/>I would not consider the CAB-type powers, particularly in the context of the seizure of assets and so on, to be useful to us at this point.  When we talk about competition offences, we look at quite a wide range.  There are matters that we see as clearly in the criminal space, such as bid-rigging, price-fixing, market-sharing and so on, but there are other practices such as vertical agreements and abuse of dominance that are not subject to proof at that criminal standard but which can be proved in other ways.  We think the appropriate step to do in such cases is to investigate those cases and to use the new powers we are being given to do so.<br\/><br\/>Part of the issue of competition investigation is that there are parties that are damaged.  If a criminal offence is proved, according to the current legislation that is <i>res judicata<\/i>.  Anyone who is damaged by the practice can come forward to seek damages, and the case is regarded as having been proved to the extent that the facts are the same.  That is not necessarily the same in the civil arena, but we hope that if the level of enforcement of competition offences, as a public agency, can be improved, that would stimulate an increase in the number of private sector cases, which includes the likes of public procurers.  People who could prove they had been damaged by an anti-competitive practice could go after the company and get damages as recompense for that.<\/p><p>We see companies being pursued and the possibility of damages as being the most valuable ways to deter people from engaging in these practices.

I have worked in research and policy on climate action and sustainability for 17 years.  Currently independent, I am an adviser to the Finland Futures Research Centre and was lead author of the transport chapter in the Environmental Protection Agency's 2020 state of the environment report.<br\/><br\/>It is to be welcomed that the committee seeks to scrutinise action on transport.  The target to reduce emissions by 51% or more by 2030 must focus minds.  Ireland's national transport carbon emissions are <i>per capita<\/i>the fourth highest in the EU.  Emissions have continued to grow even while we require them to decrease rapidly.<br\/><br\/>It is important to understand why we have been going in the wrong direction.  An extensive rail system that existed at the formation of the State was largely decommissioned over the past century.  In more recent decades, we have delivered the perfect conditions for lock-in to a carbon-intensive transport system.  Through urban sprawl, our settlement pattern has increased travel distances.  At the same time, transport policy directed major investment towards roads and motorways and allowed walking, cycling and public transport to stagnate or decline in comparison.  As our wealth grew and increased demand for transport, decades of policy and private choices funnelled passengers into cars and freight onto trucks.  A lock-in to an unsustainable system was inevitable.<br\/><br\/>The Climate Action Plan 2019, initiated by the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, was a laudable effort at progress.  However, it had a problematic relationship with transport.  Key decisions on spatial and transport planning had already been taken in the national planning framework and the national development plan, NDP.  They included modest, shorter term aims for compact growth and for shifting journeys to sustainable modes.  As a result, it became clear that we would miss our 2030 emissions targets considerably.  To plug this gap, the climate action plan was forced to ramp up the goal for the number of electric vehicles to a level that was difficult to achieve.  We now have a far deeper emissions reduction target and it is a risky and potentially costly gamble to rely on electric vehicles to meet it.  More importantly, this would make our 2050 emissions commitments harder to achieve and deepen the many sustainability problems associated with our transport system.  Just some of these include world-leading traffic congestion, damage to economic competitiveness, road traffic accidents and the many impacts of particulate pollution on human health.<br\/><br\/>The commitments in the national planning framework and the NDP must be seen as a floor of ambition rather than a ceiling.  They are not consistent with the scale of the challenge we now face.  In response, the avoid-shift-improve approach is recognised internationally by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, and others as the standard for deep emissions reductions and sustainability.  This transformative approach demands that policy move from short term to long, from marginal tweaks to big vision, and from improving technology to transforming systems fundamentally.<br\/><br\/>&quot;Avoid&quot; means avoiding the generation of more and longer trips by preventing low-density development and repairing our existing sprawl.  It has common aims with providing affordable, high-quality housing in vibrant, well-serviced communities.  It uses spatial planning tools to channel virtually all future development into the existing footprints of our cities and into revitalising the physical core of the villages and towns of rural Ireland.  &quot;Avoid&quot; also includes short-term demand management.<br\/><br\/>&quot;Shift&quot; is the next priority.  It means moving journeys from private cars to walking, cycling and public transport.  It implements the settlement and transport planning necessary to make these sustainable modes the dominant forms of movement in the years to come.  There needs to be a particular priority on rail for passengers and freight.  Rail is the safest and most sustainable option over longer distances and can support greatly increasing walking and cycling.<\/p><p>\"Improve\" means smaller vehicles, better engines and moving to alternatives such as electric.  This will remain a necessary, but not a sufficient approach for a sustainable low-carbon future.<\/p><p> Transformation involves bringing together spatial, transport and climate action policy.  It begins with 2050 goals and implements the short-term plans necessary to meet them.  In Ireland, we have major gaps to address.  Our vision, our analysis and our policy all need a shot in the arm.<\/p><p> To conclude, if our severely congested, emissions-intensive and economically costly transport system were a heart patient, it would be in cardiac failure.  Our policy is providing an aspirin when the patient needs a triple heart bypass.  Making progress will require vision and political leadership.  Through the disruption of the pandemic, we now have a unique opportunity to reset and put ourselves on the right side of history.<\/p><p> I thank the committee once more for this opportunity to speak and I am happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tadhg O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Mahony and now invite Mr. Cussen to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#B00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for the invitation.  I have submitted a statement so I will cover some highlights from it.  The remit of the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, is as an independent overseer of the implementation by planning authorities and by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of the regulatory and policy framework for planning set by the Oireachtas and Government.  I will cover the various topics such as: avoiding increasing energy demands, accelerating the shift towards sustainable travel patterns and diversifying our energy systems.<\/p> <p>  Starting with avoiding increasing energy demands through proper planning, it is fair to say that, historically, our model of development has hardwired us to mainly low-density development dependent on car-based transport, perhaps due to a low awareness of the impacts on the environment and the weakness of sustainable alternatives.  Legislative reforms introduced in 2010 included stricter controls on how, where and how much land would be sold for development but it has been very challenging to implement these reforms which has required dezoning in commuter locations and rezoning land for development in underutilised urban areas.  Today, the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040: National Planning Framework, NPF, commits to securing an average of 40% of the delivery of all new homes on brownfield and infilled development land, rising to 50% in cities and 30% in our towns and villages, through good local authority planning.<\/p> <p>  From our vantage point on the implementation of this we see a mixed picture.  Some local authorities work hard on climate action-centred planning policy despite significant vested interest, political and sometimes public opposition where the link between certain developments and climate are perhaps not fully appreciated.  Other local authorities increasingly point to brownfield and higher density development being much less economic compared to lower density greenfield development and point out that following traditional patterns of development might be essential in meeting housing supply pressures.  Communities often want to retain familiar 19th century skylines as our cities and towns struggle to address 21st century challenges, including an extra 1 million people predicted by the by the national planning framework by 2040.<\/p> <p>  Building upwards and making better use of underutilised urban land, providing attractive, affordable and well-located urban housing and connected communities are many of the antidotes to our historical business-as-usual outwards pattern of energy-intensive urban sprawl.  Yet urban regeneration, as many members of the committee will know, is massively time and resource-consuming, often litigious, and, if one does not have good participatory-based planning, can be locally contentious.<\/p> <p>  As we highlighted in the annual report of the OPR, until the NPF is properly reflected and acted upon, we will continue to approve and develop too much development in locations that continue to hardwire us into increasing energy demand.<\/p> <p>  Turning around the affordability, attractiveness and viability of large-scale housing development within our city and town centres is very critical as will a national brownfield and infill development land register to identify what compact growth means.  Land activation measures such as progressing the Land Development Agency Bill, empowering local authorities to implement the vacant and derelict sites legislation and swift despatch of litigation arising are also vital.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the shift towards active and sustainable travel, all members of the committee will agree that spatial planning policies have a great influence in determining transport patterns.  Technology can break old links between work and mobility.  There is no doubt that Government is making unprecedented investment but we are championing the critical importance of full integration between transport and land use planning, like some of the recent plans such as the local area plan for Athy and the Dingle hub project.<\/p> <p>  We want to engage in skilling programmes for the local authorities in delivering sustainable mobility but in the context of shifting from promoting sprawling estates and scattered housing, which never work from a public transport and active travel perspective.<\/p> <p>  Turning briefly to improving the sustainability of our energy sources, communities want real action on climate.  One of the best ways to tap that desire would be to show how every county in the country could play its part in delivering an estimated extra 4 GW of renewable electricity to 2030 and, indeed, more offshore energy generation to a carbon-free society by 2050.  Yet our assessments of some local authority development plans find effective bans on the roll-out of sustainable energy sources.  On top of the updated Wind Energy Development Guidelines we need a national renewable energy roadmap with county-specific targets and the designation of sustainable energy zones which can be built by the regional assemblies working with the local authority climate action regional offices.<\/p> <p>  The Planning Act under section 10(2)(n) already demands forward planning that reduces future patterns of energy consumption, shifts our present energy needs towards renewable sources and adapts to climate changes already happening.  The pace in implementing this law is quickening since the publication of the NPF, the establishment of our office and the coming into being of local authority climate action plans under the legislation promised.  Local government and local authority planning, however, has a central role to play in the Avoid-Shift-Improve approach I mentioned but it needs clear policy frameworks and resources to work with to ensure that local authority members focus on the task at hand.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding this and our statutory mandate, legislated for by the Oireachtas and supported by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, we will work to ensure that all the constituent cogs in our country&rsquo;s planning process work together in the planet&rsquo;s and not just in local interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cussen for that presentation and call on Mr. Murphy to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#B00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and the members of the committee for the opportunity to attend today's committee hearing on the implications and opportunities in decarbonising Ireland&rsquo;s transport network.  Transport &amp;amp; Environment, T&amp;E, is a Brussels-based European-level NGO, advocating a more sustainable transport network at European and national level.  T&amp;E&rsquo;s vision is a zero-emission mobility system that is affordable and has minimal impacts on our health, climate and environment.  I have been with T&amp;E for almost seven years, focusing largely on the aviation sector.  A graduate of NUI Galway, I have been living in Brussels for ten years, moving there initially to work for the European Commission&rsquo;s transport directorate.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is not alone in witnessing a growth in transport emissions, with this sector now the largest source of emissions across Europe.  However, the absolute growth in emissions from Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector - an increase of 136% since 1990 - is stark compared to an EU average increase of 20%.<\/p> <p>  It would be tempting to ascribe such exceptional growth to Ireland&rsquo;s increase in GDP and population over that period.  However, this would ignore the role that policy decisions at all levels have played.  After all, it is Ireland&rsquo;s choice where we put this population growth and how we invested this wealth.<\/p> <p>  Nearly all aspects of the Avoid, Shift, Improve approach are impacted, directly or indirectly, by European legislation.  How this legislation is amended in the coming years will be crucial to achieving substantial emission reductions in the transport sector.<\/p> <p>  Europe's effort sharing regulation incentivises avoid and shift through target setting for parts of the economy, including transport.  That regulation is, however, under threat.  Vehicle regulations set targets for large and small vehicles, and have been decisive in driving the uptake of both low emission and high emissions vehicles.   The environmental and climate impact of fuels is regulated through the fuel quality and renewable energy directives, shaping the development of biofuels policy in Europe.  Aviation and shipping have to date received only passing interest from European regulators.  That has led to damaging consequences for these sectors' ability to decarbonise.<\/p> <p>  In addition to these regulations, the EU also plays an important role in financing transport infrastructure.  For example, the EIB has in the past lent heavily to carbon intensive projects, especially airports and roads, a position which is evolving as the bank aligns its lending with the goals of the Paris Agreement.<\/p> <p>  European legislation is now starting to pay dividends where, for example, the reforms to car standards introduced in the wake of VW&rsquo;s \"dieselgate\" scandal are driving the deployment of zero-emission vehicles.  The bulk of European legislation is now under review under Europe&rsquo;s Green Deal which will touch on issues in respect of electric vehicles, batteries and biofuels.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy &ndash; Putting European Transport on Track for the Future, published last December, will guide European policy in this area.  It envisages smart and climate neutral cities across Europe, delivered through a range of measures, including shared mobility and increased cycling and walking infrastructure.  There is no one single fix to eliminating emissions from transport.<\/p> <p>  Policy developments are mutually reinforced by technological developments.<\/p><p>Improvements in battery technology, with regard to both range and price, have repeatedly exceeded expectations.  The price of batteries has fallen 85% in a decade and they can now go further and charge faster.  I consider myself one of the strongest proponents of the direct electrification of the transport system via electric vehicles.  We are far from realising the full potential of this area, due in part to some persisting myths regarding battery electrification.  Nevertheless, I have no intention of owning an electric vehicle because I have no intention of owning a private vehicle of any type.  I live in a major city with ample access to cheap public transport and where an increasing priority is given to walking and cycling.<\/p><p> This gets us to the key issue of decarbonising transport.  Stricter regulations and developments in technology mean we can, for most modes, offer people access to low-carbon mobility.  However, the public should always be given a choice and no one should be forced into a 20th century model of private car ownership which continues to have substantial negative financial, social and economic consequences.  A one-for-one switch between internal combustion engines and electric vehicles would be a missed opportunity.  It would undermine the effectiveness of public transport investments, place continued financial pressure on families and would risk putting Irish cities further out of step with their European counterparts.<\/p><p> Our transport policy is linked with our industrial and economic policy.  The right choices in decarbonising our transport sector can have enormous benefits for our economy, creating employment opportunities across the island.  With 97% of our transport energy demand met by imported fossil fuels in 2017, we have an opportunity to switch to developing our own fuels in Ireland, including fuels for the shipping and aviation sectors, through presently untapped offshore renewable energy potential. <\/p><p> I said &ldquo;most modes&rdquo; have an immediate pathway to decarbonisation.  A major exception is aviation which, before Covid, was the fastest growing source of emissions in Europe.  That is not by accident.  Our failure to effectively regulate aviation emissions, and instead to subsidise their growth, has created this situation.  This lack of regulation has consequences.  Measures put in place to decarbonise other sectors, including measures relating to cars, buildings and electricity, are starting to pay dividends.  Aviation is increasingly isolated as a high emitter of carbon, a problem which will return to threaten the sector post Covid.  This lack of regulation does the sector no favours and Ireland&rsquo;s role in resisting such regulation at European level is short-sighted in the extreme.  As an Irish citizen living overseas, I am acutely aware of the role aviation plays in connecting Ireland.  Those who talk up the strategic importance of aviation to Ireland should be equally vocal in ensuring the sector cuts its emissions.  With effort, and in time, we can develop solutions for aviation too.  I look forward to taking members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy and the other witnesses for their opening statements and for attending today's session to inform the committee about the issues at play when considering how best to reduce our national transport emissions, which are the fourth highest <i>per capita<\/i>in Europe and which comprise 20% of our overall national emissions.  This meeting is confined to a maximum of two hours.

While the clerk is noting the order, I will start off the questioning.<\/p><p>Given the scale of the challenge ahead in achieving at least 51% decarbonisation in transport by 2030, there is a fear that our planning policy is not aligned with our ambition.  In other words, is the national planning framework fit for purpose?  As Mr. Cussen pointed out in his opening statement, the national planning framework commits to securing an average of 40% of all new homes on brownfield and in-fill development land, with this average to rise to 50% in cities and to fall to 30% in towns and villages.  However, this indicates that 50% of homes are to be developed around cities and 70% around towns and villages.  This seems to pull against the principles of compact growth and the town centres first approach.  It will also continue our problem of urban sprawl, which beds in dependency on cars.  This dependency is at its worst in towns and villages, given the lack of public and active travel options.  As Mr. Cussen points out, we must away move from promoting sprawling estates and scattered housing which, to quote Mr. Cussen, will &quot;never work from a public transport and active travel perspective.&quot;<\/p><p>All three witnesses mentioned the approach of avoid, shift and improve.  Dr. O'Mahony commented that the commitments in the national planning framework and the NDP must be seen as a floor of ambition rather than a ceiling and that it is not consistent with the scale of the challenge we face.  The highest priority in this approach is given to avoiding, which is to say avoiding the generation of longer trips by preventing low-density development and repairing the sprawl we already have.

I also have a question for Mr. Cussen in particular.  We have seen evidence of local authorities enabling schemes that are quite dependent on cars at the periphery of urban centres through local area plans but it is claimed on paper that they are aligned with the national planning framework, NPF.  As regulator, is Mr. Cussen prepared to intervene in such cases to prevent their development if they will lock in dependency on cars and greenhouse gas emissions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#C00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Would the Chairman like me to address that question now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Yes, if Mr. Cussen would like to go first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#C00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":402,"content":"<p>We work within a regulatory and policy framework that is set by the Government.

A second reason is that it needs to look at alternatives.  Rather than just looking at small changes or redirecting 40% of new developments into existing footprints, it needs to look at the possibilities for approaches that are more transformative and more radical.  If one does not consider radical measures when looking at transformation, one is not seeking transformation.<\/p> <p>  I know the national planning framework was formed a number of years ago, before the real urgency of this issue came to bear, but we do not have analysis available in Ireland which can support choices.

We do not know what would be involved in taking a transformative approach to sustainable modes of transport in order that they dominate mobility in the future.  There would be capital costs and other implications but our current approach is very costly for our economy in terms of competitiveness.  It is widely accepted at this stage that this is not an emissions problem but a sustainable development problem.

It is very near the bottom, perhaps after Malta and Cyprus.  We should also be evidence driven on how much we can actually shift to rail, particularly in a short period like ten years.  Across Europe, we have about 18% of freight transferred by rail.  On a good day, we can get maybe 23% of freight transferred by rail.  There is not going to be an easy solution to shifting to rail.  That is why it is important to drive forward electrification in those sectors which cannot be so easily changed by a switch to public transport or planning changes.<\/p><p> Both the 2019 climate action plan and the programme for Government are either quite weak on the application of freight transport or they pursue some of the wrong solutions, such as using natural gas or using biogas for freight transport.  To some extent that is understandable.  The technology in this area is moving fast.  Just this month, Scania ditched plans for hydrogen-powered trucks and instead is going all out on battery electric vehicles.<\/p><p> When we are talking about this, we need to be clear on what we can achieve through changes in planning, the shift to rail and what needs to be electrified.

It is obviously an obligation on the planning authority to address those.<\/p> <p>  Public awareness is important in terms of what compact growth means and how we can achieve that in practice.  We are very engaged around that.  We have published toolkits for public engagement.  We sponsor the \"Eco Eye\" series and there is a programme airing tonight on the very topic the Deputy has raised.  I would recommend it as good viewing.<\/p> <p>  This is about raising public awareness about the urgency of this issue and its connectedness to other challenges that we face as a society, whether they are climate, economic, social, mobility and so on.  We are also engaged in training programmes with elected members.  To date, we have had seven events with an eighth one coming up this Friday.  We have had hundreds of engagements with the 949 councillors the length and breadth of the country.  They tune into our monthly webinars on these very matters.  There is strong evidence of elected council members becoming much more aware around these issues and indeed understanding some of their cruxes and the trade-offs which have to be addressed in securing compact development.<\/p> <p>  To help get things moving, we will have reviews of local authorities.  We are a statutory reviewer of local authorities, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We have a pilot programme with four local authorities being reviewed this year.  We will be building up to a series of six per annum thereafter.  We will be looking closely at local authority policies and programmes regarding active land management.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised a point about local area plans being adopted and particular opportunity sites identified.  What has been the progress since the last plan adoption and moving matters forward?  We will be asking straight questions on capacity and agility.  In fairness to our local authorities, having much experience of working in them myself over recent years, they are extremely hard pressed.  They need to be supported, resourced and funded appropriately to take on these functions.

We are tight for time so I will focus on electric vehicles, EVs.  Dr. O'Mahony made some interesting comments in his opening statement.  He said that because of the deeper emissions reduction target, it is a risky and potentially costly gamble to rely on electric vehicles to meet that target.  Our target is for 950,000 EVs by 2030.  It is obvious we have not had a very good track record in rolling out EVs or the infrastructure for same.  We are still struggling on that front, with only 7.4% of new passenger sales in 2020 being EVs.  That compares with 74.8% in Norway or indeed 18.1% in Finland.  If the target of 950,000 by 2030 is not achievable, what kind of target does Dr. O'Mahony think is feasible?  What are the kind of changes the Government would need to put in place to ensure the target was met, because meeting even a significantly reduced target would be difficult at this stage?<\/p> <p>  I am also interested in Dr. O'Mahony's opinion on using EVs to meet that target and how cost-prohibitive they are.  Is there a risk there will be a whole section of our community who cannot afford to use this technology and therefore, when it comes to a just transition and ensuring everyone can play their part the cost will exclude them from that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#E00500","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":415,"content":"<p>On the achievability of the electric vehicles target, I would not say it is not possible to do it with electric vehicles - it certainly is - but it relies on a number of things.  It relies on the supply of minerals required to make the batteries being constantly available globally, including sufficient supply to manufacture the vehicles that would come to Ireland.  That is not guaranteed.  It also means we have a system that just requires more technological change overall.  That already becomes more costly.  It is the wrong approach to start at 2030.  We must always start with 2050 and with the preventative approaches of avoid and shift, only coming to improve at the end.  I would not say it is not possible, but our target in the climate action plan to move up to 936,000 electric vehicles is the same diffusion rate as Norway's.  Norway is the world leader and that has cost a lot in terms of public subvention.  If we are relying on the cost of electric vehicles coming down, we are taking a little bit of a risk that it will happen on an expected timeline.  It also embeds the other sustainability issues.<\/p> <p>  Electric vehicles cannot deal with the issue of particulate matter completely.  A total of 50% of emissions will remain because they come from tyre and break wear.  It affects cognitive development of the unborn child, mental health and cardiovascular disease.  There are a whole range of human health impacts so, again, relying on that is ceding ground to an approach to transport systems which is not sustainable.  That being said we should still do it.  We should still pursue EVs and alternative drivetrains but not prioritise them.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has hit on a really important issue of people who may not be able to afford this.  If we rely on EVs and potentially on retiring cars before their usual end of life and give public subvention to help people to do that - scrappage schemes and other things, that is a direct transfer of wealth from the State to people who are usually wealthier.  It leaves out people who may be on the minimum wage or may be earning less.  To provide a mobility system, not a transport system, that serves all is another reason from a just transition equity perspective to prioritise avoid and shift and not just improve in EVs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tadhg O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":416,"content":"<p>Mr. Murphy may wish to address that question as well as it is relevant to his area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#E00700","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Fundamentally, the next ten years will be extremely different from the past ten years where the deployment of EVs is concerned.  The primary reason is that the range of cars available in a showroom and their prices are largely decided by EU legislation.  This legislation forces manufacturers to lower the CO2 produced by those vehicles and therefore puts more electric vehicles on the road.  In the last quarter of 2019 and 2020 there was an uptick in sales of EVs in Ireland.  They were offered at lower rates to encourage uptake.  On the issue of cost, those who have bet against the cost of EVs declining have lost every time.  Batteries have reduced in price by 85% in the past decade and have decreased by 17% in the last year alone.  Batteries are one third of the cost of electric vehicles.  Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which is among the most optimistic about the cost of EVs, upgraded its forecast for price parity between EVs and internal combustion vehicles to between 2023 and 2025.  EVs are cheaper to produce, maintain and power.<\/p> <p>  The next ten years will be very different.  People point to Norway and say we will need Norway-type subsidies to ensure the deployment of EVs but that is not necessarily the case.  If they are going to become this cheap, they can be deployed.  However, I would stress, and this is very evident in yesterday's figures on the sale of EVs of Ireland, that there is a big difference between battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.  The Irish taxation regime needs to be amended to reflect some misleading figures by manufacturers and the European legislation needs to be amended to fix some of the loopholes which are emerging with EVs.  Targets for Ireland refer to zero or low-emissions vehicles.  We need to drop the reference to low-emissions vehicles and just go all in on zero-emissions ones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I thank the contributors today.

I wish to address specifically a project near me which the contributors may be familiar with, which is the Galway ring road.  One of the arguments there is that it would increase emissions by 37%.  Electric vehicles address some of that issue.  Dr. O'Mahony talked about urban sprawl and the increased travel distance.  In some parts of that proposal, it would increase what is a 5.5 km journey to 22 km.

It is ten years since I left Galway but when I last lived there, the outer bypass was a major issue and it is still being debated.  I remember reading the impact assessment for the proposed bypass ten years ago.  The evidence then was pretty clear that building the road would cause more cars to be used in Galway and would make the city more car dependent.  Is our vision to have electric buses stuck in traffic behind electric cars?  That is what we will get if we pursue both the electrification of vehicles and the construction of more roads.  When we talk about the electrification of cars, we always talk about Norway and how great it is but we should look at what Oslo is doing.  Oslo as a city is being very aggressive in getting cars out of the city.  It has been closing streets to cars and removing on-street car parking.  Supporting the electrification of vehicles is not the same as supporting endless road building.<\/p> <p>  To touch on the mineral issues which were raised by Deputy Whitmore, there is a problem with the minerals used in battery production.  Last December the EU proposed the world's first law to regulate the mineral content of batteries, including enforcing social conditions for extraction and recycling targets for some of those minerals.  Obviously, the more vehicles we have to produce, the more challenging it is to ensure that production is done sustainably.

Instead of taking the possible expansion of rail off the table, we should look at it.  Just because we look at an option does not mean that we go down the road of taking it.

It is important to remember that as with local authority development plans, the national planning framework is a cyclical plan that will have to be reviewed or revisited by the Government in conjunction with all stakeholders on a regular basis.  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 established the legislative basis for the national planning framework and its renewal out into the future.  That will ultimately be a matter for the Government and the processes are laid out in the legislation, including Oireachtas scrutiny of the preparation of revisions to the national planning framework.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned in my paper, a very important starting point would be the compilation of a national brownfield land register or database.  As it stands, with regard to the laudable objective of 30% for villages, 50% for cities and 40% in overall urban terms, it is actually very hard for us to monitor the effectiveness of development plans in a very precise way.  It is very important that we start down the road of having those strong objectives in planning frameworks but the measurement of it, in terms of how it is actually being achieved on the ground, is still somewhat uncertain.  That is an issue that we are continuing to research and to engage on with our parent department and the local authorities more generally.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to the Senator's point about tweaking the framework while taking on board the latest scientific evidence and the evolving climate action objectives, that will naturally come in the round in terms of the evolution of the national planning framework.  We need to think through the unintended consequences of having extremely ambitious targets for brownfield development without considering the deliverability and affordability of same.  As Deputy Farrell mentioned earlier, in many cases local authority development plans will include brownfield regeneration sites and yet members will see, some years later, that progress towards getting those activated is slow.  The effectiveness of our vacant and derelict sites legislation is an issue.  The mechanisms and the tools that are available to local authorities to get brownfield development sites into production so that they provide sustainable, high-quality and affordable options for people are very important.

There may be a risk of a false dichotomy being created between electrification versus compact development.  The reality is that we need both.  In terms of compact development, at best 1% of our housing stock is built each year.  We would like to be at 2% but that is still a small proportion that will be delivered by 2030.  Obviously, as Dr. O'Mahony said, by 2050 the number will be bigger and will have much more impact.  Our entire car fleet will change over the next decade so there is an opportunity to have a significant influence on the fleet that is purchased over that period.  That will have an immediate impact.  Dr. Murphy is right that electrification is an available and usable option.  We must bear in mind that 90% of journeys over 8 km in Ireland are driven journeys and it is difficult to replace a lot of them with public transport, no matter how ambitious we become.  We have an immediate problem as well as a long-term one.<\/p> <p>  As we move from the climate action plan, which was built around a 30% target, to a 51% target, what changes would the witnesses propose we make to that climate plan?  In that context, how do we measure the cost-effectiveness of interventions?  I speak from experience with the national broadband plan, which was expensive but, in my view, absolutely essential.  I found it very difficult to get public support for that within the system because the tendency is to look at the short-term costs.  How do we deal with the issue of the choices that have long-term benefits but high short-term costs?<\/p><p>How important do the witnesses believe pricing is in achieving the objectives of transition?  Carbon pricing has its supporters and its opponents.  I refer to road pricing.  How important will they be as we move towards the 2050 target?<\/p><p> My final question relates to compact development.  Do we need to move to some sort of planning gain model whereby communities in which high density development is taking place get something back?  Do we need to see deeper integration of the local development plan with the national plan?

We can improve the climate action plan through more focus on freight.  It is suggested that there are no low-emission freight vehicles in the climate action plan but technology has changed rapidly in two years.<\/p> <p>  In terms of cost-benefit, I would drop the increase in the biofuel lending rate.  If we look at where we are getting the ethanol from and the competition we have with land, the most recent National Oil Reserves Agency report on the sourcing of biofuels in Ireland, be they advanced biodiesel or bioethanol, raises some flags regarding origins of such fuels.<\/p> <p>  On where else we can increase ambition, the T&aacute;naiste has launched his working-from-home proposal, which will study the potential benefits of working from home.  We should await that study but that is another obvious way to increase ambition.<\/p> <p>  Carbon pricing is not the most effective way of reducing transport emissions because the consumer is forced into a particular model and if the price goes up, he or she is not necessarily able to then switch out to a different model.  The Deputy mentioned that carbon pricing has supporters and opponents.  The big supporters of carbon pricing are car manufacturers who would rather shift the burden onto the consumers and individuals as a way of having to do less themselves.  We think of car standards at European level.  Carbon pricing always involves a social equity issue.  If there are ways to address the social equity issue but there will not be a big climate benefit from engaging in carbon pricing why go to the hassle of the potential risk of social inequity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Does Dr. O'Mahony want to go next?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#G00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Yes.  I will try to be brief.  On the climate action plan, in terms of short-term actions progress has already been made on spending almost &euro;1 million per day on cycling and walking.  That needs to be embedded further.  In addition, demand management and the result of the pandemic in terms of working from home, as Mr. Murphy mentioned, is very important.  It is important because it has been acknowledged internationally that looking at 2030 is not the right way forward.  We need to look at 2050 and look at 2030 and 2040 as the way-posts to decarbonisation.  To do that, we will need better evidence of what we can do with avoid and shift.  The estimates in the literature vary from a 20% to 50% reduction in emissions in terms of avoid and shift.  There is potential that that will be higher in Ireland because our population growth is estimated and it is the higher population projection of 6.7 million.  That could be higher.  We do not know.  We do not have the evidence.<\/p> <p>  In terms of cost-effectiveness analysis, relying only on such an analysis is not appropriate to understanding systemic transformations.  It gives one the results and the implications in terms of the cost per unit carbon that is reduced but it does not answer any of the equity questions.  It usually involves a forecast rather than alternative scenarios that explore avoid and shift so it is necessary but not sufficient.<\/p> <p>  In terms of pricing, I agree with Mr. Murphy.  There is a conclusion in the literature that pricing is not enough.  Carbon pricing is a supplemental measure that can prevent rebounds if the price of fuel comes down but the conclusions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its transport chapter were very clear.  We need to do the systemic long-term changes, with 2030 and 2040 changes supporting that, and carbon pricing can assist.  It is not one's first measure no more than electric vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tadhg O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Mahony.

That is important to address.<br\/><br\/>Pricing is very important in terms of shifting behaviour.  In terms of the way we build housing currently, the cost on the development side in respect of greenfield land can be much lower than in an urban or brownfield context, even though, in a greenfield context, it costs the State and the taxpayer a lot more to service it from an infrastructural perspective.  Brownfield locations very often having access to existing infrastructure.  Pricing and the price of land and how we get that shift towards brownfield development are important instruments.<br\/><br\/>With regard to compact development, I agree absolutely with the Deputy that community benefit and, indeed, development contribution schemes are mechanisms in the planning Acts that could be used more in the context of ensuring that local communities see the benefit from the regeneration of their areas.

I ask him to speak to his powers of enforcement or the opportunity to improve the policy or regulatory or legislative tools available to deliver on the national planning framework or the compact proposals.

He touched on the national brownfield and infill development land register, the Land Development Agency Bill, the vacant and derelict sites legislation and also the dispatch of litigation.  He might comment on those matters.<\/p> <p>  Finally, will he expand on the point in terms of renewable energy?

We are using discount rates that are very high for a wealthy country.  What that means in terms of an actual cost benefit analysis is that it will devalue the benefit of a mitigation project, which is something that improves a situation and reduces emissions, and also devalue the cost of a project such as a road that increases emissions.

Regarding our powers of enforcement, the way the legislation works is that we independently assess the plans of the local authorities by reference to the requirements of the legislation, the national planning framework regional and spatial economic strategies, and various guidelines and policies set out by the Minister and the Government that are relevant to planning.  At a strategic level we determine the fit between what the local authorities set out in their plans and that broader context.  If we feel they are broadly up to the mark, we will support those plans.  If we feel there are gaps or breaches of that regulatory and policy framework, we will set that out in our statutory observations, which include recommendations and which effectively have to be followed through, and other observations, which may cover more detailed points.  If the local authority does not follow our recommendations, we have the option to recommend to the Minister the use of his or her power under section 31 of the Act to direct the local authority to take such steps as are necessary to close that policy breach.  That is just how the enforcement process works.  As for some of the references in my statement to, for example, the brownfield register and some of the other areas such as that, we are engaged in research programmes and in constant dialogue with our parent Department and local authorities on how that can be done, particularly regarding the use of cutting-edge geographic information systems, GIS, and we have some ideas about that.<\/p> <p>  Yes, it is very important to progress the wind energy guidelines.  From constant engagement with both the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I understand that is a top priority, and I think that will be seen before too long.  The addition of the roadmap in terms of how the RES-E targets will be delivered and the relevance of that at a local authority level also create the opportunity for community participation in some of those projects.

I think many people who choose, in effect, the rural settlement option are often very interested in the option of being able to locate in a smaller town or village, particularly if self-build site options etc. are available at modest cost with the infrastructure laid out.  Going back to our public awareness brief, we raised this in our sponsorship of one of the \"Eco Eye\" series which looked at this very topic and how some local authorities, especially Tipperary County Council, have been very proactive in this space.

I will try to get through them as quickly as possible.  The first is to Dr. O'Mahony.  In his opening statement I think one of the very first sentences concerned the decommissioning of our rail system throughout the 20th century.  Part of that happened where I am from.  I am from west Cork and I represent Cork South-West.  There was the west Cork railway, as it was called.  It went from Cork through to Bandon and Enniskeane and on to Bantry and extended right out to the west, with branches off to Clonakilty, Courtmacsherry and other areas.  It must have been an amazing thing to witness.  However, if I were to stand up in the D&aacute;il tomorrow and call for a return of the west Cork railway and ask for it to be rebuilt, I would be laughed out of the Chamber.  A lot of the old rail lines - in this instance almost 100% - have been taken back into farmland, so the process of starting up a project such as this would be described as pie in the sky by many.  My question for Dr. O'Mahony is this: how do we get to a point where this becomes a more real conversation that is not one of dreams and unachievable aspirations but one that may be achieved?  As he has rightly stated, we have a road network but the N71 is not fit for purpose.  In non-Covid times it is absolutely logjammed because of the amount of vehicular traffic on it.  A railway would go a long way towards relieving that pressure and reducing carbon emissions.  What is the best approach in that regard that would make this a more realistic proposal?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Dr. O'Mahony as well.  He mentioned roads and road building, but would he not agree that certain road infrastructure does have a place in terms of the vibrancy of our towns and villages?  Mr. Cussen spoke a lot about \"Eco Eye\".  It recently featured a piece on Clonakilty and how it was held up as a model for how things should be done in terms of public realm works and giving people back public spaces.

I feel like I have not been given as much liberty as everyone else, but that is fine.  A big part of how that happened was that we have a southern relief road built.

That is a really important question.<\/p> <p>  I have one more question for Dr. O'Mahony about schools.  The busiest time in most of our towns and villages is school time, when there is mayhem and traffic runs.  Can public transport play a role, even within our smaller towns of 5,000 or 6,000 people, in the form of pickups in different estates to take that volume of traffic away from towns?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#H01000","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":451,"content":"<p>The rail question is an interesting one.  It is a reflection of where we are that it sounds outlandish to propose something that could be hugely beneficial to the public good.  That is because we have essentially run down the system for decades upon decades, and it is now almost a cultural thing that it is not regarded as a viable option.  I would suggest that in the climate action plan we need to see a commitment to a study on transformation of spatial planning and of mobility to see what is plausible and to see all the implications and costs.  Then a politician can make a claim of a desirable policy without it being pie in the sky because there is some evidence and analysis to back it up.<\/p><p>It is very important that in the next climate action plan we look not just at short-term measures but also at really improving our evidence base.<\/p><p> Of course roads have a role.

I am old enough to remember when I used to always walk and cycle, partly because there were fewer cars on the road.  It is also important to think of how we would look at active modes, which are good for children's health, whereby we have segregated cycle lanes in all towns that children can use to get to school and then also look at the public transport options.

As a representative of an urban area, I want to ask Dr. O'Mahony and Mr. Murphy about the Dublin bikes scheme, which was referenced in the opening remarks.  It has been a great success and it has provided that shift.  Unfortunately for the region of Dublin, there has not been a bike sharing scheme to cover the entire area.  This presents limitations to the benefits one can enjoy from this type of scheme.

I thank him for his opening statement and remarks.  With regard to the guide to the planning process and the document he gave to us in advance of this meeting, I compliment his office on the information that has been given to the public about the planning process.  The new leaflets are very beneficial and I compliment everyone involved.  In saying this, recently we have witnessed a large volume of strategic housing developments, which I hope will come to an end quite shortly.  Mr. Cussen spoke about sustainable planning.

Taking in context the role of the regional assembly, and of the councils with regard to the climate action plans that each local authority is working through, what is Mr. Cussen's view of how we could reform or strengthen their role in all of this?  At times, local authorities, particularly in Dublin, have their own individual climate action plans and on top of all of this is a regional strategy.

Specifically on the Dublin bikes scheme and car sharing, car sharing has usually been private so local authorities can assist in support of it but in practice it has been more private.  The Dublin bikes scheme is a little bit different from the schemes in other European countries because we have basically required it to pay for itself.  If we look at the emissions reduction per euro spent on it, it is very low.  It has all sorts of public good benefits because cars are taken off the road and public health is improved.  It is a very cheap way of getting around.  I was quite sceptical of it at the time.  I remember people saying they expected the bikes to end up in the Grand Canal.  It has been fantastically successful and must be applauded, and it needs to be extended.<\/p> <p>  Many of these measures, and this is also true of rail, and Mr. Cussen mentioned serviced sites and achieving compact growth, have a cost element.  We need to look at what these potential costs are and come up with innovative arrangements to finance them.  Finance is very important and was given a section of the transport chapter of the EPA's report.  I agree with the Deputy 100% that we should be looking at regionalising a bike share scheme and pushing car share schemes.  They are very sensible measures that do not have a huge financial or fiscal footprint but in some cases we may need to look at whether it is possible to give more public subvention or whether we can look at innovative financing arrangements.  It is also important that there is leadership from politicians to push and say that it is hugely beneficial to the public good and that they want it for the people of wider Dublin, Limerick or Cork.   We must ask whether we can push this through, such as through drawing down new funding to support walking and cycling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tadhg O'Mahony"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I am delighted that Deputy Devlin found our guides helpful.  That is great feedback and I appreciate it.  I will pass it on to the team.  We hope to do a lot more on this, including videos.  We will do further leaflets.  Many ordinary people often find it somewhat difficult to understand or fathom the workings of the planning process.  What we want to try to do in terms of our public awareness is to dispel some of those myths and put better information into the public's hands on how they can really influence the planning process.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a number of questions.  It is fair to say the strategic housing development process has put all the various strands, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the local authorities, under a lot of pressure, particularly in terms of resources.  Perhaps it was an initiative to jump start the assembly of planning consents, which had almost completely withered away after the banking crash.  As the Government has clearly signalled, it will run its course in the very near future.  This may allow some reorganisation of resources.  To this point, the Deputy mentioned the regional assemblies.  Certainly they have more potential in delivering a shared service or a collective approach in co-ordinating the work of local authorities.  There is some evidence of this already happening through the climate action regional offices, which, in effect, work across a number of local authorities.  There is certainly a very strong case for more on this, as is referenced in my statement.<\/p> <p>  To clarify one point on the brownfield register, it is something for the Government to progress.

This means reducing a lot of congestion and reducing the amount of air pollution that comes from freight, which is powered by compressed natural gas.  It also means looking at the issue of night flights in Dublin airport, which are under consideration, and the impact they will have on people living in these urban areas.<\/p> <p>  On the point on rolling out rail, we should always analyse various scenarios of what might be beneficial in terms of the climate benefit and the benefit to the Exchequer.  As I understand it, Irish Rail has an ambitious plan to expand many suburban connections throughout the country.  They need to be pursued as quickly as possible.  We also have the need to roll out charging infrastructure as quickly as possible, particularly to decarbonise freight which, as I said, cannot be switched to public transport.<\/p><p>An additional level of investment in expanding rural rail should be examined but we should be prepared to not like the answer much if it comes back that electrification of the car fleet is cheaper.

On overall strategy and thinking, has there been examination of the general outlook as a result of the pandemic?  Anecdotally, there is a suggestion that people want to live in less densely populated areas.  According to the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, people seem to want to move from the more densely populated urban areas to more rural areas.

Can Mr. Cussen give the committee some measurement of where they are at in terms of their acceptance of it or otherwise?  Notwithstanding what we have to do on the transport side, there are real concerns - returning to Dr. O'Mahony's point on the quality of life issue for people, which is what we need to be about and should be the central focus - about what those homes of the future will look like.  <\/p> <p>  The witnesses should comment on the lack of willingness by local authorities to invest more heavily in addressing the dereliction that exists in rural villages and towns.  I see local authorities across the country which would much rather buy a site on the edge of a village or town and build 20 or 25 local authority houses - this is not coming from private investors, but local authorities - rather than looking through each village and realising that there are 35 or maybe 40 derelict buildings that could be brought back to use.

There have often been up to 200 members tuning in on webinars and staying for the duration of the two hours or two and a half hours.  There is certainly an appetite out there.  It is an appetite that one can find articulated more among the urban members and younger members, that is, some of the newer entrants into the ranks of local government members.  There are 949 councillors and in the last local election in 2019, there was a turnover of just over a third.  There is a section among the members which is still coming to grips with this and trying to work through its implications.  I am strongly of the view, however, that the continued rolling out of our training programme, as well as that of the climate action regional offices, which is under way at present, is crucial in reaching out to each and every member.  The last analysis by the Association of Irish Local Government, which represents councillors across the country, showed that in some local authority chambers, there is participation by up to 80% of members in at least one of our training sessions.  These are positive indicators of the level of engagement but we have a lot of progress to make, particularly in respect of understanding some of the practical issues the Senator raised.  That sense of a lack of willingness by local authorities to tackle dereliction goes to the very heart of the matter.  There is criticism of the slow pace of progress in the housing capital programme but when one looks more closely at some of the questions which the parent Department often asks of local authorities about why they are progressing in a particular way, it can be because the Department is raising the very point the Senator has raised.  Sometimes, the questions that come down from the centre to the local authorities, as a means to perhaps try a bit harder, are sometimes taken as criticism of the four-stage housing programme.  However, there are some local authorities which are very proactive in this space.  Members should consider Monaghan County Council and the Dublin Street regeneration in Monaghan town.  That is a local authority that really has started to look much more assertively at how it can itself be an agent of regeneration and renewal in its towns.  That is something about which our reviews programme will examine and disseminate a broader awareness across the sector.  The Senator also raised an important point about quality of life and what the villages and towns of the future could and should look like.  Some of the media pieces we sponsored are trying to highlight that.  We will do more work on that and I will be very happy to follow up with the committee on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":461,"content":"<p>We would appreciate that, I thank Mr. Cussen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#K00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Senator Dooley has pointed to some very interesting issues.

We need to consider how the cores of villages can provide all the services, potential employment opportunities and provide affordable housing and affordable rents.  These are the big issues that we need to deal with to get a handle on this because otherwise, we will feel as though we are taking things away from people.

I know Mr. Cussen only has an oversight role.  The planners in Kildare County Council were interested in this as well.  When we are planning cities and villages, we should not hand all of the power to developers.  Local authorities could plan how a town or city is going to expand and ensure every road goes somewhere.  We are trying to introduce permeability into estates, but no estate wants to have a breakthrough.  They do not want lanes and so on.  I appreciate that Mr. Cussen has an oversight facility and I know there are difficulties in terms of joined-up thinking.

Those figures come from the national travel survey from the CSO.<\/p> <p>  The points the Deputy has raised are important in respect of how residential areas are laid out.  As somebody who is familiar with the north Kildare area and the issues she has raised, I can also point to examples of sophisticated thinking about permeability, the provision of pedestrian access and creating shorter routes to walk children to school rather than a family member feeling he or she has to drive because it is the only way round.  I know of places where that was achieved, permitted, approved and developed.  As soon as such places opened up, things became very contentious.  They are sometimes politically contentious issues. <\/p> <p>  It is important that the political process shows leadership at local and national level on how things are connected.

We have discussed our current model.  We can sum it up by pointing out that we import most of our energy from abroad for our transport system and we concentrate most of our employment in big cities.  If we do things right in transforming our transport system, we will be able to upend that in two ways.  First, we can move a lot more manufacturing, even for batteries, to Ireland.  Science Foundation Ireland is sponsoring some exciting work via Advanced Materials and BioEngineering Research, AMBER.  Battery factories are opening up in other parts of Europe that previously lost employment.  We should be targeting that in Ireland.  Second, we will have an abundant amount of renewable electricity in Ireland.  From 2030 onwards, the SEAI suggests that we will have more than enough for what we need in Ireland.  It is not inconceivable that from the 2030s onwards we can produce zero-emission jet and shipping fuels in Ireland.  That can take place in areas around the Shannon which have had low employment in recent years.  This is what we should be looking for when we talk about transforming our economy and transport system, and doing both together.  This can be a powerful driver of employment across Ireland.  In our next economic recovery, we should always prioritise a model which disperses employment across Ireland as much as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#L00600","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.  I thank the witnesses for their brilliant contributions . Most of my questions are for Mr. Murphy.  He referred to Scania and its move away from fuels towards electric freight, and the fact that the EU has a new hydrogen strategy.  From an Irish perspective, should we consider hydrogen from an energy storage basis rather than for freight, rail or anything like that?  Would it be misguided to go down that road?<\/p> <p>  I refer to shared mobility services.  As someone who spent a lot of time in Brussels and Europe for five years, I realised that one can get from a train to a bus and park one's bike.  One of the issues in Ireland is that we do not have a joined-up approach.  In Ghent or Leuven one will see hundreds of bikes.  People are able to cycle to a point and then get a train to the city to go to work.  We always hear that cities like Dublin are very old.  There are lots of older cities in Europe that have such schemes.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Murphy could give us some examples of cities which have done shared mobility really well.  Even though we have a history of one-off developments, perhaps people can drive a car to a point and park and then get public transport or live close enough to work to be able to cycle.

We should ramp up it up.  Green hydrogen should be produced from excess renewables in Ireland.  The question is where we put hydrogen once it has been produced.  I am not an expert on electricity grids or heating.  There is a role there.<\/p> <p>  In terms of transport, it does not make sense in cars and vehicles.  It is too expensive - it is more costly than batteries.  It makes a lot of sense in shipping and aviation because those modes of transport do not have low-carbon alternatives.  One cannot put a battery in a plane because it would be too heavy.  Likewise, they are too heavy for ships.  We are an island, and rely on shipping and aviation to remain connected.  We are an island which can have abundant offshore wind.<\/p> <p>  Other European countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands, are moving ahead with a hydrogen strategy which is producing fuels for their shipping and aviation sectors.  I wonder why we are not doing that in Ireland.  As I understand it, the programme for Government has a commitment to a hydrogen strategy.  It is very important that this is set up.  It is important that we are incredibly optimistic about the employment potential that can bring to all parts of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's final point on shared mobility, it comes back to not seeing this as a case of public transport versus private cars.  There is a grey space in between where, as she said, there is shared mobility.  Twenty years ago, we did not have the option of using an app or a website to book time in private cars and book cars in advance.  It is now possible to do so.  The International Transport Forum said two years ago that Dublin can meet most of its mobility needs with 2% private car ownership.  We can be a lot more exciting.<\/p> <p>  I share the Senator's enthusiasm for how Brussels has evolved over the years.  There are ample examples of such development around Brussels.

We often call it the first, last or only mile because it links up directly with public transport.  With regard to the examples of Vienna, Copenhagen and Amsterdam, there are lots of more established cities as well.  The sustainable urban mobility plan process can be used to really empower that kind of positive change.  It comes back to an issue to which Deputy Cronin referred a moment ago.  Is it something that is not relevant or possible now?  Transformation is fundamentally about thinking about how we get to desirable outcomes.  It is not about predict and provide or saying there is a problem and let us react to it.  We need to think long term, have 2030 to 2040 as the way-post to that and then consider how we can really ramp up walking and cycling and how one links that with public transport, which was also mentioned by Mr. Murphy, because public transport can facilitate walking and cycling and <i>vice versa<\/i>.

Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan said earlier that if he stood up in the D&aacute;il and called for the reinstatement of the west Cork railway, he would be scoffed at.  I would applaud him because I think that is the future, particularly for long-term planning and freight.  We have so many trucks on our roads - dirty, big, smelly and dangerous vehicles that go up and down our roads all the time.  Back in the day, everything from coal to Guinness was transported on trains but we hardly use them for freight today.  We must think about this.  As one of the witnesses noted, we should look at financing freight and transport by railway and price and study it.  This is really important.  I do not think we should frame this as a question of whether railway is better than electric cars.  That is the wrong way to go because what we are looking at here is not just managing costs but the price we will pay if we do not get it right in terms of climate chaos.

Since public transport is free and frequent and people can use it conveniently, they use it both with their bicycles and when they are walking.  They get on and off it.  This is removing cars from the roads.  To come back to cost, whatever we would pay to introduce that would be worth it given the outcome.

It is the political process that needs to make those value-based decisions after we have appropriate analysis that can inform it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tadhg O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Does Senator Higgins wish to contribute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#M01000","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Yes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#M01100","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":484,"content":"<p>There is a total of two and a half minutes remaining so if she could squeeze her contribution into that time-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#M01200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I might ask for written answers because I would really appreciate that.  One question is on the review of the TEN-T programme - the idea of funding new projects and looking to engage with Europe on the western rail project and those kinds of large-scale projects - while another concerns land use by local authorities and how we can look more at funding.  Again, when we look at the recovery and resilience strategy, it concerns the idea of giving local authorities not just the power but the funding they need to directly develop.<\/p> <p>  My three questions are really about permeability.  When we talk about compact growth, does that need to be reimagined so it is not technical density of office buildings, empty or not, but a liveable space in our cities?  It concerns the idea of the 15-minute city, about which there were comments, and permeability in terms of better use of public rights of way.  Can public rights of way - the network of laneways in our towns and the network of connections in estates that were built before intensive car usage - be reimagined so that we are not just talking about cycling and walking on the sides of roads but around other networks in respect of walking and cycling?  Could the witnesses comment on better use of that public right of way infrastructure and the possible formalisation of that?  <\/p> <p>  Should there be better use of environmental impact assessment and social impact assessment at a much earlier stage in the planning process so that these issues get caught, we do not have a backlog later at the judicial review level and better quality decisions are made at an earlier point?  Those are the key points I wish to make.<\/p> <p>  Could the witnesses comment on the sustainable development goals, SDGs, which are now mandated in local development, specifically SDG 11 around sustainable cities and communities and how that might be one of the imperatives or mandates for change in how we approach liveable and walkable cities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#M01300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>The Senator indicated she would be happy to receive written responses from the witnesses so if our witnesses-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#M01400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":487,"content":"<p>If they have time to comment, it would be great but I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021022300002#M01500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, I cannot allow it.

If necessary, further and more detailed information on certain issues raised can be sent to the clerk to the committee for circulation to members.  The committee and I wish to assist the witnesses in every way possible to ensure this meeting is beneficial for members and witnesses and that we have a good and productive session to try to get information for the general public through the committee.<\/p> <p>  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members to confirm prior to making a contribution that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.

I am accompanied in this virtual setting by: Ms Martina Mannion, assistant secretary and head of inclusion in the Department; Mr. Eamonn Murtagh, director in the planning and building unit; and Ms Shirley Kearney, acting principal officer in the school transport section.<\/p> <p>  The breadth of my responsibilities and those of the officials concerned reflect the breadth of the issues highlighted by the committee in its invitation but also, perhaps more importantly, the importance that I and my Department give to the delivery of education to children with additional needs.  As Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, I am committed to making a difference for students who have additional needs as part of an inclusive education system.  The Department has well-established structures for engaging with the partners in education and I wish to ensure that students and their families are at the heart of the education system.<\/p> <p>  I was pleased to see that the committee in its invitation referenced the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and how our education provision for children with special and additional educational needs sits with the convention.  I have no doubt that committee members will be aware that on 3 December 2020, International Day of Persons with Disabilities, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, published a consultation draft of Ireland's first report to the UN under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  There are education-specific references in the draft report regarding Article 24, which sets out the principal education content, and also, under the heading of Covid-19, responses to the education response to Covid-19 for school students with additional needs.  Submissions on the draft report can be made to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth until 3 March 2021.  With just a week to go until that deadline, I encourage all those with an interest in this area to offer their views and perspectives.  The report will then be finalised and submitted to the United Nations committee for the convention.<\/p> <p>  In recent weeks, my Department has provide this committee with several submissions in response to its request for regular briefings.  I am, of course, always happy to facilitate this and my officials will continue with this briefing until we see a full return to school for all students.  Of course, the reopening of schools remains a priority for my Department.  The first steps in the phased return of schools took place on 11 February, with special schools reopening on a 50% basis.  This was followed yesterday by the return of children in special classes at both primary and post-primary levels, comprising approximately 10,300 pupils.  This is a significant and welcome development which saw more than one third of primary schools and a quarter of all post-primary schools open for children with special education needs in special classes.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Foley, and I are committed to the full and safe return and sustained reopening of all schools at the earliest opportunity and we are working tirelessly with stakeholders and public health officials to make this happen.  As the committee is aware, the Government is currently finalising the living with Covid plan which will place children's education at the core of our priorities.  It is essential that, as a society, we continue to make progress in curbing the spread of the disease in order to allow all children to return to school as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Foley, and I, along with all in the Government and our officials, know that the return to classrooms for students with additional needs and their families is much more than just a return to learning.  We know that some families will still have concerns about the return, and so too will school staff, but all of the decisions made by the Government since last March have been about achieving a balance between the overarching aim of protecting the health of our people and the need, among other things, to deliver services such as education in the most appropriate way for all students.  We may not always agree in politics, but I know Deputies and Senators across both Houses share the objective of wanting to see our country emerge from Covid-19 restrictions successfully and as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  The Government has prioritised the provision of education and, specifically, in-class provision.  This prioritisation was not just in terms of funding the return to school last autumn, but also in strengthening school support teams following the October mid-term break to ensure schools remained open during level 5 restrictions up to the Christmas break, as well as issuing revised guidance to schools prior to Christmas in terms of supporting remote teaching and learning.  The intensive engagement with the education partners since January, when it was not possible to return to school, demonstrates the desire of the Government to see all students return to their classrooms at the earliest opportunity.  The decision last week in respect of the leaving certificate and the fact that school-related construction has been able to continue, which will ensure crucial additional capacity will be available for the new school year, are practical demonstrations of the priority and commitment this Government gives to education.<\/p> <p>  While ensuring that the return to in-school learning for pupils with special educational needs, SEN, can happen as quickly as possible in recognition of the fact that such pupils may find it more difficult to engage in remote learning, my Department has also put in place a supplementary support scheme to provide for home-based, one-to-one support for such pupils.  In addition, I am committed to supporting an enhanced summer programme for children with SEN in summer 2021 that is as successful as the programme provided last year.  It provided a strong basis to support students on their return to in-school learning in September 2020 following the long summer break.  It also allowed schools and educationalists to target learning loss in their students in a way that made the transition back to school easier for these students and their families.<\/p><p>Since my appointment, we have successfully run that expanded summer provision programme, secured a record budget of &euro;2 billion for special education, provided the resources for the creation of 1,200 additional special class places this year, and worked to put special education first as part of our school reopening.<\/p><p> Challenges remain and I am determined to tackle them.  The committee has highlighted a range of issues on which it would like to focus today.  My officials and I are happy to hear, at first hand, members' perspectives on these issues and to provide updates or further information where we can.  The fully remote nature of today's session is a first for me, so I hope we can work together to make the best use of our time.  I apologise in advance for any technical limitations, although I hope there will not be any.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#B00200","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I wish to raise two issues with the Minister of State and hope to have an opportunity before the end of the meeting to discuss them with her.

Over the past 48 hours in particular but throughout recent months, we have received emails that share how difficult it is for parents at home to cope with children with special educational needs.  There has been a cycle of expectation whereby children were going back to school and then not going back to school, and that has been a difficulty.  I am delighted, therefore, that the Government concluded its negotiations in this regard yesterday.<\/p> <p>  For children, there have been both setbacks to their development and regression.  It is difficult to read about children self-harming or engaging in aggressive behaviour, let alone to experience it as a parent.  One of the emails to which I refer cites an example of photographs of the child at school having to be put away because it was just too traumatic for the child to look at them.  Next week will see the return to mainstream schools of children from junior infants to second class.  Ideally, we would have a timeline of when we can expect the same for those in third class to sixth class.  Could they be brought back in order that there could be special education provision for third class to sixth class in mainstream schools?<\/p> <p>  Finally, the 50% capacity has been difficult for parents to manage.

It has been extremely difficult for them and we can all share that concern.  I appreciate the Senator's acknowledgement that children in special classes, a total of 10,300, returned to school yesterday.  It was not before time but they have got back and that is a positive development.  The Senator mentioned that special schools are at 50% capacity.  We want to get them back to 100% at the earliest opportunity.  While I am not a member of the Cabinet and cannot make those decisions, I imagine that will happen in early March, although no decision on that has yet been made.  I hope that will be the case.  Further light may emerge following the Cabinet meeting later; that remains to be seen.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime, it is important that we try to look after children with special educational needs, SEN, who are in mainstream classes.  The Senator mentioned junior infants, senior infants, first class and second class.  Children with SEN within those class groups will return to in-person learning next week but there is a cohort of children who will fall outside that.  She referred in that context to third class, fourth class, fifth class and sixth class.  Again, I am not in a position to give any definitive information on when those classes will return but we hope it will be sooner rather than later, and there may be some clarity on that later from the Cabinet.  Suffice to say, the industrial relations team within the Department, under the remit of the Minister, has been in continuous engagement with our education partners, namely, parents, schools, boards of management and the unions.  One of the priorities of the Government since the outset of the pandemic has been that children with special needs will get back to school as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#C00400","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Last year, there was a programme of supports over the summer.

Regression has really adverse consequences for children with special needs and the summer provision is a way for them to reintegrate into a school environment.  Last year, in line with the criteria we used, pupils included those with a diagnosis of autism or of severe and profound learning difficulties, those who were in a special school or special class, those who were transitioning into a special class from early years settings to primary school, those in primary school mainstream classes who presented with Down's syndrome or who were severely hard of hearing or had a severe visual impairment, those who had a moderate general learning difficulty and those with severe emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Approximately 24,000 children were eligible for the scheme and it was its most successful year ever.  It is crucial that it go ahead this year, and it will do so.

As a parent of a child with special needs, I have the personal experience that has led many constituents in my county of Clare to reach out to me.

I appreciate that there have been many challenges in this sector, not least in the context of the reopening of schools.<\/p> <p>  My questions relate to the cohort of special educational needs students who still have not returned to school.  The issue was mentioned in regard to those who are in mainstream school but who are not in special classes.  I had been seeking a little more clarity on that but the Minister of State said she is not sure at this time and that the issue is involved in the review.<\/p><p>I want to ask specifically about meetings the Minister of State may have had with unions representing special needs assistants, SNAs, between June and December 2020.  For example, can she outline how many meetings took place between June and December 2020?

Is there provision there should the case numbers increase again?<\/p><p> My other question concerns supporting therapists in the school inclusion model and the delivery of wraparound supports mentioned by the Minister of State in the briefing document.  Specifically, it concerns speech and language therapists who have been reassigned to other duties, including contact tracing and testing.

Can she outline how the challenge arising from this reassignment will be dealt with?<\/p><p> Following on from that, regressional behaviour has already been mentioned.

I hope that I have taken a note of all of them but if I have not, she can come back to me later.  There were quite a few there.<\/p> <p>  First, on contingency planning for the future, since the beginning of the pandemic there has been and is consistent engagement with our education partners at all times, including teacher and SNA unions.  The Department's actions are always guided by public health advice and obviously from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC.  The Department of Education is a member of the Government task force on emergency planning.  It is also a member of the national emergency co-ordination group, which is the central Government platform for emergencies.  That puts it into context.<\/p> <p>  There are structures in place for remote learning.  However, it is important to acknowledge, as we all would, that for some students, nothing can replace in-person, in-school education.  That goes without saying.  The Deputy mentioned regression.  One area at which the Department is looking consistently is a post-Covid world and trying to deal with the regression that students have suffered.  Obviously, the summer provision will help students with special educational needs, SEN, in particular.  None of us can escape the fact that many students have suffered adversely in the pandemic.  It is an issue the Department is looking at consistently to see if there is something we can do about it.<\/p> <p>  On the school inclusion model, we are looking at a wraparound service and a tailored therapeutic support.  It will involve occupational and speech and language therapists, as well as behaviour and crisis practitioners.  It will revolutionise the process for children with special needs within the school environment.  We have secured funding of &euro;2 million for the service this year, and we hope to expand it to two community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas.  The pilot was based in CHO 7, covering south-west Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  There is funding in place to secure 80 speech and language and occupational therapists and 30 educational psychologists.  We are not going to step on the toes of the HSE in any way and we are working with the HSE at the moment.  This wraparound service is not in lieu of HSE therapy which falls under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  It is a complimentary service.  We are currently recruiting the therapists for this service.  Obviously, the process has been slowed down, to a certain degree, by Covid-19.  We must be careful that the Department and the HSE are not recruiting from the same pool of therapists.  We want to ensure that there are enough therapists for everybody.  I believe that answers most of the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#D00200","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I am in Leinster House.  Hopefully I have good coverage.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State.  I too welcome her today.  We are all particularly glad to see children with additional needs going back to school, whether it is for education, social needs, routine or inclusiveness.  It is important that we are on the right track.  That is something we need to build on.  I know we are all waiting for the living with Covid-19 plan. However, it is important to provide communication and give correct dates, and ensure that there is no confusion.  I know last time there was a bit of confusion over dates. <\/p> <p>  I welcome the dates that the Minister of State has announced today because it is important.  Originally, when the schools were ready to go back, we saw that within a few hours of the announcement of the reopening of applications, they were oversubscribed by a ratio of approximately 2:1.  As many parents and children were glad to get back into their normal routine, it is important to make sure that we have communications and that we open them as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  Some special education settings have only ten or 12 students.  It occurs to me that partial reopening was geared towards large schools and no autonomy was offered to smaller schools.  The Minister of State might come back to me on that.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to raise what I am sure is a huge issue for many of us.  Parents have contacted me about SNA allocations.  It has become a huge issue, even for children going to mainstream schools who attend an autistic spectrum disorder, ASD, unit.  At present, I am working on cases from County Carlow.  We need to make sure we have enough units.  I acknowledge this is something to which the Minister of State is committed but at present, even in my area of Carlow, there are not enough places for children who need to go to school, particularly in respect of one school.  We need to find a solution to this issue and I will provide the Minister of State details of the cases I am dealing with to see if she can help me with them.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to discuss with the Minister of State the issue of school transport, particularly in my own area.  Holy Angels Day Care Centre is a special education school in my area.  The HSE used to insure vehicles for this facility.  It would also provide help in that if something happened with the bus, for example, it would replace it.  However, this all changed in 2009.  Since then, the cost has been borne by the facility.  The cost of insurance surprised me, as it costs approximately &euro;5,000 per year to insure one of these buses.  No additional funding or supports are given.<\/p> <p>  Last year, Holy Angels had to launch a fundraising appeal to add to the Lotto funding to replace its bus.  This is unacceptable.  However, even these types of issues are not just about the actual vehicle.  Individual seating for each child, which must be replaced by the children using these buses when they grow and move on, costs more than &euro;100 per seat.  Again, that is another cost these schools simply cannot afford.  Funding for escorts for these types of transport is not covered by a section 39 grant.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of that.  During the Covid-19 pandemic in particular, schools had to employ additional escorts and funding was not provided.

That is great.  It is also great to be able to ask questions today.  The matter has been discussed a lot by the D&aacute;il and in the media, but I hope the committee can bring a unique focus on rights.  The Minister of State mentioned the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities at the outset.  Inclusive education is included in the convention but unfortunately, as we all know, that right has not been met, especially since Christmas.  We are all aware that the reality is that online learning is not suitable for most students who attend special schools.  In light of that, I welcome the return of classes and schools.<\/p> <p>  Families need absolute assurance on any delays or disruptions such as those that happened in January.  I will not go into transport because Deputy Murnane O'Connor touched on it sufficiently.  It probably goes for most areas in rural Ireland but parents and support organisations in my constituency of Cork South-West are concerned about the absence of services.  For example, in my constituency, people must travel for up to two hours to access basic essential services such as speech and language therapy.  The people who are availing of the service cannot stay in a closed space for a long period, so a two-hour journey becomes much longer.  They could be travelling for an essential service that takes 20 minutes, such as speech and language therapy.<\/p> <p>  In response to a question from Deputy Wynne on the plan to revolutionise services, the Minister of State referred to speech and language therapy as one of them, but she also referred to south-west Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  Is it just in those areas?  How was that decision made?  How were the areas chosen?  At the moment it is basically a geographical lottery for services such as speech and language therapy.  How was the decision made on where the revolutionary programme would be rolled out first and last?  Is geography considered in those decisions?  I ask the Minister of State to prioritise that question and if she has time, I have a similar question about wraparound supports.  What will the roll-out be for such services in rural areas?  The Minister of State referred to recruitment for speech and language therapy.

That was only one community health organisation area.  In the budget last year, I secured money to be able to extend that to the nine community health organisation areas.  The plan is to try to roll out the programme in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked how it is decided where the next expansion will be.  Cork is a particular area of concern for the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  It is a very high-density area and there is a lack of places.  We have to do a lot of joined-up thinking there.  Cork may well be a runner but, obviously, I cannot say that.

Parents are raising a number of issues with me, one of which is contingency planning.  We had the initial lockdown last year and when the children went back there was the summer programme.  Parents are of the view that there was no contingency planning at that time for further lockdowns.  We saw this coming to the fore in January when the services were supposed to open but did not open.  Contingency planning is required in all aspects of Covid but particularly for special educational needs.  What kind of contingency planning is being done now for this year so that if another lockdown were to occur, we could see that there is a plan in place?  We have enough experience now to know what to do and how to do it.<\/p> <p>  Many parents have also told me that there has been very little real engagement with them.  While organisations may speak on behalf of parents, we find that parents themselves are not involved in the system.  At one of the first meetings of this committee, someone stated - I cannot recall who it was - that the lack of engagement by the Department on children with special needs and their parents had created a lot of problems.  That was probably last July or August.  At that time, the parents asked that this would not happen again but it seems to be happening again.<\/p> <p>  I welcome that there will be 1,200 additional school places for next year.  That is fine.  I am, however, concerned about the reassignment of staff involved in special educational needs to contact tracing.

This question keeps arising.  Children have a high and a low where they are in school one day and not in school the next day.  We need to get this right.  It is not easy.  We all agree that we do not have a reference point for this.  However, many parents are very angry because they are not being listened to.  I ask the Department, the officials and the Minister of State to place more emphasis on that aspect to try to make sure parents feel they are part of the solution.<\/p> <p> How will children catch up?

There is weekly engagement with all of our education partners and updated guidance on remote learning.  Remote learning is not ideal but there is no choice when the child is not back in an in-person environment.  This is why we put forward the supplementary in-home provision which will provide five hours per week over a four-week period - 20 hours in total - to try to supplement that.  This can be provided at evenings and weekends, as I mentioned.<\/p> <p>  It is important to remember that the Department makes decisions with its education partners, boards of management, schools, and parents representative bodies, based on public health advice.  It is not just one person making a decision.  There are many constituent parts in the education sector and we must bring everybody on board and give everybody confidence to move forward.  Obviously, people have concerns and those concerns must be addressed.  I meet AsIAm, Down Syndrome Ireland, Inclusion Ireland, Family Carers Ireland and many parental representative bodies on an ongoing basis to make sure their voices are heard.  It was very important to me, as the very first dedicated Minister of State with responsibility for special education, that the voices of children with special needs would be heard in a way that they had not been before.  I believe they have been now.  Proof of that is the fact that the special schools and special classes are open.  Obviously there is more to do.<\/p> <p>  We spoke about regression earlier.

However difficult this has been for all of us, as public representatives, for the families of children with special needs it has been immeasurably more difficult and challenging for them.  That is what motivates all of us, even everybody on this committee, so that we can be a voice for them.<\/p> <p>  I referred earlier to timelines and deadlines.  What I can say about special schools, and obviously subject to the Cabinet making a decision on it later, it is likely that they will move to 100% in early March.  That seems to be the indication but I add the caveat that it is a decision that the Cabinet must make.<\/p> <p>  On section 37A, we wrote to 39 schools last June and 14 of them were withdrawn on the basis that there was consideration of their representations, submissions and there were on-site inspections.  Those 14 schools would not have been taken off the list unless there were very extenuating valid and exceptional reasons that they could not facilitate a special class.  The schools often genuinely do not have the space, particularly in high-density areas.  Ten schools remained and they have received a third notice that was issued on 14 December of last year.<\/p> <p>  Since the introduction of section 37, 21 additional special class cases have been confirmed and there is a potential for another 66 special class cases by September 2021.  For the first time I secured a specific commitment from the building and planning unit of my Department, when I was recently appointed, concerning every new school.  Sometimes I think that the significance of this has not got the attention that it should because it is a really big decision that the Department made, and the right decision.  One might ask why was the decision not made before but at least it has been made.  I secured that every school from now on will have special facilities and special education needs, SEN, rooms unless local circumstances dictate otherwise and that there is no need.  That is a really big commitment because we want to get out of a situation where we are perennially trying to scramble for special class places.  The forecasting model will help as well.  As the Deputy will know, we announced the opening of Scoil Colm in Crumlin that will help towards the development of special schools as opposed to special classes.

I refer to a ten-year-old in an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit in Cavan.  He has an occupational therapist report that recommends a laptop with the very specific software of Englishtype junior and Clicker 8.  However, the special educational needs organiser, SENO, has refused to recommend this to the Department, which I think directly contravenes Article 24.2(e) in that the supports this child needs are being denied.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the role of a SENO. Should it be to ensure that the educational needs of children are met or somehow safeguard the Department in terms of spending money?  I ask because this is not the only instance but one example.  Perhaps I can personally raise the issue with the Minister of State after this meeting, if possible, to further the process.<\/p> <p>  Children in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and, indeed, elsewhere are forced to travel out of their areas to attend schools that meet their needs whether that is a special school or an ASD unit.  Earlier Deputy Higgins mentioned the section 37A process.  Under that process schools are asked to indicate if they have space for a unit.  I know that many schools have space but they do not want to countenance having a unit in their school so are not indicating that they have space.  Can the process be strengthened to ensure that all schools seriously consider having a unit in their schools?  My colleague, Deputy Chris Andrews, has raised the issue of the lack of special class places and ASD unit spaces in the south Dublin area, which is very stark.  The Department spends hundreds of thousands of euro every day transporting students from their localities to schools that are perhaps half an hour or an hour's journey away.  That money would be better spent providing additional units.  As the Minister of State knows and we all know, we need additional units in schools but many schools have refused to countenance this.  Is the Minister of State working directly with, say, the Catholic patron bodies?  Many of our schools still operate under a Catholic ethos and many of our schools that have units are community or DEIS schools, but many of the Catholic schools are not.  Has there been an increase in the number of schools that will include a unit?<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that all new builds require an ASD unit.  Will that be sufficient to meet the need?  I would love all siblings to attend at the same school, where possible, but if there is not a unit or special class to meet the needs of those with additional needs then that may not be possible so new schools might be needed.  I am in contact with Enable Ireland that has said it has been inundated with the number of new assessments being requested.  That indicates, in terms of planning for the future, that there will be a huge need for more units at both primary and secondary schools and, indeed, for services post-secondary school as well so a lot of planning is needed.<\/p> <p>  The forecasting model has been mentioned.  What is the latest National Council for Special Education, NCSE, prevalence rate?  In 2016, it was 1.55%.  Is there an up to date figure available?  It is 3.3% in the North so there is quite a difference, which I wonder about.<\/p> <p>  Will Down's syndrome children be included in the summer provision?

There is a process outside of the section 37A.  The National Council for Special Education liaises and engages with schools on special classes and all of the time outside of the section 37A.  The section 37A process is a very valid mechanism and has its benefits but it should only really ever be used as a last resort.  However, I will use it if I have to.  There will be 1,200 places next year.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Tully mentioned a particular ASD unit.  Earlier I mentioned that there has been a considerable growth of 235% since 2011.  There will be 189 ASD special classes this year and that is out of 197 new special classes in total.  As I said, there will 1,200 special class places but 189 of those are for ASD pupils, 12 are early intervention, 113 are primary and 64 are post-primary.<\/p> <p>  The culture and ethos of a school is really important.  It has been hard to determine, I think historically, whether it is simply a lack of places or whether schools do not want to take a class.  That culture and ethos is changing slowly.  Obviously we try to encourage patron bodies and other organisations and schools to voluntarily open a special class where it is needed rather than trigger the section 37A mechanism, which we only want to do where we absolutely have to.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned the technology, I think, for a ten-year-old boy.  There is an assistive technology scheme.  Some &euro;100 million has gone into that.  There are ICT grants available for schools as well.  The SENO can liaise through the NCSE, which, in turn, engages with the Department if there are any particular issues.  I can certainly talk to Deputy Tully about that particular case off-line another time if she wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#G00400","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":532,"content":"<p>The main aim of the committee is to be unapologetic about being proactive and determined to create some equity and equality for people with disabilities.

Going back to what Deputy Canney spoke about, how do we catch up?  Is there a plan on how we will catch up?  How will we assist families whose children have regressed so badly?  How do we increase the supports of children with additional needs?<\/p> <p>  I certainly am always learning in this pandemic.  It has highlighted the areas where we all need to learn as a society and how people with disabilities have been affected disproportionately.  We have to learn and move on to a rights-based approach to our disability services.  That, I suppose, is the aim of this committee.  It is to implement the UNCRPD.  How does the Department learn from the pandemic?  Is it the case that special needs schools and classes need to be reclassified under law as essential services to make sure that they remain open?<\/p> <p>  Finally, the Department of Education funds the National Parents Council.  Is it possible that the Department would fund a dedicated parents council for the parents of children with special needs and additional needs, or has that been thought about?  We all are aware that children with additional needs and special needs have specific and different needs from mainstream children.  Such an advocacy group for these families would be welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#H00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McGreehan for her questions.  Of course, another advocacy group could be formed.  Parents form them all the time.  There are many different parental representative bodies and groups already.  I do not see any reason another cannot be set up by the parents at any time.  It would not be something for the Department to do as such but I understand what the Senator is talking about in terms of a point of contact for parents.  We liaise with parents all the time.  I suppose another role of the NCSE is to liaise at a grassroots level with parents of children who are struggling with their needs and, indeed, the other advocacy organisations I mentioned earlier, AsIAm and Down Syndrome Ireland, and other representative groups.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the 50% capacity returning to 100%, I will welcome the decision when it happens.  Hopefully, it will happen sooner rather than later.  As I said earlier, it will be subject to Cabinet approval but we are hoping that it will be in early March.  It will be an important development for students in these schools, because they have the greatest level of need, if we can at least get them back to a full routine and a full structure.<\/p> <p>  In terms of regression, as I mentioned earlier, the summer provision will help.  That is a practical support.  There are other supports that we give from a financial perspective but that is a practical support.  The summer provision is primarily about the children but it also allows some sort of respite for the families, particularly when they have had extended periods at home looking after their children.  I must emphasise the supplementary programme also because that is a radical new departure for the Department.  It never existed previously.  It is one-to-one home support which will supplement any other learning they are getting.  It is five hours per week for four weeks, which is 20 hours.  Any unused hours can be used by 30 April, including during the Easter holidays.  There is scope there for families.  It is open to all students in special schools and in special classes who are those with the greatest need.  That should be of assistance also.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, in terms of it being an essential service, it is something I considered.  The reality is providing education is an essential service.  The difficulty is that it is not only the Department that makes the decisions.  It is everybody who makes the decisions and until all concerned are assuaged, there is no reality in going back.  The Department and everybody else takes its advice from public health advice.  The Deputy is correct that it is an essential service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#H00300","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister of State a good afternoon.  I have three different areas I want to get to if possible.  First, for those students who are not in a special class but who are in a mainstream class and receive resource hours, could the Minister of State outline what supplementary supports such children, for example, a child with a visual impairment or a deaf child in a mainstream class, are in receipt of?<\/p> <p>  Second, I want to return to the issue we talked a little about today, namely, early intervention and the lag that we might experience due to Covid.  The Ombudsman for Children's Office, OCO, report, which I am sure the Department is aware of, which outlined issues around unmet needs included a concern around access to early intervention.  Due to Covid disruption, there would be a significant cohort of students who may age-out of early educational intervention.  This is partly because referring a child for an assessment of need with educational issues is hampered by a difficulty as regard the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004, in that some of the Act's provisions have not commenced.  I understand that overlaps a little with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte's area but it also relies on school principals to do much of the referring.  The report states some of those gaps are being met by the use of the National Educational Psychological Service.  My questions in that area are as follows.  What actions are the Department taking to address the issues with and access to that early educational intervention?  What are the plans as regards children who might age-out of it due to the disruption due to Covid?  In this committee, we talk a great deal about the optional protocol, but that report also outlines that there is a lack of a robust mechanism to complain or raise concerns around issues when it comes to referring for educational early intervention.  Could the Minister of State speak to that, perhaps around what we could put in place to allow parents or the schools to report on it?<\/p> <p>  Could we get a brief update on those children in secondary education who are facing into the junior certificate or leaving certificate, and the supports that might be in place for them?  I am particularly thinking of those students would have been struggling with online learning already and how that might interact with State examinations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#H00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":535,"content":"<p>On the State examinations, there are accommodations in place for the children to whom the Deputy referred.  They are called special arrangements or reasonable accommodations.  There are, therefore, supports in place for children with special needs who are doing the leaving certificate this year.  The junior certificate does not apply this year.  I am not sure if the Deputy mentioned the junior certificate but she may have mentioned the leaving certificate.<\/p> <p>  While remote learning and not attending school are not optimum for children, there are supports in place.  I mentioned these earlier and they include the supplementary programme, which will provide significant help.  This involves in-home tuition and takes place on a one-on-one basis in the evenings or at weekends.  Other than that, updated guidance has been given to schools on some of the issues that children will need assistance with.  There are key themes in the guidance documents around the role of schools, teachers and school leaders working with children with special educational needs on all of their needs.<\/p> <p>  It is important that schools reach out to parents and let them know what is available.  There has to be regular engagement with pupils and students.  There is a blend of guided and independent learning and tasks.  There is two-way feedback between the home and school and supports for students with special educational needs.  We are looking at focusing on special education teaching hours for students who are not going back yet.  I also mentioned the summer programme.<\/p> <p>  On early intervention, while this issue is not under my remit, I have raised with the Minister of State at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, the concerns the Deputy mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#J00100","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak and ask questions of the Minister of State.  Other members covered a number of the issues raised with us in emails by parents of children with additional needs.  They have expressed to us their immense frustration and told us of the terrible impact the prolonged school closures have had on their children and the regression they have seen.  They are seeking clarity and certainty about schools reopening and classes restarting.  They are also looking, as the Minister of State knows, for a commitment that there will not be any more on-off school closures.  I know the Minister of State has already responded on some of those issues but I would like to get greater clarity on dates and to ensure that once schools open fully - and we appreciate that special schools are already open - that children with additional needs will be able to stay in school and there will not be any more on-off approaches.<\/p> <p>  I ask specifically about a Labour Party proposal for a catch-up for children scheme.  We have proposed that the Government allocate &euro;100 million to structured and targeted interventions so that once schools reopen and we are, hopefully, moving out of Covid restrictions, we will need to first establish precisely what the impacts of prolonged school closures have been for children.  We must then enable structured interventions at all stages, for example, additional tuition for children whose literacy or learning has fallen back or who gave regressed in other ways.  We have seen a similar scheme in place in the UK.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, announced a welcome plan this week for the reopening of pubs and nightlife after Covid.  We need to see a similar plan to address the impacts on children of prolonged school closures and the losses of everything else, such as sport, extracurricular activities, over the course of the pandemic.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies in England has suggested that the costs have been immense for children.  We have not seen anything like the level of discourse we need on that in Ireland.  I have been attending some webinars organised by the Children's Rights Alliance, which have referred to that issue but we need to see more intervention from the Government to address it.<\/p> <p>  I make an appeal on behalf of one specific group of parents and children I met earlier today, namely, those involved in Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland.  There are children, young adults and older adults with this condition across Ireland who have many needs.  I promised the group that I would raise in particular the needs of children with spina bifida and hydrocephalus who are seeking to access education.  There has been a real difficulty for many children in this situation who not only require SNA support but also require additional physical support such as nursing support, which has typically been provided by the HSE.  Can the Minister of State confirm that a scheme is in place to meet both the physical needs of these children, in addition to their need for an SNA, and their need to access education?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#J00200","speaker":"1631"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I took a note of the Senator's comments.  On the on-off approach, as the Senator described it, I cannot give any guarantees about anything because the Department takes its advice from the public health authorities.  I cannot give confirmative information about dates either.  I said earlier that the Cabinet is meeting today and there is an indication that special schools will go back to 100% capacity in early March.  That is the extent of my knowledge because I am the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion and my I am limited to that area.  The other decisions are not made by me.<\/p> <p>  On a catch-up scheme, one of the reasons we put in place the supplementary programme, which will be hugely beneficial, is to provide for the catch-up that children with special needs, in particular, will badly need.  Practically every member of the committee has mentioned regression.  It is a huge issue for children without additional needs, never mind for those with additional needs, and we are conscious of that.  We will probably be in a position to expand that supplementary programme at a later stage.  If it is the case that schools have to close before the end of this term or in the next term - we hope that will not happen but cannot be sure - it may well be of assistance then.  We also have the summer provision under which every child receives a progress card.  These progress cards are given to the school and when the children go back to school their teachers then know what skills they have and do not have.  That should be of significant benefit to them.<\/p> <p>  I understand what the Senator is saying about spina bifida and hydrocephalus and she is right that the nurses' list is provided by the HSE.  We are developing a nursing programme through the school inclusion model at a cost of &euro;1.3 million.

The Minister of State will probably think I am following her at this stage because I have been plaguing her in recent times.  I have a number of points and questions I would like to raise rather than giving a speech.  I am seeking clarification on a number of issues from the Minister of State and her officials.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the negative impacts all children, particularly those in special education, have experienced during lockdown and Covid.  Has there been any analysis of that in the Department or has any report been drawn up to analyse the empirical data and the impact in order to quantify that regression?  If such a report exists, could the Minister of State elaborate on it and, if one does not exist, is it worth giving consideration to compiling one?<\/p> <p>  In the case of students who, for health reasons or due to underlying health conditions, choose not to return to special education in the coming weeks, will the Minister of State clarify specifically what supports they might receive?<\/p><p>The Chairman mentioned in his opening comments that we are reasonably well catered for at primary level with ASD units and special education provision, but when children hit second level many parents speak of the delivery of supports almost falling off a cliff.  I recognise the massive investment that has happened over the last decade, to which the Minister of State alluded in her opening remarks.  The numbers of teachers, SNAs and ASD classes have dramatically increased.  Obviously, there is a massive demand there and I am concerned that we are not catering for it.  Deputy Cairns and Senator McGreehan mentioned facilitating ASD units.  What is the Minister of State's policy in that regard?  I can only speak about Cork county and city.  There is one suburb in Cork with a population of 20,000, which has three secondary schools and not one ASD unit.  New schools are being asked to provide ASD units but existing schools have to pick up the slack and if they are not willing to do that voluntarily we have to consider a change in policy or direction.  That is just one example of one suburb in Cork with a population of 20,000 and no ASD unit in place.<\/p><p> My final question relates to school transport and buses.  We have a particular issue in the Cope Foundation in Cork, where buses provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann are facilitating three schools on one campus.  Those children go into their bubbles in class and remain in them, but as soon as they come back out to the buses, three cohorts of students go on the same bus.  Will the Minister of State, or one of her officials, clarify if that is still supposed to be happening?  I do not think it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#J00400","speaker":"1521","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments and questions.  We will consider putting together a report but at the moment we are dealing primarily with getting all our children with SEN back to school.  That is the priority right now but it may well merit some sort of report.  I do not believe in having reports just for the sake of them but if we felt it would achieve something and we could learn from it into the future, it is something we would consider.  I thank the Deputy for raising that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding supports for children who are not back in school at the moment, the supplementary programme I mentioned provides one-on-one teaching outside of school hours and at weekends.  The inspectorate also has a Covid-19 helpline, which is available for schools.  The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, has published a document on supporting the well-being of students with SEN returning to school, which is being revised and is a very comprehensive resource.  People can contact NEPS psychologists or the NEPS office directly because the well-being of children with special needs is crucial at the moment, more so than for other children.  The NCSE has a dedicated phone line and the NCSE adviser will support SEN access during this period.  Special educational needs organisers, SENOs, are also available to support parents where children are experiencing challenges in returning to school.  Those supports will be important.<\/p> <p>  I will call Ms Kearney in a minute to answer the Deputy's question on the Cope Foundation transport issue.  He and I have spoken many times about Cork.  The NCSE is aware of 20 children in Cork who are not in school and who require a special school place.  They are currently availing of the home tuition scheme.  Some 116 children in the Cork area have a recommendation for a special school placement but the majority of those are currently in a special class placement.  There is much engagement going on between the Department, the NCSE, school management, the Cope Foundation and the patron of Scoil Aislinn about expanding - or not, as the case may be - to provide further places in that area.  There were a number of meetings last autumn, as the Deputy knows, and a further meeting with the Cope Foundation is planned as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#K00200","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":541,"content":"<p>We have engaged with the Cope Foundation in Cork regarding specific concerns it had about transport.

The Minister of State has already outlined the steps the Department is taking in the area of regression and the supports being provided for children with special educational needs in order to get back to school.  One of the key messages is that the Department is acutely aware that being out of school has an impact on all children, but has a particular impact on children with special educational needs.  In returning children to school, getting those children in special schools and special classes back has been the priority.<\/p> <p>  As regards regression, when schools reopened in September, the Department worked very closely with stakeholders to provide guidance documents and supports to schools about how best to provide for children on their return to school and to support any learning loss that had been identified.  There are over 13,000 special education support teachers across our school system and children with special educational needs have learning plans that identify their particular learning needs.  Those teachers have worked closely with the class teachers and the special education teams in the schools to ensure that children who had particular challenges on return to school could be best supported by the allocation of those teachers to the children who most needed them.  That, supplemented by the programme the Minister of State has identified as the supplementary programme and our summer programme, is what we can do currently to support those children in the area of regression.  As the committee has clearly identified, this is an area of which we are acutely aware and we are working very closely with the stakeholders to get everyone back.  Once they are back, we are targeting learning loss in particular.  Members will also be aware that when children first returned in September, our strategies were very much about settling back in, targeting areas of particular loss and picking up on key skills to allow children to bed that in before they moved on to building on that learning.  That will be the focus again when children in special schools, special classes and mainstream schools return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021022300002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Martina Mannion"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I missed a short period in the middle of the meeting so these questions may have been dealt with.

In many cases, the priority for the family is that the child return to school, but there are situations where the family wants to access remote learning to keep the connection with the school with a long-term view to moving back there, not moving to home schooling but looking at remote linking with the school over the next few months.  There is a concern about children being marked absent in those circumstances.  The problem is it seems to be very much on or off.  One is either in or out of school, either home schooling or in full education.  Have measures around, in certain situations, providing the option of remote learning on a temporary basis for those who seek it been looked at?<\/p><p> The Minister of State may have addressed the other issue.  It is around an enhanced summer programme with additional supports.  How do we look to ensure that, over June and July, we make up for lost time and try to enhance that programme?

The key messages for those schools and children is that once the control measures are in place, it minimises the risk of transmission in those children.  The best thing for those children is to return to school to have the benefit of the school provision and to put in place the mitigation measures to minimise the risk of transmission.  We are aware that is a difficult decision for families dealing with the competing risks in a family situation.

I, for one, as a public representative have encountered some difficulties over the past number of months in relation to school transport and people opting for one aspect of school transport, such as the taxi, then seeing it does not work out for their circumstances, changing to the grant-based model and having huge difficulty in engaging with the Department on it.<\/p> <p>  I and many public representatives have been dealing with the Department on a long-running issue.  It is where a student with complex and special needs opts for a school thinking it the most appropriate for their needs at the beginning of their school journey.  The student finds out that school is not appropriate for him or her and switches to another school after much consultation, then find they are doing well in that school and it is the best environment for them.  There is some issue in the Department's regulations stating that, because it was not named at the time of their first application, they cannot be granted funding or support for transport to the second school, even though it has been universally deemed by psychologists and everybody else as the appropriate setting for the student.  There needs to be flexibility on that.  I cannot understand why it should be the terms from six or seven years ago that determine whether the family can avail of school transport.

I can follow up with the Minister of State on the specific cases because I do not want to go into them in a public forum.  There needs to be a lot more flexibility.

There are also dedicated induction activities during the first week of term.  There are organised meet-and-greet sessions for parents of first-year pupils to share information.

I am joined online by my colleagues, Professor Rose Anne Kenny, Professor J.B. Walsh, Dr. John Faul and Dr. Martin Healy.<br\/><br\/>There is now an extensive body of international research showing the protective role of vitamin D against Covid-19 and supporting the need for population supplementation at higher doses than those currently recommended.  For example, very large background studies pooling data from dozens of individual trials have described an approximately 10% reduction in risk of respiratory infection among people taking vitamin D supplements, and a more than 50% reduction in risk among those with low vitamin D levels to begin with, especially if taking supplements daily.  Therefore, there is very robust evidence that vitamin D protects against respiratory infections in general.  That is not in question.<br\/><br\/>Since May 2020, geographic studies have shown that Covid-19 incidence and mortality are higher in countries that are far away from the equator and in countries with confirmed low vitamin D status.  Furthermore, the population groups who are most likely to be vitamin D deficient are the same groups who have suffered the worst effects of Covid-19.  These include older adults, those from black, Asian and minority ethnic, BAME, communities and those who are obese or who have pre-existing diseases, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.  The unifying characteristic of these different groups is that they are all much more likely to be vitamin D deficient.  It is also clear that the pro-inflammatory blood profiles seen in vitamin D deficiency foretell the aggressive, overwhelming so-called cytokine storm that has claimed the lives of so many Covid-19 patients.<br\/><br\/>Long before we had any data showing a direct relationship between low vitamin D levels and Covid-19 incidence and severity, we already had strong evidence to support the likelihood of such a relationship.  From May 2020, data showing a direct relationship between low vitamin D status and increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe disease and death began to emerge.  These studies included work by Dr. Faul in Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, which clearly showed much higher ICU admission rates in patients with low vitamin D levels.<br\/><br\/>Are these relationships causal?  There are now several studies published showing lower rates of ICU admission, ventilation and death in those given vitamin D during their admission.  There is also an unpublished public health initiative in Andalucia, Spain, which has demonstrated a remarkable reduction in Covid-19 mortality since vitamin D supplementation of vulnerable older adults started there in mid-November.  Yet, despite the now dozens of positive studies including tens of thousands of participants, there has been no policy change in Ireland to advance what we believe to be an extremely low risk, readily implemented, cheap and potentially highly effective intervention to mitigate this public health crisis.  While some have called for randomised, placebo-controlled trials to prove definitively the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and reduced risk, these are now ethically untenable, they are often imprecise and they are wholly impractical in the current crisis given the time required to execute them properly.  They are also unnecessary.  One need only think of the spectacular success of the workplace smoking ban to realise that not every effective public health intervention requires a placebo-controlled RCT behind it.  As Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO stated early in the pandemic:<\/p> <blockquote> \tBe fast, have no regrets.  You must be the first mover.  The virus will always get you if you don&rsquo;t move quickly.  If you need to be right before you move, you will never win.  Perfection is the enemy of the good when it comes to emergency management.  Speed trumps perfection. <\/blockquote> <p>My colleagues, who the committee will hear from today, are not just the top clinicians in the country, they are people of international stature in their specialist fields.  Just as importantly, though, they are leaders who have had the integrity, the moral courage and the ethical compass to pursue this issue and to advocate for policy change in this area which will protect the Irish public.  They have weighed the pros and cons of changing current policy on vitamin D supplementation and they are in unanimous agreement that the benefits of a new policy will far outweigh the very minor costs.<br\/><br\/>We are very privileged to share with the committee today this information that has the potential to save many lives over the coming months, but we also must recognise that we are all standing in a moment.  As domain experts, we can provide the committee with the information and the context, but the political decisions and recommendations which flow from today&rsquo;s meeting must be the right ones, and the policy actions into which they translate must be delivered swiftly and decisively to alter the trajectory of this pandemic and to save lives.  The imperative to act quickly and courageously has never been more profound nor the rewards greater.  What we are asking of the committee today is leadership, the leadership required to enhance vitamin D policy as a central element of our living with Covid-19 strategy, and to steer us a better course out of this crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Daniel McCartney"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":568,"content":"<p>Thank you.

With regard to the condition known as Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, where the immune system attacks the nervous system, would a supplementation of the immune system lead to a greater chance of that condition occurring?  I happen to know of at least five people who have suffered from that condition in the past two years.

We have data from geographic studies, laboratory studies and observational clinical studies where we look at people who have SARS-CoV-2 infection and evaluate their clinical course.  Latterly, we also have information coming from intervention trials with vitamin D supplementation so there is much evidence there that suggests that at least in the context of immunological problems that could predispose somebody to worse infection, vitamin D confers an advantage.  Is there is a down side?  I will bring Professor Kenny in on this.  There are certainly situations where one needs to be careful with vitamin D but for most people, this is extremely safe.  I will bring Professor Kenny in to talk more about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Daniel McCartney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to respond.  In respect of his first question, there are no symptoms of deficiency as such, unless the vitamin D deficiency is very low, so the Deputy will not know whether or not he is deficient as I speak to him now and I certainly do not know by looking at him.  However, in the TILDA study, it was found that 60% of middle-aged adults and older persons in Ireland have insufficient vitamin D in winter.<\/p> <p>  There is no downside to taking vitamin D up to levels of 4,000 international units.  Our request and recommendation is for 800 to 1,000 international units so that is the next thing.  It has not been reported that Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is a side effect of taking vitamin D.  Whether or not Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is associated with severe deficiencies has not been reported to my knowledge.

The safety of vitamin D is well recognised.  She said that we recommend 800 to 1,000 international units.  That is what we give to our bone patients but it is recognised by the Institute of Medicine that safe levels can be up to 4,000 per day.  This is really to emphasise what Professor Kenny said.  In addition to the recent longitudinal study with which Professor Kenny was involved and which she quoted to the committee, we  also have the study involving 36,500 people in the Dublin metropolitan area published last August that showed that 70% of people living in the Dublin metropolitan area, Kildare and Wicklow are insufficient or deficient in vitamin D during the winter, which is a significant percentage, and 30% are insufficient or deficient all year round.  When it comes to people in the Indian community at whom we have looked, only 17% of them are sufficient and that is the same throughout.  They do not change in summer or winter.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  We know also that some people who develop Covid-19 get neurological problems.  We have seen this in young children who have problems walking.  Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome was mentioned.  There are neuropathies and, as we know, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is a post-viral-type neuropathy so there are main neuropathies.  This is not to say we have strong evidence that vitamin D affects that but we know the severity of disease with people who get Covid is more severe among those with very low levels of vitamin D.  It is important they have vitamin D normalised a long time before they get Covid.  One does not shut the stable door after the horse has bolted.  We are still waiting for the evidence that this may be of value but we know that people with the severest form of the disease have the lowest levels of vitamin D.

The effects of vitamin D are essential.  It is a vitamin, which is a vital amine.  It is required for someone to be alive.  The original studies, which we cannot do in humans, were done in animals at the turn of the century and involved withdrawing animals from sunlight and nutrient vitamin D.  One of the problems with human studies is that even if we tell people not to take vitamin D supplements, if they go out in the sunshine, they will get vitamin D.  Dr. McCartney said that what is done in animal studies would be unethical in human studies.  If one withdrew animals from sunshine and gave them a particular diet such as that the famous single-grain experiment, which involved giving animals either corn, oats or wheat, they would not survive.  The animals who did the best were those fed corn.  It was worked out by scientists at the time - Steenbock <i>et al<\/i>in Wisconsin, details of which I can share with the committee - that it involved ultraviolet radiation of the food itself.  Even irradiating the food with ultraviolet light let the animals survive and thrive.  If one did not do this, the animals would be infertile and would not thrive.<br\/><br\/>The effects of vitamin D are thought to be beneficial in humans.  In fact with regard to the entire cereals industry in the US involving companies like Kellogg, Quaker Oats bought the patent for irradiating cereals so it could say there was vitamin D supplementation of its cereals.  As the members are aware, Quaker Oats is a well-known cereal manufacturer in the US.  It was based on that scientific knowledge that vitamin D is good for us and people should take it on a daily basis.  <br\/><br\/>Regarding the question about Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, I agree with my colleagues that we do not have enough data on that.  What we can tell the Deputy is that in the case of animals, on whom we can do experiments, animals that are vitamin D-deficient or vitamin D knockout mice have enhanced autoimmune encephalitis, an immune response that leads to a form of neurologic disease, which is the classic model.  We would guess from the models of animals that it would be worse if one was vitamin D-deficient.  Obviously, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is uncommon and is very difficult to predict but that is what we would say.  <br\/><br\/>We would also say that multiple sclerosis is similar to vitamin D deficiency and has been associated with it.  I can send the members papers on this.  If someone is vitamin D deficient, he or she is much more likely to get multiple sclerosis, which is a very similar type of neurologic disease to Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome.  I know it is not quite the same syndrome but it is a very similar type of neurologic disease that is affected by the immune system.  I do not think fears of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome should push us off giving vitamin D supplementation to our patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Faul"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I wish to comment on one thing Professor Walsh said.  We have identified a number of groups that are particularly susceptible to vitamin D deficiency across the population.  This is really a whole-of-society problem and requires a whole population response even though we know that vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in our older adults, BAME communities and certain other communities.  Even in young people, it is extremely prevalent.  About 50% of our young people aged 18 to 39 have low vitamin D levels at this time of year.

We think that a recommendation and explicit guideline for adults in the Irish population to supplement 20 to 25 mcg per day, or 800 to 1,000 units per day, is absolutely essential.  We also feel that higher supplementation may be required under medical supervision in at-risk groups, such as people from the BAME communities, people who are overweight or obese, which comprises 60% of the adult population, and older people or people in nursing homes, in particular, who have notably lower vitamin D levels than the rest of the population.<\/p> <p>  The other question that may arise is whether we give vitamin D free, as is happening in the UK, to specific at-risk groups.  Do we supplement people in nursing homes, prisons or other long-term care institutions where their vitamin D levels are likely to be compromised?  There are a number of discrete populations which can be supplemented, such as, for example, people in nursing homes.  We know that half of the mortality observed in Ireland in regard to the Covid-19 pandemic has occurred in these settings.

We are saying between 800 international units and 1,000 international units daily so there is not much difference.  The other reason is that our emphasis is slightly different.  A level of 30 nmol per l is a blood level for deficiency and 50 nmol per l is what we normally take as a sufficient level.  At 30 nmol per l, there is still a level of secondary hypoparathyroid and the body is struggling to raise the level.  We have 7,000 people attending our bone health clinic annually.  We aim to get everyone up to 50 nmol per l or even slightly higher because as people get older, we like them to be at a level of between 60 nmol per l and 70 nmol per l because there is a slight reduction in falls as well.  The Department recommends 600 international units daily to bring a person up to a level of 30 nmol per l.  What we are saying is take between 800 international units and 1,000 international units.  Dr. McCartney spoke of how for 800 international units one might see 20 mcg and for 1,000 international units one will see 25 mcg.  The are written in two ways but we should think of units because they are very straightforward and that is how clinicians think.  Nutritionists often think in milligrams but both measurements are often printed on bottle labels.  Between 800 international units and 1,000 international units daily is simple.  As Professor Kenny says, there is good evidence showing that people go up to 4,000 international units per day.  We do not come near that.  Having said that, I take 2,000 international units a day and I do not apologise for that.  <\/p> <p>  Fortified milk is one source.  Taking a half litre of super milk provides 400 international units in a day.  Cereals are also fortified.  Other than fortified milk and cereals, there is very little food available that provides vitamin D.  Wild salmon is a source because they feed on plankton but farmed salmon do not get that opportunity and have only one-quarter of the amount of vitamin D that wild salmon have.  That was the other source of vitamin D mentioned.  The limited number of food sources of vitamin D is the reason people are vitamin D deficient.  It is a problem for young people working in factories and hospitals.  Paradoxically, the study found a higher level of deficiency in the 36,500 younger people than in many of the older people.  We can also consider the potential level of deficiency that has arisen in recent times, with people now indoors, whether for work reasons or in environments such as nursing homes.  The study we published recently covered a five-year period.  It showed total consistency every year, with levels increasing in summer, although there was still a level of insufficiency or deficiency of 30%, and deficiency of 70% in winter.  It is a real epidemic.  We have observed the highest incidence of deficiency and insufficiency in the black, Asian and minority ethnic, BAME, communities and seen how they have been so badly struck down with Covid.  These are the kinds of issues that worry us and that is why we are here today.  We are saying this is a simple solution.  It is just giving a bit of sunshine in winter when we do not have any.<\/p> <p>  Incidentally, vitamin D supplementation is totally safe.  Of the 36,500 people in our study, only 21 patients had a level over 250 nmol per l and all of them had normal calcium.  No one had any side effects.  As regards safety, it is very rare to get high levels unless people are taking, say, 5,000 international units or 7,000 international units daily.  It is very rare to come across that.

Second, they will comply with the recommendations because, being healthcare workers, they see the value of doing that.

I had some IT problems at the beginning of the meeting so I apologise in advance if any of the points I raise have been covered.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned that there is no clear advice and no recommendations from NPHET on vitamin D supplementation.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on this in recent months, most recently a couple of weeks ago.  The Minister told me that the existing guidance on vitamin D, which was updated in November, advises adults over 65 years to take 15 g per day for bone and muscle health.  I was disappointed that the Minister for Health did not inform me of any advice in relation to Covid and the role of vitamin D in supporting a strong immune system.  The reply went on to say that NPHET had considered this matter in January and agreed that efforts should be made to increase awareness of existing guidance and that adults spending increased time indoors, etc., are also recommended to take a vitamin D supplement.  The Minister is saying that a small amount of vitamin D supplementation is recommended for bone health and NPHET is repeating the advice and saying the recommendations for vitamin D are being incorporated into wider messaging on Covid.  I have not heard that wider messaging from NPHET - I do not know if others have - but it is really important that we get that messaging very clear.  What engagement, if any, has the group had with NPHET?  This issue needs to be pursued actively by the committee.  We have seen how NPHET, while it is doing great work, can be a bit behind the curve.  It was certainly behind the curve on face masks and ventilation and it seems that is also the case with regard to the role of vitamin D.  That is a matter the committee will take up and pursue with NPHET.<\/p> <p>  Is there a country that the group would hold up as the best model in relation to the importance it attaches to vitamin D in the context of Covid specifically?  Is there a difference between taking vitamin D fortified foods and taking supplements?

That is well worth pursuing to see if we can get better interaction there, particularly on messaging.  While direct provision of vitamin D among the population might happen in due course, these supplements are very cheap and readily available.  If the public get a clear message that they should be supplementing at X dose in the current context, they would follow up on that.<\/p> <p>  I will talk a little about Finland.<\/p><p>Certainly they have done very well on food fortification and supplementation.  We have seen the effect of this in terms of population with low vitamin D levels.  We know Finland has got many other things right in terms of public health policies and health protection.  I do not think it is any coincidence that Finland has shown not just the lowest mortality rates for Covid-19 throughout Europe but also some of the lowest incidence rates.  They are quite considerably lower than most other countries.  This is a country to follow if we can but we are some way off food fortification.  It is not something that will be done this month or this year as it is something that takes a long time to do, so supplementation is the answer.  This goes into the next question on whether fortification or supplementation is required.  At current levels of fortification, which Professor Walsh spoke about in answering the previous question, we cannot reach sufficient levels of vitamin D intake to reach optimum blood levels for immune health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Daniel McCartney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Shortall for her question.  The bottom line is that it would be very valuable in the context of today's discussions if NPHET did more than recommend raising awareness with respect to vitamin D and if there was a much more secure recommendation along the lines we have been discussing with respect to vitamin D.  Individuals in NPHET are aware of the value of vitamin D and the science behind it but we have heard nothing consistently solid from NPHET in terms of a public statement with respect to this.  To give committee members an idea of how difficult it is to get sufficient vitamin D from foods, there was one Norwegian study where participants ate salmon for five days a week for a considerable period and despite this were unable to reach the sufficient levels we are discussing this morning, which is 50 nanomols per litre and above.  It is very difficult to get it from food alone.  We do not get it in Ireland from sunshine at this time of the year or, indeed, during most of spring and some of autumn.  This message needs to get out there.  I say this because I have heard scientists speaking on radio saying there is no need to supplement because people get sufficient from food and sunshine in Ireland.  This is very incorrect and it needs to be said.<\/p> <p>  Some people ask whether we should be measuring vitamin D levels in everybody and then we would know.

She has been tremendous.  With regard to food fortification, I want to add to what I said earlier and to what Professor Kenny said.  I mentioned the only two foods that show some degree of fortification.  These are fortified milk and cereals.  With regard to ordinary milk, cows are no different from humans and do not get much sunshine either in winter.  It takes 40 L of ordinary milk to equal 1 L of super milk so there is a significant degree of fortification in it.  Half a litre of super milk has 400 units and there are also cereals that will bring up people's levels.  If children take fortified milk in the morning, they will get some supplementation but it takes a long time to build up.  It is not an insignificant amount, as people can imagine, but other than this there is not really much fortification.  Most farmed fish will not get much vitamin D either.  This is very important.<\/p> <p>  We have all been in communication individually with individual members of NPHET, almost all of whom we know quite well.  They know of our concerns.  What they say is we must wait for the randomised controlled studies of the intervention of vitamin D but the trouble with this is we would have to give a large population enough vitamin D for a year and have another controlled population not being given vitamin D.  It would be like giving one group parachutes and not giving parachutes to the other group.  This is what we are speaking about.  We are not speaking about something that will do harm.  It is something that has been proven to be effective.  The only reason we do not have sufficient levels is because of the fact we live here.  With regard to fortified food, the US and other places have reduced incidence of severe rickets.  I still get people coming in with severe bone disease and osteomalacia in the Irish culture.

I hope that as the science catches up with the information that is out there we will know more and more.  We are beginning to learn that more supplementation is better.  To back up what my colleagues said, because of the lockdown we have even less sun exposure.  None of our patients with respiratory illnesses are going on sunny holidays, which are good for them.

Could it be prescribed in the same way as folic acid is to pregnant women?  Could we generalise prescribing vitamin D?  What do the witnesses recommend to the Government with regard to vitamin D?  For instance, the VAT could be removed from vitamin D in particular.  A country such as Iceland gets very little daylight at certain times of the year.  How does it counteract deficiency?

Regarding the general recommendations, we would like a recommendation for 800 to 1,000 units for all adults in Ireland with the potential for higher doses in specifically vulnerable patients, that is, older people, people who are carrying extra weight or who are obese or overweight and people who have darker skin.  There should also be direct provision of vitamin D supplementation to healthcare workers, the institutionalised elderly and our communities if possible, with nursing homes a priority.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about countries that do things differently.  There is a geographic difference in vitamin D status.  We see it.  Generally, vitamin D status is worse the further away one gets from the equator.  There are exceptions, though.  For example, in Italy and Spain we see much poorer vitamin D status than one would expect because people avoid the sun.  They go in away from the sun during the daytime and their levels are lower for that reason.  We also see much higher levels in some Scandinavian countries because their governments have been proactive in putting in place robust food fortification programmes and very well-communicated messaging on vitamin D supplementation, so they are getting it right.  Finland's population has very good blood vitamin D levels and very low levels of infection and mortality from Covid-19.  Norway and Sweden are also doing well on food fortification.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the prison population.  I would absolutely put that population in among the vulnerable people who are much more likely to be vitamin D-deficient.  The UK has said it will provide free vitamin D supplementation to the prison population there over the winter months this year.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to Dr. Faul to respond to the Deputy's question about depression and seasonal affective disorder as they relate to vitamin D.

There are many more disadvantaged communities where families cannot afford supplements and perhaps would not have the level of disposable income to be conscious of these things.

The evidence from all the studies that were pooled together - 42 randomised trials involving almost 48,000 subjects - clearly showed a significant reduction in acute chest infections, be they viral or bacterial, with regular, daily maintenance supplementation but not with intermittent high-dose boluses.  This, we proposed, may be why there is confusion out there among academics about vitamin D.

It is interesting that in the past GPs did not really request vitamin D that much and there was no great demand for it but, in the current climate and with Covid and many of the issues surrounding vitamin D in the media, requests for vitamin D have gone through the roof.  Practically every patient who goes to a GP now will ask to have vitamin D added to his or her test, even though GPs would not normally do so because they would look at the patient and, as someone said earlier, one cannot tell by looking at the patient whether or not his or her vitamin D level is low.  If the patient walks in, sits down, stands up and walks out, his or her vitamin D might be okay, but the issue of the Covid connection with vitamin D and other issues have driven vitamin D requesting significantly higher, so we are now measuring far more vitamin D than we did in the past in GPs' samples.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martin Healy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614038400,"counter":616,"content":"<p>With regard to respiratory infections, I want to back up what Professor Rose Anne Kenny said.  It has been looked at in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, in detail in large studies which showed that it is protective, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis who respond better after an exacerbation if they are vitamin D deficient and the vitamin D is supplemented.  Cystic fibrosis is a particular problem because they have malabsorption of vitamin D.  It is routine for cystic fibrosis patients to take vitamins A, D, E and K on a continual basis because of malabsorption.  Without vitamin D supplementation they do worse after an exacerbation of cystic fibrosis.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, we would not be here to talk about asthma, COPD or cystic fibrosis.  It appears to be a specific thing for the infection with SARS-CoV-2 and vitamin D deficiency has a powerful impact.  That is what we are stressing.  I do not think we are here to say that if we give vitamin D supplementation it will cure all ills and fix everybody with every respiratory condition but it is crucial in the current pandemic because of the lack of resources, lack of ventilator beds and the crisis in the hospitals right now.  If we can reduce the severity of people's disease, and it must be remembered that pneumonia is the number one killer in Covid and it is taking up our ventilators and people are in hospital for long periods of time, and if vitamin D supplementation can help that I believe we should do it.

To follow up on what Professor Kenny said, there are other health benefits from vitamin D apart from this well-established reduction in and risk of respiratory infection.  We are seeing it in testimony from Professor Carlos Camargo in Harvard University.  Professor Camargo is perhaps the world authority in this area as it relates to respiratory infection and vitamin D.  In a large meta analysis, which Professor Kenny referred to, of 48,000 patients they discovered that when they parsed this and looked just at people who were getting vitamin D supplementation on a day-to-day basis rather than these large bolus doses, there was a 25% reduction in risk of acute respiratory infection.  On that basis alone and on the assumption that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not differ in any huge way from these other acute respiratory infections that would be included in that, we could argue that we should be supplementing vitamin D.  There are other benefits also.  Some studies suggest, for example, much lower cancer rates in people who are vitamin D replete over time.  I refer to osteoporosis and also heart failure, which is responsible for one in four accident and emergency admissions in this country.  In all the areas of cardiovascular health vitamin D seems to be beneficial.<\/p> <p>  I would like to touch on the affordability of vitamin D also because the last two members, Deputy Kenny and Senator Kyne, focused on that.  We see approximately half of the rate of supplementation - this is in young women, and I have done research in this area - in people in the lower socioeconomic groups.  Anything we can do, therefore, whether that is a VAT exemption for vitamin D or any other intervention we can do to make it more affordable would be very beneficial.  We have to embed it into the culture so that, as one of our colleagues mentioned, it becomes well known across the population like folic acid supplementation in pregnancy, for example, but any assistance in terms of affordability, particularly at this time, would be very useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Daniel McCartney"},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":618,"content":"<p>Has Senator Kyne concluded?

We know that it is safe.  It is like if one is thirsty one takes a drink of water or if one is hungry one eats a bit of bread.  We do not need it.  We know that it is extremely safe.  As we re-emphasised in our study of 36,500 people, we did not have an existential level.  From that point of view, therefore, the level we are recommending of 800 to 1,000 international units is totally safe and will bring people up into normal levels.  That is all it will do, and one can take it.  In winter time, 70% of people of all ages in the Dublin metropolitan area will be deficient in vitamin D, and there is not too much difference with the rest of the country, but all they need do is take it.  We only do levels in other people if they are required in particular cases but, ultimately, it is not an essential point.<\/p> <p>  I dealt with the issue of fortification of food already.  We know that Finland has done so and where it has done that it has made a difference in the severity of rickets and the severity of cases.  Even with fortification we have not got over the insufficiency levels that we have in Dublin.  That is okay.  As I said, GPs can prescribe vitamin D so that is something.  People have medical cards and that would help to get over the cost issue.  The GPs can add it to the prescriptions of people with GMS cards but people must be aware of the fact that GPs have that power.  For others, it is very cheap to buy not only in a chemist but even in a supermarket.

We need to focus on getting out that message.<\/p> <p>  It is essential that we introduce a fortification and supplementation policy urgently to combat the deficiency in the hopes of saving people from experiencing more severe Covid-19 symptoms.  Last November, we were aware that the UK introduced free vitamin D supplements to those who were at risk of Covid.  People could apply to the NHS for free daily supplementation.

One very interesting study came out this week from Professor Luke O'Neill at Trinity College Dublin.  He spoke about iron and the immune system and I want to ask about that.  We know iron is a mineral that we need for all things in our bodies but our immune system needs iron also.  The very compelling evidence shows that iron deficiency makes vaccines less effective.

We know that iron deficiency is very common in the Irish population, particularly in young women.  We know that around 50% of young Irish women do not have sufficient amounts of iron in their diet.  The research I have conducted with the Coombe Hospital suggests that about 3% to 4% of those women when they present for their first antenatal visit in early pregnancy have frank iron deficiency.  That is worrying because it has an impact on the outcome of those pregnancies.  There are other reasons, apart from the immunity aspect, that are important in terms of iron nutrition across the population.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of Professor O'Neill's study and perhaps Professor Kenny will comment on it too.  A number of nutrients are suspect across the Irish population so while we are talking about vitamin D today, Dr. Healy for example will tell us that magnesium is a very important nutrient in terms of biologically activating vitamin D in the body.  A proportion of people have low magnesium levels in the population, including people who over-consume alcohol, some older people and hospitalised patients.  That might be an issue as well.  Zinc and selenium are also important nutrients for immunity.<\/p> <p>  To focus in on vitamin D and iron, we see a high prevalence of deficiency in vitamin D right across the population, in men and women, young and old, among immigrant populations and populations of Irish ethnicity.  Vitamin D deficiency is ubiquitous but I take the Senator's point that iron deficiency is an issue that needs to be addressed among our female population in particular and also among our elderly.

Obviously with malabsorption syndromes iron deficiency would be a feature but in the absence of malabsorption syndromes, the ordinary run-of-the-mill person, apart from pre-menopausal or pregnant women, will not run into this problem.  In fact, if a person is iron deficient, it is very important to look into it and exclude things like bowel cancer and other cancers that cause a person to lose iron.  When we meet patients with iron deficiency, we focus on whether there is an underlying medical cause for it.  We ask whether they are passing blood in the urine or rectally.

This is really why we need explicit guidance for the population on vitamin D.  There is lots of justified discussion on the role of vitamin D in immunological health as it relates to SARS-CoV 2 and what we need from the Department of Health are explicit guidelines on the appropriate level of supplementation so that people do not over-supplement and put themselves at risk.  We heard today that a number of agencies including the European Food Safety Authority, the Institute of Medicine in the US and the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in the UK, are all unanimous that oral intake of vitamin D up to 100 mcg per day is safe.  We have very large population studies of people who have been supplemented at 50 to 100 mcg over extended periods of two to five years which have shown no instances of toxicity.  Professor Walsh's work is also relevant.  Of the 36,000 people whose blood levels were evaluated in the Dublin region over the past five years, only 21 had levels over 250 nanomillilitres per litre and none had high calcium levels in their blood, which is the tell-tale sign that one has too much.  Vitamin D toxicity is extremely rare.  One can encounter it in some clinical conditions like sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, lymphoma and other granulomatous diseases but those hazards, or potential hazards, with vitamin D will be telegraphed to such patients by their primary physician.

Most of the vitamin D humans get is physiologically contributed by sunlight exposure.  We therefore find ourselves at an interesting juncture in human evolution because we all decided to move indoors 30 or 40 years ago and vitamin D levels have really dropped because of that.  Proposing food, at least natural food, as an intervention here is not really going to be effective.

The good thing about it was that when they measured, the average level was 75.9 nmol\/l.  That is exactly the kind of level that would be optimal.  Therefore, we have a country which became proactive with the fortification of food and did not run into any toxicity levels either.  They are the kinds of things which are crucial.  It can be done and done safely.  Going back to what Dr. McCartney said, the sun is where a person will get 90% of his or her vitamin D.  Twenty minutes of exposure to a person's hands is all that is really required to keep a person optimised.  However, in this country we do not get any vitamin D from the sun from October to April.  It does not happen.  Even the little bit of sun that is out there is very low in the sky, and hence food fortification.  Vitamin D is stored if a person gets a lot of it but there is a limit to how long that storage lasts.  That is why we in Ireland have 70% insufficiency or deficiency levels in winter time, as mentioned earlier.

Firstly, what would be the consortium's explicit guidance to the population on the level of daily supplements they should be taking?<\/p> <p>  Secondly, given the data the consortium has provided showing 70% of people, especially in Dublin, are vitamin D deficient, how long would it take a person taking their daily dose to sufficiently build up his or her immunity?<\/p> <p>  My third question relates to a point Professor Kenny made earlier which I did not fully follow.  The other day I happened to meet somebody who was coming from having his prescription filled for a monthly capsule.  I was surprised by this as I had not come across monthly capsules.  Has the consortium a view on daily, monthly or weekly supplements?  Is there any difference?  Furthermore, is there any difference between tablets and capsules?<\/p> <p>  I will finish by making two points.  The point about wild versus farmed salmon is very interesting and certainly news to me.  There are not many people who have the opportunity to eat wild salmon these days.  It is thus important to get across the message that people are not getting vitamin D to any extent from farmed salmon, which is standard.<\/p> <p>  The other point is positive.  I was in a Boots branch recently stocking up on vitamin D for myself and my family and I had difficulty getting it at sufficiently strong doses.  The shop assistant told me it is flying off the shelves and they cannot keep it in stock.  This is a very good sign.  People will often just vote with their feet; they can be very sensible about being active in maintaining their own health.  Of course the point has been made by many people that much of the population does not hear those health messages because they are not coming out clearly enough.  Equally, much of the population is not in a position to afford it.  We must therefore be very clear that there must be Government intervention as well as strong public health advice.

It was better but not great.  Obviously people forget to take the tablets.  When we asked them afterwards, they were not quite clear that it was important.

Generally, we would say that if one impacts one's immune system severely - for example with a high dose of steroids - it takes about three months for one's lymphocytes to recover from that.  If one has, say, a death in the family, then three to six months later one gets shingles, it means one's immune system is hit in some way.  We think the same is for recovery.  When one tries to boost someone's immune system - say, the person comes off chronic steroids - one's immune system only really recovers three to six months later.  It is at least three months.

The witnesses are saying there is no real downside to taking vitamin D.  They are also asking for the opt-out model, particularly for nursing homes.  Their figures suggested that one in four of us are vitamin D deficient, particularly in winter.  One cannot really overdose on vitamin D.  It was suggested there would be clearer messaging coming from NPHET.  The committee has invited NPHET to come before us and we will raise with it the whole issue of vitamin D.  We will also have the Minister for Health.  Again, we can look at that.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about a dosage of 800 to 1,000 mcg a day.  The point was made that many people are actually being proactive about their own health and shelves being emptied of vitamin D.  While people are acting on this themselves, we need that public messaging and explicit guidelines.<\/p> <p>  Vitamin D is one of the building blocks of our immune system.  Several years ago, the view on cancer was that one's immune system was not really important.  We know now from evidence that it is vital and our immune system breaks down cancers every day.  We all have cancers in our systems which one's immune system breaks down.  It is important having one of those building blocks in relation to that.<\/p> <p>  Is there anything else the witnesses want this committee to look at?  We will make recommendations.  Vitamin D deficiency is common across all age groups in the Irish population.  Up to 47% of 18 to 39-year-olds are deficient.  Up to 60% of 50 to 59-year-olds are deficient and 64% of over 80s with 80% of those in nursing homes.  That is the evidence of the importance of nursing home residents getting vitamin D.  Up to 94% in dark skin or Irish BAME, Black, Asian and minority ethnic, communities are vitamin D deficient.  The groups with the highest prevalence of vitamin D deficiency are those with obesity, dark skin and the older population, the very groups with the highest risk to Covid-19.  The witnesses pointed out recent studies have also shown the significantly lower risk of ICU admission and deaths among Covid-19 patients who were supplemented with vitamin D.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses want to reiterate any of these points?  Is there anything they want to ask of the committee?  We all accept there needs to be clear messaging.

In that case, 70% of people among all age groups we are seeing in winter do not have sufficient vitamin D.  This is the case across the entire Dublin metropolitan area.  That is a simple figure.  Professor Kenny's work with the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, shows a similar result for the whole of Ireland.  That is what we are talking about.  We should talk about sufficiency.  At this point in time, only 30% of the Dublin population has sufficient vitamin D and it is no different for the rest of the country.

All of these people would, however, be aware of their conditions.  I repeat that even the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and others have said that the crucial thing is to measure is the excess calcium or vitamin D in one's blood.  We did not find this among the 36,500 cases.  That is important.  It must not be forgotten that what we are recommending is 800 units to 1,000 units.  As people have repeatedly said, internationally up to 4,000 units a day is considered safe.  We are not going near that.  We are way down at a fraction of that.  The Department of Health has recommended 600 units for deficiencies but we are saying that 800 units to 1,000 units would give people sufficient vitamin D, defined as a rate of 20 nmol\/l or more.

There is a condition called hypervitaminosis D.  People who have this condition have excessively high levels of vitamin D in their blood.  This is not caused by eating vitamin D supplements but the processes about which we were talking such as sarcoidosis, some lymphomas and so on.  The classic example is sarcoidosis.  This is an inflammatory condition where the body creates an enormous amount of vitamin D and it is not regulated by calcium in the blood.  Normally, calcium in the blood stops this.  It is not regulated, even locally, by vitamin D levels.  It is an automatic production of vitamin D by inflammatory tissue.  The treatment for it is steroids and anti-inflammatory therapy.  Just for clarity, the hypervitaminosis D about which one hears and which can be toxic is not caused by eating supplements but an underlying condition.  If the underlying condition is treated, it goes away.

It can take a while.  This is the case when using the commonly available vitamin D supplement, vitamin D3.  There are other supplements which act faster but they are only used in acute situations such as in the ICU when a person's level must be increased very quickly.  When one takes a supplement, one may be anxious to see if one's levels have gone up, but a repeat test cannot be carried out within three months.  One must wait three months before a repeat test can be carried out for the level of vitamin D in the blood.  This is because of the way vitamin D is handled in the body.  It takes a while to get to what is called a steady state.  It takes a minimum of three months and sometimes longer.  While it is inappropriate, we often see requests for vitamin D testing two weeks after supplementation has begun.

There is good research behind that which suggests that melatonin is suppressed by the exposure of the back of the eye, the retina, to that white light.  It is very well established that the physiological response to that white light is responsible for some of those better outcomes in persons with SAD.<\/p> <p>  I would like to follow up on a number of questions or issues raised in summation.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe raised the issue of opting in.  Under the UK scheme, even though, in theory, vitamin D supplementation is being provided free to 2.7 million of the UK's most vulnerable citizens, it is being provided on an opt-in basis.  That is an example we should not follow.  It must be operated on an opt-out basis if we want supplementation to be effective for vulnerable groups, such as people in nursing homes, our black and minority ethnicity, BAME, communities, our front-line healthcare professionals and people arriving to test centres.  We cannot rely on people having the knowledge to know that they need vitamin D and to take the appropriate action.  It needs to be provided on an opt-out basis.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I will raise is that we have borrowed a lot of the guidance from the UK in this area and a lot of the evidence our statutory agencies have reviewed in this regard has also been from the UK.  That evidence has focused on musculoskeletal health.  It is really important that the committee understand that the thresholds for blood vitamin D that must be achieved for some of these skeletal benefits are much lower than those to be achieved for immunological function, including for defence against Covid-19.<\/p><p>Were NPHET to review this evidence, we would need a specific review of the evidence on immunological health as it centres on Covid-19.  Reviewing the evidence of vitamin D in respect of musculoskeletal health does not bring us any further along.<\/p><p> The other thing to realise here in the context of that information is that the randomised control trials that many people have requested and that we would all like to see in this area may never happen.  Professor Kenny will say that the biggest of those studies is in C&oacute;rdoba in Spain where some 1,000 individuals have been targeted.  They are on 300 at the moment after the elapsing of nine months in that study and may never reach the 1,000 patients.  <\/p><p> We cannot wait for those randomised control trials. There is a model or paradigm called the Bradford Hill criteria for causality and the evidence that we have in relation to vitamin D and Covid-19 already meets those Bradford Hill criteria.  These are the same criteria that anti-smoking interventions have been based on, which as we said earlier have been very effective.  <\/p><p> Finally, on the issue of our population, we mentioned obesity.  Obesity affects approximately 60% of our adult population, who are either overweight or obese.  The dosage of vitamin D one requires if one is overweight, that is a body mass index, BMI, of between 25 and 30, is about one and a half times what a person of ideal weight would require to raise their blood levels by the equivalent amount.  When one gets into the obese category, that is a BMI above 30, then one may be looking at a dosage of about two to three times to achieve the equivalent level of increase in the blood.  Even though 20 to 25 mcg per day may be sufficient for most of the adult population to reach the required threshold for immunity against Covid-19, there is a significant proportion of the population who will require supplementation at higher doses than this, including people with darker skin, our nursing home residents, older adults, and some other vulnerable groups old as well. <\/p><p> That is all I really have to say but as a group we will be delighted to engage with NPHET if that opportunity arises and to furnish the committee with any further information that they require on any of the issues that we discussed today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021022300002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Daniel McCartney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614038400,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McCartney very much.
