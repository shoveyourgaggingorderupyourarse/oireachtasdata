Is that agreed?  Agreed.  As agreed last week, the secretariat is working to continue the practices of writing to bodies that are late laying statements and accounts before the Houses, and of writing to bodies to explain issues with procurement that have been flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  On correspondence, before we proceed I just want to note that a number of Deputies have emailed their suggestions for the work programme to the Clerk.  These items are not included in correspondence as we have our hands full at the moment with what is in front of us but they will of course be addressed as part of our consideration of our work programme, which I would hope to address at next week's meeting.  <\/p> <p>  Today we are considering the B items of correspondence, that is correspondence from Departments and public bodies.  As agreed at last week&rsquo;s meeting, given the volume of correspondence in this category alone, and that we must adjourn at 12.15 p.m., the committee has decided on courses of action in relation to much of the correspondence in advance of this meeting.  These items were received since the last meeting of the previous committee on 12 December 2019.  I have reviewed the correspondence with the clerk and a list of correspondence with proposed actions was circulated to members earlier this week.  Members were requested to respond if they did not agree with the proposed action or would like to suggest an alternative course of action.   Members will have noted we are dealing with a significant backlog of correspondence.  Some 91 items were included on the B list for today and we will have almost as much for our meeting next week, which is category C, correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.<\/p> <p>  Today&rsquo;s correspondence includes a number of items that were received after the last meeting of the previous committee.  They are primarily responses to requests from the committee arising from matters raised at meetings and I commend the previous committee on the work it has done in raising and pursuing matters that require accountability from Departments and public bodies.  I hope we will continue with that good work.  I propose that we will note and publish all of the correspondence on the list that has been circulated with the exception of No. 2683.  For this item, we will publish the covering letter only.  The Department of Education and Skills advises the information was provided on a strictly confidential basis, so we will not publish the attachments for this item but we will publish the covering letter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  We will briefly go through the items where further actions are proposed and if we do not get through the list we will take it up at next week's meeting.  The full list of correspondence considered by the committee will be published as part of the minutes of the committee&rsquo;s meetings, and any body that has written to the committee can see the action that the committee has taken in relation to their correspondence.  The first item of correspondence that has been flagged is No. 2645 B from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Justice and Equality, dated 13 December 2019 providing information requested by the committee on the operation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the 50% of road traffic cases which do not result in convictions, to include a breakdown of the reason for the cases being struck out.  Deputy Munster has indicated she wishes to address this item.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020092400002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1600938900,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Looking at the response we had got back in respect of offences that were before the court or the judge for holding a mobile phone while driving, the figures state that there were 3,886 offences that did not result in a conviction.

I am saying that on the basis that we are all familiar with all of the problems with the PULSE system and penalty points.  I do not think that it is as transparent as it ought to be.  If there are reasons for striking out cases, they should be outlined, but there are quite a substantial number, and we do not fully understand why an offence can be withdrawn at the request of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

We can make a real difference in relation to the change in how things happen, and often that is where recommendations come in.  There may well be a variety of categories that could generally capture the reasons cases are struck out, but if we are going to have confidence in a system, people have to feel that there is more than just an arbitrary reason for a case being struck out and that it is not because a person happens to know a particular individual or something like that.  It does merit some explanation as to why it can be the case that no explanation is given so as to help us understand it better.  Obviously, the separation of powers exists, and the striking out of cases is happening in the courts, but we at least need to understand why it is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020092400002#G00300","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1600938900,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Does any other Deputy wish to speak?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020092400002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1600938900,"counter":21,"content":"<p>As someone who has worked in the District Court on the criminal side, albeit not a huge amount, in fairness, each court may approach the issue in a different way.  If someone comes in to have a case withdrawn, the judge may look for reasons, so it can depend on the way in which it is approached.  It is something that could arise, for instance, where a judge raises a technical issue and the Garda will withdraw the offence on the basis of coming back again because it does not have sufficient evidence.  There are various reasons cases are withdrawn.<\/p> <p>  I am not clear that there is a huge volume of cases withdrawn, but I could be wrong on that.  It could be a simple case, for instance, that the garda involved is not available to give evidence, or another similar issue could arise.  It can be complex in some cases, and sometimes sufficient reason is not given.  For example, a judge could decide that because the case has been adjourned on a number of occasions, he will not allow further adjournment and the case is either dealt with or it is taken off the list.<\/p><p>It is complex at times.

One of the difficulties we have found is that there is a limit to the amount of work we can do within the courts system.  We do not make recommendations as to what judges should do and so on.  One idea that has been there for a number of years is that there be a unified system from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through to court cases and on into the prison system in order that there would better quality information available.  In the past the systems have not spoken to one another.  They have had all sorts of different numbering systems.  The Garda has one case number, a court case has another number, and then the service of convictions follows another numbering system.  There has been an idea that the justice system should develop a unified system to track any offence through.<\/p> <p>  As for recording the reasons, I would certainly be in favour of understanding more about why strikeouts happen.  As Deputies have said, the reason a case may be struck out can be an inefficiency on the Garda side in prosecuting it, the judge may be left with no option, or it may be a direction of the court.  To understand even those basic questions, we could start looking at the process more within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if that is where the problem is or if there is some kind of technicality in the law that is causing the strikeouts.  We have recommended and favoured that there be better quality information.  I think it could lead to better administration and better use of funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020092400002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1600938900,"counter":27,"content":"<p>What Mr. McCarthy said about the paucity of information coming from the Courts Service is frustrating in many different ways.  One of the other resource implications of what we are discussing is the man hours taken by the Garda for one, two or three days, potentially, and not being clear why a case has been struck out.  There are therefore resource implications in more than one direction, not just revenue-generating but also the use of resources.  I think it is worth investigating.

Late during the final session we brought forward legislation which most people would have supported, involving the introduction of measures so that people, instead of having to go prison for non-payment of a fine where somebody could not afford to pay it, community service and other measures could be considered.  As I recall everybody was supportive of this at the time.  There was an inadvertent outcome to that which I just cannot remember the detail of offhand, but I did raise it here and perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General may be able to recall.  We did not have time to get into it.  There was an anomaly in it where if somebody chose not to pay a fine through wilful neglect, the system could not follow up on that person without holding additional court hearings which were going to clog up the whole court system with thousands of such hearings.  We could usefully explore that issue too.<\/p> <p>  The only other thing I would say about the Department of Justice and Equality is that it has many seasoned public servants who work very hard and they are good at attending this committee but if we are not very specific about what we want to discuss at a given meeting, they will not discuss it.

Recommendation A.1 reads: \"The Committee recommends that the Department immediately improves the system to provide comprehensive information in respect of all housing provision and that this information is published on a monthly basis.\"  The response received from the Department focused on the monthly reporting issue rather than the fact that the committee found the data to be unsatisfactory.<\/p> <p>  Recommendation A.2 states that the spending on the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, \"does not represent value for money\".  The Department dismissed the argument made by the committee in that regard.  The Department did not answer or address many of the issues.  There is a list but I will not delay the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Recommendation A.5 by the committee seeks value for money \"where emergency accommodation is required\".  The Department did not mention or address the key value for money issue, which is the length of time that families remain in emergency accommodation.  I have quite a few issues with the response from the Department.  The Department has skirted around or dismissed some of our concerns and ignored specific recommendations.  All of these matters must be rectified when the officials are here again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020092400002#K00200","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1600938900,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Every Committee of Public Accounts operates differently but I will outline what we did in the past.  A comprehensive report is produced following a body of work.  In some cases, Departments say they have noted our recommendations but we all know that means they accept what we said, they say they have heard it and they will keep things under review but then they do nothing.  We all know the language.  It is fine when we reach the point where they accept a recommendation.<\/p> <p>  There is a suggestion that recommendation A.6 is unclear.  This is one that comes up repeatedly when there is an underspend by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on Traveller-specific accommodation.  Anybody who has been a member of a local authority will know very well that moneys provided for Traveller-specific accommodation can only be spent in a very defined way and not on traditional housing.  Every year there is an underspend, yet there is a group of people who find it almost impossible to find accommodation.  Indeed, a report was released in the last few days that shows people's attitudes to the Traveller community.  I am surprised that the Department does not understand our recommendation.  I think we need to go back on that if the moneys cannot be spent in a particular way.  Every year, it looks like the local authorities do not deliver Traveller-specific accommodation.  We should begin by discovering, for example, whether the Traveller community wants certain types of accommodation.<\/p><p>If the money is there for a halting site or a particular group housing scheme, for example, it can be spent on it.  Every year, however, there is an underspend and I am not happy that the Department is coming back and saying it is unclear.<\/p><p> There are a number of other recommendations in the report regarding, for example, the Analysys Mason report on the metropolitan area networks.  We spent much time on broadband and on the metropolitan area networks contract.  A report sat for a couple of years on the Minister's desk.  When he came into the Committee of Public Accounts, a reduction in the cost of broadband was announced the same day.  Therefore, that report was important in having an effect on the price of broadband.  It was to be reviewed within a period of two years.  That was in 2017, and we see here that the answer to the recommendation is \"No\".  There either is or is not going to be a review.  It was an important recommendation.<\/p><p> A number of things in this report would merit a detailed amount of discussion.  In fact, these kinds of reports would often have taken up most of the time for correspondence at a particular meeting.  When we have done a body of work, we look for action to be taken.  Having taken the trouble to do a report and write to the Department to seek its response to it, we want our work to have an effect or an outcome.  I do not believe we can just make a recommendation and move on because there are many elements in this report we could go back to the Department on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020092400002#K00300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1600938900,"counter":51,"content":"<p>One other speaker has indicated.

In some instances people told us that they had been paid in book vouchers.  They had very precarious situations.  It was not unique to one university and several universities had problems.  In looking at this, we need to look at not just holidays in line with legal requirements.  I believe we asked this college this question.

It is from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE, dated 10 January, providing a brief note requested by the committee in relation to non-compliant procurements.  Myself and the two Deputies have flagged this because it is of serious concern.  Deputy Carthy has suggested that the committee requests further information as to why the HSE is unable to furnish this information and why the timeline for correcting this is so extensive.  Four years is excessive to try to correct a serious matter like this.  From my point of view, the correspondence from the HSE is wholly unsatisfactory.  The HSE does not have a single procurement system.  It operates several legacy systems, it is unable to provide full visibility on how procurement is done and, over a four-year period, there were examples given by the Comptroller and Auditor General of up to 49% non-compliance with procurement.  This body will spend a  &euro;17.4 billion budget this year and the extra spending put in for Covid.  We are talking about huge sums of money and the really concerning thing is that the HSE says it cannot correct this until quarter 1 of 2024, which is four years from the date of this letter.  What it says is that the HSE has a plan to have 80% value of the HSE health spend covered by a single national finance and procurement system by 2024.  I suggest that it is totally unacceptable to the committee, and that it would be totally unacceptable to the general public, that public funds cannot be accounted for more efficiently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020092400002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1600938900,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I have a question for the Comptroller and Auditor General.

Every year, the samples we take consistently indicate that there is a significant amount of non-competitive, non-compliant procurement happening.  Effectively, because the HSE never built a single financial system or a single procurement system it has a decentralised procurement system.  Many parts of the HSE are undertaking procurement and a lot of it is not compliant with normal rules.  By comparison, in other organisations which have simpler structures than the HSE, there would be better visibility of procurement and expenditure because, effectively, they are operating on one accounting system or one financial management system.  We are better able to take a sample from that system on a random basis.  More recently, many of the Departments have developed a comprehensive database of all the procurement they undertake and they signal on it whether procurement was competitively or non-competitively procured and, in the latter case, the reason for non-competitive procurement.  As a result, they are better able to manage and account for the compliance of the procurement they are undertaking.  Undoubtedly, the HSE is one of the biggest and most complex organisations in the country but this is a problem that we have been signalling for nearly a decade at this stage.

The other reason it has happened is that the HSE was not funded to have a co-ordinated system.  It is only in recent years - I think in the past two or three years - a specific amount of money was allocated to IT systems that are essential to delivering this kind of outcome.

I think we should bring it in on this anyway.  Miesian Plaza is where the Department of Health is located, in the former Bank of Ireland building on Baggot Street.  The basic story is that the OPW did a deal with the landlord and, despite being advised by its internal personnel, used an old measurement mechanism to denote the square footage.  That was incorrect.  I think it ended up paying about &euro;300,000 extra per annum in rent or &euro;10 million over the course of the entire lease.  We had a hearing here from the chairman of the OPW at the time who said it was this extraordinarily complex process of measurement that has changed.  As an auctioneer, I can tell the committee it is not.  Any of us in this room could probably manage to measure it.  There was internal advice that highlighted the danger in mixing up the two measurement standards yet they still went ahead.  The follow-on was that they were then going to go to the landlord and say they made a mistake and ask to be let off, which I doubt will happen.  This update from 17 January last seems to indicate that they had a meeting and a discussion and were hoping to have another meeting.  My best guess is they are not making any progress.  At the committee meeting at the time, I asked if there was any disciplinary process afoot.  The answer was \"No\", it was not a disciplinary matter.  I asked why and they said, \"Oh, well, it is complex\" and so on.  This is the classic thing from us all, whether politicians or public servants at a senior level.  There are no consequences for our actions.  There are no outcomes.  When we do eventually spend &euro;300,000 on some external report, the inevitable answer as prescribed by the hand of the terms of reference will be cultural or systemic failure.  Nobody gets punished, there is no outcome, even when it costs the State &euro;10 million.  I have a problem with that.  It is endemic across many of our Departments.  I would like to have the OPW in to ask it precisely what is going on and at this late stage, having had more than a year to reflect on it, if there is any disciplinary action or if such mediocrity is accepted policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020092400002#T00500","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1600938900,"counter":125,"content":"<p>On a point of information, I have a memory of this coming up at the committee before when the Deputy was here and I think he indicated that it was an issue he dealt with.

It bought a site for &euro;1.35 million for a new Garda station in Sligo and it was announced by the Government that there would be no Garda station built now.  I want to know what that site is going to be used for and the reasons for this.  Perhaps the Garda or others are involved but we are going around and dishing out &euro;1.35 million for sites but are not proceeding to build something that we are now saying was not needed within a year.  My understanding was that this particular Garda station was in a public-private partnership bundle with new Garda stations in Clonmel and Macroom.  Not to be political about it but I highlighted in my run in to the election that this was my fear.  It was, of course, all going ahead up to the election and the ballot papers had not gone into storage when it was decided that the Garda station in Sligo would now be done up instead.

First, a distinction is made in the note between non-competitive and non-compliant.  The standard process is that there should be a competitive tendering process for any sizeable contract.  For smaller contracts, quotes might be sought from a number of reasonable suppliers - people who could credibly supply the service - but for a bigger tender one would expect a competition.  There is a very complex set of rules deriving from EU law governing how these competitions are to be run.  It is onerous but nonetheless it is expected.<\/p> <p>  Certain exceptions are allowed within the EU rules.  For instance, if it can be demonstrated that there is only a single supplier of a particular service or good then it is acceptable that one would look for a price from the supplier but obviously one would have to be satisfied that it represents good value and so on.  There are other cases.  We have talked about emergency procurements and so on.

They should have been laid within three months of the Comptroller and Auditor General signing them off, as per the requirements of Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 7\/2015.

There is an issue we might focus on.  Obviously Covid has had a huge impact on all aspects of Irish society but one that I do not think is in the spirit of solidarity that we are all embracing is that the RSA has a contract with a company that goes around to check all commercial vehicles.  The anecdotal reports coming in are that a budget or contract price was agreed for the year but because of Covid the level of work fell off because nobody was on the road or the company was not allowed to go around.  Now there is this mad race to \"do\" enough people, for want of a better expression, to justify the contract price.  There is an overzealous number of checkpoints.  I am not supporting rogue drivers but it appears that if these people stop drivers they will find something.  Someone could buy a truck one day and the next day the company would find something wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020092400002#Y01100","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1600938900,"counter":198,"content":"<p>There is no appeals process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020092400002#Y01200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1600938900,"counter":199,"content":"<p>The operation of this contract, given Covid, is not in the spirit of solidarity that we have in the country at present.
