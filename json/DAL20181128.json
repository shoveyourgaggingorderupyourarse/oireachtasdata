The Department of Education and Skills has a particular role.  The Children's Rights Alliance has recommended that the school completion programme would be extended to homeless children in non-DEIS schools.  What is happening in the private rental sector in particular is that children are not necessarily in DEIS schools.  If one is in a local authority estate and the local school is a DEIS school then one has access to all the services based on the demographic of the area.  However, if one is in the private rented sector in a non-DEIS area one does not have access to many of the services.

The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is responsible, through its network of special needs organisers, SENOs, for the development, delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with special educational needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements.  For the 2018-19 school year, 160 new special classes have been opened.  That means there are now 1,459 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011.  There are 1,196 autism spectrum disorder, ASD, special classes. <\/p>  <p>  The greater proportion of children with autism attend mainstream classes, but some require the environment of a special class or special school.  Enrolment in a special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he or she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day, even with appropriate supports.  The placement decision\u00a0is based on a recommendation made by a relevant professional.  While it is not always possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in a child&rsquo;s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, it is satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand nationally. <\/p>  <p>  From time to time, the NCSE identifies local areas where additional provision is required.\u00a0 In those circumstances,\u00a0SENOs work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved.\u00a0 The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, when commenced, will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs.  Section 8 of the Act, which will commence from Monday, 3 December 2018, will provide the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800004#B00900","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1543401300,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  Some of what he said is welcome.  I am aware of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which we debated in the House.  My fear is that we again have a situation where children who have an additional need or a disability are falling through the cracks or being left behind.  They are being treated differently from children starting in mainstream schools with no additional needs.  It is often at the last minute when the parents of children with an additional need finally find out they have secured a place in an ASD unit.  There are long waiting lists and we know that they are increasing.  A study in 2016 found that one in every 65 students has an ASD diagnosis and, therefore, we are very much playing catch-up in this area.<\/p>  <p> One of my main concerns is the attitude of schools when it comes to children with a diagnosis of autism.  Many schools are good, as are many teachers.  There are also, unfortunately, many schools that just do not want to know about ASD and will encourage parents to send their children elsewhere.  There is no written proof but we all know that it happens.  Kids are put on a reduced-hour day, perhaps two or three hours, with the hope that the parents will eventually just give up on that school and go somewhere else.

The statistics from 2011 reported 548 special classes.  That is now up to nearly 1,459.  We are making gains but, at the same time, affording choice to parents has to be at the heart of that provision.  I refer to whether they want their children to go to a special school or a special class or if they need ASD provision.  The increase in the number of ASD units throughout the country has proved to be a significant success.  That is attributable to the great work of the SENOs and the NCSE, as well as the work the Deputies did on the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which gave the Minister for Education and Skills the power to compel schools, where there is insufficient supply of ASD classes or special classes, to ensure that provision is made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800004#B01100","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1543401300,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I agree that where ASD units are operational they are, in the main, successful.  That, however, is the reason I raised this issue.  Greater access is needed for students.  There are many different examples of where that is needed and I am not the only person who could cite examples; every Deputy could probably do so.  Some students cannot start school.  They have to go to a special school and were supposed to start in September 2018 but they cannot start until September 2019 because of the lack of access.  Those students cannot get access to any more pre-school provision because they have used up their two years.  That puts a child with an additional need at a disadvantage.  Parents are also being told that their children can have a place in an ASD unit but the unit is miles from their home.  They will have to spend an hour and a half on a bus before getting to school.  That again puts a child at a disadvantage.  In the main, that is not the case for children attending school who do not have an additional need and that is what we need to focus on and tackle.<\/p><p> We seem to be okay with treating children who have an additional need differently and saying to them that they have to wait, that they might not be able to start until October because we do not have a place for them and they have to put up with being on the bus for an hour and a half.

My message to officials from day one has been to look with favour on any building request from a school for an extension which will accommodate an ASD unit and free up another classroom.  That is the message coming across from Deputy Funchion as well.  It is important to ensure equality of access for parents who want the best standards for their son or daughter.  If they want their son or daughter to be in a mainstream school they cannot be disadvantaged.  If they do not have a special class or ASD unit they are disadvantaged.

In terms of access initiatives, under the national access plan approximately 16,000 students are expected to be assisted in 2018 through the student assistance fund at a cost of &euro;9 million, whereas 12,000 students are expected to be assisted through the fund for students with disabilities at a cost of &euro;10 million.  Approximately 400 students will benefit from the 1916 bursary fund under the programme for access to higher education, PATH, at a cost of &euro;2 million.<\/p>  <p>  The national student accommodation strategy, NSAS, was published in July 2017 to enable an enhanced supply of student accommodation as part of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  It set a target of 7,000 additional purpose-built student accommodation bed spaces to be delivered by the end of 2019 and construction of at least 21,000 bed spaces by 2024.  This initial target is expected to be exceeded, with over 10,000 bed spaces either completed or on site as of October 2018.  The Government is also developing measures to provide better rent predictability in purpose-built student accommodation in the forthcoming residential tenancies (amendment) Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the block grant paid to higher education institutions includes a specific weighting to promote access to higher education.  This involves an additional premium for all eligible access students.  This takes account of the cost of additional measures to support the enrolment and retention of students from under-represented backgrounds.  For those from targeted socioeconomic groups and mature students, this is applied for the first two years of course duration to reflect the higher support needs during this period.  For people with disabilities, a further weighting is applied for the entire length of the course to reflect the higher support resources required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800006#D00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1543402500,"counter":38,"content":"<p>It sounds good until we look at the facts.

At Dublin City University, student accommodation providers tried to increase rents by 27%.  The Irish Universities Association has pointed out that we are now have one of the lowest levels of investment per student anywhere in Europe and, as already stated, that investment has dropped 50% since 2008.

When I spoke with the principal and staff at the college, I was informed that there is an 80% progression rate from leaving certificate to third level, including for trades and apprenticeships.  It is an ambitious school and it is able to compete on the points scale as well, with students getting into the top courses and universities.  There are examples of the fact that people will get to third level if the support system is provided.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy's second point related to the barriers of cost and I can pick that up in my county, with parents making the decision as to whether it is affordable to send a son or daughter to college in Dublin.  These are the questions on the minds of parents.  We need to continue an all-of-Government inclusive support.  I acknowledge Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling their motions, which we support, seeking to ensure that we can have more supports in high-pressure zones and where the rental costs are high.

We give &euro;700 million in research and development tax credits, mostly to big multinationals in this country.  That money should be redirected to our universities and third-level education.

A number of important provisions in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, which was passed by this Oireachtas, facilitate higher education institutes in borrowing money from the Housing Finance Agency for the purpose of financing student accommodation provision on campus.  That is happening not just in the capital but throughout the country.  Universities and other third-level institutions are considering at ways to make more accommodation available for students.

When I walk down the corridor and meet Deputies and Senators from north County Dublin, it is the only matter they raise.<\/p>  <p>  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years up to 2022, including six new primary and two new post-primary schools to be established in north Dublin.  The four year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for additional school accommodation in other areas in the future.  Based on the current analysis, this need can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools.  Approximately 40% of extra school places are delivered by extending existing schools.  The requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review and will have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p> <p> I know that the issue for the Deputy is the here and now, what happens today and what happens in September in the context of enrolments.

They were outside the D&aacute;il earlier this term and while it is an incredibly useful education for them in the need to protest to get things delivered, they should not have had to do that.  What answer does the Minister have for them today?  I appreciate that the Minister has outlined the method that the Department is using but I am telling the Minister that it is not working.  The situation is critical for St. Joseph's and for St. Maloga's school in Balbriggan, which I have discussed with the Minister previously.  In that school, 58% of students are in 20 year old, crumbling prefabs in the current appalling weather.  St. Maloga's is only at the project brief stage even though it has been in the pipeline for so long.  The same situation prevails at St. Michael's House in Skerries.

It is critical at this stage and the point I am making is that the system is broken.  To take St. Joseph's as an example, the issues in that school have been long flagged.  It is not the case that the school community has only taken to the streets in the last month: they saw this coming.  The Department was warned and the concerns were flagged.  The issue has been raised in this House and with the local authority.  In this House, we are told that the local authority is dealing with the matter and is looking for a site but when local councillors raise it with the local authority they are told that no-one in the Department has contacted the authority about finding a site.

The answer to this question is a little different.  It is a variation of the previous response so I will put it on the record.<\/p>  <p>  The safety of the school students and staff has been my priority from when the initial invasive work was done in Ardgillan on 19 October.  It continues to be my overriding priority.  I shall give a summary of the outcome.  Nineteen schools were cleared to open in full without any precautionary works, 19 were enabled to open in full following external precautionary measures in the form of fencing around all or part of the building and protective decking, and three were enabled to open, initially at ground floor level only, following the implementation of both internal and external precautionary measures.  The latter relates to two schools in Tyrrelstown and Gaelscoil Eiscir Riada in Lucan.  One building, namely phase 1 of Ardgillan Community College, closed completely.<\/p>  <p>  Internal precautionary works are currently ongoing on the upper floors of the three schools that were opened initially at ground floor levels only.  I assure the Deputy that the Department's priority is to have these works completed to enable all three schools to open fully and the students who were temporarily decanted off site to return in the coming weeks.  I acknowledge the impact this has had on parents, staff and boards of management in recent weeks.  I thank them not only for their patience and understanding but also for their proactivity.  They have been proactive in ensuring whatever measures needed to be put in place would be put in place.  I was in Tyrrelstown last week.  I watched how the work was organised.  It included garda&iacute;, stewards and staff decanting students on a day-to-day basis in the rain.  It was exceptional work in a short period.<\/p>  <p>  Let me focus on what happens next.  We will move as quickly as possible to the next phase, which is to initiate more detailed structural investigations in all 42 schools, even the 19 that did not have any structural issues.  Following this, the objective is to implement the permanent remediation works required. <\/p>  <p>  It is also my intention to initiate an independent review of the Department's design-and-build programme, to include aspects such as procurement, quality control, workmanship and oversight, examining aspects both before and after the implementation of the amended building control regulations in 2014.  This will be an independent review conducted by a person or entity outside the Department.  This review will be informed by the more detailed structural investigations to be carried out in the next phase of the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800008#F00800","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1543403700,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  The final part is important and the key.  There is no doubt that the schools have done great work in opening and dealing with the issues that have arisen.  The fact, however, is that these are brand-new schools and they should not have to deal with these issues.  That also has to be recognised by the Department.  As the Minister said, more than half of the 42 schools built by the company concerned, Western Building Systems, have been confirmed as needing remediation work or at least precautionary protective measures pending further investigation.  I am thankful the Educate Together school in Letterkenny was one of the schools that showed no problems when reviewed and was able to resume activity.  It is clear, however, that the Department's design-and-build programme was compromised in some way or another, and that is the crux of the problem.  It might have been through not thoroughly investigating companies in the procurement process prior to signing the contract or through not inspecting buildings properly.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen from previous commentary that questions remain as to who is ultimately responsible.  That is what we need to get to.  Ultimately, the Department is responsible because it is the procurement body and it is paying.  The people are not getting what they are paying for and this has to be addressed and examined by the Department.  Changes have to be put in place to make sure contractors comply with what is required of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800008#F00900","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1543403700,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy's point on responsibility to the taxpayer.

None of that was considered when the cheapest possible tender was selected.  These schools are ultimately going to prove very expensive as a result of the short-term view taken in opting for the cheapest tender when the priority should have been for the Minister to ensure that the schools were built to the proper standard.  Schools offer value for money when they operate for 20 years without requiring additional work to counteract substandard work carried out under the contract.

That is not to say that rapid build cannot be done properly.  Rapid build construction is being employed to deal with the housing crisis and for several student accommodation projects, as was raised earlier.  It works if it is done properly.

There was obviously carelessness and unacceptable standards in the construction of these schools.<\/p>  <p>  A Supplementary Estimate was submitted for the Department of Education and Skills.

It will not cost money to acquire, and, therefore, it is an option.   There is also a constraint on the Putland Road site because there is a protected structure on it.  It is a smaller site of some 4.3 acres.  We have to ask whether the school can do what it wants to do on a 4.3 acre site.  The Deputy believes it can.  We need local engagement now more than ever.  I have spoken to the Minister for Health, about this matter, and Deputy Brady has raised this on a number of occasions with me.  A meeting of minds is required at tomorrow's meeting.  The formal decision by the board of the ETB to reject the BIFE site as a preferred location was only taken earlier this week.  We have to take that on board.  From a taxpayer's point of view, it must be acknowledged that the officials were considering a site that would not cost anything.  The Putland Road site would cost money, and it is also zoned.  I do not know what the valuation of the site is or what it might cost.  Patronage was awarded in 2013 and the school was up and running in 2016.

Any family with small children would state that is now 27 sleeps until Santa arrives.  For many families, the reality of making Christmas happen is one of stress and expense.  Regrettably, providing even essentials is beyond the means of many.  That unfortunate reality means that many families resort to borrowing money, some from friends, family members, credit unions or banks.  However, that will not be an option for others and many of them will resort to borrowing from moneylenders and loan sharks who, in many cases, are unlicensed and charge punitive and frankly disgusting interest rates.  They are a scourge on our society.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a licensed moneylending industry in this State whose practices are equally repulsive.  A UK-based moneylender, Amigo Loans, has been given a licence by the Central Bank to operate in Ireland.  The Central Bank has sanctioned it to offer loans with interest rates of up to 49.9% to people who have been excluded from accessing mainstream finance.  Amigo Loans considers that to be mid-cost credit.  I would call it daylight robbery.  Amigo Loans is not the only entity involved in this game.  A fortnight ago, the Centre for Co-operative Studies at UCC published a report on behalf of the Social Finance Foundation.  That report indicates that moneylenders in this State are licensed to charge interest rates of up to 187% which, when collection charges are added, rises to an  average percentage rate, APR, of 287%.  The report also states that a total of 21 of the 28 EU member states apply caps to high-cost credit.  That includes Ireland but, ironically, the only cap we apply is in respect of credit unions.  We do not apply any cap on moneylenders.  That is the reason moneylenders go door to door delivering leaflets at this time of year, preying on the vulnerabilities of people coming up to Christmas and charging these kinds of extortionate rates.  Moneylenders are getting rich on the back of hard-pressed people who are simply trying to provide for their families.  They can do this because the system in place allows them to do it.  This is State-sponsored robbery.  There is an urgent need to introduce a cap on the interest rates these types of outfits can charge.  There is also a need for more wide-ranging reform of the regulation of moneylenders and the policing of illegal loan sharks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800013#L01900","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1543406700,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

It is now less than a month from Christmas, which is a wonderful time for families and children.  It is a time for excitement, friends and celebration, but it can also be a very stressful time, particularly when it comes to getting the house ready, buying presents and finding the money to do all of that.  I absolutely acknowledge that.  To assist  people and families, particularly those on low incomes, with the cost of Christmas, we fully restored the Christmas bonus in the budget.  In the next week or so, the Christmas bonus will be paid at 100%.  That is the first time it has been paid at 100% in seven or eight years.  It is a shame that Sinn F&eacute;in is not supporting the budget.  It should support it.  One of the reasons it should do so is that the budget makes provision for the 100% Christmas bonus, as does the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In March, there will be further increases in the working family payment for low income families who are working, increases in the qualified child payment for families on welfare and increases in the minimum wage will come into effect in January.  As a Government, we are working very hard to increase pay in a sustainable way, reduce taxes in a sustainable way, increase welfare in a sustainable way and also reduce the cost of living where that is under our control.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of regulation of financial services, as the Deputy is aware, we have a system of independent financial regulation.  The Central Bank is the regulator.  It is not the Government that is issuing licences to banks, moneylenders or the financial services industry.  As far as I am aware, the Deputy is not proposing that the Government should take over the Central Bank and become the regulator.  We have independent financial services in Ireland for very good reasons.  That is the norm across Europe and it should remain the case.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding moneylenders or people offering high-interest loans, I echo the Deputy's sentiments.  It is important that people are very careful in taking out such loans and that, if they do, they are confident they can pay them back.  Anyone who takes out a loan is responsible for repaying it.  Anyone who takes out a loan has a responsibility to make sure they are able to pay it back.<\/p>  <p>  There are alternatives.  For example, the credit unions, working with the Department of Social Protection, offer low-cost loans.  We call it the It Makes Sense loan.  It is not available in every credit union but is available in many of them.  I launched it when I was Minister for Social Protection.  It has been very successful and allows people to take out a short-term loan at a low interest rate to meet costs such as Christmas.  That can then be deducted from their credit union account or welfare payment.<\/p>  <p> People can also seek urgent needs payments from their community welfare officers.  I would ask people to consider alternatives and, if they do take out a loan, to always consider the fact that they may not be able to pay it back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800013#L02200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1543406700,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.

As the Christmas lights go up, it should be a time of excitement, happiness and joy, particularly for children and families.  In truth, it will be a tale of two very different Christmases, depending on where one is positioned in Irish society and, in particular, whether one has a roof over one's head.  Imagine the situation faced by Elaine and her three children, for example, who visited my office in the past few weeks and who are about to be evicted, having exhausted all appeals through the Residential Tenancies Board and with nowhere to go.  Another family with three children, who would rather not have their names mentioned, face eviction before Christmas, while the father of yet another family, who visited me this week and who are living in emergency accommodation in Wicklow, must take his children to three different schools in south Dublin, sit in the car all day waiting for them to finish school and then drive back to Wicklow every day.  Other families are experiencing their second or even third Christmas in emergency accommodation.  It is shameful that people are being evicted in the midst of this situation and that children must go through a second or third Christmas like this.  For others, however, it will be a bumper Christmas.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to draw the Taoiseach's attention to this property supplement from a newspaper which states: \"Strong residential investment deals.  Over 1,600 apartments sold.  Total value &euro;610 million.\"  The vast majority of these, of which approximately four are in my area, are National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, properties that were sold or are being sold to real estate investment trusts, REITs, or wealth asset management companies.  The average price is approximately &euro;380,000.  The most recent one to be sold in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, comprising 214 apartments, cost &euro;95 million at an average price of &euro;440,000 per unit.  The article helpfully goes on to state how that block will generate approximately &euro;5 million in rental revenue for the new purchasers.  These properties are being sold by NAMA.  They are publicly owned and they are being sold to Kennedy Wilson, REITs and other wealth asset management companies which in some cases, to add insult to injury, will then lease them back to local authorities at extortionate prices, boasting about the amount of profit they are making.  At the same time, families will suffer a miserable Christmas in emergency accommodation or face eviction.<\/p>  <p>  We face a large demonstration on Saturday which will call for an end to evictions into homelessness.  Should the Government not take emergency measures to ensure no kids or families are evicted as Christmas approaches?  Will it do anything to stop NAMA selling thousands of properties that could be used to provide secure, affordable, permanent homes for these families who are suffering trauma and hardship as Christmas approaches?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800014#M00600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1543407300,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that Christmas is, and can be, a stressful time for some families, particularly those who are living in emergency accommodation or looking for a new place to rent.  I can imagine the concerns parents must have in the run-up to Christmas when they are asked by kids how Santa will visit if the hotel room does not have a chimney, or where the Christmas tree will be put.  I totally understand the Deputy's concerns and, whether he believes it or not, I share those concerns.  I also think about those families in the run-up to Christmas.<\/p>  <p>  Figures on emergency accommodation will be released this week.  I do not have them yet but I understand from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that they will show a fall in the number of children and families in emergency accommodation and a reduction in the number of families presenting as homeless in Dublin.  On the other hand, they will show an increase in the number of individuals who are in emergency accommodation.  Those figures will be available later today or tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  The only solution to this is supply.  While it is not the entire solution, it is at the centre of it.  We are seeing a real increase in the supply of new homes across Ireland.  By the end of this year, we expect 18,000 new houses and apartments to have been built, and that is not just a number.  Behind it are 18,000 people, that is, 18,000 families getting keys to a new house or apartment for the first time this year.  Some 18,000 families, therefore, will be in a new home this Christmas which they were not in last year.  We need to recognise the progress made in that regard.  There will also be an increase of approximately 8,000 in the social housing stock this year, more than half of which are new builds by local authorities and affordable housing bodies, while the rest will be acquired through Part V leasing and acquisition.  That is a significant change and increase compared with the situation last year.<\/p>  <p>  On evictions, the Deputy will have seen the figures.  I do not have the exact number but I think there were approximately 300 evictions this year.  Evictions happen for all sorts of reasons and not all of them are evictions into homelessness, although some are.  They can also be related to anti-social behaviour and people who live on a street where neighbours have caused havoc will understand why evictions are sometimes sadly necessary.  The courts tend to take a sympathetic view of families if an eviction order is sought.  We will bring forward legislation, which is being championed by the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, to strengthen the power of the courts to refuse eviction orders and eviction requests where they relate to a family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800014#M00700","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1543407300,"counter":167,"content":"<p>For those who face eviction before Christmas, those words are not much consolation.

In other European states, it is against the law to evict people at this time of year, but that will happen here.<\/p>  <p>  It infuriates me when the Taoiseach talks about supply.  He did not answer the central question about the article, which is evidence of the supply.  Public property is being flogged off to vulture funds.  Some 700 of the properties are in my area, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and they would resolve the emergency homelessness crisis there.  In Lucan and Santry there are hundreds of apartments that we had in our hands and that could be used to house those families who are in the hubs and who face eviction but we are flogging the apartments off.  In the docklands, rents of &euro;3,300 a month will then be charged and will go to Kennedy Wilson, an American vulture fund.  Why does the Taoiseach allow that to happen?

The post office network is not looking for handouts, it is seeking to provide services that are meaningful to the population that will support rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  This matter has reached crisis point.  Some 50 post offices are due to close in January.  A total of 159 will have closed by the end of the first quarter of 2019 and 390 are earmarked for closure under the An Post programme.  This is not what was expected from the Government.  Such is the level of demoralisation, there is difficulty in attracting postmasters to run post offices which are deemed viable by An Post.<\/p>  <p>  How can the Taoiseach speak of a republic of opportunity without offering rural Ireland a hope as his policies reduce services within rural communities?  Rural transport is not being developed, rural medical services are being allowed to diminish, rural financial services delivered by An Post are being diminished and rural broadband is not being rolled out.  This Government is not addressing the sustainability of rural communities.  Even at this late stage, will the Taoiseach call a halt to the closure of our post offices and the destruction of our post office network?  It is not good enough for him to shrug his shoulders and state that this is a commercial decision when the social consequences for rural communities are so far-reaching.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800015#N00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1543407900,"counter":174,"content":"<p>The Government wants a post office network which is extensive enough that everyone will be within reasonable distance of a post office, which we believe can be achieved.  However, the network must also be viable.  The best way to ensure that it is extensive and remains so is that it is viable.  The Government does not close post offices.  In most cases, postmasters are retiring and are accepting retirement packages they have negotiated with An Post, which is a semi-State company.  In many cases, there is no one willing to take on that contract because it is not viable.  Where it is viable, the post office will remain open and if there is a shop or other service nearby which is willing to take it over, that will be considered.  It is not just being left up to An Post, there is an independent review mechanism to assess viability.<\/p>  <p>  Times are changing and we need to reflect on that and be realistic.  Footfall at our post offices is decreasing.  There are many fewer unemployed people in rural Ireland and, as a consequence, there are fewer people collecting jobseeker's payments from their post offices.  More people who retire do not collect their pensions from post offices.  Instead, they have it paid directly into their bank accounts because that is how they had been paid over previous decades.  As we extend broadband to more rural areas, more people will access public services, bank and pay for their television licences and motor tax online.  The solutions which are often put forward can be contradictory because the more we extend services such as broadband to rural areas, the fewer people use the post offices.  We need to be realistic about these things.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to investing in rural Ireland, it is important that we invest in the technologies of the future which is why we are so committed to ensuring that the national broadband plan happens, why we launched the rural fund on Friday last, which will be major investment in improving the public realm in rural Ireland and modernising our towns and villages so that they are more attractive for people to live in, and investing in enterprise and tourism so that we can bring new jobs to rural Ireland.  The best way we can give rural Ireland a good future is by investing in new technologies, jobs and services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800015#N00700","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1543407900,"counter":175,"content":"<p>The viability of rural post office is under threat but that is because of Government inaction.

It is a sham.  I am not aware of any post office that has successfully gone through the independent appeals process.  The only criteria used relate to whether there is a population of greater than 500 in an area or whether a post office is greater than 15 km from the next nearest post office.  Communities are spending vast amounts of time developing business cases to support their view that their post offices should be retained and in respect of the level of services that they would like to be delivered in them.  All those appeals are being rejected purely on the grounds of population size and distance to the nearest post office.  Times are changing and An Post needs to change.  The programme for Government, to which I keep returning, included a process through which post offices would change; they would be given extra services, would act as Government hubs and be utilised.  A national asset of 1,100 post offices should not be thrown away purely on the basis of an economic model which does not allow for the sustainability of the communities that will lose their post offices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800015#N00800","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1543407900,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I do not think that the Deputy is quite correct about the appeals mechanism.

We are joined for this commemoration by Mrs. Doris Calleary and Mrs. M&aacute;ire Ardagh and their families: John, Conall, Dara and S&iacute;ofra Calleary, daughters-in-law Trish and Siobhan, son-in-law John, grandchildren Laura, David and Anna, and family friends; and the Ardagh family are represented by Charlie and Rory Ardagh, Se&aacute;n's sons, and their wives Catherine and Deirdre, and by Darragh McShea, Senator Catherine Ardagh's husband, and four grandchildren, Charlotte, Jane, Jamie and Arabella.<\/p>  <p>  The two Se&aacute;ns were people it was an absolute privilege to have known.  They were honourable men, with very different personalities, but they served their people here with dignity and integrity.  Neither of them undervalued the honour bestowed on them by their constituents.  Se&aacute;n Calleary did his utmost for the people of his beloved Mayo and the country, and Se&aacute;n Ardagh did his utmost for the people of Dublin South-Central and Ireland.  Knowing both Se&aacute;ns as well as I did, I know how thrilled they would be that the next Calleary and Ardagh generation have taken the political baton and continue to work for the people they represent.  To our colleagues, Catherine and Dara, and the wider Ardagh and Calleary families, I renew my condolences to them on their sad loss.  Their fathers served their party, their Parliament and their country with absolute distinction and their families should be very proud of that work.

B'fhear stuama, cneasta, gn&iacute;omhach agus cr&iacute;ochn&uacute;il &eacute;.  Duine ciallmhar agus polaiteoir den scoth a bh&iacute; ann.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; d&iacute;lis d&aacute; mhuintir f&eacute;in agus d'oibrigh s&eacute; go dian d&iacute;cheallach Domhnach is d&aacute;lach ar son mhuintir a dh&uacute;iche f&eacute;in.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; ar a shuaimhneas agus an-&eacute;ifeachtach ar fad sa Pharlaimint, go h&aacute;irithe i gcoist&iacute; na D&aacute;la, an Coiste Chuntais Phoibl&iacute; agus an Coiste um Dhl&iacute; agus Cheart agus Comhionannas ach go h&aacute;irithe.<\/p>  <p>  Se&aacute;n Ardagh was one of the great gentlemen of Irish politics and one of the kindest people one could meet.  I always appreciated his advice on a personal level but also his continual good nature.  He was immensely hard working, courteous and committed.  He was also enormously popular with his colleagues and, of course, his constituents.  There is no greater testament to that popularity than the fact that every time he contested an election, he won that election.  His first campaign was in 1985 when he ran in the local elections.  He had to share the ticket on that occasion, I believe, with no less a celebrity than Sonny Knowles, who has recently passed away, and we extend our sympathies to his family also.  Se&aacute;n was the highest polling of the four Fianna F&aacute;il candidates.  He ran for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on three occasions.  Not only did he win every time but he also increased his vote on each occasion.  At his final outing in 2007, he topped the poll and was elected on the first count.<\/p>  <p>  He was a very fine and brilliant parliamentarian in the true sense of that word.  In particular, he was a very eminent and solid chairperson of a number of Oireachtas committees.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, he established himself very firmly during the DIRT hearings in the late 1990s.  Obviously, he was greatly aided by his own accountancy background in this endeavour but, for a first-time Deputy, he quickly acquired an authoritative reputation that would have been more in keeping with a more experienced Member of the House.  After his re-election in 2002 and 2007, he chaired the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, which was always one of the busiest.  Again, he carried out the role with aplomb.  He really was a natural.  He was rarely adversarial.  He never prejudged an issue and was always open in his approach and dealings, and he maintained that during his tenure as Chair of the Committee on the Constitution during the 30th D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt his equable temperament on political matters gave him great strength when he faced serious health issues during his time in the House.  He was first diagnosed with cancer in his first term.  He got past it that time only for it to re-occur again in 2010, when he was absent from the D&aacute;il because of illness for a period of the year.  He tackled his diagnosis with great dignity and inner strength and, of course, with the help of his close family.  Before Se&aacute;n passed away in 2016, he happily and proudly saw his daughter Catherine elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and he took great pride in her achievement.  He was a keen supporter of her campaigns and may well have enjoyed them more than his own.  Indeed, when we knock on doors, as I do with Catherine from time to time in that constituency, Se&aacute;n's name is always mentioned with the highest of esteem and affection.<\/p>  <p>  One constant in his life throughout was M&aacute;ire and for 45 years they were together.  They were best friends, hand in glove, and she too was elected to public office.  They were both very committed to public service and to politics.  It is often a clich&eacute; at times like this but I believe Se&aacute;n Ardagh was one of the true gentlemen of Irish politics.  His decency, integrity and good nature were transparent at all times, qualities that are invaluable in political life.  He always had good advice for people and he led by example.  Se&aacute;n did not seek the headlines but what he said mattered.  Any time he spoke, he was listened to as people respected him greatly.  If he did not have anything good to say about people, he did not say anything.<\/p>  <p>  I again extend my deepest sympathies to all of Se&aacute;n's family - his wife M&aacute;ire, sons Rory and Charlie and, of course, Catherine.  He is still very fondly remembered and sadly missed.<\/p>  <p>  Aire, Teachta agus polaiteoir den scoth ab ea Se&aacute;n Calleary.

Sheas s&eacute; go doimhin lena phrionsabail i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  One of Ireland's greatest public servants and gentlemen, Se&aacute;n Calleary served Mayo as a Deputy for 19 years, eight of these as a Government Minister.  He discharged his duties with distinction and honour in the 1980s and early 1990s as Minister of State in the Departments of Labour, Public Service, Industry and Commerce and then Foreign Affairs.  Politics was in the blood, of course.  His father, Phelim, won a by-election when Se&aacute;n was eight months old.  However, he first came to prominence through a very ecumenical sporting ability.  He played junior football with Mayo and he lined out for University College Galway and won the Sigerson Cup in 1955.  However, he did not let it rest there.<\/p><p>In the same year he lined out for UCG in soccer and won the Collingwood Cup, the first ever victory for UCG and stopped University College Dublin, UCD, from winning an eighth in a row.  He had a deep and lifelong love for rugby and his great performances for Galwegians helped the club to achieve a regional dominance.  This was at a time when the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA, did not allow members to play or even attend what were termed \"foreign games\".  Se&aacute;n, a member of the Mayo junior team, simply adopted the pseudonym, J. J. Kelly, also known as Jacko.  As his celebrity as a player grew, a journalist said \"I don't know if you have seen that Jacko Kelly but if you're half the player he is, you'll be very good.\"  Following his playing career he performed leadership roles in Mayo GAA as selector and Connacht Rugby as president of the Connacht branch of the Irish Rugby and Football Union, IRFU.  He was particularly pleased to be inducted into the Mayo sports star hall of fame in 2014.<\/p> <p> His political career began with election in 1967 to the county council.  This started an uninterrupted series of electoral successes, which stretched over the next 22 years, and he spent 19 years as a Member of the D&aacute;il.  He quickly made a name for himself in Leinster House as a decent and considerate man who drew great strength from the community he served.  It was in his five years as Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs that he made his biggest impact.  His primary responsibility was overseas development aid but he played a much wider role and often stood in for his senior Minister, Brian Lenihan Snr, at major international meetings as well as in the D&aacute;il.  He presented the shamrock to the first President Bush standing in for the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and for Brian Lenihan.  He was the first Mayo man to present the shamrock in the White House through circumstance.<\/p> <p> Ireland's strong international standing for its overseas development work is because of people like Se&aacute;n Calleary who brought his engineering background to bear on the development of water solutions for many of the people in Africa.  He may not have had the resources available to him then that subsequent economic growth provided but he demonstrated leadership and determination in policies that have benefitted millions of the world's poorest people.  His greatest pride, of course, was in his family and his wife, Doris.  At his funeral in Mayo last June, his son Dara told us he was \"privileged to have a ringside seat at one of the world's greatest love stories, Se&aacute;n and Doris.  They were devoted to each other.\"  He was proud of all his children's achievements and took great pride in Dara being elected to serve the people of Mayo in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2007.  He was ever available to give my good self advice on the fortunes of the party from 2011 on and the re-emergence and renewal of the party.  His advice was always strongly given and with effect.  On behalf of the party and on my own behalf, I extend our sympathies to his wife, Doris, to Dara, Conall, John, and his daughter S&iacute;ofra.

Se&aacute;n was loved by all sides in this Chamber, and was respected by all and could work with all.  I was fortunate to serve with him on the Joint Committee for Economic Regulatory Affairs during my first term in the D&aacute;il and benefitted a lot from his kindness and advice.  I also saw close up his forensic ability to get to the heart of an issue, his sound judgment and his determination to serve the public good.<\/p>  <p>  One obituary suggested that Se&aacute;n Ardagh might have gone further in politics only for the fact that he had not a bad word to say about anyone, including his political opponents.  I hope that is not true because I believe we need more people like Se&aacute;n Ardagh to make our politics work better.  On the Committee on Public Accounts, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, and as a Deputy and a councillor, he did the State considerable service.  Those who knew him will remember him above all as a gentleman and as an astute politician, someone who served the people of Dublin South Central with distinction and who never neglected his family.  I know how proud he was that his daughter, Catherine, was elected to the Seanad shortly before his death and I suspect it will not be too long before she takes up his former seat in this House.  On behalf of the Fine Gael party, I offer my deepest condolences to his widow, M&aacute;ire, his sons, Rory and Charlie, his daughter, Catherine, his grandchildren, extended family and colleagues in the Fianna F&aacute;il party.  <\/p>  <p>  I also welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to Se&aacute;n Calleary as someone who epitomised the spirit of public service at home and abroad and who was a true Irish patriot.  Se&aacute;n Calleary was a firm believer in something Se&aacute;n Lemass once said: \"Irish people are citizens of the world as well as Ireland\".  Over the course of a distinguished career in politics, he served as a Minister of State in several Departments.  He oversaw our overseas development aid programme and in many ways got that going.  He also worked to combat famine in Ethiopia in the 1980s.  He defended the Irish in Britain who faced discrimination, supported German reunification and was Ireland's lead negotiator on the Lom&eacute; Convention, with African Caribbean and Pacific countries, and we can still see the value of that work today.  At home he championed the building of Ireland West Airport at Knock and the restoration of the C&eacute;ide Fields when others were sceptical about both projects.  In his work on local councils, as mayor of Ballina, as a Deputy and as a Minister of State, Se&aacute;n Calleary worked to make his county and country much better places.  <\/p>  <p>  Many people have said he was a gentleman who never lost his patience with people, a rare ability among politicians, but he loved politics and was a wise counsel for many Governments and Fianna F&aacute;il leaders.  He was also, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said, an accomplished sportsman, excelling at Gaelic football, hurling soccer and rugby, although I believe he sometimes had to play rugby under an alias because of the ban and I glad that today I have finally learned what that alias was.  <\/p>  <p>  Very few families can say they have had three generations who have served the public with honour and distinction.  The Callearys can be proud of their contribution to Irish political life, first through Phelim Calleary, who served the people of Mayo in this House for many years, then through Se&aacute;n and now through Deputy Dara Calleary.  I know how justifiably proud Se&aacute;n's children were of his achievements, and I know he was immensely proud of them.  I offer my condolences to Se&aacute;n's wife, Doris, his daughter, S&iacute;ofra, his sons, John, Conall and Dara, and to all his grandchildren and relatives.

The Ceann Comhairle rightly spoke of the two as being honourable men.  There are many parliaments in which that title is given to members as a matter of course.  In the case of Se&aacute;n Ardagh and Se&aacute;n Calleary, it was completely merited and earned.  They understood fully and embraced and accepted the privilege it is to serve one's community in our national Parliament.  They worked to advance not only their own constituents' interests but to contribute to the national good.  Both men could be described as rocks of sense.  The views they expressed were always listened to carefully by other Members.  At committees and during debates in the House, one listens to the views expressed by certain individuals in order to test one's own views.  Very often, the views expressed by Se&aacute;n Calleary and Se&aacute;n Ardagh were so thoughtful, anchored in logic and obviously carefully considered that they altered the views of others, including even those who came here with fixed positions.<\/p>  <p>  Se&aacute;n Calleary and Se&aacute;n Ardagh represented the highest standards expected of Members of the House.  Se&aacute;n Calleary had a distinguished ministerial career and graced several portfolios with discernment and ability.

When Ireland was poor, or certainly much poorer than it is now, he built awareness of our responsibilities to developing parts of the planet.  That will be a very important and long-lasting legacy memorial of his.  His sporting achievements have been referred to by a number of speakers.

I express to Se&aacute;n Calleary's family, particularly his son, Deputy Dara Calleary, my sincerest sympathy on the loss of a father and husband.  As one who grew up in Tuam, County Galway, known for the Tuam Stars, I know how highly regarded Se&aacute;n Calleary was in Galway circles, especially by those in UCG, those at Galwegians and people involved in Gaelic football and soccer.  His was a name I grew up hearing.

He was always very kind during the years of great difficulty, sadness and illness in our family.  I will never forget that.  The members of the Ardagh family know I mean it from the bottom of my heart.  M&aacute;ire Ardagh served as a councillor when I was a city councillor and we got on well together and had many great nights and a lot of craic.   We enjoyed the moments.

This is a difficult day for the family but it is also a proud one, hearing so many kind words in the Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  Se&aacute;n served as a Deputy for 19 years, eight of those as a Government Minister, and by any standards that is an exceptional record of public service and one to be extremely proud of.  For me in my first term in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, that level of service is something to aspire to and to admire.<\/p>  <p>  In my personal interactions with Se&aacute;n, he was always a very considered man, an intellectual, somebody who was well read and somebody who knew his stuff.  He understood politics but, more importantly, he understood Mayo politics.  I knew that he was a strong source of support for Dara and for the wider Fianna F&aacute;il organisation across Mayo, his opinion was always asked for and he was very well regarded and respected across the constituency and across the political divide.  Within Fianna F&aacute;il, we were obviously immensely proud of him and we still are but even in Fine Gael, those with whom he worked on the county council and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann had great respect and admiration for him.  He was a man of integrity, he was genuine and he was trusted and that is something that can be difficult for politicians but he was certainly trusted by the Mayo electorate which was evidenced by his continued electoral success and within the party, climbing to the ministerial rank.  He was somebody who was seen as a support, not just for his family and his son Dara, but for the organisation and he is sorely missed within Fianna F&aacute;il nationally and very deeply missed within Fianna F&aacute;il in County Mayo.<\/p>  <p>  As we speak today about the loss of a great public servant, I am conscious that he was a father and a husband and will be deeply missed in that regard.  That is not something that will ever be replaced, but is something that one must look back on in appreciation and learn to live with.  I am grateful for the opportunity to express sympathy to the family and thank my colleague, Dara, for being a kind person to work with.  He embodies many of the good qualities that his father had and he has been a very supportive constituency colleague.  I know that his father was immensely proud of him, as Dara was of his father.<\/p>  <p>  On the death of Se&aacute;n Ardagh, I offer my sympathy to my colleague and friend Catherine, who serves in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, to his wife Maura, to Charlie, Rory and all of the extended family.  I know how difficult this was for Catherine.  Having been on the campaign trail with her during the Seanad elections, it was a testing time and she showed huge courage, steel, determination and all the good qualities that we look for in a public representative.  I know how much her father meant to her and how much he impacted on her as a person and influenced her career.  I am so glad that he got to see her elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and I have no doubt that she will be elected to this House in the near future.  I offer my deepest sympathies to her entire family.  I did not know Se&aacute;n personally, although I met him on a couple of occasions, but a bad word has never been spoken about him nor about Catherine.  She is a fantastic colleague and she also embodies the good qualities that her father brought to this Chamber.

He was an honourable man, a man I had great respect for and who served the people of Mayo.  We have had many politicians over the years but Se&aacute;n carried out his job in a very quiet, effective and decent way and when I went to him as a colleague to make representations on behalf of the constituency, he always got back to me and was always there to support and help me in whatever way he could.

I also thank the members of the Business Committee for the honour they have bestowed on us today, which is a very difficult day but one of which we as a family are very proud.  I am proud of my Dad and his achievements in this House.  He served here for 19 years and enjoyed every day he had the privilege of being here.  He contested seven elections.  For those who think this is an uncertain time, they should consider there were three elections in 14 months in 1981 and in 1982.  Dad was honoured to serve as a Minister in a number of Departments but particularly loved the honour of being the Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs in charge of overseas development aid.<\/p>  <p>  He had a very good sporting track record, not something I have picked up.  He played for an Oireachtas team in 1978 against the Westminster Wanderers, the Westminster soccer team.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, served on that team with him.  As Deputy Brendan Howlin said, he would have been thrilled that Ireland beat the All Blacks last Saturday week but he would have been even more thrilled that on the same day Easkey GAA won its first Connacht championship.  He also played with Easkey, even though it is a Sligo team.  He would have enjoyed both wins.<\/p>  <p>  He was very conscious of the honour of serving here, the integrity one had to have as a Member of this House, and of representing all of the people.  My grandparents were both active in the War of Independence and in the Civil War.  They raised my Dad and my uncle in a spirt of tolerance and respect for others.  My Dad played sport all his life and while he played to win and played the ball hard, he respected opposition and opposition voices.  If there is one thing we can do in this House now, it is to bear that in mind.<\/p>  <p>  He would have been honoured to share this occasion with the late Se&aacute;n Ardagh, somebody with whom he shared main traits.  They were always fond of checking in on the Mayo relations of the Ardaghs.  In as much as this is our loss, it is their loss - M&aacute;ire's and Catherine's - as well.  I am sure Catherine's Dad would have been delighted with all the endorsements she is getting from other sides of the House about taking the seat in the next general election.  We will make sure that happens for him.<\/p>  <p>  I thank all the party leaders for their warm words.  Our grief is very private but it is very public.  Dad would have been mortified by the turnout at the funeral, but I noted the Minister, Deputy Ring canvassed it well.  There will be a few in the box for him from there.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know if we have lost ourselves as a family in the past six months; is it possible to have a heart that is both broken and full of pride at the one time?  It is.  We are full of pride about the respect and integrity in which he is held and the memories people have of him.  We aspire to live up to those memories and standards as we proceed forward.  His view of politics was that it was not a game but a deadly serious profession, that we had to respect the people who put us here and to work collectively for those people.<\/p>  <p>  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam agus go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat le gach duine sa Teach.

Some 5,000 people came onto the streets to march.  As many as 3,000 marched last Saturday.  The Taoiseach acknowledged that there were issues to be dealt with in Tipperary town and I asked him to look at setting up a task force.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste neglected the town, as did the Minister, Deputy Bruton, through the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme.  The people are willing to collaborate and work on this.  They are not talking down the town.  They are willing to talk it up.  There is great community spirit and energy there.  Will the Taoiseach please set up a task force to look at this?  They hope to get some of the money from Project Ireland 2040.  While we got money  for Kickham Barracks in Clonmel, which the Government closed, and in Thurles, which we appreciate, Tipperary town and west Tipperary have been neglected.

I acknowledge the Taoiseach was on the Roscommon and Leitrim border last Friday, when he opened an extension creating 60 extra jobs and this is good, but many rural areas are really suffering and the only thing we can hope to get into them is employment.

The key to driving forward this issue is an indemnity scheme by the Department for landowners so that anybody using the land would not be in a position to claim against the landowners.  The one thing that has been holding up everything for the past 18 months is, we have been told, that primary legislation is needed to provide this indemnity insurance policy.  No progress has been made and draft legislation has not been printed.  Will the Taoiseach follow up with the relevant Minister to get this issue over the line for the 2019 season?

It is a fine video and it is well produced but having been a Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I realised that the campaign for the UN Security Council is a close-up campaign.  I do not say it is hand-to-hand combat but the Taoiseach will be aware that it is about personally engaging with representatives from other countries.  Our officials do it and our Ministers do it whenever they are overseas.  When I watched the video, it looked like it was intended for a domestic audience and not one that was likely to encourage anybody on the UN Security Council to vote Ireland onto the council.  Rather it was a video that made everyone look good, including the Taoiseach, for a domestic audience.  I believe there is a serious issue in respect of the emphasis placed on public relations and the proliferation of videos with the ensuing costs.  We need better transparency on this.

They were campaigns such as Healthy Ireland, which is all about encouraging people to take those little steps that could improve their physical or mental health such as giving up smoking, exercising more and healthier eating.  I do not believe that anyone in this House would think it money badly spent to invest in Healthy Ireland and to put across to the public those important messages regarding their own health.  One could give no better health advice than to give up smoking, exercise more and eat healthier.<\/p>  <p>  There was also a campaign to inform the public about Project Ireland 2040, what is in that programme and how it will affect people in their communities and their lives.  Another campaign was the public information campaign for the self-employed to let self-employed people know what new benefits are being made available to them by the Government, how their tax burden is being reduced and how the Government is increasingly investing in supporting entrepreneurship.  These are all public information campaigns.  When I first became Taoiseach, I took the decision to centralise this funding in my Department through the special communications unit so the spending relates to that.  This is why it has almost all occurred before July 2014.  My intention was to centralise communications, improve communications and reduce the costs thereof.  Given the political controversy that was caused, which became such a distraction to the project, that is no longer the case.  In future, and indeed currently, these campaigns and information campaigns are funded through the line Department and not through my Department.<\/p>  <p>  I disagree with Deputy McDonald's comments earlier.  Anything that exposes somebody who makes false claims about health or particular cures is very much in the public interest.  The Deputy and her party do not have a very good record on this with regard to her own conduct and that of some of her party members around the issue of CervicalCheck and cervical screening.  Some of the false claims made by the Deputy's party caused increased anxiety for women in Ireland.  There were false claims in health and false information was put out.  Claims of false cures can cost lives and can damage people in the long term.  I do not believe that anyone in this House should be ashamed of exposing those who make false claims around health and particular cures.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have a breakdown of staffing numbers but I can provide those by correspondence.  It is the 21st century and people who work in media no longer tend to be broken into social media, broadcast media and print media.  Increasingly the platforms are all becoming one.  The number of persons dedicated to social media may well be very small, or zero, but people tend to work across platforms these days and not just in one branch of media.  My Twitter account is mine.

This is taxpayers' money.  As the Head of the Government, he makes the announcements and he has Government colleagues with him.  Why, however, is there a general election candidate?  That is what got the Taoiseach into bother the last time around when it was regarded that State money was being used to make announcements on projects on the taxpayers' dollar, and that it was being used, misused and abused to promote not only a party political agenda but also an agenda very much connected with the electoral prospects of his party colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800024#W00400","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1543413300,"counter":304,"content":"<p>That is the core point.

The Taoiseach was honouring a remarkable contribution to politics and to peace on the island of Ireland.  Mr. Durkan was a close confidant of, and great adviser to, John Hume.  He was a member of the British Parliament.  Regrettably, he lost his seat in the last general election.  He is a big loss to politics in Northern Ireland.  He would have cast his vote in Westminster if he had been elected to support the draft withdrawal treaty on Brexit, which is now before the British Parliament.  In many ways, honouring Mark Durkan illustrates the silence in Northern Ireland of the anti-Brexit majority, who do not have any public or parliamentary forum through which they can articulate their views on Brexit.  It is my genuine belief that the collapse of the Executive originally and the absence of any Executive and assembly is something that has caused great damage to Northern Ireland in terms of its capacity to make a meaningful contribution to the Brexit debate.  In particular, if the Executive and assembly had not been collapsed they would act as a potential bridge between the two communities, an opportunity to channel a practical approach to Brexit that has been sorely missed to date.  I recall the letter that former Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, and First Minister, Arlene Foster, wrote together, basically referencing the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland and the desire of both to work together to manage the issues facing Northern Ireland in the Brexit context.  How polarised it has become since that joint letter was issued.

I agree that it is extremely important that he and members of his Government regularly visit communities in the North across the board.  That in and of itself is an important confidence-building measure.<\/p>  <p>  I disagree that the anti-Brexit majority has been silent.  The facts speak to the contrary.  In fact, it has met the Taoiseach in political form - ourselves from Sinn F&eacute;in, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, the SDLP and the Greens.  The anti-Brexit majority has spoken loudly well beyond politics in the business community with which we, and no doubt the Taoiseach, have worked closely, through agriculture, academia, the trade unions and the community sector - one could not miss them.  The message is unmissable regarding the anti-Brexit position.<\/p>  <p>  Of course it is absolutely disgraceful that the power-sharing institutions are not up and running.  I absolutely agree with that point.  However, the Taoiseach should not overestimate the extent to which the institutions would have influenced the Brexit debate.  He should look to Scotland.  The Scots will go into the House of Commons, 80 or so of them, and vote against the draft withdrawal agreement because Scottish interests are not to the forefront.  They are irrelevant in the Westminster debate.  They will tell us, if we have ears to listen, that they have been marginalised.  It has been a box-ticking exercise.  In fact, Scottish members of the House of Commons went so far as to leave on one occasion, such was their level of frustration.  Brexit in an essential way is a very English phenomenon.  It is a dispute, but that is just in a matter of shade.

He made a very thoughtful but also very witty speech on the night.  I regret that he lost his seat because it has left the city of Derry unrepresented in Westminster, which leaves Derry and the residents of the Foyle constituency without a vote on Brexit.<\/p><p>We understand there will be a series of votes in the House of Commons; it will not just be a simple &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; vote on the withdrawal agreement.  It will be possible for MPs to table amendments on which there will be votes.  There could be specific votes on the backstop and on whether the United Kingdom should remain in the EU customs union.  That matter was only defeated by three votes a few months ago when MPs last voted on it.  There could be a vote on whether the UK should stay in the Single Market.  The Scottish National Party, SNP, is strongly pushing that option.  There could even be a vote on whether there should be a people's vote.  It is regrettable that seven constituencies in Northern Ireland will be disenfranchised and will not have a say on this important matter that affects them so much.<br\/><br\/>On a level beyond simple arithmetic, I am also concerned that many MPs in the House of Commons are not hearing the full story from Northern Ireland.  Many English MPs - Deputy McDonald is right to identify much of this as an English phenomenon - do not know a great deal about Northern Ireland.  They do not read the <i>Belfast Telegraph<\/i>or the <i>Irish News<\/i>.  They are not really hearing from business people or farmers in Northern Ireland.  They are hearing what they are hearing around the tea and coffee rooms and bars in Westminster.  That is why it is important to be there and Sinn F&eacute;in MPs are not.  The people of Northern Ireland are being badly let down in that regard.<br\/><br\/>I was asked about the game plan.  To get the assembly and the Executive back up and running, we want to work with the British Government to encourage the two major parties, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, to come together, make compromises, put aside their differences and build trust.  We want them to form an Executive and restore the assembly.  It is my hope that if and when the United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster approves the withdrawal agreement, then at least we will have certainty about what is going to happen and what is not going to happen for the next two years or more.  I hope that allows a window of opportunity for the parties to come together and to agree to the establishment of an Executive and assembly again.  In the absence of that, we will ensure that the other institutions, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, work, operate and meet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800025#X03300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543414500,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I will deal with the Good Friday Agreement in the next question.

For example, if the SNP were to vote in favour of the withdrawal agreement or aspects of it, it would pass by a wide margin.  SNP Members have been involved in all the talks with the British Government - I have met them.  However, nobody from the assembly or Executive in the North has been in talks as a government with the British Government on the issues relating to Brexit.  How can there be regulatory alignment with the Single Market without the Executive and the assembly up and running?<\/p>  <p>  As I have said for the past two years, if people do not want to take their seats in Westminster they should not stand for election and allow people who would take their seats to stand and give Northern Ireland representation on a crucial issue.  This is existential in some respects economically for the entire island if the wrong call is made by the Westminster Parliament.  I do not want to predict too far into the future - there could be an Article 50 extension and so on.  The stakes are very high for ordinary people and their jobs in sectors from agrifood to business.  Civil society has not been represented adequately.  While some anti-Brexit groups have been coming, they have been reduced to deputations to Brussels, Dublin and elsewhere.

I indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision either by the UK or the EU to end the backstop.<\/p>  <p>  I recalled the prior commitments made that the backstop must apply \"unless and until\" alternative arrangements were in place to supercede it.  We both expressed the hope that the negotiations could conclude in a satisfactory manner as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the endorsement by the European Council of the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union, and approval of the Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship.<\/p>  <p>  Both sets of negotiators have worked long and hard to achieve this decisive progress, with compromises on all sides.  Ireland&rsquo;s key objectives for this stage in the negotiations have been fully achieved.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the backstop arrangements in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland provide a guarantee that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland.  We hope that the backstop will never be used and we will work closely and continuously with our EU partners during the negotiations on the future relationship treaties that will establish the alternative arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  I can also confirm that the protocol includes provisions allowing for a review of the backstop.  The legal text states that the backstop will stay in place unless and until alternative arrangements can be agreed and can only be ended by the mutual agreement of both sides.<\/p>  <p>  The EU and the UK have committed in the finalised withdrawal agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  For the avoidance of any doubt, the protocol confirms that nothing in the agreement would prejudice the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom and that the principle of consent as set out in the Good Friday Agreement is now part of a draft treaty between the UK and the EU, therefore strengthening and copper-fastening that principle of consent.<\/p>  <p>  While the backstop, if invoked, envisages some different regulatory rules applying in Northern Ireland, this does not represent a threat to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland in my view.

I welcome the fact that the essentials of the Good Friday Agreement have been preserved within the withdrawal agreement.  I have absolutely no doubt but that the collapse of the Executive and the Assembly was contrived nearly two years ago by Sinn F&eacute;in for political reasons.  Allegedly, it was over the renewable heat initiative.  We now know Sinn F&eacute;in was involved in trying to keep that extended as well.  The degree of cynicism involved in that act was extraordinary.  I do not accept Deputy McDonald's assertions, and I put it to the Taoiseach, that the absence of the Executive or the Assembly somehow is irrelevant to the unfolding Brexit situation.  That is an absurd assertion to make.  I have made those points on the importance of the Assembly and the Executive in terms of allowing the anti-Brexit majority in Northern Ireland to have a parliamentary voice and a voice at the Executive, and also to improve the dynamic in relations.  Brexit has damaged relations between two communities in the North.  It is polarised because of Brexit and, in my view, the absence of real politics.<\/p>  <p>  When a scandal hits a government, one does not collapse it.  One deals with the scandal.  It is extraordinary that a renewable heat initiative scandal that has occasioned an inquiry caused the collapse of the entire edifice of Government - the Executive and the Parliament.  I believe that is unparalleled in any European democracy and, in my view, unforgivable, given the gravity of Brexit, and compounded by the absence of any Brexit sentiment in Westminster where people did not get an opportunity to articulate their view.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit is about damage limitation.  We know Brexit will be bad.  Events may unfold differently in the Westminster Parliament.  We are now in the realm of speculation here as to what will occur there.  I note the Taoiseach said last week that no Government could be prepared for a no-deal scenario.

At that stage, the Taoiseach can make his assessment on an informed basis as regards Sinn F&eacute;in.  What he is doing at this point is simply playing party politics.  He says he wishes, in an even-handed manner, with rigorous impartiality - that is what both Governments are committed to in the Good Friday Agreement - to ensure the restoration of the institutions of Government, yet at every opportunity, in a very partisan and partial way, the Taoiseach chooses to attack Sinn F&eacute;in and to attack me.  That is the Taoiseach's business, and it might be the party political acoustic of this Chamber, but it is a far cry from adopting a posture of rigorous impartiality.<\/p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Martin, I have not advanced any absurdities.  Unlike his party or the Taoiseach's party, we actually represent people in the North of Ireland.  We have a democratic mandate from them.  We live and work within the communities in question so I know full well the necessity and the value of good government and sustainable power sharing.  However, I am also saying to him that he is in cloud cuckoo land if he thinks there could be an agreed all-of-Executive position on Brexit with the stance that has been taken by the DUP.  He is even further in the realms of fantasy and wishful thinking if he imagines for one second that Ireland, or any representatives from Ireland, will be the decisive factor in the shape of Brexit, or Scotland for that matter.  That is not a real possibility.  As I have said previously, the withdrawal agreement is the least worst outcome.  In his bid to sooth unionists' nerves, I ask the Taoiseach to reassure the D&aacute;il that he will not give any succour to the position advanced by Arlene Foster that the backstop should be ditched.

It involves the hiring of veterinary officials, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is confident it can do that.  It requires significant infrastructure at Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare.  Those works are under way, and the OPW is leading on those in conjunction with the port companies and the Dublin Airport Authority.  Also, the European Commission is working on its no-deal contingency plans, many of which have been published, and notices have been issued with regard to what will be done in the case of citizens' rights, aviation and so on.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe a no-deal scenario is likely.

Even if one does not agree with somebody, understanding where they are coming from is of benefit.  Listening is a benefit as well.

That was not my intention whatsoever.  When I used the term \"precious union\" in this Chamber, I did so quoting Arlene Foster because she often refers to the precious union.  I quoted it in an attempt to demonstrate that I understand how precious the union is to unionists and how important their British identity is to them.<\/p><p>I said it and quoted it in an attempt to demonstrate that I was listening and that I understood that unionists regard the union to be precious.

It is extremely important to prepare properly.  To date, the Dutch Government, for example, has been further ahead than us and hired 1,000 customs officers.  There is a significant issue with our level of preparation across the board, including in enterprise.  The number of companies that describe themselves as not ready for Brexit in surveys such as Bord Bia's and others' is a concern.<\/p>  <p>  On unionism, I recall the Taoiseach's comments last week and I think he was attempting to educate me about the unionist mind.  I have talked with unionists for more than 30 years, on many occasions off the record, and in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs I managed to co-chair the discussions that resulted in the devolution of justice, which was the final act of the St. Andrews and Good Friday Agreements and which brought the administration of justice to a devolved setting in Northern Ireland.

It reflects a monumental failure.  I do not live in cloud-cuckoo-land.  I have given much time and effort to Northern Ireland over many decades to try to understand it, coming from the republican background that I do.  I have worked well with unionists, people from the nationalist and republican communities and public representatives on all sides.

All the stakeholders have been making efforts and are working hard to reverse this trend.  Only last year we secured the national apprenticeship centre which is located in the town and there are over 250 apprentices based on the site today.  Our small and medium enterprises are showing initiative to drive forward despite the difficulties.  These include OMC, an engineering company based in Thurles which was founded and driven by mid-Tipperary business people, and Dew Valley Foods, a processing company, which is also a significant employer.<\/p>  <p>  An opportunity now presents itself to Thurles and mid-Tipperary which requires the support of Government and Government policy.  Lisheen, just outside Thurles, has been designated as a national research centre for the bioeconomy.<\/p><p>Thanks to the research of Professor Kevin O'Connor and his team at UCD, and the pilot work done by Glanbia, there will be a biorefinery on the site in a relatively short time.  This is just the beginning.  The research happening at the site has the potential to turn the waste from the agricultural and agrifood industries into high value, globally traded commodities.  The resulting jobs and supports connected to that can be a game changer, not just for Tipperary but for development in rural Ireland as a whole.  The energy from the bioeconomy will be to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th, and we in Ireland are ideally placed to capitalise on it.<\/p> <p> The site at Lisheen is perfect in many ways.  It is flat, it has scale, it has high voltage electricity and green energy available and it has a water supply that matches the size of the site.  However, one piece of the jigsaw is missing, namely, connection to the national gas network.  This can be solved at relatively small cost.  If we consider the benefits to the State which I have outlined, it will be an investment that makes a return to the State of a magnitude never before seen.  If this final part of the infrastructure was brought to Lisheen, the site would immediately be attractive to the pharmaceutical and food industries, or a mixture of the two.  It would fit all the criteria required for a hub for the international data centre industry.  It would be a shining example of how to create rural development and could be recreated throughout the country.<\/p> <p> If Lisheen was connected to the national gas network, with a bioeconomy focus on the site, it is easy to see the biogas industry being attracted.  This could help to achieve the national target of 30% of all gas used in Ireland coming from biogas by 2030.  The biogas used at Lisheen could be pulled back into the national gas grid and, given this potential payback, it is easy to justify the investment.  The gas network can be connected to the Lisheen site from Cashel in County Tipperary.  This would have the added benefit that the shortest route runs adjacent to Thurles, which is the nearest urban centre to the Lisheen site.  Lisheen would be the anchor tenant and would justify connecting Thurles in the same way Tipperary Co-op did for connecting Tipperary town, the Goodman factory did for Cahir and Arrabawn did for Nenagh.  As Thurles would provide the role of urban support to the fully functioning site, which would ultimately have hundreds of employees, it is only sensible that Thurles be connected to the network as part of this project.  That would have the effect of supporting existing industry in the town and would also make the town attractive for new industry of all kinds.<\/p> <p> A number of steps must be taken to progress this project.  First, a robust feasibility study must be carried out as soon as possible and this study must have input from the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  It must also include input from Tipperary County Council, which is passionate about the project.  The study must include all of the aspects of climate change that the project can benefit.  This study can be done for &euro;90,000.  With the feasibility study done, it will be possible to make an application for funding to Project Ireland 2040 as early as next September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800029#GG00200","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543416600,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I am sure he knows the way this works.  Gas Networks Ireland is a commercial State-sponsored body and is regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  The CRU has developed a network connections policy, under which industrial users, towns or groups of towns within a region can make an application to be considered for a connection.  The criterion the regulator sets is that the net present value of the revenues over a 25-year period must exceed the net present value of the costs of the connection.  I gather, from what I am told within the Department, that the last time the Tipperary region referred to by the Deputy applied was more than ten years ago and, at that stage, Thurles did not qualify for a connection.  Since then, the system has evolved in that groups of towns can apply, so if there are connections with Lisheen that might add additional payload, those can be included.<\/p>  <p>  Gas Networks Ireland would need a proposal to come forward with various payloads and the need for energy and gas usage from industrial users and from towns.  Clearly, it cannot assume that just by providing gas, everyone will connect, given there is a connection charge and also the cost of adjusting one's own heating system to a gas system.  It has to conduct this study.  As I said, the area in question has not made an application in ten years.  If the businesses that are developing in Lisheen have a gas requirement, that can be added as part of a submission, which would be evaluated under the connections policy the CRU has enunciated.  Gas Networks Ireland would then apply that.<\/p>  <p>  Based on what the Deputy outlined, I do not know which industrial users are in the area.  Gas Networks Ireland does not provide speculative extension of the line without having an indication that the demand is there, which is natural, given it is a commercial user.  There has to be the establishment of demand and there would have to be projects coming on stream and approved, whether by Enterprise Ireland, the IDA or Teagasc.  That is the system.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is examining whether there are other dimensions, such as environmental dimensions, that could be a top-up to simply looking at the pure net present value.  I understand a report will come to me shortly with an evaluation of that.  That report will consider issues such as the carbon savings that might accrue and whether the net present value criteria are taking those into account.  However, the overall approach is as I have outlined.  Whatever the local promoters of the various initiatives are suggesting, whether it be biogas or otherwise, those will have to be developed to a point where they are close to approval as viable projects before Gas Networks Ireland could be in a position to supply its system.  I am trying to be as helpful as possible.  Of course, applications to the climate action fund or the disruptive technologies innovation fund can be of a more innovative type.  Where there are innovative initiatives coming forward, those could apply to the climate action fund, where they would be looked on based on their value in respect of carbon impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800030#HH00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1543416600,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I am encouraged by the Minister's reply.

Tipperary County Council is very enthusiastic about the potential of the Lisheen site and what it can do.  Sustainable food production will be the byword of the 21st century.  Given the research going on into the Lisheen site and the fact it is a bioeconomy centre, I have no doubt the usage will be there.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister that the feasibility study on the potential of the Lisheen site and the gas connection, which the county council has asked for, be undertaken.

I am confident in the extreme that he will recognise the significant potential of this site and the Thurles area.  Glanbia has bought into this biorefinery.  The location is at the heart of the agrifood industry, with Arrabawn, Dairygold, Tipperary Co-op and even Lakelands in the vicinity, as well as numerous meat factories.

Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, is not going to undertake an assessment of these.  This is based on projects that are coming forward, enterprises identified that are about to be approved or supported by the Industrial Development Authority, IDA or Enterprise Ireland.  When those enterprises are identified and have a demand for gas then GNI can assess whether that will be connected.  Neither GNI nor the Department go speculatively looking to see if they could create a demand for gas.  That is not the way the system works.  This has been regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  The emergence of new biorefinery activities with a gas demand will trigger an application to the connections policy and provide the opportunity to pass the test applied.

Some of the women impacted by this are in the Visitors Gallery and are watching the proceedings here.<\/p><p>We welcome the publication of the report.  The women's voices are present throughout the report but that is coming from a fairly low base because there were not very many face-to-face interviews.  We would like to see more of the women's stories reflected in that report.  I acknowledge that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has met the women.  Before we went into the meeting, we had a very frank exchange and they had a very frank exchange with the Minister.  It is not easy to talk about some of these issues.  I raised them at Leader's Questions and know it is a difficult subject.  It is a credit to the women that they put forward their own cases, along with Melanie their representative, in a very coherent manner.  They rarely use euphemisms which is welcome.  We are all adults after all but we acknowledge this is a difficult topic.<\/p><p>We know that the scanners are coming but by what date?  It is impossible for many of the women to gauge the level of the problem and to know the best course of treatment.  Is there a co-operation agreement in place or can one be put in place for use of the scanner that will be installed in Belfast?  In that way at the very least we might have access to that scanner.  Will the women be afforded access to the treatment abroad scheme?  I know that is a tricky area.  I know the rules and that the Minister of State knows about this issue not only from this debate but from constituency cases.  <\/p><p>We have learnt from the report that the governance mechanisms were not in place at national level.  Only yesterday <i>The Guardian<\/i>covered this story and said that mesh implants made by one of the biggest pharmaceutical firms in the world were inserted despite the company being warned that the mesh could shrink and harden.  I met a woman today whose implant was inserted only six months ago.  I asked previously for the suspension of its use and it has been paused but this was in use until very recently.  We want to see action on all the clinical and technical issues associated with the use of mesh as a matter of urgency because while there are some women in the Gallery there are many more at home because they cannot travel, and more come forward every day of the week to tell their stories and to seek help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800031#JJ00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1543417200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>If there is something I admire more than anything else in politicians of any hue, colour or creed, it is consistency.  The Deputy's consistency in this subject matter for a long time is commendable.  The report to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, from Dr. Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer, on the use of urogynaecological surgery in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence, SUI, and pelvic organ prolapse, POP, in women was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018.  Synthetic mesh devices have been widely used in the surgical treatment of SUI and POP in women over the past two decades.  However, controversy about the safety of mesh devices has arisen in many countries because of concerns about the frequency and severity of complications associated with their use.<\/p><p>In responding to these questions and in recognition of the complexity of the matters arising, the Minister requested the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, to prepare a report for him on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.  Preparation of the report has involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies.  The report has been informed by a review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years.  The report has also been informed by the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.  The Minister for Health acknowledges the bravery, commitment and dignity shown by the women he met and those women who have written to him in sharing what were harrowing and deeply personal experiences.<\/p> <p> The report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures.  However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women.  These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.  The report makes 19 recommendations, including the development of patient information and informed consent materials; surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures; the development of clinical guidance; the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices; ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.  A programme of work to advance some of the report's more important recommendations has already commenced in the HSE in advance of its completion.  The HSE was also asked by the CMO on 24 July to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so until a number of key recommendations have been implemented.  The Deputy acknowledged that in her contribution.<\/p> <p> A priority recommendation being progressed by the HSE is the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications.  This includes identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally.  The HSE will also examine the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.  Decisions to remove mesh devices in women who experience complications must be made on an individual basis following detailed clinical assessment and discussion of the risks, benefits and treatment options by women with their treating clinicians.  The HSE has published a dedicated website page on vaginal mesh implants, including contact information, for women suffering complications.  I hope this is a useful resource, the link to which can be made available.<\/p> <p> I appreciate I have not answered the two direct questions on the date for the scanning machines and whether there is a co-operation agreement with Belfast.  I was also asked about the treatment abroad scheme.  I will get clarity on those matters for the Deputy and forward the information to her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800031#JJ00500","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543417800,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and for his kind words.

I welcome the Minister of State's statement that he will come back to me on access.  My questions were not designed in any way to trip anyone up.  Like the Minister of State, I want to be able to tell these women when this will happen.  There is an acknowledgement of what happened to these women and there is also an acknowledgement on the part of the HSE and the Department that action must be taken.  We are looking for a timeline for that action and a date by which the women will start to see a material difference.  I spoke to the husband of a woman from the Minister of State's county, albeit not from his constituency, last week.  That couple had just cobbled together enough money to get to England to have a full removal procedure there.  The husband had spent five and a half years looking after his wife who is in agony and they could not wait.  I would dearly love to be able to tell that man when his wife would get treated.  That is all people are looking for.  While the acknowledgement and the fact that some progress has been made are very welcome, we need to join up the dots now and set out the date on which women will have access to a scanner or the treatment abroad scheme.  They will then be able to start the process of recovering.  Some of those women will never recover, but we must ensure they can get as well as possible.

It was an oversight on my part.  I thank the Minister of State for attending to take this Topical Issue on the lack of a consultant psychiatrist in Carlow for the last period.  The position has been vacant in Carlow for a number of years at this stage.  There was a mental hospital in Carlow for many years, but it closed following the policy changes of recent years.  While the outreach service has, generally speaking, been good, the position of consultant psychiatrist has remained vacant with services being provided on a locum basis.  The locum would come on a weekly basis to meet clients, but when a new locum attended, the client had to start from scratch all over again to explain his or her story.  The lack of consistency has been a huge problem.  As difficult as the locum situation was, there has been no service at all since 1 February 2018.  There is no consultant psychiatrist at all, whether provided by a locum or otherwise.  There is no service in Carlow at all to cover what is unfortunately a great level of need locally.  Service users have now been told that their care plans will not be reviewed and that the medication they have been prescribed will have to continue to do them until a consultant psychiatrist is available or a similar service can be provided.  This is totally unsatisfactory.  At the very least, a locum service should be provided to meet the needs of people in Carlow.  If those needs did not exist, the position would not have been created to meet them.  While I appreciate that there is a huge difficulty in filling vacancies and that consultant psychiatrists are extremely hard to acquire, closing the service completely has been a regressive move.  I ask the Minister of State two questions.  When will the position be filled?  What is the possibility of renewing the locum service in the short to medium term?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800032#KK00500","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1543417800,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Deering for providing me with the opportunity to address this issue.  The lack of consultant psychiatry services in Carlow is an issue he has brought to my attention on numerous occasions in various fora.  To refer to the broader picture first, the Deputy acknowledged the worldwide shortage of consultant psychiatrists.  It affects us here in Ireland also.  I note that the Acting Chairman, Deputy Connolly, has a great interest in this area too.  We are currently short approximately 60 consultant psychiatrists in Ireland.  No matter what action we take and no matter how much money we spend on advertisements in medical journals in Australia, New Zealand and other countries, we cannot get sufficient cover for the positions we have created in recent years.  We are putting adequate resources in place.  If it was a question of more money, I could solve the problem overnight.  We have increased the mental health budget from the &euro;700 million provision in place when the Deputy first came to the House in 2011.<\/p><p>It is now more than &euro;1 billion.  Having put an additional &euro;300 million into the mental health budget over the past five years, we still face the same challenges.<\/p> <p> I am a firm believer that if we always do what we always did, we will always get what we always got so we have to move away from the issue of more money and resources because that is not the problem.  There is a shortage, we have an over-reliance on the consultant psychiatry and we have to look at new ways of delivering consultant psychiatry.  What I have done since becoming Minister of State is increase the number of training places for psychiatric nurses by more than 130 every year and I have introduced 114 assistant psychologists in the past year and brought 20 psychologists into the mental health system.  We have also introduced ten advanced nurse practitioners, which are effectively one step below a consultant, to try to do as much of the work that consultants do as possible and to make sure that consultant psychiatrists are only doing the work that they absolutely have to do.  We are trying to reorientate the system to be more proactive, to get more people into the system earlier, to ensure earlier intervention in the system and to get people detected at an earlier stage before they get to a higher level input.  That is an ambitious target and that is the journey we are on.<\/p> <p> I have also engaged extensively with numerous partners to try to bring about telehealth because that is what they are doing in Australia and America where they have the same difficulties as us.  Telehealth works through screen to screen delivery of mental health services.  A consultant psychiatrist based in Dublin can assess, diagnose, prescribe, treat and admit patients, if necessary.  Many of our consultants provide cover in areas where we have gaps and as soon as I announce that I have a consultant psychiatrist for Carlow, there will be somebody else in the Deputy's seat in a few more weeks saying that there is a consultant psychiatrist missing in their area.<\/p> <p> We need to look at the bigger picture, and recognise that we have a challenge here and that we need to look at how we do what we do, and that is why I have been championing telepsychiatry.  We have made good progress and we will roll out a number of pilots this year in this area.  I would love to hear from the Deputy's community health organisation, CHO, area and it is something that he might take up with HSE management in his area because we will make money available for people to apply to participate in a pilot project so that a neighbouring consultant psychiatrist can provide governance to the team that is working locally and cover without having to make a four or six-hour return journey by car.  We can eliminate the travel and do it in a clinical, supervised setting.<\/p> <p> Thanks to the Deputy continually raising this issue, he will be pleased to hear that we secured an adult psychiatrist in his area who started work the day before yesterday.  It is a locum position and it is not the silver bullet that I wish it would be but it ensures that there is a service there as of this week for the short term and, hopefully, the medium term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800032#KK00600","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543418400,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State again for this result, for his comprehensive understanding of the situation and for his engagement in recent times.

It is important that there is a service, albeit it is not the silver bullet service that we might want, as the Minister of State mentioned.

No matter what the area of difficulty, I have always felt that we needed to look beyond the normal and traditional ways of doing things and a teleservice is definitely something to consider for the future.  The Carlow area could be considered and I will definitely take that issue up with my CHO area.  It is something that could be piloted in as many areas around the country as possible so that people will have access to that service.  My genuine initial concern was that service users would not have their service plan reviewed and they might have to deal with the same medication for months without being reviewed which I would consider to be dangerous.  I am delighted that has changed and that there is a little bit more certainty for the service users that they will have a system available to them.  Going forward, there needs to be something more definite and better planned so that they will be able to go in whenever they have an appointment and see the same face.

My ambition is to see a hub established in, say Dublin, where there would be a consultant psychiatrist on duty 24 hours a day and consultant psychiatry can be beamed into six or seven emergency departments, so that if a child or a young person in psychosis presents to an emergency department, a trolley or a cart with a screen on it will be brought up and a consultant psychiatrist will be there live and will diagnose, treat, prescribe and admit, if necessary, and that consultant psychiatrist in the hub can cover six or seven emergency departments as opposed to us trying to have a consultant psychiatrist in each one of those emergency departments 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to cover the two or three cases that might present in any given 24-hour period.  This is how they are tackling the shortage in other countries and in Ireland we have to be forward thinking and brave in this as well and embrace that new technology and new thinking.  It has been done elsewhere and we do not need to reinvent the wheel.  We just need to take up the challenge as opposed to trying to do what we always did because we will always get what we always got, which is not satisfactory and is not good enough as far as I am concerned.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to working with the Deputy to roll out some of these initiatives in Carlow and wish the new consultant who took up a post in adult psychiatry in Carlow on Monday the best of luck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800033#LL00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1543418400,"counter":384,"content":"<p>Bogfaimid ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; an Saincheist Tr&aacute;th&uacute;la dheireanach &oacute;n Teachta O'Rourke.

That has been positive and significant.  The announcement on Monday under the urban regeneration and development fund of funding to Kildare County Council to progress the bridge to route selection brings it up to, and including, the design and tender stage, which is welcome.  Celbridge has a population of more than 22,000 people and this is something that we have been seeking for many years at this stage.  There is gridlock and it can take up to 45 minutes to move 300 m or 400 m through the town, which is frustrating for people living in the area.

The location of this land will provide clear access to the M7 in Naas and on to the M50 and a very accessible route to the M4.  It is beside amenities such as the Celbridge GAA club, the tennis club, schools etc.  The local area plan, which has just been approved by the local councillors and by the Minister of State's Department, has identified this land as an area for key strategic development.  When we discussed this matter in July we sought that the Minister of State's officials would engage with Kildare County Council and ask it to engage with the landowners to progress the master plan, which in turn, it is hoped, would lead to development of those lands sooner rather than later given the current crisis, the need for housing and the location of this land, which is not depending on infrastructure.

This matter was originally tabled for last Thursday and the Minister, Deputy Murphy, had hoped to take it as it is an issue with which he is happy to engage.  I welcome the Deputy's positive comments regarding the funding announced for project B for Celbridge and the other counties.  Deputies O'Rourke and Durkan raised it with the Minister, Deputy Murphy, and myself on numerous occasions.  We recognise the importance of it.  We will have development in key areas such as Kildare and Celbridge in this case and we will be bringing forward housing proposals.  We also have to provide the necessary infrastructure in order that we provide such development in a co-ordinated and planned way.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Murphy, and the Taoiseach made it very clear when Project Ireland 2040 was announced that four or five funds would be announced later in the year, and that happened in May or June, to back-up Project Ireland 2040 and to make sure our plans are realistic.  The Deputy rightly identified the importance of the bridge and the relief road for Celbridge as key areas if we are to be able to develop these lands in a positive way for the town but also to provide housing for people from the area who want to have their own homes or other people who want to live in the area.  We are seeking to achieve a proper co-ordinated structure with good planning and infrastructural development, and that is what funding under the urban renewal fund addresses.  I recognise Deputy O'Rourke's comments in that respect and the importance of having discussions such as this one in the House to make sure we get all this right.  Deputy Durkan and himself have kept us focused on this.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy's raising of this matters gives me the opportunity to outline where we are at with the development.  The Celbridge local area plan 2017-2023 was adopted by the elected members on 17 August 2017 and came into effect on 14 September 2017.  It is hard to believe it is a year ago as we had many discussions on that and other parts of the Celbridge plan.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban development, I welcome the fact that the plan supports the provision of a substantial new housing development in a key urban area close to Dublin.  Kildare County Council, in its current county development plan, has earmarked the population of Celbridge to grow by approximately 10,000 people over the next five to ten years.  We are discussing that planned development in the coming years but also during the next seven to ten years.  We need to plan for this increase and to ensure that Celbridge grows in a coherent fashion with the timely delivery of the new infrastructure that will be needed for this expanded population.  That includes the lands that are ready for development today but also we need to ensure we will make good use of our infrastructure, be it bridges, roads or train stations.  We planned the development close to those in a joint and co-ordinated fashion.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, I welcome the provisions of the plan enabling future housing growth on the southern side of the town in proximity to the existing commuter rail station at Hazelhatch, as the Deputy mentioned, and around that area.  This development strategy is consistent with established national and regional planning policy which encourages new housing accessible to such high quality public transport facilities in the interest of sustainable development.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the local area plan also identifies the key pieces of strategic infrastructure that are required to be delivered as part of the planned new housing development areas.  The phasing arrangements set out in section 13 of the local area plan include requirements regarding the provision of a new road, bridge, open space and other facilities that will support the new homes to be constructed.  Design briefs are also provided for the five key development areas earmarked for future housing development which will further assist in ensuring the construction of quality residential neighbourhoods that are integrated into the existing urban fabric of the town.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the roll-out of the local area plan and in the interests of supporting the integrated development of housing within the local area plan, Kildare County Council is committed to preparing a transport mobility management plan to support the sustainable growth of the town.  State agencies, along with my Department and, I understand, the National Transport Authority, will be active in their support of the development of such a plan which will inform future infrastructure delivery.  It is very important that we get the infrastructure right.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that Irish Water is in the process of upgrading the Leixlip wastewater treatment plant which serves Celbridge, and is also actively working to address identified constraints in the local wastewater system, in particular the upgrading of the local pumping station.  These measures will actively support the ongoing and future delivery of housing in Celbridge.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned the fund, which enables lands to be developed in a co-ordinated way.  Celbridge was successful in that respect.<\/p>  <p>  I will check the status of the communication between the Department and Kildare County Council.  The planners and officials in the Department are happy to engage with the Deputy's team in Kildare County Council to develop the lands that are set aside for development now and also to master-plan the next phase of development.  That is what we are to do, namely, to do this work in a co-ordinated way.  We will be happy to engage around that also.  The lead authority is Kildare County Council and it has been engaged in this process under its local development plan during the past year or two.  We are happy to engage and build on that in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800034#MM00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1543419000,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that positive response on progressing those lands at Hazelhatch.

The difficulty now is the infrastructure needed to get the wastewater to that.  Irish Water has carried out a number of site investigations and my understanding from working with the local authority is that it hopes to progress the start of the project some time in 2019, which would be timely because it would take some time to put together the master plan.<\/p>  <p>  The key question is how we can get the master plan done.  The key stakeholder, the landowners, are willing to carry out the master plan.  They will put in all the financial resources needed to do that but they need guidance and direction from Kildare County Council as the lead player in this.  We would not expect the local authority to do the master plan.  It would not be fair because it is not resourced.  It is under pressure doing other local area plans and dealing with planning applications for Kildare that are coming in on a regular basis.  We are not looking to the local authority to resource this work on this.  The landowners are willing to do all the resourcing of it.  They merely want to get the local authority to engage with them, bring them into a meeting  and get the process started in terms of the guidelines, being told what to do and being given a template.  Once that happens, the process will progress from that point, but Kildare County Council informs me it needs some communication from the Department to get it kick started.  As soon as that happens and all those stakeholders engage, my job, and the Minister of State&rsquo;s, is finished because they will start the discussion and the planning.  It will take whatever length of time it takes to complete it but at least it will be commenced.  The difficulty is that nothing has commenced between July and now.

I want to be clear, not just in respect of Celbridge but other parts of Kildare also, that as a Minister in the area, along with our officials, we are happy to engage with both the local authority staff but also with the councillors on other zoning issues which they want to tease out and their plans for the county in regard to Leixlip and other places.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of Celbridge, it would be important that our Department and the local authority have those conversations about the planning system.  I will certainly engage on that and if resources are required to do the planning and the master planning, that is something we can examine in conjunction, as the Deputy said, with landowners who are happy to do that as part of their duty.

It is important legislation which has garnered strong support from across all parties.  I hope we can see the Bill pass in the D&aacute;il speedily so it can become law and make a difference in our society.  The Government has spoken about its support for the core objectives of our legislation.  We are open to any amendments the Government or anybody else wishes to table to improve on the work that we have brought forward.<\/p>  <p>  Every country has a gender pay gap and in every case we have looked at, women are paid less than men.  There are comprehensive statistics from across the OECD relating to that.  That is a fact but does not mean that it is acceptable, much less inevitable.  Equal pay for equal work is a basic principle of equality and of human rights.  Ireland has made progress on this issue.  We had a massive pay gap between men and women which is shown in the statistics from the 1940s through to the 1970s.  It has gradually declined since more progressive legislation began to be introduced after we joined the European Economic Community.  It is no surprise that when there was a marriage bar in the Civil Service and public service, there was an enormous gender pay gap.  That was removed in 1973 and from that time, women's average earnings have increased.<\/p>  <p>  The latest EUROSTAT figures measure Ireland's gender pay gap at 13.9% whereas the OECD has it at 10.6%.  There are different ways to precisely measure the gender pay gap.  We have to be careful to be accurate about which measuring stick we are using and what the basis of our measurement is.  EUROSTAT measures the difference between the average gross hourly earnings of male and female employees as a percentage of male gross earnings.  The OECD measures the difference between the median average earnings of men and women relative to median earnings of men.  Most people are already lost with those statistics.  I will put it as simply as I can.  If men are paid &euro;100 on average, women doing the same job are paid &euro;86.89.  That is a much clearer and more succinct formulation.  It adds up to a very significant difference with implications not only for the lifetime of work but for pension purposes in retirement as well as income throughout a person's working life.<\/p>  <p>  The Acting Cathaoirleach will be glad to know I do not intend to discuss the ins and outs of the statistics but I want to focus on the substantive issue.  It is clear that there is still a gender pay gap which is real and manifest in our society and country.  On average, women are paid significantly less than men.  It is positive that Ireland is doing better than many countries.  It is better than the EU average and the OECD average but that is not a reason to be complacent.  A number of countries are doing much better than us, such as Belgium, Italy and Romania.  We see from statistics that gender pay equality is greater among younger employees which probably does not come as a major shock or surprise.  I am glad to say that gender pay equality is higher in the public sector than in the private sector.  The worst gender pay inequality is in financial services and the insurance industry.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of explanations for the gender pay gap.  Women and men play different roles throughout their lives with regard to rearing a family.  That is the normal reason given.  Women take time out for parenting and that often reduces women's earnings, more often than men's.  There is a difference in the professions that men and women are prevalent in.  More women are in healthcare and teaching, with fewer in engineering and finance.  There are unanswered questions too.  We do not know enough about gender pay differences in this economy.  We do not know, though we might suspect, that bonus payments to men, not least in those male-dominated professions and financial services, are greater than those received by women.  We want to know the truth and that is at the heart of this legislation.  We want to improve information about gender pay inequality so we can better understand and address the reasons for it, that would permit us, where necessary, to take remedial action to eliminate gender inequality.  We want to increase transparency about gender pay inequality throughout the economy.  That will raise public awareness on this very real, important equality issue and create pressure in society for enterprises to improve their own performance.  We do not have to look beyond, for example, the national broadcaster here or the BBC in Britain.  We had transparency and people were aghast to find women working side by side with colleagues, doing the same job and suddenly finding that there were manifest differences in the rates of pay for no explainable reason at all.<\/p>  <p>  Unequal pay for women is clearly an issue of equality and human rights, as I have said.  That is why we envisage a central role for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in our legislation.  We propose that it draws up a scheme for employers to publish their rates of pay by gender.  This will apply to medium and large employers which employ 50 or more workers.  A requirement will not be placed on the vast majority of small enterprises to comply with this legislation although we would welcome and encourage their voluntary compliance and best practice to have this sort of reporting across the economy.  In the Bill, we have specified the types of employer and employee affected by the proposed scheme alongside some minimum requirements on the type of information that we will require to be published.  This will include the difference between the average hourly rate of pay of male employees and female employees using both the arithmetic average and the median, or middle value, average.  Publication will also have to include bonus pay and refer to part-time versus full-time workers.  With regard to enforcement, we envisage fines for companies that do not meet their obligations under the legislation.  Additionally, larger employers with more than 100 workers which do not meet their obligations would have the name of their company published by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.<\/p>  <p>  This is not complex legislation.  It is not an onerous demand on employers.  There is a lot of evidence that our graduates are keenly aware of equality issues and the disparity in pay.  Many enterprises will put their equality and diversity policies front and centre to attract the best employees of whatever gender.<\/p><p>This is a positive progressive direction in which our society is moving and our legislation is designed to nudge those employers who are laggards in this regard on the path to putting their house in order.<\/p> <p> Our society offers our children and young people great opportunities.  Women and men are entering into professions that did not even exist ten or 15 years ago.  Women are excelling in science, engineering and technology in our universities and in the workplace.  Women are active in every sector of our economy, although not in equal numbers to men in every sector.  However, gender inequalities persist.  Our legislation comes down to basic questions.  Would parents want their sons and daughters to have access to any job available to the opposite gender?  Would they want them to have the same rates of pay and access to the same bonuses as any other man or woman doing the same work of the same value?  Would they want them to have the same career expectations in terms of promotion and advancement?  The Labour Party has no doubt the answer to all these questions throughout Ireland will be a resounding \"Yes\".  This is why it is important that the Bill becomes law at the first opportunity, to advance these important principles that I believe are shared throughout the House.  I ask colleagues to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800035#NN00300","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543420200,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I also ask colleagues to support the Bill.

This Bill is way ahead of other Bills as it has gone through one House of the Oireachtas already and is now being debated on Second Stage here.  I urge the Minister of State to help us bring it to fruition.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has spoken about doing its own thing on gender pay but this is an opportunity to make it happen quickly.  It certainly cannot come quickly enough for the women in the workforce who are not being paid in accordance with equality.  It is a fundamental equality issue for women in particular.

One could not possibly live in a society where one did not get equal pay for equal work and not try to fight it.  It was part of Article 141 of the European Community treaty.<\/p>  <p>  We are now at a stage where we know there is still a big gap in the mean and median hourly rates between males and females.  This is throughout the European Union, as Deputy Howlin has said.  More recently, the European Union has come out with specific recommendations.  In November 2017, the European Commission adopted an action plan to address the gender pay gap.  This includes a number of measures to be implemented in 2018 and 2019 that are focused on eight different areas.  These include improving the application of the equal pay principle, combatting segregation in occupations in sectors, breaking the ceiling with initiatives to combat vertical segregation, tackling the care penalty, better valorising women's skills, efforts and responsibilities and unveiling inequalities and stereotypes.  The other two, which are particularly pertinent to our Bill, are alerting and informing about the gender pay gap and enhancing partnerships to tackle the gender pay gap.  Clearly, the European Union has already directed European countries to take action in this area and we want to take action.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of models and our Bill is closely modelled on the UK one.  Iceland has a different approach, which is more punitive, and Germany has a different approach again.  The main point of what we want to achieve is to have transparency so women know what is going on in their company.  As Deputy Howlin said, this can be an impetus for companies to do better.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission can take action through its existing powers.  In effect, the Bill is in the context of an existing statutory regime that enables the commission to acquire information, assess compliance with employment equality law and direct steps to be taken by employers where it finds institutional inequalities.  While the Bill is primarily about information it can lead to further action to deal with the issues.  This is important and we have put the Bill in the context of the commission because of the role it plays.<\/p>  <p>  I know there are other views on how we might do this and, as Deputy Howlin said, we are open to any amendments the Government or others wish to propose but we want to see this happen.  As well as addressing the median and mean pay gap between men and women, we also want the Bill to address issues on bonuses.  Often the advantage that male employees have, particularly at upper echelons, is the bonuses they get so we have included bonuses.  We have also included part-time work in the scheme.  The scheme also requires the breakdown of information by reference to the full-time or part-time status of employees and by reference to their age.  In many cases, women work part time.<\/p>  <p>  In some ways it is not covered under our legislation but it is statistically true that women tend to be in lower paid employment in general.  Areas such as childcare are predominantly female and are atrociously badly paid considering the work childcare workers do and the significantly high qualifications most of them have.   Care generally is not well paid.  There are also the hospitality, retail and cleaning sectors, to which I particularly point with regard to women.  Unfortunately, because cleaning is often contracted it might not even be captured by a company's overall employment and pay status in terms of men and women.  This is something we really need to tackle.  There are a number of elements to the fact women in society do not have the same pay status as men.  There is also the point made by Deputy Howlin on the positions women go into.  As the workforce is changing this is also changing and it is to be welcomed.  Statistics show that only approximately 19% of senior roles are held by women.  It is slightly better in the State sector.  All parties here are conscious of the importance of having gender balance on State boards.  More recently, we have seen academic imbalance highlighted and people have pointed to these issues in the arts, entertainment and communications sectors.<\/p>  <p>  These are all very important issues in the equality agenda.  Many years ago we got equal pay for equal work but we do not have equality.  Very often, women's childbirth role and the fact they take time out, particularly after childbirth, mean that in many cases there is an unconscious bias against women in the workplace, particularly women of childbearing age.  Employers are wary of time that will be taken off.  This needs to be addressed because it is a role that cannot be avoided if we are to have a next generation.  It must be included in the culture of the workplace.  What we want to achieve here, as well as having very specific pieces of information put into the public arena to change behaviour and, perhaps, force changed behaviour through the commission, is to change culture.  It is good for any workplace to have this type of gender balance.  It is not good for any sector of employment to be predominantly male or predominantly female.  I hope we will achieve this type of change in society.<\/p>  <p>  One of the statistics that comes out of the figures we have, and Ireland is at approximately 14%, is that women effectively work for free for one month a year, if we compare it with the average pay of men.  Nobody can stand over this.  There are reasons some countries have a much better achievement.  In many cases it is because they have legislation of one type or another and because they have already implemented legislation such as the Bill that has changed behaviour.  We specifically refer to larger companies that have 50 or more employees.  The Government may have a view as to this figure.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>We believe it is the appropriate figure, and we are supported by many organisations in that belief.  If that information is in the public arena, it will force change.  It will also mean that women will have access to information they do not have at present.  The data show that in many cases women who are applying for employment are offered lower wages because it is expected that they might accept them in a way that perhaps a man would not.  We want to tackle that and the way we propose to do so is by having information in the public domain to change behaviour.<\/p> <p> We urge the Members from other parties to support this legislation.  It has reached this House of the Oireachtas and it should not take too long to be passed if it receives the support of other parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800036#OO00400","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543420800,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill 2017 which was introduced by the Labour Party in the Seanad and has been passed by that House.  The fundamental aim of this Bill, which is to address the gender pay gap, is fully in line with Government policy as expressed in the programme for a partnership Government and in the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020, with which not everybody is familiar.  For that reason the Government has chosen not to oppose this Private Members' Bill in either House.  We believe the debate is important and worthwhile.<\/p>  <p>  That said, we differ on the mechanism to address the gender pay gap.  The Bill predates the publication of the Government's proposals.  We took the opportunity to engage with stakeholders, including employer and employee representative groups, in drafting our proposals.  In particular, I thank the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development for their valuable input.  We examined the possibility of bringing forward amendments to this Bill but our legal advice is that such an approach would be excessively cumbersome and that it would be much more straightforward to bring forward a new Bill.  Having secured the Government's approval for the heads of the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill, we published the legislation on 26 June and invited the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to submit its views as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, as we are required to do.  Regrettably, we have not yet received the report of the committee.  I am anxious to consider any views the committee may have and to endeavour to incorporate them into the Government's proposals.  I am also anxious to move forward with the Government's Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill before us proposes to amend the legislation establishing the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, by assigning to the latter powers to make mandatory gender pay gap information disclosure schemes.  Under such schemes, specified categories of employers would be required to compile and publish information relating to differences in the pay of their male and female employees.  Schemes would not apply to employers with fewer than 50 employees.  Contravention by an employer of the provisions of a scheme would be an offence.  I am advised that the latter provision could mean that under Article 17.2 of the Constitution and Standing Order 179 a money message from the Government will be needed before Committee Stage of the Bill can be taken.  A decision on whether such a message is needed is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle and the Bills Office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800037#PP00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1543420800,"counter":401,"content":"<p>A pre-emptive strike.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800037#PP00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1543420800,"counter":402,"content":"<p>The principle of equal pay for women and men for equal work or work of equal value has been part of Irish law for almost 45 years and is part of everyone's contract of employment.  The gender pay gap is somewhat different in that it is the difference between the average gross hourly pay of female and male employees.  Not respecting the principle of equal pay is likely to be a contributory factor to the gender pay gap, but there are a number of other causes as well.  Among the factors which interact in creating the pay gap a number have an obvious gender dimension.  I refer to traditional role models, gender segregation in education and in the labour market, the challenges of balancing work and family life, the difference in participation of men and women in family responsibilities, the availability of quality, affordable childcare facilities and out-of-school hours care and processes within organisations where imbalance needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  To put the situation in Ireland in a broader context, it should be noted that, according to statistics from 2014, Ireland has a gender pay gap below the EU average.  It is 13.9% here and 16.7% in the EU.  However, our gender pay gap has shown no longer-term tendency to decline and, therefore, must be the focus of specific action.  Pay transparency as provided for in this Bill and in the Government's proposals is one such measure and, in recognition of that, the Government does not oppose this Bill.  Indeed, the gender pay gap is the subject of a number of actions in the programme for partnership Government.  Measures committed to include increasing investment in childcare and reviewing the lower pay of women and gender inequality in senior appointments.  To that end we have established a strategy for the private sector called Better Balance for Better Business.  It is part of the national strategy for women and girls which was published in 2017.  One of the actions in the strategy is to carry out an independent review of corporate boards in Ireland focusing initially on Irish Stock Exchange companies.  That will report to the Government in the first quarter of next year.  It will also cover gender differences in the senior management of companies, as mentioned by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan earlier.<\/p>  <p>  We are all agreed that it is important to approach this from a number of different angles.  Having women in senior management at board level is an incentive and support to other women and girls to move up the line and take up such positions.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan was right to refer to diversity in companies.  Many companies are recognising and valuing this now.  When there is diversity in companies, it helps everybody.  Ultimately, it helps with the bottom line.  The companies are happier places in which to work and people are valued for their diverse ways.  Many companies are beginning to realise that now but we must help them with that.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is active on all of these issues.  The programme states that we will also seek to promote wage transparency by requiring companies with 50 employees and more to complete a wage survey.  These commitments are reflected in the actions in the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020.  Action 1.22 of the strategy states that we will initiate dialogue between key stakeholders, unions and employers aimed at addressing the gender pay gap, and develop and promote practical information resources to explain and increase understanding of the multifaceted aspects of the gender pay gap and its causes.  Practical tools will be developed to assist employers in calculating the gender pay gap within their organisations.  Clearly, this is an action which must be addressed before legislation such this Bill or the Bill the Government is preparing comes into effect.  Action 1.23 of the strategy pledges to promote wage transparency by requiring companies with 50 or more employees to complete a wage survey periodically and report the results.  This is, of course, the subject matter of the Bill before us.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has concerns with the specific approach proposed in the Bill, and I will outline some of these.  The Bill provides for the insertion of a new section 32A in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  Subsection (1) provides for the making of a scheme by IHREC.  As set out in the subsection, the exercise of any authority or power to make a scheme would be at the sole discretion of IHREC.  There is no provision under which the Minister may require or request IHREC to make a scheme.  As such, there is no provision whereby enactment of this legislation is guaranteed to result in the introduction of wage surveys as promised in the programme for a partnership Government.  We must bear in mind and respect that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is independent under the Paris Principles.  As subsection (1) is phrased, approval of the Minister is not required for any scheme.<\/p>  <p>  While IHREC has undoubted expertise in this area, it would be appropriate that powers are subject to the control of the Minister, as is the case under section 31 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 whereby codes of practice can be prepared by IHREC for submission to the Minister and the Minister may, by order, approve them.  There is no similar mechanism in the Bill so it is very much out of line with the principal Act.  In effect, it gives a quasi-legislative power to IHREC with no mechanism for oversight or control.  The Bill provides not just for the publication of the overall gender pay gap figure for an employer but for disaggregation of this figure by reference to bonus pay, full-time or part-time status and the ages of employees.  In this context, we must bear in mind the data protection aspects and my Department is consulting the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner on the Government's Bill to ensure that it respects the general data protection regulation, GDPR.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, the Government wants to legislate in this area.  Our proposals have been with the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality since 5 July last.  Our proposals are informed by the debate around this Bill in the Seanad.  Indeed, I wish to acknowledge the great work of Senator Bacik on the Bill.  She continues to make a significant contribution to advancing gender equality.<\/p><p>Our proposals are also shaped and informed by our consultations with employer and employee stakeholders.  The debate in the House this evening will be of considerable value as will the report from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, when we receive it.  I hope that Members would appreciate the value of the considered approach taken by Government in respect of this legislation.  I look forward to hearing the views of other Members in the House this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800037#PP00400","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543421400,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I will be sharing my time with some colleagues, and I am pleased to say that I will be sharing the time equally with them.  I welcome the Labour Party Bill before the House this evening.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that for centuries women in Ireland, and women throughout the world, have been discriminated against.  Not only have they been treated as second-class citizens they have been deprived of some of the basic rights that men took for granted for centuries.  This year we celebrate the centenary of women getting the vote in 1918, which was a significant event.  It is also important to recall that there was significant opposition to that.  It was not always the case that the path of women's suffrage and rights for women was supported by the political establishment.  Some of the biggest opponents of giving women the right to vote prior to 1918 were members of the Irish Parliamentary Party, and it was not only John Redmond.  Sir Edward Carson, as a member of the Irish Unionist Alliance, was also vigorously opposed to giving women the right to vote.  Some Irish MPs were different in that they supported universal suffrage but the political establishment prior to 1918 was very much opposed to women getting the vote.<\/p>  <p>  When the Irish Free State was established the marriage bar was introduced in 1932.  This prevented women from working in the Civil Service upon marriage.  This affected many women, mothers of many of us no doubt, who had to give up their jobs once they married.  We only got rid of this measure in 1973.  Legislation that was prompted to a large extent by the European Economic Community, as the EU was known, gradually resulted in greater rights being given to women in the workplace.  In 1977 the Employment Equality Act was introduced.  This important legislation was introduced by another member of the Labour Party, the former T&aacute;naiste, Michael O'Leary, a man who appears to have been airbrushed out of Irish history but who played a significant role in improving the path for the equality of women in the workplace.  Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the Employment Equality Act 1998, which ensured that equality on the basis of gender was upheld in the workplace.  That was also a significant piece of work and a significant achievement.<\/p>  <p>  Today, unfortunately, we still have not attained full equality for women in the workplace.  The statistics reveal that currently there is a gender pay gap.  I note the Minister of State's comments on the causes of that, but it is not necessarily the case that the reason for the gender pay gap is that the laws, be they the Employment Equality Acts of 1977 or 1998, are being breached.  The fact of the matter is that the pay gap exists and the Oireachtas has to do something in respect of that.  We are in the fortunate position where the public sector has led the way for many years in this.  There is no suggestion or contemplation that any Member of this House who is man should be paid more than a female Deputy.  This also applies throughout the public sector and the Civil Service.  The problem appears to lie significantly in the private sector.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is very useful in trying to deal with a complex problem.  One of the first stands that must be made in order to deal with a problem is to disclose the problem.  If companies over a certain size are required to publish information in respect of the gender pay gap, then it focuses attention on the issue.  Once attention is focused on the issue then we can start to resolve it and it will become a more obvious requirement for companies to ensure they do not have a significant gender pay gap.<\/p>  <p>  The gender pay gap that is being statistically examined in the State is at present around 14%.  We also note that the problem appears most significant at the higher end of the workforce.  This question really needs to be examined closely, and answered.  We should not permit a situation to develop where there is any breach in respect of the amounts that women are paid compared to men at the higher levels or the lower levels.<\/p>  <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague, Deputy O'Loughlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800038#QQ00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1543421400,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I commend the Labour Party on introducing the Bill, and I thank Senator Bacik for all the work she has done on this in the Seanad.  I also commend my colleague, Senator Clifford-Lee, and Sonya Lennon of the WorkEqual campaign.  They have done a huge piece of work on bringing this issue to the businesses that we need to talk about.  There is no point in us talking about this in the D&aacute;il Chamber or our colleagues talking about it in the Seanad Chamber; we need businesses to take it on board, to stop talking about it and to put practical realities into action.<\/p>  <p>  Equal pay for equal work has to be the cornerstone of any just and fair society.  While we talk about this I am very conscious of the pay disparity that exists for those workers who started working after a particular year, especially between teachers.  That is also absolutely wrong.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most worrying aspects of recent research into the gender pay gap is the fact the gap is now widening for younger women when it absolutely should be narrowing at this stage.  Progress is being made in other areas of gender equality but not, it would seem, in terms of pay.  This is why Government intervention is essential.  The strategies, consultations, reviews and symposiums have not worked.  The Government must support this Bill.  I am aware that the Minister of State has said the Government will not oppose it, but the Government should be supporting the Bill and not be neutral on it.  The Bill is an important step towards pay equality.  The Bill proposes legislation that will compel an employer with more than 50 staff to publish information on its employees' pay, a measure that already exists in the UK and Australia.  The legislation needs to be supported by improved childcare provision, improved shared parental leave, as proposed in the legislation brought forward by myself and Deputy Lisa Chambers, and by increasing the number of women in better-paid roles and occupations.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill has been described as a diagnostic rather than a curative measure.  To solve the problem, however, we first need to gather all the necessary information to assist in public policy formation.  This information can then be used by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Ireland continues to hold a ranking of\u00a025th place on an international league table of overall female economic empowerment.  Our latest figures say that the gender pay gap is 13.9%.  As Deputy Broughan said, women are working for free for one month in the year.  Our boardrooms have an 18% female participation rate compared to 22% in the UK and 34% in France.  As usual, the Nordic countries are leading the way.  Progress has been excruciatingly slow in addressing the pay gap and the lack of gender diversity on boards.  Ireland is one of the worst performers in Europe for gender balance on corporate boards.  Half of all State boards are still failing to meet the 45% minimum target set in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Young Irish women are constantly reading news stories about their favourite actors, musicians and celebrities fighting for equal pay in the worlds of music and film.  It is good that people are being upfront and out there about their fight.  As their representatives, we have to try to ensure parity of pay for young women here in their own country.  Great strides have been made to improve economic independence for women in Ireland in recent decades.  Bold and progressive policy changes were needed to achieve this.  The same approach should be taken to address the gender pay gap.  We would not accept different rates of pay on any other basis.  If two people are doing the same job with the same level of experience then they should be on the same salary.<\/p><p>It is deeply disturbing that as women progress in their careers and gain experience, their earning power drops to such a level that they earn 28% less than their male counterparts after 15 years.  Shocking research from the UK shows that Ryanair is in the top ten of those with the worst gender pay gap.  I am happy to join my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, and lead in this area in saying that Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Bill in an effort to progress the glacial pace at which pay equality is proceeding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800038#QQ00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543422000,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak in support of the Bill.  Like colleagues, I pay tribute to the Labour Party for bringing it forward.  I also pay tribute Deputies O'Loughlin, Lisa Chambers and O'Callaghan who are doing extraordinarily good work in this regard, particularly in respect of a Bill they brought forward recently.  I also commend Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee on her efforts to make improvements in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Although we have had equal pay legislation on the Statute Book for more than 40 years, we still have a significant problem regarding the gender pay gap.  The available statistical information has long shown that progression, if it takes place at all, is excruciatingly slow.  It is high time that real action was taken and that we resolved this situation once and for all.  The most up-to-date statistics from the CSO show that, on average, women are paid 14% less than men.  As Deputy O'Loughlin has pointed out, that would correspond to women working one month in the year for free.  While it is in some way understandable that the pay gap is widest for older employees, it is worrying that statistics suggest the gap is now widening for younger women too.  While we have been making progress in so many areas on gender equality, it is extraordinary to think that this remains the case.  It should not be happening.  It is clear from the lack of progression in the area that the only way the gender pay gap can be addressed is through Government intervention.  While I welcome the comments of the Minister of State this evening, I urge him and the Government to do everything in their power to come to terms with this issue.  As my colleague stated, there have been many national strategies, public consultations, reviews and symposia on the pay gap issue.  However, there seems to be very little movement at all on getting something concrete done.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il introduced a Bill in July that would allow the mother of a newborn child to share her maternity benefit entitlements with the child's other parent, if she so wishes.  Our party believes this is an important move towards broadening parental choice, promoting gender equality and supporting a healthy work-life balance.  It is relatively unusual within Europe that parents cannot share leave.  For example, in Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, the United Kingdom, Norway and Germany, there are provisions for parents to share maternity leave allocations.  A woman may wish to share her maternity leave with the child's other parent for a variety of reasons.  Certain jobs are more amenable to periods of leave.  A person at an established company may find it easier to take leave than a self-employed person.  Certain women may wish to re-enter the workforce earlier.  We believe that this should be for a woman to decide.  Parental leave policies that support fathers' involvement are a powerful policy tool to tackle gender inequality.<\/p>  <p>  In the EU, the gender pay gap is shown as a percentage of men's hourly earnings.  It does not take into account all of the factors that contribute to the gap such as, for example, differences in education, labour market experience, hours worked, the type of job and many other factors.  The Department of Justice and Equality states that the gender pay gap in Ireland was 17.3% in 2007.  According to the most recent figures published by EUROSTAT, in 2014 the gender pay gap in Ireland was 13.9% while the gender pay gap across the EU overall was 16.7%.  However, a report published by PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, in February 2017 indicated that the gender pay gap in Ireland has widened over the last five years.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800039#RR00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1543422000,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I am happy to work with my colleagues in the Labour Party in supporting this Bill.  In recent weeks, we have worked together on other legislation in the same vein in order to try to advance women's equality, address the stark inequalities that exist in our society and do our job as legislators in trying to bridge that gap.  Where we see failings in legislation, we seek to make changes.  That is what this Bill certainly seeks to do.<\/p>  <p>  This is a very practical Bill in that it requires employers with more than 50 employees to publish information about their pay scales in order that we can see if there are any differences in how they pay their male and female employees.  It is quite simple information but it would be very effective in making changes.  It would also allow the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to create an information disclosure scheme for employers about a gender pay gap if one exists in an organisation.  Some organisations will welcome this - those that are doing a good job - while others might not.  That level of discomfort is something we need in working towards our goal.  These provisions will allow employers to benchmark against their competitors and should act as an incentive to do better, because companies need to do better.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will also allow prospective employees to look at employers and decide which are best to work for, which actually value equality and which will treat them properly and equally.  The fact is that in late 2018, we are looking at a 14% gender pay gap.  Women in this country are being paid 14% less than men and the gap is widening.  As Deputy Jan O'Sullivan pointed out, this effectively means that from 10 November each year, women stop being paid.  That is unacceptable and wrong and there should be a sense of urgency in addressing it.  We have to address the underlying reasons that the pay gap exists in the first instance.  There are many such reasons.  The fact remains that the pay gap is wrong.  If employers know they are paying their female employees less, they should be taken to task.  They should be forced to publish that information and they should be forced to close the gap completely.<\/p>  <p>  Given that women are still the primary caregivers, are required to take maternity leave and are ones who will have absences from work, it is no surprise  that they are discriminated against.  A Bill that Deputy O'Loughlin and I published not long ago was not supported by Government but was supported by the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Social Democrats, and the Green Party.  Basically, the entire Opposition supported the Bill but the Government opposed it.  That Bill would have allowed women to share their maternity leave entitlements with their partner if they so chose.  The effect would have been twofold.  It would have given flexibility to women to get back into the workplace quicker if they wanted.  It would also have levelled the playing field in the sense that when people were going for a job the employer might look at the female candidate and the male candidate and think that actually either of them might take maternity or parental leave.  That level of discrimination would have lessened.  However, the Government decided not to support the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  When listening to the Minister of State's response as to why he is not supporting the Bill, I have to say I think many of us were smirking at the true intention behind why it is not being supported.  To say that he has examined the possibility of bringing forward amendments and that it was just too cumbersome suggests it is just inconvenient, and that really the Labour Party beat Fine Gael to it.  Is that not the real reason?  The Labour Party got there ahead of Fine Gael.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800039#RR00300","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1543422000,"counter":409,"content":"<p>No.  We are waiting for the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800039#RR00400","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1543422000,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Fine Gael has published the heads of a Bill-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800039#RR00500","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1543422000,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Last July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800039#RR00600","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1543422000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>Only the heads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800039#RR00700","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1543422000,"counter":413,"content":"<p>-----but the lack of urgency is notable.

We are very happy to support the Bill and we hope to see it pass as soon as possible.  The fight to ensure pay equality is another step in the battle to ensure equality between women and men.  Deputy O'Callaghan made reference to the distance travelled and it includes battles such as the fight to win universal suffrage - the vote essentially - a century ago; the fight against the marriage bar; in very recent times the fight to repeal the eighth amendment that caused so much harm and suffering to women over more than 30 years; and indeed now this fight for equal pay.<\/p>  <p>  It is a relevant issue across the world, perhaps starker in other parts of the world than here.  According to the World Economic Forum it would take 217 years to close the economic gender gap globally.  However, it is also quite significant in Ireland.  With a gap of 13.9% it would take 55 years to close the gender pay gap in this jurisdiction if we were to continue as things are.  This is a mechanism that has been introduced in other jurisdictions.  Britain has gender pay gap reporting and similar proposals have been implemented in other EU countries and in the United States.  Measures similar to the ones proposed are due to be signed off in the North in the coming months.  We welcome these moves.  They are not a silver bullet, as I am sure the Bill's proposers would agree, and many other issues need to be addressed.  It is right to shine a light particularly on those businesses that might be fearful of the Bill's provisions where there is a significant pay difference - inexplicable in many circumstances.  It is a way to bring pressure to bear.<\/p>  <p>  I am mystified at the Government's attitude.  It is very common to see Government Bills where the Government introduces on Committee or Report Stage practically an entirely new Bill.  It is unusual and very positive to see a Private Members' Bill pass through all stages in the Seanad and arrive into the D&aacute;il.  That is a sign of the support for it and the consensus not only in here but in society as a whole.  The Government should work with that.  The framework of the Bill is good enough and I do not know why the Government is starting with another Bill.  It should work with this Bill and we should advance it.<\/p>  <p>  I was pleased that a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment proposed in the Seanad was accepted.  This ensures that where a company does not comply with the legislation by refusing to publish data, the company's title would be published by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  It is positive that that was accepted.  Publicity will be as powerful as any fines in this.  There is a role for fines, but the focus needs to be on shining a light and putting pressure on those companies that are discriminating.<\/p>  <p>  Many other issues need to be addressed in tackling the gender pay gap.  Reporting of this kind will not of itself address the overall gender pay gap.  It will not capture large childcare providers which may not have a large gap between male and female employees, but the majority of them are likely to be female and the majority of them are likely to be low paid.  Throughout society in low-paid work women predominate.  Therefore, we need to take other steps to address that and ensure the playing field is levelled and people have greater flexibility with leave.  I commend the Bills introduced by Deputy Lisa Chambers and Senator Clifford-Lee in that regard.  Much more needs to be done on that and on the social welfare side as well.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill.  There is a good framework here to deal with an issue that is important for society.  The Minister of State should work with it rather than try to work in a different direction at the same time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800040#SS00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1543422600,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I also commend Senator Bacik on introducing this important legislation.  As my colleague stated, we will support the Bill.  Indeed, we share the frustration of the Labour Party with Government foot-dragging on the issue.  The gender pay gap is not a new issue.  A multitude of research has been undertaken across the EU and in Ireland on the subject.  Back in 2002 the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform commissioned Indecon to undertake a study on male-female wage differentials in a number of sectors.  So accepted is the fact of the gender pay gap that the EU has an annual European Equal Pay Day to highlight the gap which we all know now stands at just under 14%.<\/p>  <p>  With all this in mind, why on earth is the Government frustrating the introduction of gender pay gap reporting in Ireland?  When this legislation was first introduced 17 months ago, the Minister of State with responsibility for equality acknowledged that the Bill echoed current programme for Government commitments.  However, despite this, the Government failed to engage and dragged its heels before finally producing its own heads of Bill more than a year later.<\/p>  <p>  In justifying this decision, the Taoiseach told us last week that a new Bill was necessary as changes were needed to the Long Title and Short Title.  That is simply not credible, nor is the Minister of State's concern with the new section 32A.  His concern seems to be that oversight and initiative are robbed from the Minister and that it falls to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  I am very happy to see such a change.  We have waited so long and the political establishment and the Government have been in such a state of splendid inertia on this issue, I am very happy for a commission with responsibility for human rights and equality to set the pace on this.  God knows, if we were waiting for the Government we would be waiting a very long time.  Irish women and Irish society are no longer prepared to wait.<\/p>  <p>  It is not just about the reporting of gender pay differentials.  We need to be honest about this and look at low-paid sectors in our economy.  We need to be honest about this and look at cost of living.  We need to be honest and say we need to do so much more, including the introduction of a living wage and rent caps.  We need market interventions.  For today, we support this legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is a reasonable person and I do not question his good faith on these matters.  I appeal to him; for God's sake let us stop the delay.

We have introduced many Bills to improve workers' rights and Fianna F&aacute;il did not support them for exactly the same reason.  That party seems to support the softer Bills but not Bills that make a real and tangible difference.

Even though it seems that women tend to be more highly educated and qualified than men, that is not translating into earning power.<\/p> <p> It is obvious from all the data and the figures which have been presented by the Labour Party spokespeople, my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues and the Fianna F&aacute;il Teachta&iacute; also that there is a problem.  Not enough is being done.  This Bill would go some way to at least identifying the problem and I do not see why the Minister of State's Government is not in a position to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800040#SS00700","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543423200,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this very important issue.  The PwC index is very interesting where it shows that the level of inequality - 14% less pay for women than men - is up from the figure in 2014 when it was 12%.  It is 18% in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.  An interesting comparison is that Iceland has had equal pay for the genders since 1961 - 57 years of neutral pay rates.  Interestingly, it is not a member of this great European Union - the great club - that is supposed to have brought women equal pay in the first place, an argument I have often refuted, and the statistics are before us in terms of Ireland, Britain and the rest of Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Self-professed experts often say there is no such thing as a pay gap and that it is a fiction.  They argue that differences in pay for the same work is illegal, that we have equal pay legislation across the European Union so how can there be a gender pay gap.  The reality is that some employers will brazenly break the law.  However, much of that gap is structural because women end up in the jobs and professions that are overwhelmingly female and overwhelmingly undervalued by this society.  It is not incidental that happens.  It is because of the structured attitude of society to the sort of work women do, such as cleaning, caring, maintenance and hands-on work that is undervalued in comparison to the muscular, more physical sector in which men generally work.  <\/p>  <p>  I believe that gap worsened during the years of austerity under the measures the proposers of the Bill brought in.  For example, the Labour Party, in government with Fine Gael, enforced legislation on workers' rights, the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation, of which we are still feeling the impact, where workers in this House and across the public sector, both men and women, earn 10% less than people they work alongside.  It is one of the reasons teachers and nurses are threatening strike.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800041#TT00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1543423200,"counter":429,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il did that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800041#TT00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1543423200,"counter":430,"content":"<p>It is also the case that during those austerity years pensions were cut for women.  Services like home help and special needs assistance, SNA, were cut, again jobs largely done by women.  Their levels and their pay were cut.  The legacy of austerity also looms large here.  It is good to document these things but they will not go away until we set out to improve our industrial relations machinery, which barely recognises the existing legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I note that the provisions in the Minister of State's proposed Bill argue for personnel from the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to conduct on-site inspections to ensure compliance on gender information, but there is a problem.  We recently attended a committee on bogus self-employment with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty.  From questioning the Department we were able to show that when inspectors go on-site to check the statistics on bogus self-employment, they do not actually do it.  They do not keep statistics on bogus self-employment.  We have industrial relations machinery that is not fit for purpose.  It is certainly not fit for purpose in terms of keeping track of inequality that exists between men and women on the one hand and the same workers in the same sectors on the other because of the austerity.<\/p>  <p>  We have had a plethora of strikes recently including Lloyds Pharmacy, Dunnes Stores, Tesco, teachers and nurses, of which the workforce is largely female.  Those strikes in the private sector in particular are often based on the lack of a permanent secure job, precarious work, the lack of contracts and issues of inequality.  I am glad to say all those strikes took place because the workers were unionised.  From that we should learn that as well as producing papers that record inequality in a particular manner, we have to end the impact of austerity and the inequality.  However, we also must ensure that in every workplace we do as much as we possibly can to get workers into unions, and get them mobilised through those unions, to achieve their rights.<\/p>  <p>  In April of this year, it was revealed that Ryanair pay women on average 72% less than men in terms of mean hourly pay.  That means for every &euro;1 a man earns, a woman earns 28 cent.  Ryanair said that eight of the 555 pilots in the UK are women.  That is equivalent to 1.4% of all pilots.  The inequality is impounded by companies in which unions do not exist.  I greatly welcome the unionisation earlier this year of Ryanair and that the company, given those unequal statistics as well as its record, was forced to recognise the trade unions, which hopefully will be able to do something to close that gender pay gap.  We all know the reason for that is the nature of the work women largely do in the airline such as ground staff and crew as against the number of women being trained as pilots.<\/p>  <p>  We can safely say the gender pay gap in Ireland is probably the worst in the EU.  We should stop eulogising the European Union as some kind of deliverer of rights for women or advances in terms of equality because that is not the case.  Where women have fought and won equality in pay and in status in their jobs, which was mentioned by Deputies earlier in terms of fighting for same sex marriage, the repeal of the eighth amendment on abortion rights and proper childcare, that was done by women campaigning both through their unions and outside the gates of this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800041#TT00400","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1543423200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>And men.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800041#TT00500","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1543423200,"counter":432,"content":"<p>There is a good deal of work to be done, and I welcome a Bill that attempts to begin to document what is required in that work, but there was a level of tongue and cheek in the way the Labour Party approached this issue, given its record when it was recently in government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800041#TT00600","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1543423200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Check the facts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800041#TT00700","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1543423200,"counter":434,"content":"<p>That is a complete falsehood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800041#TT00800","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1543423200,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to talk about this Bill.  It is very important because for far too long women have been treated unfairly.  The further back we go, the worse it was for women.  It is only right that where women are doing the same work as men, they should be paid the same.  That inequality has existed for far too long, and I am glad to have the opportunity to support the Labour Party for bringing forward this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  We must recognise that women have played a very important role in all our lives.  We would not be here if it were not for women.  In the past, women worked inside and outside the home.  They kept the home going but were hardly ever remunerated.  My grandmother's husband was invalided from early in their marriage.<\/p><p>She had to work outside and do all the work to cut turf for sale.  I am so agitated when I hear people suggesting people should not cut turf because I know what she and that generation went through to survive.  It must be recognised and made possible that women be paid the same as men.  There are many inequalities in our system, even now.  Young teachers are not paid the same as teachers used to be or as teachers who work alongside them and were qualified earlier.  It is wrong, degrading and frustrating for young teachers who spend five or six years in college but end up working for much less than people who entered the workforce before them.  <\/p> <p> Likewise, nurses on the front line do vital work.  It is no wonder that many of our young graduates emigrate and take up employment in other countries because it is not fair or right that nurses are not remunerated for the hard work they do in caring for sick people to the same degree as the people who entered the workforce before them.  They must work so much harder because of all the paperwork, liability and pressure that is put on them.  They must work long hours and it is not right that they are not paid the same as the other nurses.  <\/p> <p> I am sorry to say that the Labour Party played a role in this issue by what it did to women in the home whose pension entitlement was changed.  We are only now starting to address that but it was wrong and unfortunate.  I met so many women who were not going to receive the same pension and they were so hurt because they felt they had paid their contributions but, as the playing pitch was changed, they would not get the same pension that other women received, and would continue to receive, alongside them.  As these women came of pension age in only 2012, they were subject to the new regulation and it hurt them badly.  I am glad this matter will start to be addressed in the coming year.<\/p> <p> As I said at the outset, women, whether they be wives, daughters or mothers, play such an important part in the running of our country and homes.  We must ensure that they are treated the same and that they receive the same remuneration for the same work as men.  It is great that the Bill acknowledges the great work that women and girls around the country do on behalf of men and their country.  They are as proud of our country as anyone else and they have played such an important role, not least in past times of trouble when they cared for men.  Circumstances must change and we must move on and ensure women are treated properly.  I am 100% in support of the Bill and I hope it is brought to a conclusion as soon as possible.  This situation has gone on for too long and it needs to be corrected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800041#TT00900","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543423800,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of French Delegation","time":1543423800,"counter":438,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800042#UU00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1543423800,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Before proceeding with business, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Members, I welcome to the D&aacute;il and offer a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to a parliamentary delegation from the Assembl&eacute;e Nationale in France, comprising members of the Ireland-France parliamentary friendship group, led by Monsieur Paul Molac.

I am delighted to support the Bill and I commend the ongoing work of Senator Bacik, who has long been a champion of women's rights, on introducing it.<\/p>  <p>  While there has been much change in society over the past few decades and many barriers to gender equality have been broken down, this does not mean we can afford to be complacent.  Structural and cultural issues that prevent true gender equality remain and they must be overcome through positive measures such as the Bill.   It has been more than 40 years since Ireland introduced the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act and yet the most recent CSO figures show that, on average, women in this country are paid 14% less than men.  There are many complex reasons such a difference persists, despite laws to prevent gender pay discrimination.  Fortunately, overt discrimination has become less frequent, but there continues to be significant gender segregation by occupation and the undervaluing of occupations in sectors that are predominantly female.  <\/p>  <p>  Gender equality, like all matters of equality, cannot be achieved by passive acts.  It must be won through positive action.  We can write the words on paper and pass laws calling for an end to discrimination but without active enforcement, follow-up, research and work, we cannot overcome the more subtle problems.  The Bill will work to tackle these subtleties through the collection of data.  Detail will show us exactly where problems lie and inform us how we must tackle them.  In particular, I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s call for companies with more than 50 employees to publish information on the proportion of male and female employees in the lower, lower middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands.  There are many organisations where, while men and women on the same band are paid equally, women comprise the majority of the lower pay levels and men the majority of the upper pay levels.  Last year we learned this was the case for Departments, where women fail to break through to upper and managerial levels.  With data we can learn how systemic this is and develop the policies and supports necessary to address it. <\/p>  <p>  Ending the pay gap will not only be beneficial for women; rather, it will be beneficial to the economy at large.  PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that cutting the pay gap could boost OECD economies by &euro;4.9 trillion.  I hope the measures outlined in this Bill will be extended to cover companies and enterprises with fewer than 50 employees and ensure that areas with precarious employment, in which women are more likely to be employed than men, are monitored and assessed for gender biases.<\/p>  <p>  There is much more work to be done to value women&rsquo;s work across all sectors and advance gender equality, which is a priority of the Oireachtas women's parliamentary caucus.  Senator Bacik&rsquo;s Bill will make a significant positive impact in addressing gender pay issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800042#UU00700","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1543423800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I strongly support the Bill.

I understand that she met the Minister and his officials to see how they could work together to progress the most legally sound Bill.

In Iceland, however, the figure is 25 so the legislation there applies to even smaller companies.  I agree with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland that this should be reduced further but at least it would cover far more companies than provided for in the original Government Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill includes a number of new provisions.  The new section 32A(4) sets out the type of information to be published including the differences in mean hourly rates, median hourly rates, bonuses, etc.  The new section 32A(5) provides for the status of employees to also be included in the breakdown referencing the ages of employees and whether they are full-time or part-time.  This will be particularly interesting given the over-representation of women in part-time employment, and in the huge and growing precariat, and also given the increasing use of if-and-when contracts.  The new section 32A(6) provides for the imposition of a class A fine on conviction if these provisions are contravened.  The new section 32A(7) provides for the publication of the name of the employer of at least 100 staff who contravenes provisions but I am not sure why there is a difference here for employers with between 50 to 99 staff.  Why are all eligible employers also not liable to be publicly named if they are not complying with law?  Why make a difference between the size of the companies in this respect?<\/p>  <p>  I recently spoke on the excellent Report on Gender Budgeting produced by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I am a member.  That report was worked extensively on by the Parliamentary Budget Office.  Examining gender and equality budgeting has been a big part of the committee&rsquo;s remit.  We have heard from many distinguished stakeholders on the topic, including the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, Members of the Scottish parliament, IHREC, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association.  We had hoped that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, would produce a gender budgeting report alongside budget 2019, which was one of the committee's fundamental recommendations.  Hopefully, this will happen in future along with green budgeting.  Six pilot projects on equality budgeting are being undertaken by the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Children and Youth Affairs, Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Education and Skills and Health.  Just under &euro;2 million has been spent on these programmes, which include initiatives such as requiring more apprenticeships to be available to young women.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office produced research on historical earnings in the period 1938 to 2015.  That research included an earnings by gender section.  Between 1942 and 2007, female industrial workers earned less weekly than their male colleagues.  The weekly difference in earnings was &euro;79 in 1942 and this jumped to &euro;215 in 2007 but the actual percentage gap reduced from 50% in 1942 to 31% in 2007.  In 2014, the gap for industrial workers was 22.6%.  Earlier this year, a marketing agency, Alternatives, released the results of a survey it carried out which showed that in the marketing and advertising sectors men are more likely to receive a higher wage and additional non-salary benefits.  As Deputy Catherine Martin noted, that is the case in many professions across the public and private sectors.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, when Ireland was reviewed by the UN for compliance with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, IHREC reported on the 14% gender pay gap, the 38% gender pension gap and the prevalence of women in lower paid jobs.  We know from that report and our own evidence that it is working lone parents who are more likely to live in poverty or at risk of poverty and yet the Government has consistently introduced measures that would continue to harm this cohort of women.  One of the characteristics of the policies of the austerity Governments since 2011 has been that the cohort of the most vulnerable women were damaged most.  We still have not undertaken fundamental reforms for groups such as women returners, the women who have been out of the workforce for several years and who do not have access to programmes such as community employment.  The latter is something in respect of which we did nothing year after year.  There is a great deal of ground to be made up but this Bill is an important step.  With this and hopefully with the Minister of State&rsquo;s initiatives, we will achieve vast improvements in this area.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned Iceland earlier.  Iceland introduced a gender equality law in mid-2017.  It is now mandatory for companies with over 25 employees to obtain an equal pay certification.  It is working to eradicate the gap by 2022.  We have seen many reports on the pay gap.  In the UK, we saw the outrageous differences in pay between men and women presenters at the BBC across a range of activities.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation introduced by Senator Bacik and the Labour Party is a small step towards transparency and echoes the thrust of my own High Pay and Wealth Commission Bill, which I introduced in the previous D&aacute;il.

He must have been looking at the books last night to put it together.  I have had this treatment from Fine Gael in the past, both in government and in opposition.  What is happening here is the legislative equivalent of putting something in the fridge and then the deep freezer so that it becomes so covered over in icicles, the Government can grab its own legislation - inferior and all as it might be - and tell us we must run with it instead.  I am very glad of the expressions of support for the Bill before the House and the principles contained therein.  The Bill can be further improved and we are totally open to that.<\/p>  <p>  I have a friend, Mary Upton, a former Deputy for Dublin South Central who departed this House some time ago.  She has a theory about a potted plant and it describes well something to which the Government is prone.  I refer to the situation where women cluster around male politicians to create a doughnut, or as Mary used to call it, a potted plant effect.  There is far too much of this clustering in photographs on social media posted by various men in the current Government, although I will not name names.  There is also an approach whereby women are flattered.  Flattery will get you everywhere, as Marx - it might have been Groucho Marx - said.  Flattery does not cut it.<\/p>  <p>  The sentiments in the Bill are very clear.  In effect, the gender pay gap means that, from November, women work for free.  In other words, they are working for free for two weeks of November and all of December.<\/p><p>I want to be clear to women at home that this is what we want to erode and end, namely, the difference whereby women, despite working just as much as men, end up earning less.  We have had many examples of this.  All of it needs to be changed.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State was a little self-satisfied when he said that the public service is better.  I draw to his attention a table the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, gave me yesterday which refers to the three top grades in the Civil Service.  In 2012, 23% of Secretaries General were women and that has fallen to 21% in 2018, which is a small fall.  For second secretaries general, who are usually in large Departments such as the Department of Finance, 40% were women in 2012 and that has fallen to 25% in 2018.  At deputy secretary general level, which, again, is a significant public service position, 36% were women in 2012 and that has fallen to 24% in 2018.<\/p> <p> The Government should wake up and look at what is happening.  We have capable men and women in all parts of the public service and in all walks of life in Ireland.  Our demand is simply to mind the gap and to ensure equality between men and women.  It is important for young people growing up today, whether they are boys or girls in school, that they feel they can aspire to any field of work or any occupation they wish to pursue, and that our public education system and other services will make their aspirations possible to fulfil.  That is what we are looking for.  We would not like professions in which there were only women and no men.  In that sense, we need to look at areas like teaching to see if more young men might be encouraged to take part in various elements of teaching.<\/p> <p> I refer to my involvement, as a politician, in advancing the cause of women.  Almost every woman who comes into the House seeks to take one or more steps in favour of women.  When I was elected in 1992, I put forward on behalf of the Labour Party, and, to be fair, the then Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, Michael Woods, accepted the proposal to provide 20 years of home care credits for women in the social welfare system, which was important.  As Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid, I was involved in orienting our development programme to the poorest people in Africa, who are women and children, and that very much arose out of the Labour Party's philosophy.  In more recent years, when we went into government with Fine Gael, as the country was on its knees, in our first budget, in which I was involved as Minister, we reversed the &euro;1 an hour pay cut that had been made to the minimum wage.  For a woman working 30 hours a week on the minimum wage, that was worth &euro;30.  I have always been proud of that.<\/p> <p> During my period as T&aacute;naiste, we established the Low Pay Commission to research the issue of who has low and precarious pay in order that all of us in the D&aacute;il could better address that.  We also brought in registered employment agreements to allow for proper trade union negotiations, which made us the only country in Europe, in a difficult economic era, that significantly expanded trade union rights.  That is very much in keeping with the philosophy of Connolly and Larkin and our Labour Party history.  Not all colleagues are aware of this, or perhaps not all want to be aware of it, but it is worth pointing out.  When Deputy Frances Fitzgerald and myself were the only female members of the Cabinet, alongside M&aacute;ire Whelan as Attorney General, we worked to ensure that women and girls who had been affected by the Magdalen laundries had a process whereby they did not have to go to court and could get redress.  It was not perfect but it provided a solution, particularly for women living in England and the United States.  Very often, when women left Magdalen laundries, they just got on the first boat and headed away from this country.  I am again grateful that the Labour Party, together with Fine Gael, was able to achieve what was a fundamental address of an issue that caused people to suffer all of their lives.<\/p> <p> I would like the Minister of State to think again.  Sometimes in politics it is better to be generous than to be mean, and this is one of those occasions.  We have heard an extraordinary range of agreement.  In the end, the Government can produce its own Bill and it can listen to people in business saying, \"We cannot do that because we have only 80 employees.  Why do people want to know about our business?\"  In any modern interpretation of what should be available politically in a country, information about firms and companies that command large swathes of our economy is important in regard to how, ultimately, people experience life.  If we want to help women in low paid employment or women on social welfare who want to get into employment, we have to make sure we have a way of getting the information from companies.  Where companies are not treating women on an equal basis to men, that must be immediately addressed.  We have had examples in the public service going back 30 or 40 years and we have addressed them, by and large, except in terms of promotion.<\/p> <p> We are in an era of exceptionalism in regard to the appointment of women.  For example, in the justice area, recently the Minister, Chief Justice, Director of Public Prosecutions and the head of the Garda were women.  For a variety of different reasons, several of them left office and we are now back to a male dominated structure.  I have nothing against any of the men and I know they have achieved their positions on merit.  However, this is what the Bill is about.  We have to bring in structures that force us to look at whether the proper balance between men and women is present.  That is what the debate on the gender pay gap is all about.  A society is poorer in a situation where women are treated less well than their male counterparts, particularly when they are doing the same or more work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800043#VV00700","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543425000,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate and to respond on behalf of the Government, specifically the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton.  The explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill does a good job of explaining its purpose and context.  It identifies three uses for the information to be published by employers who come within the scope of a scheme.  The primary purpose is to provide information to diagnose the causes of the gender pay gap in organisations so as to inform the formation of public policy.<\/p><p>I assume this would require the compilation and analysis of responses from all employers subject to a scheme and for such analysis to be available to the Government for policy purposes.  The second use is by employers, providing them with the means to benchmark their gender pay gap against that of their competitors.  I note that this would require employers' information to be publicly available.  The third use is by IHREC, whereby a scheme would provide it with an additional source of information on differences in the pay of male and female workers employed by an organisation.  Such information could inform a decision by IHREC to use its existing powers to invite employers to carry out equality reviews and to prepare and implement action plans.  It could also inform a decision by IHREC to carry out such equality reviews and action plans on its own initiative.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, spoke on Second Stage in the Seanad on this Bill, he mentioned his concern that we should not enact legislation in this area without having full consultations first with interested stakeholders, in particular with employers and trade unions.  We need to ensure the legislation asks for the right information, that it is reported in the most efficient and useful manner and that it will produce the best indicators for future policy direction, not only for national policy but crucially also to support analysis and inform change where it is most needed at the level of the individual employer.  I am pleased to say that in the intervening period there has been intensive consultation on the subject.  In August 2017 the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, launched a public consultation on the gender pay gap which resulted in 38 written submissions.  In January of this year the Minister and the Minister of State for Justice and Equality, Deputies Flanagan and Stanton, and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, hosted a very successful symposium, 'Rising to the Challenge: Addressing Ireland's Gender Pay Gap'.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, has met the social partners and officials of the Department have held additional meetings with them and are in ongoing contact on the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2018.  Deputy Stanton has also met with other organisations with an interest in the subject and will take on board their concerns and suggestions insofar as it seems appropriate.<\/p> <p> The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality invited the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and the National Womens Council to its pre-legislative scrutiny session on 21 November and if Deputies consult the official report of that session, when it is available, they will see the views of these organisations on the issues which arise.  The present Bill covers similar ground to the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2018 which is at an advanced stage of drafting and on which the report of the Oireachtas joint committee is awaited.  The Government's preference is for its Bill to proceed to enactment because very extensive amendments to the present Bill would be needed to make it acceptable.  The long and short titles would need to be amended as with the substance of the Bill.  We do not believe the making of rules on gender pay gap reporting as an IHREC function and therefore we do not think it appropriate that the Bill amends the IHREC Act 2014 but rather that it amends the Employment Equality Acts which already cover discrimination on the grounds of gender in pay. <\/p> <p> The 2016 programme for Government said that the Government would promote wage transparency by requiring companies of 50 or more to complete a wage survey.  We await the report of the Oireachtas committee on the Bill and we will publish our own Bill after that.  Nevertheless, I wish to welcome the initiative of the Labour Party and in particular its Seanad Members in tabling this Bill and I look forward to the enactment and the coming into operation of legislation providing for gender pay gap reporting as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800044#WW00200","speaker":"1318","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543425600,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank all Members of the House who contributed to this debate and in particular for the very broad acknowledgement of the work done by my colleague in the other House, Senator Bacik, who, I think, has an extraordinary reputation not only on this issue but on a wide range of areas in advancing gender equality the equality agenda and human rights in this country.

We have created a state of non-existence for Bills that require a money message.  This is new politics.  My colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan talked about 140 Bills but I think it is closer to 200 Bills from this House alone now in that state of no grace that awaits in the pretence that new politics advances things.  As I raised in the House with the Minister for Justice and Equality last week, resolutions of this House, formal decisions of this our national parliament are increasingly being treated like formal decisions of the local debating society in a third level institution.  That is very dangerous for our democracy.  It is undermining, and cannot be sustained.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, who sits close by me said that in the beginning there was a degree of real concern at Cabinet that resolutions would be passed by the D&aacute;il and the Government would be defeated but now it happens three times a week and it is a matter of indifference.  That is not the way Parliament should work.  We have to address this issue collectively because if it goes on that resolutions of the House or Bills passed on Second Stage are simply put on a shelf to die of old age and neglect, we undermine our democracy.  I ask people to reflect on that point.  <\/p>  <p>  I was concerned too by the view expressed obliquely enough by the Minister of State, his curious concern about the role of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which would have fairly universal support and admiration around this House.  He was concerned that we were giving it a \"quasi-legislative power\".  It is simply to ask it to do up a scheme for reporting, authorised by legislation of these Houses.  We often devolve authority to agencies of State, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to bring in regulations to monitor environmental matters.  <\/p><p>Somebody crafted that speech, perhaps even the Minister of State himself.  It underlines a worrying attitude within the Department to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and I will certainly be more alert to that in future.  I have underlined for my own benefit the concerns expressed by the Minister of State in his speech but I will not rehash them in the three minutes I have left.  However, the Minister of State knows well that all of them can be addressed on Committee Stage if he wants to do so.  The Bill has passed through one House of the Oireachtas and it can pass Second Stage in the D&aacute;il this week.  As such, there are only a couple of hurdles left.  We could go through Committee and Remaining Stage this side of Christmas if the Minister of State really wanted to solve this issue and address pay inequality.  The Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, came to the House to say his preference was to advance a Government Bill, but no such Bill exists.  Rather, there are heads of a Bill which have been sent by Government to a joint committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The clue is in the term \"pre-legislative\".  It does not exist as a Bill yet.  No matter what happens, that is a year away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800045#XX01800","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543426200,"counter":472,"content":"<p>We have to do that.

It was open to the Government side to present its own amendments and Sinn F&eacute;in amendments were accepted.  If there are further amendments to make, let us debate them rather than to pretend there is a difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputies for the thoughtful contributions.  I should not be enticed to respond to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, who is congenitally incapable of making a speech in the House without attacking the Labour Party, but I need to correct a few factual points.  She said as a matter of course that Ireland was the worst in the EU in terms of pay equality.  In fact, if one looks at the actual statistics published by the OECD, Ireland is better than Spain, Lithuania, Cyprus, Sweden, the Netherlands, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Finland, the United Kingdom, Latvia and Estonia.  She also said the European Union was no good as it was no guarantee of gender pay equality.  In fact, eight of the ten best performers on pay equality are EU member states.  I will not bother going into her other inaccuracies about our term in government.  She said that during the term of Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who is sitting beside me, as Minister for Education and Skills, SNAs were reduced.  In fact, they were massively increased in our time in government.  In some politics, facts matter no more, but I try to be factual here.<\/p>  <p>  As a smaller party, the Labour Party's Private Members' time is scarce.  We have selected this Bill to bring through all Stages because it has been already passed by the other House.  I ask the Minister of State to think again.  He will be defeated anyway.  He knows that.  However, it does not matter because he will use other tactics and deny the Bill a money message.  Nevertheless, I ask him to allow the Bill to proceed on Committee Stage and to provide the money message.  I give him my own guarantee that if there are insuperable problems that the Minister of State finds with the Bill then and his own Bill is galloping up apace, we will address that problem with an open mind.  Let us solve the problem now.  Let us pass the legislation and show across the House that we are committed to pay equality in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800046#YY00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543426200,"counter":474,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill 2017: Referral to Select Committee [Private Members]","time":1543426200,"counter":475,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800046#YY00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1543426200,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Justice and Equality pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 141 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800046#YY00600","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543426200,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018: Report Stage (Resumed)","time":1543426200,"counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800046#YY00800"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543426200,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 4:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1543426200,"counter":480,"content":"<p>When the debate adjourned last night, Deputy Nolan was on her second contribution.

Amendment No. 4 was put down in good faith by Deputy Nolan and I support it wholeheartedly.  As we know from the Amarach polls, 44% of those who voted to repeal the eighth amendment said they did not want to have to pay for abortion in Ireland.  That is obvious but polls suit the Minister when they suit him and more times they do not suit him.  There were attacks on us at the committee and there have been attacks on those who have put down a limited number of reasonable amendments.  They were 10% of the total on Committee Stage.  On Report Stage, we have 16 amendments of a total of approximately 60.  As such, we cannot be accused of holding up, delaying or frustrating this process in any way.  As Oireachtas Members, we have the right to put down amendments and deal with them.  The fact that there was no pre-legislative scrutiny is all the more reason we had to table them.  The Minister requested that we would have no pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill was introduced in the House in 2016 by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and it is only now on the same Stage as this Bill.  It is clear, therefore, that this is being rushed with gusto.  People are trying to intimidate us and rule us out.  We are told the people have voted and that we must go with the flow and let the Minister do what he likes and care as he likes.  We are doing no more than we entitled to do, namely move the amendments and speak to them.  We are entitled to do so with respect and to be respected for these amendments.  It is no different to the position with the amendments we tabled to the Finance Bill this week.  It is what we are doing with the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Regulation Bill tomorrow.  It is the same with all legislation.  Oireachtas Members have been subjected to totally unfair criticism, including in the media.

The people who are for the Bill are entitled to their view and I will not suggest that they should not have one.  I want that reciprocated and to see respect for our views in the House.

The questions were about the large numbers in the UK who have a second abortion and the many cases of women who have up to eight abortions.

It may not always be what it seems and it could be a situation where a person is being abused and is being forced to abort.

There was no other reason to place it in this Part of the Bill and certainly no symbolic or other considerations behind it.  Moving the offence provision has no bearing on the substantive operation or application of that section.  However, in light of the concerns raised on Committee Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il, I asked the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to look again at the positioning of this section.  A number of Deputies made the point that a Bill about access and healthcare for women should not have, as the first thing when one picks up the Bill, the offences section.  We asked the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to look at it again and therefore I am submitting amendments which will have the effect of moving the offences section to Part 3 of the Bill.  They propose deleting sections 5 and 6 from Part 1 of the Bill as it currently stands and instead inserting them as new sections, 25 and 26, in Part 3 of the Bill.

I have tried to ensure that medical practitioners and people who are acting with the explicit permission of the pregnant person are excluded from offences.  When we had the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, we had lengthy discussions about the chilling effect of offences and the impact that has on doctors and pregnant people.  We concluded that there was a considerable chilling effect from the offences, which were acting in a way that was deeply unhelpful and not necessarily a medical necessity.  Medical professionals need to be assured that if they act with good faith and do their job in good faith, they will not be exposing themselves to prison sentences merely for administering healthcare.  If we do not explicitly protect doctors, we will continue to see this chilling effect and this could end up endangering women's health.  We found at the committee that the chilling effect has an impact and can put women's health in danger.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 7 seeks to ensure that in cases where a pregnant woman explicitly requests someone to help her obtain abortion pills from the Internet or in another manner, that person will not subsequently be guilty of an offence.  We do not want to end up with a situation similar to the one we have seen in the North where a woman who was helped by her mother to obtain abortion pills is now under investigation and could possibly be jailed for acting on the explicit instruction of and within the bounds of what her daughter had requested.  I believe we have to remove the reference to a 14-year prison sentence.  To me, this is just the eighth amendment coming back into the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800049#BBB00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1543427700,"counter":493,"content":"<p>The Minister just said that he has taken this from the front of the Bill and put it in the back because in our discussions and we talked about the chill factor for doctors.  I am sure he is not misinterpreting anything but I think he is misplacing the sentiment.  What we said and still mean is that having it upfront makes this Bill look like it is about criminalising abortions rather than being about women's healthcare.  We have always argued that it has to be centred on women and women's healthcare.  Taking the chill factor from the front to the back is like closing the front door and opening the back door and letting the wind come through.  It does not get rid of it.  The fact that there is a 20-year sentence for a doctor or medical practitioner is still a chill factor and it is part of the legacy of what we are trying to leave behind us and what the country said we need to leave behind and move on from.  The 14-year sentence is still there and will  be still a big negative to the provision of services.  In fact, it could lead to putting the brakes on midwives and doctors in maternity care services participating in the scheme.<\/p><p>I understand that these amendments will technically fall if we support the Minister's but the Minister having put his name to our amendment does not mean we will vote against our own amendment.  Now is probably the appropriate time to speak to why we want to get rid of criminalisation, which is why we say &quot;delete&quot;, and the Minister's name is now on that, though he is moving it to amendment No. 57.  If he cannot do that, will he at least try to lessen the impact of criminalisation, including, as proposed by Deputy Clare Daly, the removal of the 14-year sentence?  If one combines the 14-year sentence and criminalisation with the compulsion of notifications for all doctors who administer abortions and the serious harm wording in the matter of where a woman's health or life are at risk, I think the Minister is compounding the fear that doctors and medical practitioners of all sorts will have about providing proper, full, sustainable healthcare for women.  It was that chill factor and the question of how they could engage with this process that stopped doctors from treating Savita Halappanavar in the way she should have been treated.  I appeal to the Minister not to go down this route and to call out those in his Department and those providing the legal opinion that he must do this.  There does not have to be a 14-year sentence.<\/p><p>I think Lawyers for Choice have made recommendations in the case of anybody being coerced or treated violently, and having an abortion forced on her, which would be a rare case indeed.  Nevertheless, they argue that this can be dealt with under existing legislation, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, by inserting two small paragraphs.  I think the Minister is aware of them.  They state that the following two paragraphs could be inserted:<\/p><blockquote>It shall be an offence for a person intentionally or recklessly(a) to cause injury or death to a pregnant person such as to cause their pregnancy to end; or<br \/><br \/>(b) without consent to administer any drug or substance to a pregnant person such as to cause their pregnancy to end.Section 5(2): It shall be an offence for a person intentionally to coerce or deceive a pregnant person into having [a termination of pregnancy, as defined by this Act,] against their will or without their knowledge.<\/blockquote><p>Surely that addition into other legislation would do what the Minister is attempting to achieve here and do women of this country a service by removing the chill factor that lingers over doctors and medical practitioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800049#BBB00400","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1543427700,"counter":494,"content":"<p>This section and this group of amendments are the most important before us in our adjudication of this legislation.  Our names are on amendments Nos. 5 to 9 in this grouping.  At the core of this is the decriminalisation of abortion in Ireland in line with the ancillary recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, the Oireachtas joint committee, the United Nations and the World Health Organization.  Anybody who even glanced at the proceedings of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution would see that the issue of decriminalisation came up at every single session.<\/p><p>It is reflected in our report, which cited the case Amanda Mellet brought to the UN Human Rights Committee.  It found for her and against Ireland.  It found Ireland had subjected her to discrimination and inhuman or degrading treatment because of our laws against abortion in circumstances of fatal foetal impairment.  It found her suffering was aggravated by the shame and stigma associated with criminalisation.  We know the report of the Oireachtas joint committee stated the criminal provision also has the potential to create a chill factor for doctors and clinical risk by distorting clinical decision making.  Moving it to the back means it is great it is not at the front but we are not decriminalising abortion.<br\/><br\/>At lunchtime today, I happened to bump into one of the leading people in the Well Woman Centre, which will be at the forefront of delivering the services.  We have received a statement from the Irish Family Planning Association, which will also be at the forefront of delivering the service.  These eminently respected and key arenas for women's health are warning us we must remove criminalisation from the Bill.  They are not alone in this.  The World Health Organization has long called for an end to criminalisation and defines decriminalisation to mean removing specific criminal sanctions against abortion from the law.  By supporting our amendments we will be supporting the World Health Organization's position.<br\/><br\/>I want to draw attention to a statement made in September by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.  It urged governments throughout the world to decriminalise abortion and enhance their progress towards ensuring the right of every woman or girl to make autonomous decisions about her pregnancy.  The statement warned that:<\/p><blockquote>Legal frameworks for abortion have typically been designed to control women's decision-making through the use of criminal law.  Many legal frameworks generally prohibit abortion and make it legal only on specific grounds that do not capture the range of circumstances in which women and girls may need abortions.  Moreover, strict time limits for abortion often cause women to be in situations where their abortions become illegal.  These legal restrictions frequently converge with the practical barriers to effectively deny abortion to pregnant women and girls at the expense of their dignity and well-being.<\/blockquote><p>These are very serious words.<br\/><br\/>We are at an important juncture in the development of Irish society in terms of women's reproductive health.  If we pass this legislation but maintain a criminalisation sanction in it, albeit a slightly watered down one, we will fail any organisation that gave this issue serious consideration, which every one of them has.  Even at this late stage, I am pleading on these issues.<br\/><br\/>The provision is unusually wide ranging.  It has the potential to still have a chilling effect.  It is broad enough to leave healthcare providers open to malicious reports and criminal investigation with regard to their decisions as to gestation stage or the nature of risk to health after 12 weeks.  We do not need them operating in that climate.  I know the Minister will speak about good faith and reasonable opinion but they are defences to being prosecuted.  They might work or they might not but it does not preclude the initiation of criminal proceedings with all the consequences for healthcare providers this would involve.  There is ample medical regulation and other legislation in place to cover such situations.  Given that the eighth amendment was removed by popular vote there is no requirement to include this clause.  As we pointed out on Committee Stage, the Irish Family Planning Association and others have pointed out new offences should only be included if there is a public interest in addressing a clearly identifiable potential harm to women that would otherwise fall outside the remit of medical regulation.  I have not seen any that fall into this category.<br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive, would become relevant in the event of amendment No. 5 falling.  They would send a signal that if we are maintaining some form of sanction we need a clear statement in defence of doctors who might be worried about the chill factor associated with the Government's offences provisions and, therefore, might be deterred from providing abortion care to their patients.  It is also there to ensure others, such as friends and family members of pregnant women, who ask for assistance are not criminalised in the process of acquiring pills.  Where they act in good faith and on explicit instruction from a pregnant woman they should not be subject to a criminal prosecution.  This would protect against somebody being coerced.<br\/><br\/>I echo the point made that we need to move away from associating abortion with a 14 year jail term.  It is being consistently mentioned as the term, which leads people to believe it is an automatic sentence.  If we were to do nothing else we should do this.  I know the Minister will support the first of the amendments but he must support the removal later of criminalisation or not move its insertion.  Obviously, we will oppose its insertion.  It is absolutely critical because of all of the empirical medical and legal evidence before us.  Even at this 11th hour I plead that we deal with this once and for all in the proper clinical medical setting and not as a stand-alone issue open to any extra criminal sanctions, which is what we are still doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800049#BBB00500","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543428300,"counter":496,"content":"<p>On a point of order, I would like clarification.

To my mind this is patently unacceptable.  It is a throwback and concession to the viewpoint of those who were defeated in the referendum, where the people made a very clear decision they do not believe that women making a decision to have an abortion should be guilty of a criminal offence and that women should have the right to do it.

In the meantime, I ask the Minister to take what we have said on board.  The joint committee made this point very clearly with regard to criminalisation.  It was probably the issue that was most debated in the committee.  Leaving this provision in place will damage the Bill rather than enhance the fact that women will be able to access women's healthcare in a way they have never been able to previously in the history of this country.

I am happy to do that.  After the people voted to remove the eighth amendment, I told the House that I felt a responsibility to stick to what we said we would do in the general scheme.  These offences were included in that scheme.  The Bill provides that it shall be an offence for a person, by any means whatsoever, to intentionally end the life of a foetus other than in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  Officials from my Department and the Office of the Attorney General considered these issues in a number of ways.  Deputies have submitted amendments which propose to delete the offence entirely so that the termination of pregnancy is decriminalised.  I cannot accept them.  In many countries, this matter is covered by law in penal or criminal codes so Ireland is not unusual in providing for offences in law and for penalties to be applied when the law is broken.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies have proposed deleting the subsection which makes it an offence for a person to aid, abet, counsel or procure a pregnant woman to intentionally end or attempt to end the life of that pregnant woman's foetus other than in accordance with the provisions in the Bill.  However, criminalising a person who does this is necessary from a policy perspective.  The health and well-being of pregnant women are at the heart of this policy.  Helping a pregnant woman to end her pregnancy outside of the provisions of the Bill is not in her best interests and may on occasion put her health or her life at risk.  One of the primary purposes of this legislation, and the amendment to the Constitution that preceded it, is to eliminate the health risk to women from illegal abortion.  The Bill also provides that women can access, free of charge, safe medical procedures carried out by registered medical practitioners.  That is an important point.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions in the Bill protect people from forced abortions or an attempt to intimidate women, for example, in a situation of domestic or sexual abuse.  A dominant personality trying to forcibly terminate a woman's pregnancy might induce a woman to terminate the pregnancy herself instead of attending a medical practitioner.  I accept there is a difference of views on this, but we proposed these offences in the general scheme of the Bill which the people saw in advance of the referendum.  It is important that termination of pregnancy remains illegal outside the circumstances in which it is legal.  I have taken significant advice from the Attorney General on this matter and I am not in a position to accept the proposed amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800051#DDD00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1543428900,"counter":508,"content":"<p>We must deal with this from the perspective of where we came from.  In the context of the various scenarios outlined by the Minister, there are ample medical regulations and other legislation that would cover those rogue operators and coercers and deal with those issues.  The reason it must be decriminalised is precisely because of our history, the possibility of malicious complaints and so forth.  The Bill provides for abortion to be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the law.  Take the example of a doctor who, in good faith, is examining a woman who may be approximately ten weeks' gestation but who is not sure whether she is within the 12 weeks.  If the doctor makes the diagnosis, he or she has hanging over him or her the threat of criminal sanction and a potential 14-year prison sentence.  One can state that he can say he was acting in good faith and that he will get away with it.  However, he could also decide that the risk is too great and that he does not want to take it.  Suddenly, the doctor is concentrating on possible legal penalties rather than on what is in the best interests of his patients.<\/p>  <p>  Similar judgment calls will be impeded for our medical practitioners in the case of the health of a woman, for example, where they are considering serious health risk.  What does this mean?  The doctor has to wonder how serious it is.  That is a big thing and now the doctor cannot concentrate on her health as he or she must worry about the potential legal sanction.  It is that serious.  This is an extremely important measure to protect women's health.  We need decriminalisation.  I echo the points made by Deputy Joan Collins.

This provision will come home to roost in the most dangerous situations for women.  I do not believe that it is envisaging somebody forcing a woman to take the pill or forcing her to have an abortion under the ten or 12-week limit, when 95% or 96% of women generally seek terminations.  The number of women who seek terminations in the early term is very high.  This will come into its own as both a chill factor and a dangerous legal implement when women are at their most vulnerable and endangered.  When their lives or health are at risk, when they are undergoing abortions for fatal foetal abnormality or when there are questions about viability is when this will have the most impact.  This section is putting the most risk on the most vulnerable women at the most vulnerable time of their lives.  Applying the logic of shoving pills down one's throat and so forth is not what this is about.  As I said earlier, the Minister has been asked by Lawyers for Choice and others to consider using other existing legislative measures in terms of offences against the person rather than inserting this provision.  It must be considered very gravely indeed.

The public made its decision emphatically and any deviation undermines the process we presented to the people.  However, I am concerned - I have always expressed this view - about the criminalisation of people.  We should always place matters in a context.  It might be a vulnerable girl whose friend helps in the procurement of abortion tablets.  When they are administered, it could all go horribly wrong.  In that context, it is not good for the health of the girl if, by presenting to a medical professional, her friend or colleague could be prosecuted and criminalised for helping her to procure an abortion. <\/p>  <p>  There are downsides to this as well.  We must consider the practicalities of what can happen.  I accept that there must be a system in place whereby people are not able to provide abortions without criminal sanction in the event that they do it regularly and outside of good faith.<\/p><p>Equally, consider those particularly vulnerable young girls or women from immigrant backgrounds or women without access to major supports who, in the event of this going wrong, may be very slow to come forward for medical assistance because the person who assisted them could be criminalised and sent to jail for 14 years.  Even people who have very strong views against this legislation are concerned.  The criminalising element with the severe sanction of 14 years was also an issue of major concern for many people during the previous debates around the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act that we discussed years ago, well in advance of this legislation.  While I say in one breath that I do not like any deviation - I accept that it is in the heads of the Bill - I believe that we have to keep an eye on this to ensure we are not discouraging people from presenting to medical professionals if things go wrong, and I put it to the Minister that things do go wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800051#DDD00500","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543429500,"counter":512,"content":"<p>We all agree on the deletion of those lines but we just have some disagreement about reinsertion and where they should go.

This is why we are going to get on to issuing a review clause shortly, which is quite important.  To be clear, the Oireachtas all-party committee gave me my instructions in preparing for the referendum and in drawing up the general scheme.  The committee asked me to make sure the law was amended to allow for surgical terminations to be legally carried out in a hospital setting and to allow for medical terminations be provided for through the licensing of medications for that purpose and prescribed by a qualified practitioner acting in good faith.  The committee recommended that where terminations occur in such settings, no criminal sanctions should apply, and in any case no woman should ever be guilty of a criminal sanction.  This is what the Members on the Oireachtas committee charged me with doing as the Minister for Health.  This is what we put into the general scheme of the Bill and this is what we put to the people.  The woman never commits an offence in any circumstance.  The woman should not ever be criminalised.  This is very important.<\/p>  <p>  We have come from a situation where termination was illegal in Ireland, except in the narrowest of circumstances when the woman was about to die.  We are now in a situation where we will rightfully allow access to termination, without a charge and on a universal basis, to any woman and without specific indication, although there is always a reason, up to 12 weeks.  There is a legal difficulty with what some Deputies are asking me to do.  They ask if this can be caught in other Bills.  I looked at this quite carefully and it cannot.  Under section 7 of the Criminal Law Act 1997, referred to by some Deputies, \"Any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an indictable offence shall be liable to be indicted, tried and punished as a principal offender.\"  Given that the pregnant woman will never be, nor should ever be seen to be, committing an offence this section of the Act will not apply and cannot be relied upon to charge any person who aids or abets, counsels or procures a pregnant woman to end her own pregnancy.  I worry that we have yet to find a better vehicle by which to do this.  We have had numerous conversations with the Attorney General.  Based on those conversations, on the work of the all-party committee and on the general scheme of the Bill, I am not in a position to accept the amendments to remove the offences section.

Barriers to access to services under the Act are very much at the core of the three year review.  The only one that presents a challenge to calculate is the categories of pregnant people who may be unable to avail of services under the Act.  We would need some research methodology from an external reviewer to get to the bottom of that.<\/p>  <p>  This is a three year review that will learn from the mistakes of other countries that passed legislation and left it on the shelf gathering dust without checking whether it was working for women and doctors.  We will not do that.  However, we should not be overly prescriptive.  If we were being prescriptive, we would probably have missed a number of the core things that should be part of any review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800054#GGG00900","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543430700,"counter":543,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1543431300,"counter":544,"content":"<p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>I move amendment No. 12:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;(2) The review under this section shall include a review of:(a) any barriers to access to services under this Act;<br \/><br \/>(b) the number of pregnant people who may require travel to other jurisdictions to avail of terminations of pregnancy;<br \/><br \/>(c) the categories of pregnant people who may be unable to avail of services under this Act;<br \/><br \/>(d) access to services for those from Northern Ireland; and<br \/><br \/>(e) the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800055#HHH00100","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"vote","time":1543431300,"counter":545,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 34; N\u00edl, 64; Staon, 0.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Br\u00edd Smith and Louise O'Reilly; N\u00edl, Deputies Se\u00e1n Kyne and Tony McLoughlin.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800055#HHH00300","aye":["1238","1252","1361","1279","1253","1306","1316","1434","1258","1259","1288","1303","1266","1348","1349","1345","1239","1362","1333","1226","1280","1302","1325","1291","1215","1269","1287","1305","1366","1301","1222","1367","1232","1355"],"nay":["1368","1246","1321","1293","1369","1220","1350","1335","1273","1218","1336","1263","1221","1339","1217","1298","1261","1338","1436","1356","1322","1264","1214","1341","1441","1251","1275","1320","1319","1237","1365","1229","1314","1311","1346","1243","1224","1244","1337","1347","1223","1290","1343","1284","1262","1295","1342","1234","1315","1328","1326","1296","1329","1257","1324","1312","1334","1304","1213","1344","1277","1235","1236","1358"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1543431900,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 13:<\/p><blockquote>In page 9, line 9, to delete &ldquo;<i>section 14(2)(a)<\/i>&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;<i>section 14(2)<\/i>&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>Section 14(1) states: <\/p><blockquote>A termination of pregnancy may be carried out in accordance with this section by a medical practitioner where, having examined the pregnant woman, he or she is of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that the pregnancy concerned has not exceeded 12 weeks of pregnancy.<\/blockquote><p>Section 14(2) states:<\/p><blockquote>A termination of pregnancy shall not be carried out under this section unless &mdash; (a) the medical practitioner referred to in <i>subsection (1)<\/i>has certified his or her opinion as to the matter referred to in that subsection, and <br \/><br \/>(b) a period of not less than 3 days has elapsed from the date of certification referred to in <i>paragraph (a)<\/i>.<\/blockquote><p>Section 14(3) states:<\/p><blockquote>The medical practitioner referred to in <i>subsection (1)<\/i>shall make such arrangements as he or she shall deem to be necessary for the carrying out of the termination of pregnancy as soon as may be after the period referred to in<i>subsection (2)(b) <\/i>has elapsed but before the pregnancy has exceeded 12 weeks of pregnancy.<\/blockquote><p>The requirement that the certifying medical practitioner must carry out the termination of pregnancy is necessary to ensure the process for accessing a termination of pregnancy is clear for the woman and her medical practitioner.  The lack of a direct link between the four stages of the process, namely, examining, forming the opinion, certifying and carrying out the termination has the potential to act as a barrier to the woman wishing to access termination of pregnancy.  For example, if the law did not require under the section the termination to be carried out by the medical practitioner who forms the opinion referred to in section 14(1), it could lead to a situation where a medical practitioner certifies in his or her reasonable opinion formed in good faith that the pregnancy concerned has not exceeded 12 weeks of pregnancy and after the required three days has elapsed from the date of certification, the woman could be refused termination by a different medical practitioner on the grounds that he or she is not of the required opinion, which could create a barrier to access that none of us wants to see.  Furthermore, the law should not impose an obligation on a medical practitioner to carry out a medical procedure on the opinion of another medical practitioner if he or she does not agree with that opinion.<\/p><p>From a legal perspective, I am advised that not linking the four steps in the process would have the effect of breaking the chain of causation necessary for an unlawful termination of pregnancy to be prosecuted effectively.  Having set out the rationale for the policy behind the requirement of the legislation, I must note the following points raised on Committee Stage, concerns raised by medical practitioners and discussions within my Department about implementation and service provision.  <\/p><p>A difficulty was identified in the section, which we discussed at length, because it would require without exception the certifying medical practitioner to carry out the termination of pregnancy.  Should the section be left as it stands, it may create a barrier to access for women in certain cases, where, for example, the medical practitioner is subject to unanticipated events such as illness or other issues which mean he or she is not available when the woman returns for the termination of pregnancy.  In addition, rostering issues and practical realities of medical practice in a hospital setting mean that following the three-day period the same doctor may not be on duty when the pregnant woman returns to undergo the termination of pregnancy.  In both cases, the requirement for the same doctor to carry out the medical procedure could result in the woman having to start the process all over again with another medical practitioner and also to have to undergo a three-day wait period again, which no one wants to see happen.<\/p><p>It remains my policy that the medical practitioner who forms the opinion and certifies the termination of pregnancy should be responsible for carrying out the medical procedure.  I do not wish to create any other mechanism in that regard, but it is important that we acknowledge the practical realities of service provision.  I propose, therefore, amendments in this group to the section, which would allow a second medical practitioner to become involved following the three-day period if the first is available.<\/p><p>The amendments keep the safeguards and legal requirements which the section currently contains but aim to clarify the pathways for accessing the service and avoid creating an additional barrier for women trying to access the termination of pregnancy under this section.  The effect of my amendments is to provide that where a medical practitioner has formed the reasonable opinion in good faith that a woman's pregnancy has not exceeded 12 weeks, and certified that opinion, and the woman has fulfilled that three-day period a second medical practitioner may carry out the procedure without a further period having to elapse, where he or she has formed the reasonable opinion in good faith that the pregnancy has not exceeded 12 weeks and has certified the opinion.  This does not change the grounds but it recognises that following the period after the woman returns to see the doctor, it may not be the same doctor on duty.  The doctor may be ill or on leave and we cannot have a situation where a barrier is put in front of that woman.<\/p> <p> This tries to respond to the concerns expressed to us as a health committee by the medical profession and concerns which many colleagues have expressed in this House and discussions in my Department.  It is a sensible amendment, which recognises the practical reality that when a woman returns to her doctor, the same doctor may not be able to see her and she should not have to start the process all over again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800056#JJJ00100","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543432200,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendments Nos. 33 and 34 in this grouping.  The Minister said that we cannot have a situation where there is a barrier but the three-day waiting period constitutes a barrier.  There are different degrees by which it does so.  It might not be so much of a barrier for a wealthy woman who can easily take time to access her GP, but for a woman who lives in the North who might have to make multiple journeys, it represents a significant barrier.  For a woman subject to domestic violence, it will be a barrier that will effectively render this legislation useless.  A woman in direct provision might not be able to get out.  These are serious considerations.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate my statement on Committee Stage that the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution did not recommend the three-day waiting period.  It is a political construct.  It was not recommended by doctors, lawyers or any of the politicians on the committee, yet it somehow found its way into the public discourse.  While we accept it was in the heads of the Bill and formed part of the discourse, nevertheless barriers to access &ndash; I will not speak of cooling-off periods &ndash; must be minimised because access is key.  We have discussed whether access should be put into the Title of the Bill.  Surely we can accept that if we must live with the three-day waiting period, it can start from when the appointment is made, two or three visits to a doctor are not necessary and a requirement of this nature will have different degrees of impact on women, having the least impact on wealthy women who have time, if they are not in a domestic violence situation, and the most impact on women who do not have the financial means.  As I said on Committee Stage, ultimately, the test of this legislation will be whether there is a marked reduction in the number of women sourcing tablets from the Internet.  If there is not, then this legislation will have failed.  If we stick with multiple visits to a GP, we will put an unnecessary barrier into this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation also has a blind spot relating to women under the 12-week period but in a situation where the three-day wait could take them over 12 weeks.  It would be sensible to ensure that if the three-day period is overly burdensome, then we can do what is necessary to minimise the impact of that, if we cannot eliminate it altogether.  <\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution did not put this in but it was put in.  We could probably schedule a rake of debates on how, why and where this happened, however, it was part of the public discourse.

We also support amendment No. 31.  It was tabled at Committee Stage but was not successful.   The World Health Organization, WHO, has said that waiting periods like this demean women as decision makers, and we ought to keep that in mind.  Waiting periods will only lead to delays in accessing treatment.  The UN committee on the elimination of discrimination against women also recommended the elimination of medically unnecessary waiting periods for abortion as they pose a barrier to access.  The legislation is supposed to facilitate access to abortion services and we should remove any barriers.  There is no medical basis for the waiting period, which will particularly hit poorer people, those living in rural, isolated areas and people who may be in abusive relationships.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 34 seeks to waive the three-day waiting period if the woman in question would otherwise be denied a pre-12 week abortion.  While we advocate a complete removal of the three-day period, if we cannot achieve that, then surely amendment No. 34 is a reasonable alternative.  If a woman decides that she wants to have an abortion and cannot access one here because of an arbitrary barrier to access with no basis in medicine, then she will still have to travel to the UK.  <\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 33 has a similar intention to that of amendment No. 32 tabled by Deputy Kelly.  Its intention is to reduce to some extent the negative and harmful effects of the three-day waiting period by ensuring that the clock starts from the time of the appointment, irrespective of how long one must wait for the appointment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800057#KKK00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1543432200,"counter":550,"content":"<p>As I set out on Committee Stage, I do not agree with the three-day period and there is no medical evidence to back it up.

If we are applying a principle that says we must stay in line with what the people voted for, inevitably we will sometimes vote for provisions that we personally agree with and sometimes against provisions we personally agree with.  This is one of those times.  I will support the retention of the three-day waiting period because it was part of the heads of the Bill which people knew when they voted.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for his clarification on section 13.  An issue I raised with him at length on Committee Stage, as have senior clinicians, is that it would have been unworkable for a woman to have to go back to the same GP in any circumstances.  GPs get sick, they work in different practices, locums are used, GPs go on holidays and so on.  I acknowledge that the Minister has taken this on board.  Amendment No. 35, which is not in this group but is related, essentially brings that in and allows a woman to be seen by a second GP after the three days.  I acknowledge that the Minister committed to bringing that in on Report Stage and has done so.  I will support it, as it is important that if a GP changes, a woman can still access healthcare services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800057#KKK00400","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1543432200,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I will formally move amendment No. 31 and I will refer to a number of other amendments in the grouping.  From the outset, Solidarity has pointed out that this will be an unnecessary barrier to many women and pregnant people.  We said that it was not discussed in any great depth by the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and any time it was raised, every expert swiftly said that no such delay should be implemented.  The WHO opposes these barriers being put in the way of women accessing abortion and healthcare.  We have established that it was a political decision, which came after the committee reported, to make it easier for some Deputies to accept the legislation.<\/p><p>However, it was ill informed because no real discussion had taken place about it.  This is being done away with in France, for example, where abortion legislation is much older.  In any country where these waiting periods apply, they always act as a barrier to the most vulnerable in society - the poorest women and people who live in isolated areas, who may not, by the way, have a GP near them to supply this service and who have to travel.  It will hit ordinary working women, who will have to take a half day or a day off work for the first GP appointment, take more time off for the second appointment and then take time off to have the abortion itself, which could involve a few days.  We currently have many people in precarious work who do not have official leave or even sick leave, and we are making life much more difficult for them.  It is already a difficult situation for people to manage, particularly for those who are working or who may have children, in that they will be asked to make an unnecessary second visit.  As has been pointed out, people who are in abusive relationships or controlling relationships will also find it very difficult to get to a GP surgery on two occasions, given they need transport and time on their hands.  This is just not needed.<\/p> <p> Many of the points have been made before and we will not labour them.  People voted in the knowledge that this was in the legislation.  However, there was no necessity to put it in legislation.  It did not have to be nailed into a law.  Once it is nailed into a law, we all know how difficult it is to amend it or change it if we find it is a major problem.  It could have been put in medical guidelines as an option for a GP to recommend that somebody needed more time to think, for example.  We could all tell our anecdotes about talking to people on the doorsteps but it certainly was not a big feature for the people I spoke to.  Even if people were aware of this, what was proven by all of the exit polls at the referendum was that people voted \"Yes\" to give people a choice.  It was a very pro-choice sentiment, probably more so than the Government realised.  Trusting the person to make this decision was the overriding point that came back at the doors.  Since this has been proposed, we have had the whole situation with cervical cancer and a recognition there has been a paternalistic model of not trusting women, not giving them full information and not treating them as agents with brains and thoughts to make these decisions for themselves.<\/p> <p> I will make two final points.  This will not just be a three-day delay.  The reality is that GP surgeries open five days a week.  If a person rings up for an appointment on Monday or Tuesday, they will then have to go back for the second appointment and, as the surgery will be closed on Saturday and Sunday, many people will have two extra days added on to the delay.  In addition, doctors do not want this as they know how unworkable their surgeries are going to become.  As it stands, there are queues and long waiting times, particularly in urban areas.  This is not wanted by GPs as an added burden.  Anywhere these waiting periods have been brought in, it has proven to be much more than three days.<\/p> <p> Trump and people who are attacking abortion rights all around the world start by bringing in or proposing these kinds of measures.  Why do they do it?  It is because they want to erode those rights and make it much more difficult for somebody to have an abortion, if that is their own decision.  We should recognise that when people pick up the phone to ring their doctor to make an appointment to discuss something like this, they have thought about it; in fact, they have thought about nothing else.  I object to the idea that the Minister needs to tell them to go away and think for another three days when that does not apply to any other group in society who wants to access medical care.  We should start trusting women and pregnant people to make these decisions for themselves.<\/p> <p>If we are going ahead with them, I support the other amendments in the grouping, which at least would make it somewhat easier in practice to access these services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800057#KKK00500","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543432800,"counter":553,"content":"<p>To clarify, the Deputy cannot move amendment No. 31 until we reach it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800058#LLL00200","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1543432800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I want to speak to amendments Nos. 33 and 34.  Insofar as I want to challenge what has been said in regard to this being in the heads of the Bill that was put to the people, which got us the vote to repeal the eighth amendment, I want to make the following points.  As has been said, it was not a decision or a recommendation, it did not even form part of the discussion for those of us who sat on the joint Oireachtas committee, and it was not a recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly.  It came into the political discourse as we were clearly moving towards a referendum and the heads of Bill were then published with this in it.  I remember thinking, \"Where did that come from?  I am quite shocked.\"  The only reference I could remember to a waiting period from the time one would contact a doctor was from the Netherlands, where there is a waiting period of up to five days, although it starts from the time one contacts the doctor to make the appointment.<\/p>  <p>  As has been said, it is making an assumption that no full thought is given to the request that is being made to the doctor, which is pretty patronising.  However, let us say full thought was not given to it and that it was just an impulse along the lines, \"I will pick up the phone now and look for a termination but I have not really thought it through.\"  The Minister said he envisages a 24-7 helpline that would guide people towards a practitioner who would give them an abortion or deal with their request for an abortion.  It is just a thought, but what if such a helpline was geared to say to people who call that they have to get a doctor's appointment and that their request has been noted, that it is 28 November and that in three days' time, 2 December, if they have not had an appointment, at least it will have been noted that they requested one and that three days have to elapse before their doctor gives them the pills they require.  That would make sense, given a helpline is to help, so questions can be asked and the person can be referred to a counselling service.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I can tell the House this will apply in very few cases.  It is a big decision in one's life to seek a termination, and it is not something anyone does without thinking about it.  This is an obstacle to access.  We are going to hear this again and again, just like we did in the last discussion.  If we want to create an accessible service for women in crisis pregnancies, then we should not put these obstacles in the way, and I see this as an obstacle.  There are many provisions in amendments Nos. 33 and 34 that would allow for the three-day period to be inclusive of when the appointment was first sought.  It could be sought by email, by text or by phone call, for example, through the 24-7 helpline.  Whichever way it is sought, there are means of recording the three-day period after it is sought.<\/p>  <p>  The measure is cruel and highly political.  When we went to the people with this as part of the heads of the Bill, it was not part of the major discussion but neither was it completely clear that the three days would start from the time the termination is sought.  That was ambiguous in the heads of the Bill and this needs to be taken into account when one makes the argument that we must deliver on the outcome according to the heads of the Bill.  As I said, the heads of the Bill were ambiguous.  We need to take cognisance of the fact this did not form part of the discourse of either the Citizens' Assembly or the joint Oireachtas committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800058#LLL00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1543432800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>These are key amendments in our deliberations.  They were discussed at length at committee.  I want to echo the points made about where this came from.  When this was discussed at the committee, to be fair, the Dutch representatives were incredibly good and this certainly did not come from them, so any idea we are basing it on the Dutch model is wrong.<\/p><p>It was designed to facilitate and encourage careful decision making.  The Dutch service is very much based on women consulting with their doctors but the woman's decision and input is the key one.  No woman makes this decision lightly.  When she decides to make an arrangement with her doctor she has already given the issue an incredibly serious amount of thought and we have to see this provision in the context of other provisions and restrictions that are there.  It is the combination of those factors that make the waiting period a barrier.  It is not like the Dutch service where abortion provision is much broader.  It is not on as strict a clock of 12 weeks.  The circumstances where they can access abortion are far more broadly available.  The decision to implement it here in this way if it is not amended will act as a substantial barrier and other Deputies have made the point that if we are keeping the three-day limit, which is the case, we have to get real on when we say that.  It should be the date on which an appointment is requested for all the reasons highlighted, including the geographical inequality, the problems in our health service, the difficulty in getting a doctor's appointment and all the rest.  That is a reality and by combining that with the provision as currently constructed the clock could tick and women who are in danger of exceeding the 12-week limit would be in a situation where they are forced to travel or access an unsafe abortion which was one of the key situations that people in putting forward this legislation did not want because it causes delays and delays mean harm.  It is critically important that it be the date on which the appointment is requested.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 34 is key also because it states that unless the three-day period is overly burdensome to a women, including because it might contribute to her exceeding the 12-week limit.  This is critical in the context of those vulnerable groups.  I used the example last night of the challenges for deaf women, that the helpline, the phone option, is of no value to them.  A website is not of much value either when a large chunk of the country does not have access to broadband and all the rest.  It is still not good enough.  When a deaf woman needs to see a doctor there is the added burden of procuring an Irish Sign Language interpreter to go with her.  There could be a significant shortage of qualified interpreters available, and an even smaller number who are experienced in a medical setting which is difficult.  The woman may not want to bring her family along for privacy reasons.  She may live in a rural part of the country where it is even more difficult to get a sign language interpreter and not to mind all of the other barriers.  In circumstances like that, there has to be an option for a waiving of the three-day period if there is a risk of it going over the 12 weeks.  I am particularly worried and I would hope the Minister would say how he envisages the situation of a woman in a domestic violence scenario or one who is coming from a remote direct provision centre is to attend the second appointment after three days.  The Minister kind of led us to believe on Committee Stage that section 12 might be used to waive the waiting period but we need to put that on the record because there has to be a facility for waiving that period.  Otherwise we are in danger of forcing people to continue to travel who are at that juncture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800058#LLL00400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543433400,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I want to speak to amendment No. 32 in my name.  It is very similar to amendment No. 33.  The Minister should listen to the previous speakers.  I agree wholeheartedly with what they have said.  The three-day period was in the heads of the Bill, we have to accept that.  How it got in there we can possibly debate another time.  It is a barrier for all the reasons that have been stated.  If we have to stick to the three-day period, my amendment proposes that we consider the period in which the woman makes the arrangements to attend the medical practitioner, when the clock begins to tick.<\/p>  <p>  I know it was in the heads of the Bill and the public voted on it.  I am not of the opinion that, while it was in the heads of the Bill and the discourse at the time, it was in people's minds that there was an absolute doctrinal three days.  It would be within the spirit of what was proposed if my amendment or, indeed, amendment No. 33 &ndash; I am not hung up on which amendment is passed &ndash; was accepted.  It does not change anything that the legislation and heads of the Bill proposed.<\/p>  <p>  There are many practical reasons the Minister should accept one of these amendments.  Many women find themselves in vulnerable situations, where they may, within a fairly defined period, have to create a circumstance where they can start the clock ticking by making arrangements for this procedure.  There is a range of reasons they might find themselves in that situation.  I have met many of the doctors' groups which are in favour of this legislation but in certain parts of rural Ireland, there will be geographical problems with provision of service from day one, for many reasons which I will not go into here.  It is going to be quite difficult for some women, some young girls and some people in vulnerable situations to adhere to this requirement.  That is why it is necessary, if we are going to stick to this three-day period - I believe is a barrier but it is there and was in the heads of the Bill - that we at least accept one of these amendments to ensure the clock can start from the time they make their arrangements with the relevant doctor.

The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Repeal of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution did not make a recommendation on this.  To be honest with the House because I would like to be honest in this debate, and I think we should all be honest about it, this was inserted primarily to address concerns of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, last March.  He is entitled to that concern because this is a very difficult issue.  It was inserted for that reason alone.  There is no clinical or other evidence to suggest why it could be in there.  I distinctly remember at the time that issue being raised on several occasions by the T&aacute;naiste and subsequently the three days counselling was floated and now we have the three-day cooling off period, which was in the heads of the Bill.  That is why it was in the heads of the Bill.  There may be other views on the other side but I am fairly certain that is the reason.  Whether it was in the heads of the Bill or not, it will act as a barrier.  Some people may have wanted it in to act as a deterrent.  It will certainly act as a barrier for several reasons.  Women or young girls who find themselves in a crisis pregnancy and a very vulnerable position may have difficulty going to the GP twice for several reasons.  First, if the GP in the surgery a woman in a rural area normally goes to is a conscientious objector, she may have to travel a long distance to a GP who is not a conscientious objector.<\/p><p>It would mean taking time off, finding someone to mind children and travelling long distances.  That is a simple example of the practicality of the three-day wait.  The other issue is that of vulnerable women, namely, women who may be in very abusive relationships or who may have chaotic lives where one day just rolls into the next.  Given that chaos, they may not be able to organise themselves to attend a GP service on the third day or close to it.<\/p> <p> There are many reasons this might act as a barrier, even though it was put in to act as a deterrent.  Those are fundamentally different.  I am very concerned about it.  The fact it was in the heads of the Bill suggests that what was put should be passed.  The review, however, will have to be very clear in assessing this particular issue.  If we continue to find that women are procuring abortion pills online on a continual basis, this will evidently have been a barrier to people availing of services.  I expressed concern about the three day provision when the heads of the Bill were published, but I accept that it is there and do not want to deviate from it for the reasons outlined.  People on both sides of the debate will simply rerun the campaign itself whereas we have to accept the verdict of the people and try to implement what was put to them.  To be helpful and honest, that is why the provision is there.  It is not there for any clinical reason that I heard listening to many hours of professional evidence presented at the committee.  Nothing flowed from that to suggest this was a good idea.  It was never really mentioned by people advocating for women's health or by doctors who care for women in obstetrics and gynaecology.  For that reason, I have major concerns about it.  There is a three-year review, although there is nothing to stop the Minister coming to the House next month or next year to amend the legislation in advance of a review.  I record the fact that I have been very uncomfortable with the inclusion of this provision in the heads of the Bill and with the reasons that was done.  However, I am purist about the legislation we put on the Statute Book being as closely aligned as possible with the Bill as published in advance of the referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800059#MMM00300","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543434000,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I refer to amendments Nos. 32 to 34, inclusive, and the 72-hour provision.  On 26 May, the people voted to repeal the eighth amendment and provided the Oireachtas with the opportunity to legislate for the termination of pregnancy.  When the people cast their votes, they had the heads of Bill to guide them.  They stated clearly that there would be a 72-hour waiting period before an abortion could be carried out.  It is irrelevant why that was promised or who promised it.  It was in the heads and that is what is relevant.  The 72 hours were referred to in some instances as a cooling off period, but this was put forward by the Taoiseach as a safeguard.  Its inclusion in the heads of the Bill was the important point because when the people voted on 26 May, they were guided by what they saw in those heads.  The removal of the waiting period would mean the Government misled the Irish people deliberately on the safeguards during the referendum campaign.  Many people could be described as having voted by way of a soft \"Yes\".  They passed the vote on the basis of the guarantees provided by the Government.  The Government has to be held to its word.  There is a great deal in the Bill with which I do not personally agree but I am a realist and I realise that when the people voted, they did so according to their conscience based on what was contained in the heads of the Bill.  Those heads included a 72-hour waiting period.

It is not something I would have included in the Bill.  As other Deputies have said, however, it is part of what was put before the people and voted on.  There are many aspects of the legislation of which other Members do not approve, but that is what was voted on.  We have to be consistent as we move through this process.  The three-day waiting period does not serve the interests of women.  It serves to placate some of those who are more concerned about having services at all.  As has been said, however, it was part of what was put before the people in May.  No woman comes to a decision to request a termination lightly.  It is not a decision that is taken at the last minute or without have considered the situation.  However, the provision suggests that one needs three days to cool off because one does not really know what one is doing, does not know one's own mind or has not really thought about it properly.  It suggests that if one has three days to think about it further, one will change one's mind.  In my view, when one has come to the stage of asking for the service and for help, one has thought about it and knows what one is doing.  One knows one's own body and mind and has one's own reasons for wanting the service.  As such, the review will be important.  We must consider sections like this in particular in that context as they may have a very negative impact on women.<\/p>  <p>  I refer in particular to the amendment to which Deputy O'Reilly spoke and the potential for the three-day waiting period to be overly burdensome on some women.  There will not be many cases of it, but it is possible that there will be women who, for whatever reason, find out and make that decision very late and close to the 12-week mark.  It is possible in those circumstances that the three-day requirement will put them over the 12 weeks, thereby precluding them from accessing services in the jurisdiction.  It is one of the potential consequences for women.  This provision suggests somehow that women do not know what they are doing when they request the service and that if a woman has a bit more time to think about it, she might change her mind.  It undermines the validity of her decision in the first place.  It is insulting to suggest that a woman has not thought about it properly before she makes that call or sees her GP.<\/p>  <p>  However, I understand the concerns on the other side of the debate and I understand that some people genuinely believe that with more time to think, one might change one's mind.  I understand why the three-day waiting period was requested.  I appreciate fully and acknowledge that it was voted on and formed part of the heads of the Bill.  For that reason, I support the position of Deputies Donnelly and Kelleher that we have to pass legislation that is very much in line with what was before the people in the referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800060#NNN00300","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1543434000,"counter":562,"content":"<p>When witnesses from Holland were before the all-party committee, they outlined the kind of care available in their country.  Some of the very good ideas they brought to the committee were helpful, in particular in relation to ancillary measures such as those around unmet contraception needs.

The matter of the waiting period came up in the context of a discussion with those witnesses.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>I particularly remember asking how that works because I was trying to visualise somebody from this jurisdiction who had to travel and went to the Netherlands.  How would that practically happen for them?  Would they arrive in Amsterdam, turn up at a hospital and wait for three days?  We were absolutely assured that it did not work like that.  The way it worked was that it was from the date where the contact was first made, be that a phone call or the first time an appointment was made.  That is what we were told happened and there was good reason for us to ask that kind of question because we obviously have women travelling from this jurisdiction.<\/p> <p> I see no good reason to include a three-day waiting period and it is part of the reason why my name is on some of these amendments.  If it is being relied on as the origin of this idea, it should similarly be relied on in how it happens in practice.  It happens in practice in the Dutch experience when people make an appointment.  That is what amendments Nos. 32 to 34, inclusive, are reflecting.  They are accepting that if the three-day waiting period will not be dropped, there are a set of criteria that we can include in the Bill and they are very reasonable amendments from that point of view.  There are not just difficulties in accessing primary care services in terms of conscientious objection but as the Minister knows, there are real difficulties in the availability of GPs and the length of time that it takes to get an appointment and this is an unnecessary imposition.  If we are using the Dutch experience, it demonstrates to us that the three-day period is from the time that the appointment is made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800060#NNN00400","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543434600,"counter":564,"content":"<p>This three-day rule presents practical difficulties to the women, which have been outlined by other Deputies, but it also presents practical difficulties for the doctor.  When we had a hearing on guidelines in September, the experts who gave evidence could not present any international evidence on why there should be a three-day waiting period.  When the Minister is responding, he might outline what he feels the purpose of that three-day period is, because there does not seem to be any medical evidence to support it.<\/p>  <p>  The other practical difficulty is the question of when it starts and when it finishes.  I know the Minister has mentioned that it may be that six o'clock on a Monday evening and nine o'clock on a Wednesday morning would fulfil the three-day period, but that also presents practical difficulties, because how will that actually be monitored?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister must also understand what happens in a consultation.  When a woman presents to a GP to discuss an issue such as this, a substantial discussion and consultation are carried out.  It is not something that happens in the space of two or three minutes and it is quite often a prolonged consultation.  That is an important point because if it is being suggested that the waiting period starts when a phone call is made or a text sent to a practice, that is not practical because it calls confidentiality into issue.  Who is the woman sending the text to or leaving the message with?  She might be leaving the message with a secretary and what is being discussed is confidential information which cannot be discussed with non-medical personnel.  Those are the practical difficulties of it but the issue of confidentiality is also so important.  If there is to be a waiting period, the starting period needs to be a conversation with the doctor who will be in charge of providing the termination.  It should be a consultation and not purely a conversation with a member of staff or a text.<\/p>  <p>  Within the medical profession, there is the well known concept of a deferred prescription.  For example, if a woman comes in and wishes to have a termination and the doctor is happy that everything can be certified, the doctor can issue a deferred prescription and tell the woman that if she is not sure or if there is any uncertainty about it, she does not have to cash the prescription in today or tomorrow, but that she has that prescription, she can use it at her discretion and she should contact the practice if she is going to defer it for a period of time.  There does not have to be an instantaneous decision making process.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Minister will expand on the purpose of the three-day rule but there is much discretion within the consultation on when the taking of the medication is triggered.  It is not a one for all decision that has to be made right on the spot.<\/p>  <p>  The three-day rule has no international evidence to back it up.

It is difficult for any of us to try to second guess what people voted for because in reality, there was a huge spectrum of reasons why people voted.  Some wanted a very liberal regime of abortion, others wanted a very restrictive regime of abortion and some did not want abortion at all and that was the whole spectrum.<\/p>  <p>  To suggest that this issue of 72 hours was not important is wrong.

It appeared and presented in the Heads of the Bill and for people who wanted to see termination in controlled and limited conditions, this 72-hour period was not to be seen as a barrier or an obstacle as portrayed by Deputies earlier.  The other side of the coin was that during that 72-hour period, the woman in question would not just be left there, but that other options, advice, counselling and supports would be made available to her, which she may not have had the option to consider or access beforehand, and it was taken in that context.<\/p>  <p>  To try to second guess what people thought is wrong.

I and many other Deputies in the House canvassed throughout the campaign for weeks and not once in the thousands of doors upon which we knocked did the issue of the three-day waiting period come up.  The issue raised was always the substantial one, the issue of whether there were circumstances in which it was justified to have a termination or whether people believe women had the right to choose.  On the finer detail we are discussing around the three-day waiting period, not once did I hear that come up.  I am not saying that because it suits me to say it.  I am telling the Minister as a statement of fact that I never heard it discussed in the course of the campaign.  I do not believe that particular point had any bearing whatsoever on the votes that were cast.  I do not believe for one second that to question this and to propose amendments that would delete this three-day waiting period is somehow flying in the face of the democratic decision that was made by people.  It is paternalistic.  A woman might go to the doctor uncertain and she might say she wants to talk it through and think about it or she might say she has thought about it and wants the abortion.  The idea that the State will enforce a three-day wait on a woman in that difficult circumstance, whatever her thoughts might be about it, is paternalistic and wrong, and I do not see any justification for it.  Deputy Harty asked a very good question of the Minister, namely, could he please explain what the rationale for it is?  I cannot understand the rationale for it.  I do not believe there is any evidence that it serves any useful purpose and I do think it is a concession to people who are essentially trying to deter women from having abortions.  I am very happy to support the idea that we remove that completely and I do not see any problem with that.<\/p><p>  However, if that does not happen, and I suspect it will not, although I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in terms of trying to explain his support for enforcing this three-day wait, and if he is going to persist, then he has an obligation to seriously consider the other amendments.  What is his answer if that three-day waiting period takes the woman over the 12 weeks?  That would very wrong and very unfair to women if that were the case.  I do not believe it can be justified.  The Minister certainly needs to answer that question about what happens in that dilemma and if he cannot answer it, he has no choice but to support amendment No. 34.<\/p><p>Similarly, regarding amendment No. 33, all the obvious practical difficulties have already been presented to the Minister.  Unless he has good answers, and I do not think there are good answers, we know there are difficulties in getting GP appointments and that money, geographic location, disability or difficult personal circumstances for the woman involved can be an issue.  They are all real practical problems and impediments that will create barriers for women in a difficult and vulnerable situation where they do not need barriers, obstacles and further difficulties heaped upon them.  If the Minister insists on the three-day period, he has an obligation to consider the issue of it being from the point at which contact is made with the doctor and the appointment is made rather than insisting otherwise because, effectively, then, it becomes not a 72-hour period but quite considerably longer than that in many circumstances, and that is unfair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800062#PPP00100","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1543435200,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I want to comment on the 72-hour waiting period and to express my opposition to it.

That is quite obvious.  It was an effort to get the T&aacute;naiste over the line with regard to a Bill that he probably did not agree with at the start.  There was a question about the rationale for this three-day wait.  The rationale is that there are two lives involved in each pregnancy.  The Bill says that.  An abortion will end one of those lives forever.  It is a life and death situation, and therefore time needs to be taken to make a decision.  It is also understood that crisis is often the worst time to make a lifelong decision.  In an effort to offer support, help and advice, those three days can be beneficial with regard to making a decision.  People have asked what the medical evidence is for this three-day wait.  The Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution heard evidence to say that most abortions do not have medical reasons.  The majority of abortions are for socio-economic reasons, not medical reasons.<\/p>  <p>  One thing that greatly disappoints me with the debate we have had over the past while is that so many people, especially on the Government side, have said that they are pro-choice but the economic policies they are pushing have forced many women to feel that they have no choice.  Some 19 women who gave birth last year were homeless.  One can imagine, if one was homeless and pregnant, the feeling one would have with regard to one's ability to proceed with that pregnancy.  I imagine most women feel that they do not have a choice whatsoever.  It is also disappointing that in all of this debate, there has been little effort to focus on the socio-economic causes, to try to fix the economic pressures that so many mothers feel that they have and that they cannot proceed to give birth to their child.  There is no real effort in this debate to give confidence to mothers that they will have all of the necessary socio-economic supports to make a real decision on this issue.

Those relate to the three days starting when she first makes the arrangement.  The purpose of the examination is for the medical practitioner, having examined the pregnant woman, to determine in good faith that the pregnancy concerned has not exceeded 12 weeks.  There is no reason that the three days should be after the examination and that they should not start from when she first makes contact.  I do not see any practical reason to bring her back twice.  There are obviously economic and other practical reasons why going twice would cause difficulty.  Deputy Kelleher spoke about where there are conscientious objections and one does not have many alternatives.  That can be difficult because the woman may have to travel far from home.

I know people on both sides of the debate have strong feelings on this issue.  I feel that we have to stick to what is in the general scheme of the Bill.  I remember one of the big reasons and main arguments leading \"No\" advocates had for campaigning was that one could not trust politicians.  They said this was the draft law but that if given a mandate, politicians would do something completely different.  They said politicians would provide reasonable discussion and a deliberative process but would change their minds as soon as people voted \"Yes\".  I have no intention of being one of those politicians.  The Bill that I proposed in March, which was approved by the Government and published in advance, is the legislation that I told the people I would endeavour to enact if they voted \"Yes\".  People in this House are within their rights to try to amend that legislation.  I fully respect that but I feel a responsibility to enact legislation that is not substantively different from the draft general scheme.<\/p>  <p>  We made some changes to try to improve the operation of this.  As Deputy Healy referred to, it was 72 hours in the original scheme.  That does not work for many reasons, so we changed that to three days.  I also clarified on Committee Stage how the three days would start, so the issues Deputy Coppinger mentioned are not as stark with regard to it not being three full days.  I do not believe it runs over the number of days but Deputy Coppinger believes it does.  Deputy Daly raised the issue of what happens if a woman turns up in a particularly difficult situation.  The Deputy specifically raised domestic violence.  We discussed this at the committee.  We also discussed it in a meeting with the Chief Medical Officer.  He was clear and I am clear that there are emergency provisions in the Bill which will be used by doctors in accordance with their own clinical discretion.

With regard to section 14, I think Deputy Harty was asking if it is necessary to bring the pregnant person back in front of the doctor twice.  Can a doctor see a person on one day, prescribe ahead and tell that person to take the prescription on the third day, then call the doctor to say how she got on?  The doctor can keep an eye on the patient from there on.  Is it possible to do that in the context of this legislation?  It is an interesting question coming from somebody who is at the coalface of delivery of general practitioner, GP, services and understands better than most of us how difficult it is to get GP appointments in a country that has a ratio of GPs to population that is probably lower than most of the rest of Europe.  We have a crisis in that aspect of our health service as well as everything else.

We talked to people about it.  Some people loved it and some people hated it but it was certainly a feature.<\/p><p>That said, I do not know that it changed anybody's mind.

There are women in particular circumstances, and I have mentioned domestic violence, women in direct provision and women who live in the North, and I hope we will come away from this evening with some sort of understanding as to how they will be able safely to access the service.  I respect what the Minister has said with regard to the emergency provisions but realistically speaking it would probably be better if they did not have to access the service through them or, indeed, have that access at the discretion of the doctor.  That is probably not a good idea.<\/p> <p> I do not see why we cannot start that time period from when the appointment is made.  I do not know that people should necessarily have to state why they are making an appointment to see the GP if they do not feel comfortable doing so.

The Minister's concerns about giving false commitments are not appropriate in this context.  I want to say again with regard to the point on the Dutch model made by Deputy Catherine Murphy that the people we spoke to were very clear.  We asked how could an Irish person avail of it if there is a five-day waiting period.  We asked whether Irish people would have to book a hotel in the Netherlands for almost eight days, with five days before and a couple of days afterwards.  We were told that when they get there five days after the first point of contact they can have the termination.  It is a real five days.<\/p>  <p>  For all of the reasons outlined by the other Deputies, in Ireland three days in the context of the other provisions will not mean three days and could provide a barrier.  In this context I plead with the Minister, particularly on amendment No. 34.  I heard what the Minister said about the emergency provisions, and I get that in the case of a woman escaping a domestic violence situation or a woman in direct provision a doctor can state it is an emergency, that the woman clearly does not have the ability to return within the time and that he or she will make a call under the emergency provision to waive the three day period.  That is fine but there is probably only a small number of doctors who have this confidence.  They are experienced doctors who are prepared to take that risk.  We had a discussion on Committee Stage about how younger doctors might not be so confident to make that evaluation and take the chance.  Therefore, given that it is only a small number of circumstances, the provisions of amendment No. 34 would mean it could be waived if there is a risk it might exceed the 12 weeks.  Essentially, the Minister is stating it is trying to do the same thing.  However, it would make it easier for doctors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800064#RRR00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1543436400,"counter":581,"content":"<p>We have debated this at length but several points should be put on the record because this provision in the legislation could prove to be very problematic for many people and it is important to recognise this on Report Stage.  People did not vote on the three day waiting period.  I know the point being made by Deputies but people voted to repeal the eighth amendment.  There was a piece of legislation and people might have agreed with some parts.  In general, the big bullet point in bold big font was 12 weeks.  That was the big debate.  I do not think the idea of making people wait three days was a huge factor.<\/p>  <p>  In actual fact, the parliamentary committee did not accept all of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  It was not willing to go that far.  The Citizens' Assembly was made up of 99 ordinary people selected from an opinion poll so using logic we can deduce the people are ahead of politicians on this entire issue.  If this provision had not been there the referendum would have been passed anyway.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of people voting, I certainly did not know for sure that two visits would be involved when I spoke to people about it.  I agree with what people have said on it being a three day waiting period and not two day visits for a woman who is pregnant.  This is the way it has worked out.

Yes, they were voting on an amendment to the Constitution but they were also voting on that amendment in the knowledge that, by and large, Members of the D&aacute;il had said if the referendum was passed the draft legislation put before them would be the basis for the change the people made.

It was a very nuanced decision by the people and, ultimately, a compromise was put before the people and debated.  Overwhelmingly, whether I or others like it or not, the public voted for it.  It is incumbent on us at this juncture, with the first legislation introduced after the referendum was passed, to execute faithfully what we can discern to be the will of the people as expressed in the referendum.  It is a political will rather than simply the straightforward legal will of the people, which was to amend the Constitution.  The political will of the people was certainly evidenced by their listening to and taking part in the debates.  As someone who spoke on the media during the referendum I have to say our broadcast and written media did a fantastic job.  I had no complaints whatsoever.

These are the amendments I tabled on Committee Stage in an effort make the legal situation around what happens when a foetus becomes viable very clear.  The legislation requires some thinking through to get there.  A number of people whose views on the legislation vary widely have asked me for clarity.  The Bill states that a termination is only allowable where the foetus has not reached viability.  The direct inference from that is that once a foetus has reached viability, a termination of pregnancy, which is defined in the Bill as ending the life of the foetus, is no longer allowable under the legislation.  That is my understanding but one must read through the Bill and make that extra logical step.  I asked that clarity be provided in the explanatory memorandum and the Minister has done that.<\/p><p>Can the Minister confirm on the record whether my understanding is correct?  Some people have a fear that a viable foetus could have its life ended, but my understanding is that this is expressly prohibited.  In fairness to the Minister, he confirmed my understanding on Committee Stage but I am seeking confirmation again that it is correct.  That understanding is that once a foetus has become viable, termination of pregnancy is no longer possible.  If a pregnancy must be ended to protect the mother, the baby will be delivered and everything will be done to keep the baby alive in the same way as if it was a premature birth.  We would not have a circumstance in which a termination of pregnancy would be carried out when a foetus had reached viability.  In other words, a viable foetus would not have its life ended.  I would appreciate if the Minister could tell me whether my understanding is correct, incorrect or correct with caveats.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800065#SSS00400","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1543437000,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I also ask the Minister to address the issue of viability.

I believe viability is the point at which a child can survive outside the womb with or without medical assistance.  In some cases it can be at 22 weeks and in others it can be at 23 or 24 weeks.  It can vary according to the baby and the mother.  It can also vary depending on which hospital one is attending.  Obviously, a wide range of facilities is available in the Rotunda Hospital and the Coombe, whereas all that equipment will not be available to a baby born in a community hospital in a more rural area unless the baby is transferred to another hospital.

They largely relate to a requirement to consult the woman, ascertain the views of the woman and other issues in terms of serious harm and the issue of risk.  It is quite a broad berth but I will be as brief as possible.  First, in the Bill, as drafted, there is no requirement to consult the pregnant woman.  That is very problematic and is not reflective of the rights based approach to the provision of women's healthcare.  Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 seek to do this in part.  Amendment No. 15 deals with the pregnant woman having a right to deem that the risk to her life or health is unacceptable.  We have discussed this.  Pregnant women are competent adults.  We removed the eighth amendment to recognise bodily autonomy, and we should do that.<\/p>  <p>  Examples were given at the committee of where a woman knows best.  A doctor might think there is a risk to a woman's health but the woman might think, \"I am in my early 40s, I have no other children, I desperately want a child so I want to take the risk and continue with the pregnancy even though it may result in a risk to my health.\"  She makes that decision, whereas perhaps a younger woman with children at home and other responsibilities might feel that the risk to her health is too great a risk to take.  There was much talk during the referendum campaign about trusting women and that was very much a sentiment of the electorate, but it is not reflected anywhere in the Bill.  The amendment is an addition.  It is not eliminating anything but allowing the voice of the woman to be put centre stage in the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 17 relates to the term \"serious harm\".  We have discussed this a great deal so I will not labour the point.  The term is not helpful given the climate we have come from on this issue.  It is not women centred and the points made repeatedly to the committee were about the challenges in fixing risk and that it is best considered in a clinical setting, not defined in legislation as serious or severe.  Many of the medical practitioners made the point that risk of the development of serious harm can fluctuate and in that context mothers can slip through the net.  We cannot have that situation.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 19 is also important and deals with the issue of risk.  It proposes deleting the word \"avert\" and substituting the word \"reduce\".  This would ensure access to abortion if it reduces the risk to the woman's health even if it does not eliminate that risk.  With the current wording the intervention would have to eliminate the risk.  That is very dangerous so we must change the language.  There will be scenarios where the pregnancy is a significant contributing factor to the risk to the health or life but not the sole determinant, and its termination may significantly mitigate but not entirely avert the risk.  We must be very careful and amend this to support the medical practitioner's clinical judgment.<\/p>  <p>  Good information has been brought forward by Lawyers for Choice on the legal sense of the word \"avert\", which Deputies will have read.  Avert in the legal sense means prevent.  That is a definitive view in the context of risk and harm.  Lawyers for Choice give the good example that in situations where an abortion would reduce the risks to health but not fully avoid them, there is a legal risk that the pregnant person could be forced to continue the pregnancy on the ground that the need for aversion rather than reduction or considerable reduction had not been met.<\/p><p>Lawyers for Choice gave examples of conditions that might develop as the pregnancy continued where it would be safer for the person to have an early termination but where it did not quite tick that box.  They suggest the ending of such a pregnancy at the earlier gestation would reduce but not eliminate the risk.  In other words, under the current wording, a person who is at 14 weeks gestation and requires an abortion owing to a condition that might get worse during the pregnancy would meet the criterion of risk to health.  As the pregnancy had not reached the point of viability, that box would be ticked, but the person might not meet the criteria in section 10(1)(c), as the abortion would not completely avert the risk; it would only reduce it.  That is why we need to have the word \"reduce\" in order that the person would not have to travel to access abortion care.  That is why we have put forward many of these amendments.  If we do not have them, there is a risk the person who needs to access this service might have to continue to travel.  Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 in this group for the purposes of discussion are really just technical amendments to facilitate amendment No. 15.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800065#SSS00600","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543437600,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Witness after witness who attended the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution was very clear with us about the difficulties or impossibility of grading risk.

People voted in the spirit of the amendments proposed by a number of Deputies.  I shall speak to a number of the amendments in the group, particularly amendment No. 15 because I did not speak to it before.  I raised the issue on Committee Stage, but I felt it was necessary to insert an new clause into the definition of when a person can access an abortion owing to a risk to life or health.  Having two doctors was mentioned, which is fine.  Doctors need to have rules about when they can intervene, but it had become obvious on Committee Stage that many were concerned about one aspect; that there was no voice for the person who was pregnant in the horrendously difficult situation where life or health was at risk.  I proposed the insertion of the clause \"(b) the pregnant woman deems the risk to her life or health to be unacceptable&rdquo;.  This is because the law, as it stands, mentions doctors, but it does not give a voice to the woman.  This has echoes of the case of Savita when she asked for an abortion.  It was a different situation because the clinicians had deemed that her life was not at risk, that it was only her \"health\" and that, therefore, they could not act.  One can see, however, how quickly that situation developed completely and utterly into a scenario where her life was at risk.  The fact that a woman like her was not listened to and that she had to go through that trauma resonated with the entire population.  That was the filip or impetus for the abortion rights movement six years ago and it reinvigorated the campaign for the repeal of the eighth amendment to the Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider a situation where a woman lands in a conservative hospital where two doctors are to decide.  Let us say there is a chilling effect of a law and they are very afraid in a difficult situation that a decision could be challenged.  What if they say \"No\"?  What will happen if the woman points out that she believes the pregnancy presents a huge danger to her health or life?  She may have her reasons for saying so.<\/p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>It may be because of a previous pregnancy, that they know nothing about how that evolved, or it could be for mental health.  I am really concerned about this.  It is very difficult to judge when somebody's mental health is such that there is a risk of them taking their life.  However, two years ago, a teenager was sectioned by a psychiatrist; I do not know what happened since but it was reported that she was sectioned for a period because the psychiatrist had that power.  That pregnant person who said that her life was at risk through suicide, due to which she should have been able to have an abortion, was not listened to.  I think the Minister has to be cognisant that this is definitely something that people wanted changed in this country, where women themselves do not have their voices heard at all.  I echo Professor Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, who appeared at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and whose testimony was among the most memorable we heard at the time.  He has dealt with these situations over many years and when he was asked by the committee members if it was possible to define a risk to health in law, he said it was not.  People asked what we should do and he said the woman has to be listened to.  She is the ultimate arbiter.  It is disappointing that this is not being taken up in law.  This clause is an attempt to rectify that.<\/p> <p> On serious harm, it is disappointing that the wording was changed from what was discussed by the committee, from \"risk\" to \"serious harm\".  Even taking out the word \"serious\" would have been helpful.  The definition of what is serious is very broad.  I agree with the point about the words \"mitigate\" and \"reduce\" and stress that the woman should be consulted where possible.  If somebody is unconscious, they cannot be consulted.  I really cannot understand how no amendments have been accepted all along the line on this one because this is not a case of the Minister breaching faith with the people who voted in the referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800066#TTT01200","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543438200,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I thank colleagues for their contributions.  For Deputy Donnelly, I confirm that his understanding in respect of viability is correct.  We discussed this on Committee Stage and doctors have already told us all through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and through the Oireachtas special committee that they do not need this to be in law as it is the practice.  However, we have put it in law anyway just to provide absolute, complete and utter clarity and reassurance to people.  Our doctors are in the business of wanting to deliver babies and where a baby has reached viability, that baby will be delivered.  I think the legislation is clear on that.  We have also heard from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to the effect that it is already the practice in Ireland.<\/p><p>In response to Deputy Butler's question about what entails extraordinary life-sustaining measures, and indeed Deputy Donnelly's raising of this issue, I thank the Deputies for acknowledging that we have now put this in the explanatory memorandum, again to provide absolute clarity and certainty on what is meant in that regard.  Deputy Butler is entirely correct; we have not put a timeline on viability and I think that is really important for the reasons she outlined.  The committee has considered this as well.  The timeline for viability can vary from woman to woman and from pregnancy to pregnancy.  It should be a clinical decision and we should not have a rigid point in law.  With medical advancements, viability may come earlier and earlier in pregnancy.  It is appropriate that our clinicians are empowered to make those decisions.  For the reasons I have outlined, I believe Deputy Donnelly's amendments, while well intended, have been dealt with through the clarification and the explanatory memorandum.<\/p><p>Deputies have proposed a number of amendments to insert a provision in the Bill whereby a termination of pregnancy may be carried out under section 11 in cases where the pregnant woman deems the risk to her life or her health to be unacceptable.  I did say on Committee Stage that the law should not impose an obligation on a medical practitioner to carry out a medical procedure on the opinion of another medical practitioner if he or she does not agree with that opinion.  While I appreciate that the Deputies wish to ensure that attention is paid to the woman's wishes, as do I, and indeed to her opinion of the risk to her life or health in this situation, I would go further and say that it would be wholly unacceptable to force a medical practitioner to arrive at that reasonable opinion based on his or her patient's view.  The medical practitioner has to be able to satisfy him- or herself or the risk.  That is the job with which clinicians are entrusted.<\/p><p>However, I think it is really important to say that medical practitioners should not decide on a course of treatment without reference to the wishes of their patient.  As I have pointed out previously, the Medical Council's <i>Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners<\/i>specifies that a medical practitioner's responsibility to provide patient-centred care does mean treating patients as individuals, taking into account their personal preferences, goals and lifestyles, and acting with compassion and respecting patients' dignity.  That is the obligation our doctors have signed up to under their regulator, the Medical Council.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 16 concerns the process by which a medical practitioner can ascertain whether a termination of pregnancy may lawfully be carried out.  This is set out in sections 11 to 14, inclusive, of the Bill.  Apart from emergency situations, which are covered in section 12, the Bill clearly sets out the steps which must be undertaken to assess termination of pregnancy in this country.  The medical practitioner must examine the pregnant woman, form a reasonable opinion in good faith, certify that opinion and carry out the termination of pregnancy.  In order to form a reasonable opinion in good faith, the Bill is clear that the medical practitioner is required to examine the pregnant woman.  I thought long and hard about this on the basis of the very detailed discussion that we had on Committee Stage.  A number of Deputies put forward different wordings to replace &quot;having examined&quot;, for example with &quot;following a medical consultation with&quot; or &quot;ascertain her views&quot;.  There was quite a number of suggestions put forward.  I have taken a lot of legal advice on this and I am advised that it is important that there is consistency between the various sections of the Bill from a legal point of view in order not to differentiate between them or cause unintended consequences in the way the Bill is interpreted.  Given that there is a requirement for examination included in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, leaving it out of the current Bill would result in a lessening of the clarity around the process, potentially causing undue confusion both for medical practitioners and for the woman.  The important aspect of the requirement set out in the Bill is that medical practitioners providing the service and women accessing it are clear as to how a medical practitioner is expected to reach the reasonable opinion formed in good faith.  It is therefore my opinion, heavily influenced by legal advice that I have received, that to remove this requirement would result in a lessening of the clarity around the process, potentially causing undue confusion for both medical practitioners and for women.  This is something that I did insert in the Bill after publication of the general scheme on the basis of the legal advice I received in terms of providing clarity.<\/p><p>I also took a look at the issue in respect of the word &quot;avert&quot; rather than &quot;mitigate&quot;.  This wording, used in section 11, was considered at some length during the drafting of the legislation.  The formulation set out in the Bill is based on the position approved by Government and set out in the general scheme published last March in advance of the referendum.  The phrase &quot;serious harm to the health of the pregnant woman&quot; was used in the general scheme and has not been changed since.  This is a phrase that, again, if we are sticking to what we said we would do in advance of the referendum, was there from the start of March.  The qualification &quot;serious&quot; was included in section 11 to clarify from a legal perspective that the nature of the risk to a woman's health goes beyond the normal risk of harm to a woman's health which pregnancy would pose, even to a healthy woman.  It was inserted on the basis of advice from the Attorney General.  Pregnancy by its very nature does involve a risk to a woman's health.  Evidence shows that an early termination of pregnancy, if done safely and according to best medical practice, will always - factually - pose less of a risk to a woman's health than continuing with the pregnancy to delivery.  We did need to clarify in law what exactly we meant when we were talking about risk of harm.  In addition, the wording used in this section makes it clear that the risk to a woman's health would not include, for example, poor health from a respiratory tract infection or another ailment that could harm a woman's health while she is pregnant but would not have sufficiently serious consequences for a termination to be justified on health grounds.<\/p><p>Deputies, particularly Deputy Kelly, sought on Committee Stage to replace the word &quot;avert&quot; with &quot;mitigate&quot;.  However, I have taken legal advice in respect of that as well.  The language used in the Bill has regard to the need to clarify that the scale of risk of harm involved goes beyond that normally involved in pregnancy and that a termination of pregnancy is appropriate in cases where it can prevent rather than reduce or mitigate such harm.  Under the terms of the Bill, a medical practitioner can take the decision in consultation with the woman to carry out a termination of pregnancy on the grounds that it would be appropriate in order to address that risk.  Use of the word &quot;appropriate&quot; was deliberate to try to provide the sort of clarity that Deputy Kelly is looking for.  Termination of pregnancy is not restricted to cases where the medical practitioner believes the termination is necessary in order to avert the risk.  For these reasons, I am not in a position to accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800067#UUU00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1543438800,"counter":604,"content":"<p>The Minister read out the regulations in place for medical professionals about how to talk to patients and treat them with respect.

They propose to delete lines in sections 11 and 13, which require an obstetrician to carry out the termination of the pregnancy concerned or, alternatively, propose to allow the certifying obstetrician to make arrangements for the carrying out of the termination of pregnancy.  Sections 11 and 13 both set out four steps which must be carried out by two medical practitioners.  These steps are carrying out an examination, reaching a reasonable opinion formed in good faith that the requirements set out in the section have been fulfilled, certifying the opinion and carrying out the medical procedure.  These steps are linked and follow each other sequentially.  If there is no direct link between each of these steps, there is potential for confusion or for a woman in a crisis situation wishing to access termination of pregnancy to face additional barriers before she can access the service she requires.<\/p>  <p>  In both sections one of the medical practitioners must be an obstetrician.  Section 11 provides that the other medical practitioner must be an appropriate medical practitioner, which refers to a medical practitioner appropriate to the care or treatment of the woman in respect of the risk of the life or serious harm to her health.  In section 13, a medical practitioner of relevant specialty is required, which refers to a medical practitioner registered in the specialist division of the Medical Council.<\/p>  <p>  Both sections provide that the termination of pregnancy must be certified by the certifying obstetrician.  In cases where both certifying medical practitioners are obstetricians, which will often be the case, the medical procedure to terminate the pregnancy may be carried out by either of the certifying obstetricians.  This requirement for the termination of pregnancy to be carried out by one of the certifying obstetricians is necessary to ensure the process for accessing terminations of pregnancy on these grounds is clear for women and their medical practitioners.  Importantly, it also ensures continuity of care for the pregnant woman and places patient safety at the heart of the service.  <\/p>  <p>  I have discussed this matter with Dr. Peter Boylan and others.  I accepted earlier in the debate that an issue arises in respect of early pregnancy - there was no doubt about that - and it had to be rectified.  This is a different situation.<\/p><p>This is a situation concerning health and life, and it is important there is a continuum of care.  In addition, there is not a time period that needs to elapse, as there obviously is in early pregnancy.<\/p> <p> The requirement for the procedure to be carried out by an obstetrician is necessary in recognition of the likelihood that the terminations carried out under these sections are likely to take place at a more advanced stage of pregnancy and may require more complex care, particularly in the view of the fact they may involve co-existing medical conditions.  It is my Department's view, given the medical expertise contained within it, that from a patient safety perspective it is essential the highest possible standard of care is provided in these situations, although I know Deputy Daly and others will not agree with that, and that such cases are supervised and services delivered by the most highly experienced and qualified medical personnel, in this instance, consultant obstetricians.  We do not want to do anything unintentionally that would in any way jeopardise a woman's health or lead to less than optimal outcomes.<\/p> <p> Amendments were also proposed on Committee Stage to allow the certifying obstetrician to make arrangements for the carrying out of the termination of pregnancy.  However, if the Bill did not require the termination under this section to be carried out by a certifying obstetrician, it could lead to a situation where one obstetrician certifies that, in his or her reasonable opinion, formed in good faith, the pregnancy concerned has fulfilled the requirements, but the woman could then experience a delay at a critical point if a second obstetrician must then be found to carry out the procedure.  There is a duty of care, which is the point in these situations.  In the worst-case scenario, a woman could be refused a termination by a second obstetrician on the grounds that he or she has not formed the same opinion as the obstetrician originally involved, and this would create a barrier to access for a woman when time is of the essence, and it could cause considerable distress or confusion.<\/p> <p> I am of the strong belief the law should not impose an obligation on a medical practitioner to carry out a medical procedure based on the opinion of another medical practitioner, as we discussed earlier.  I genuinely do not believe these amendments are required.  I believe the unintended consequence would be potentially to reduce the optimum level of care that a woman would receive, considering that, under these sections of the legislation, we are talking about a woman who might be very sick and at an advanced stage of pregnancy.  There is a duty of care on the obstetrician.   There is also a situation where no time period needs to elapse, unlike in early pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800071#YYY00600","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543440300,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I will be withdrawing amendments Nos. 24 and 26, based on the clarification the Minister gave me earlier.

I am happy to make some brief remarks about these amendments.  Given the gravity of what we are dealing with here I hope a certain latitude will prevail in the discussion but I do not see it.  I am not holding out any great hope that any of our amendments will be accepted.  The Minister set his face against any amendments we put down in good faith on Committee Stage.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his intervention last night when we were being told that we were doing all kinds of things and that we had ulterior motives in putting down amendments.  Every Deputy is entitled to table and move amendments.  I am glad that none of that occurred tonight and that we have had a reasonable and respectful debate.<\/p>  <p>  Every Deputy has a duty with a Bill like this to peruse the Bill and take advice on it, look at international practices and try to sanitise the ferocious nature of this Bill.  That is merely what we were doing with our amendments.  I do not want to be critical of the Bills Office but there was a problem with it on several fronts regarding names on the amendments.  One or two of them were sent in without the names of people who did not want to be on them but then they were added.  It is a pity because it is a very fraught issue and people have reasons for not supporting an amendment or for supporting it.  The Minister said he was not going to break his word and his commitment given to the people during the referendum.  When the three-day period was discussed I refrained from getting involved and commenting on it.  We know that came from the Minister's colleague who told us all that it was going in for good reasons.  The Minister described it in other terms on Committee Stage.  <\/p>  <p>  Dr. Peter Thompson told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution that 40 years ago the Parliament in Westminster passed a Private Members' Bill ensuring that doctors who performed abortion under certain circumstances would not be performing an unlawful act.  Despite the fact that this was amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 all subsequent attempts to have the Act amended have failed.  I believe the same will happen here in respect of positive life-affirming amendments.  That is of serious concern.<\/p>  <p>  The most striking aspect of the Bill and indeed of the majority of the amendments before us is the total absence of any positive reference to the unborn child.  That is what I feel so strongly and passionately about, as do many people who voted.  They had the heads of the Bill but they had no feeling of what the outcome would be or what legislation would come before us.  They voted to repeal the eighth amendment and rightfully handed the duty of legislating to the Oireachtas Members elected for the time being.  I am privileged to be one of them for the moment.<\/p>  <p>  I am doing my best to ensure the Bill is sanitised and reflects the people whatever which way they voted.  We had many debates, interaction, canvassing and everything else in an honest effort to engage, to find out and imagine what might be put before us after the eighth amendment was removed.  People on the Government side like to think about polls.  I am not a big man for polls but in the exit poll 44% who voted \"Yes\" did not realise they would be paying for abortions and did not want to be paying for them. <\/p>  <p>  The protections afforded to the unborn child and mother which were guaranteed by the eighth amendment no longer remain in place.  T&aacute; siad imithe.  They are gone.  The people have that on their hands.  They voted for that and we have to accept democracy.<\/p>  <p>  That being said, the heads of the Bill, as they were presented to us, and indeed the Bill before us now, should not be seen as a blank slate from which we can draw the most extreme conclusions.  Our laws in this area and the amendments which seek to modify them ought to express the guiding and deepest principles of our nation.  That is where we are in 2018.  I see nothing in the majority of the amendments before us which gave expression to that view.  They are by a significant majority devoid of any reference to the right of the unborn child to die a painless death where possible.  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae is right, we did meet several people who travelled here to educate us, whose lives were intended to be ended in the womb by abortion but they survived by some miracle.  They were aborted and left to die but thankfully in both cases that I met a nurse or a paramedic had compassion and offered some sustenance and they are now adults and have families themselves.<\/p>  <p>  Those experiences left a deep impression on me and on anyone who cares to listen.  We know that when they tried to speak here and book hotels to express their views the hotels were picketed and threatened.  That is water under the bridge now but it is important to recognise that.  No matter what happens here, or when this Bill is finished, and we are not delaying it by one minute, history will record what we said and did and how we voted.  Only time will tell what that history will be.  We know the history in England and America, safe legal and rare, but there have been millions of abortions.  It is a slippery slope. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800073#AAAA00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1543440900,"counter":639,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 28 deals with the possibility of abortion on the grounds of disability and in particular for conditions such as Down's syndrome.  For all the wrongs that have taken place in this country over the past century we can be proud of how we cherish Irish citizens born with Down's syndrome.  This legislation looks as if it will bring an end to this because all the European countries with similar liberal abortion regimes have seen the number of people born with Down's syndrome dwindle to almost zero.  In the UK, 90% of children diagnosed with Down's syndrome are aborted and in Denmark that number is 100%.  There is now a test which can screen for Down's syndrome with 99% accuracy at ten weeks, two weeks before the 12-week limit for abortion on demand under this legislation.<\/p><p>In an article in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>on 24 May, the day before the referendum, the Minister for Health said the Government specifically excluded disability as grounds for abortion in the legislation.  In a post on a Twitter account during the campaign the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, reproduced a graphic design from Fine Gael's head office to explain the Government's abortion proposal stating that termination on grounds of disability is prohibited.  Both these statements were absolutely and totally false as it stands and there is no provision in the Bill that prohibits abortion on the grounds of disability.  As abortion campaigners admitted during the referendum campaign and, as has been said many times in the House, the availability of screening tests can detect a range of disabilities and genetic abnormalities as early as the third week of pregnancy.  There is nothing in the Bill to in any way prohibit children who test positive for these conditions being aborted within the 12-week time limit.

It is estimated that there are 100 million missing women in the world today due to gender selective abortion and infanticide.  To give Deputy Chambers some of the facts in that regard, I note that in China the sex ratio for the generation born between 1985 and 1989 was 108 men for every 100 women.  By the generation born between 2000 and 2004, it was 124 for every 100 women.  In some provinces, it is at unprecedented levels of 130 men for every 100 women.  In countries like Taiwan, South Korea, Pakistan, India, Armenia and Azerbaijan, they are also having major problems with this.  In India, there is a radical gender ratio divergence because for economic, social and cultural reasons, unfortunately and shockingly, they favour sons over daughters.  These facts can be seen clearly by anyone who takes a second or two to investigate them.  People might think this only happens in these particular countries, but it is happening in western countries also.  I am happy to let Deputy Chambers understand that a lecturer in statistics at Imperial College London says that among immigrant groups from these countries, there is clear evidence of a trend and that the only reliable available explanation consistent with a statistically significant gender shift observed in the census data is gender selective abortion.<\/p>  <p>  It is shocking to me that this could or would happen, yet it is happening in western countries.  It is happening in Canada, Britain and the United States of America.  Deputy Chambers should realise that it is happening to such an extent that Labour Party MP Naz Shah, the shadow women and equality minister in the United Kingdom, has called for a ban on gender selective abortion in Britain.  The Labour Party in Britain is no bastion of pro-life views but it knows non-invasive pregnancy testing at nine weeks makes it possible to identify the gender of the unborn child and to have an abortion on that basis.  The Labour Party knows that is happening in Britain.  I do not think Irish people are morally superior to British people.  We live in a globalised society and there are many people from these cultures living in Ireland who share the views people have in India and China.  It is clear that this is possible under the legislation.  It is clear in the legislation that this is legal.  All I am saying is that we should follow the advice and example of the British Labour Party and lay down a clear marker that gender selective abortion will not be allowed here.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to disability in respect of which the following is very important.  In an earlier contribution, the Minister, Deputy Harris, said it was important for the Government to stick with the general gist of the debate around the referendum.  The Minister noted that before the referendum, people were saying \"Don't trust politicians because when they legislate, what they introduce will be radically different to what they articulated in advance of the referendum.\"  In February, the Minister said there would absolutely not be a right to have an abortion on the basis of disability in the Bill.  He said that would explicitly not be allowed.  Non-invasive pregnancy testing at nine weeks is available in Ireland and the results are available within three days.  That will tell one what disability may be present within the pregnancy.<\/p>  <p>  It is absolutely practical and feasible under the legislation as drafted for a person to have an abortion on the basis of disability.  It allows for it.  This is one of the issues that motivated many people on our side of the debate when the referendum was happening.  I was at a public meeting in Kerry on Monday and two women who had voted \"Yes\" told me they had done so on the understanding that under the legislation, it would be explicitly illegal to have an abortion on disability grounds.  It is not.  It is explicitly allowed because an abortion without indication is allowed up to 12 weeks.  By definition, that allows it to happen.<\/p>  <p>  People will say this will not happen in Ireland.  However, we need only look at our nearest neighbour where there is an organisation called Don't Screen Us Out.  I ask Members to think about that for a second.  In the 21st century, people with disabilities in Britain have come together to create an organisation with that name to ask able-bodied people not to select out people with disabilities before birth.  To quote the statistics from a government health body in Britain, the birth rates for children with Down's syndrome are falling by approximately 13% because 90% of children diagnosed in the womb with Down's syndrome are, unfortunately, aborted.  It would be a very strong message for us to send if we say we will protect people with disabilities 100% under this legislation.  We should simply provide in the Bill for the promise the Minister made before the referendum took place.<\/p>  <p>  If Members are looking for another example from a European country, the minister for health in the Netherlands was asked what would happen if the right to choose led to a situation in which no more children with disabilities were born.  The Minister said \"Well that is something we would have to get used to.\"  That is a startling situation.  Anyone who believes a gap should be left in the legislation in this regard must look into his or her own heart and ask whether that is fair.  There are people on the other side who are decent and who want abortion rights.  There are decent people whose instinct is not to restrict those in any way at all because they believe access is so important.  However, all I say is that in these two situations, we should be able to take a step towards each other to provide some protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800074#BBBB01200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1543442100,"counter":652,"content":"<p>When it comes to termination on the grounds proposed - race, gender and disability - the Bill clearly makes it an offence that carries a prison sentence of up to 14 years and it does so by stating the starting position is that it is an offence to procure and aid.  It is a wide ranging group of offences, except in certain circumstances, none of which include race, disability, gender or anything else to do with the condition of the foetus.  After 12 weeks, no one can seek or be involved in a termination in any way on the grounds set out in the amendment - disability, race, gender or anything else, other than what is stated very clearly in the legislation - a fatal foetal abnormality, a risk to the life of the mother or a serious risk to the health of the mother.

That is what the Bill states and it could not be stronger in disallowing terminations on grounds of disability.<\/p>  <p>  There is a counter argument that it does not state before 12 weeks and that, theoretically, a woman could undergo screening and decide that she will have an abortion on those grounds.

Let us play it out.  What would happen if we were to pass this amendment is that if there were screening to determine gender, the law would state something along the lines that a woman could have a termination if the foetus was male but could not if the foetus was female.  That would be the essential implication.  If there were screening for a disability, the law would state that if the foetus was deemed to be healthy, the pregnancy could be terminated, but if the foetus was deemed to have a disability, it could not be terminated.  That is what would actually happen.<\/p>  <p>  Let us talk about race.  If we were able to screen to determine the race of the foetus, there would be a situation where if it was of a certain race or races, a termination would be allowed, but if it was of a certain other race or races, it would not be allowed.<\/p>  <p>  There are people who passionately believe in the protection of life during pregnancy and I am not casting aspersions on anybody.  The assertion that the Bill allows for termination on all of these grounds is incorrect.  It could not be stronger in disallowing it and doctors to whom I have spoken about amendments such as this have said they get the issue and that the Bill states very clearly that a termination is not allowed, except in the four areas I mentioned.  They have said the moment a grey area was introduced such as a hierarchy of permissable grounds, there would be a question about which gender or disability, for example.  The question would be raised as to whether it was Down's syndrome, an intellectual or a physical disability.  That would start to make life very grey and make the legislation very confusing.  Several doctors have said that in their view it would weaken protections which disallow termination on the grounds of disability because it would start a conversation about whether a termination could be carried out, depending on the disability.  Ultimately, we cannot live in a world where any woman would ever be in a situation before 12 weeks where she would be told that she could have a termination if it was one gender but not the other, that she could have a termination if the foetus was healthy but not unhealthy, or that she could have a termination if it was of a certain race but not of a certain other race.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800075#CCCC00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1543442100,"counter":655,"content":"<p>That is not what the amendment states at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800075#CCCC00400","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1543442100,"counter":656,"content":"<p>That is not something that could ever be implemented in our society.

Ideally, it should be withdrawn, but certainly it should be opposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800075#CCCC00500","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1543442100,"counter":657,"content":"<p>Deputy Donnelly has definitely misconstrued the amendment.  He has his own interpretation which he is entitled to have, but it is certainly wrong.  What we are looking for is reasonable and fair.  The Minister gave himself a pat on the back earlier for sticking to what he had promised the people before the referendum.  He did state abortion would not be allowed on the grounds of disability.  We just want to have safeguards and that is all we are asking him for.<\/p>  <p>  We hear the Government talk about how inclusive we are becoming as a society and how we are giving equality to all of the people.  We have seen the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ratified after a scandalously long period of ten years, yet here we are unwilling to provide any safeguard to protect the lives of unborn children who may have disabilities.  I find that very hard to stomach.<\/p>  <p>  As somebody who came from the education profession, who strongly and firmly believes in treating every child equally, who strongly believes in inclusion in society and inclusive schools and who strongly believes in giving everybody a fair chance, what we are saying to society?  Are we saying some people deserve to live and others do not because that is the way it appears?  This is a fair and reasonable amendment and it is beyond me how the Minister could overlook it.<\/p>  <p>  On gender selection, I remember some months before the referendum being absolutely shocked after I had discussions with a couple of women.  They told me that when they had been expecting their babies, they had gone to well known maternity hospitals in Dublin and received a high standard of treatment, for which they were very grateful.  However, they mentioned to me that one of the ladies had asked to be given information on the sex of her baby and had been told quite firmly by a nurse that they could not give her that information.  When she asked why, she was told that a high number of women who had asked the sex of their baby had not returned to the hospital.  We can draw our own conclusions from this.  I am just stating I would be worried about it.
