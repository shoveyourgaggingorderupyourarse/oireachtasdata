the surge in Covid-19 cases across the country;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the continued public health guidelines and restrictions and their effects on employment and people&rsquo;s movement;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the consequences for many thousands of workers across the country;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the likelihood that other counties may join Dublin and Donegal in higher levels of restrictions in the coming weeks;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the Government rhetoric of &lsquo;in this together&rsquo; is contradicted by the cuts to the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the ending of the eviction ban and rent increases;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the need for the income of all workers and their households to be guaranteed in order to allow for the successful implementation of the necessary public health measures;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that in recent weeks over 19,000 new claimants have applied for the PUP, reflecting the consequences of the current surge; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the increases in those claiming the PUP in areas affected by the recent restrictions, with Dublin, for example, now accounting for over 85,000 claimants in total with 10,000 new claimants directly following the increased restrictions; <\/blockquote>condemns: <blockquote> \t&mdash; that on 17th September, the Government moved to reduce the PUP for the second time;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; this move, which reduced the payments to over 217,000 people by &euro;50, with many others seeing a reduction of &euro;100 per week;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; these cuts which come on top of an earlier reduction that affected over 60,000 workers in June;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the Government added a new requirement for all recipients of the PUP to be seeking work;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that on 1st September, the State reduced the amount of subsidy to employers in receipt of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which has had an impact on many workers&rsquo; pay;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that this entailed a reduction for workers from a headline figure of &euro;410 to &euro;203 per week; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the Government did this with no attempt to ensure employers availing of the scheme would top-up the income of workers who faced this cut; <\/blockquote>recognises that: <blockquote> \t&mdash; the fight against Covid-19 is ongoing with future surges and waves that will continue to restrict employment and movement across the country; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; those workers affected will need income guarantees to cope with the ongoing effects of the pandemic; <\/blockquote>calls on the Government to: <blockquote> \t&mdash; immediately reverse the cuts to the PUP introduced on 17th September;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure that all workers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic are supported with a minimum payment of &euro;350 per week, including those over the age of 65 and seasonal workers;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure that workers in the taxi, arts, entertainment, events, hospitality and tourism industries, and others whose industries are specifically affected and show no sign of returning to pre-Covid-19 levels of activity in the medium term, are supported with tailored and targeted schemes, involving step-down payments to allow for partial returns to work in an ongoing Covid-19 crisis;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; remove the requirement for all recipients of the PUP to be seeking work;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; review, in the interests of equality, all other social welfare payments, including disability, pensions, jobseekers and others with a view to establishing a universal minimum welfare payment of at least &euro;350 per week to lift all in Irish society out of poverty;

earnings;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; where an employer can clearly demonstrate an inability to pay top-ups to their employees, that workers&rsquo; incomes continue to be supported by the State, and that this be funded through a Covid-19 levy on large profitable enterprises; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; where a complaint against an employer is upheld by the Workplace Relations Commission or Labour Court under the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, regarding deductions from an employee&rsquo;s pay, that employer shall lose their entitlement to the EWSS.&quot; <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>The essence of this motion is a call to reverse the cutbacks in the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment and restore it to &euro;350.  The budget being introduced in the D&aacute;il next Tuesday should include a provision to that effect.  I want to make a point to every single Government backbencher and every Deputy from Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  These Members will be under a lot of pressure to vote for the budget.  Most of them will have no problem with it whatever.  However, if they are opposed to the cut to the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment, they must vote for this motion tonight.  I will be watching the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party backbenchers very carefully to see which way they vote.  The majority of many of these Members' constituents and voters will want them to vote for this motion because they are opposed to the cut.  <\/p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment was cut on 17 September to &euro;300 for some people and &euro;250 for others.  In other words, a cut was made of &euro;100 a week for some and &euro;50 a week for others.  In fact, the Government planned further cutbacks.  It planned to cut the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment back to a maximum of &euro;250 in February and &euro;203 in April. <\/p><p>To be clear, these cuts do not affect people on high or medium incomes.  They are affecting low-income people and families.  These people have not been slightly affected by the pandemic.  They have been hit very hard.  They are out of work as a result of the pandemic.  Apart from people who have contracted the virus and suffered ill health and worse as a result, these people are among the hardest hit.  The Government is hitting them to the tune of &euro;50 or &euro;100 a week, with more to come.<\/p><p>Who are the 200,000 people on the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment?  We are told that one in four works in the accommodation and food sectors, that is, 51,000 people.  Many of them are arts workers or taxi drivers.  A large proportion of them are young and work in precarious jobs.  These are people whose standard of living is precarious at the best of times.  We know for sure that they have not been living the high life in recent months.  The payment is being used first and foremost to keep a roof over their heads, put food on the table and keep the wolf from the door.  This motion aims to support and advance the interests of those people.<\/p><p>A simple and obvious question arises.  Why was it right, proper and reasonable to give &euro;350 to people locked out of work as a result of the virus in March and April if it is not okay to pay them now, despite the fact that their circumstances have not changed?  Why is it okay to pay people &euro;250 or &euro;300 a week now, with the threat of further cuts, when that was not sufficient at the start of the year?  When the cuts introduced on 17 September were being prepared during the summer months, the Government and the Minister may have thought there would not be much of an outcry because the numbers availing of the payment were decreasing.  The virus was under a degree of control and its incidence in society was in decline.  However, we now have the opposite situation.  The virus and the restrictions are now on the increase.  If the virus is strengthening, the supports for those it has hit must be strengthened as well.  I see that in County Donegal, which has been on level 3 for some time, the number of people who were forced to apply for the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment increased last week by almost 2,000.  That is indicative.  If level 3 applies throughout the country, with the possibility of having to move to level 4 or worse in the weeks ahead, it seems fairly obvious that the number of people who need the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment will increase, not decrease.  It is unacceptable to ask an increased number of people to survive on &euro;250 a week when their job would have paid a multiple of that and they have families to feed and dependants to provide for.  This is a further argument for reversing these cuts at the very least.  <\/p><p>The other argument against the motion was made yesterday morning by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, in an interview on Cork's Red FM.  He said that the country cannot afford to pay a &euro;350 Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment if it is to be in place until next April.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach said it might be necessary to keep paying it after that.<\/p> <p>This is a question that is in the minds of many ordinary people and, for them, it is a legitimate question which the movers of the motion need to answer, and I am going to attempt to answer it.<br\/><br\/>The basic point is that Ireland is a wealthy country.  There is a serious amount of wealth in this country but it is very poorly distributed.  In fact, a tiny minority of people control the majority of the wealth.  We have seen already how the Government turned its back on the opportunity to go after &euro;14 billion in back tax from one of the biggest corporations in the world, Apple.  We also have a situation, as <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>rich list informed us, where a mere ten individuals own and control between them a combined wealth of &euro;50 billion.<br\/><br\/>I put it to the Minister and to the Government that it is obscene for the Government to say to some of the lowest income people in society, who have been hit hardest by the pandemic, who are locked out of their jobs as a result of the virus, that they are the ones who must tighten their belts and who must make sacrifices, while it will not even entertain the idea of a debate on the issue of wealth taxes.  We need more than a debate on wealth taxes; we need wealth taxes to be introduced.<br\/><br\/>I will finish on the point on which I began.  We have a budget next Tuesday.  That budget should do many things, but two of the things it should do are to restore the &euro;350 pandemic unemployment payment and to introduce serious wealth taxes in order to pay that and other necessary measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700003#A00200","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602061800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, surprised the nation on Monday night not by his cynical attack on NPHET, not by his undermining of public health advice in general in an extremely dangerous way, but by his newfound concern for ordinary people.  All of a sudden, Deputy Leo Varadkar is a champion of mental health, opposed to poverty and stands up for the ordinary worker.  He forgot how it was his Government which slashed the budget for mental health in the last term.  He forgot that, just last week, he voted against a motion to eradicate child poverty.  Most of all, he forgot about his actions in regard to the ordinary worker because he said nobody on NPHET will have to go onto the PUP of &euro;350, or now &euro;300 or less, as a result of going to level 5.  He did not mention, of course, that he is not going to have to either.<\/p><p>What he also did not mention is that his Government is responsible for cutting this already inadequate amount of money.  He bears responsibility for that.  He also failed to mention that, earlier this year when he was Taoiseach and when the Government started talking about cutting the &euro;350 payment, I challenged him to live on &euro;350 per week, which was the sum before he cut it.  He did not take me up on that offer, nor has any Minister.<\/p><p>For the Government, it seems that a cut of &euro;50 in people's weekly income is not a big deal.  What is &euro;50 for them?  For a Government Minister, &euro;50 is a lunch or a bottle of wine, but for families across the country, &euro;50 is the groceries for half a week or more, the gas bill for a month or a few weeks of electricity.  The sum of &euro;50 may be spare change for the Taoiseach on his &euro;550 a day salary but for those on low incomes, whether the Government knows it or not, it is the difference between being able to get by in lockdown and simply not being able to get by.  We have a Government of millionaires protecting the billionaires and hammering ordinary people.<\/p><p>Thousands of pub and restaurant workers are out of work today as a result of the Government moving to level 3 last night.  Thousands more retail and other workers fear they could be next.  They need and are crying out for support but the Government is turning its back on them.  In March, the Government accepted that no one should be driven into poverty or homelessness by following the health advice.  That is what the &euro;350 payment was about: it was the Government accepting that that is the minimum people needed to survive.  Now, however, this Government of millionaires is telling workers that &euro;350 a week is too much for them.<\/p><p>These are hard-working people who have sacrificed a lot to fight the pandemic.  They have lost their jobs and the Government wants to take their dignity away too.  It is time to reverse the cut to the PUP and to restore the &euro;350 payment.  Why does the Government say it cannot do it?  During Question Time yesterday, the Taoiseach came out and simply said that we cannot afford to do it.  It is funny, but we never hear the Government say it cannot afford to hire another special political adviser or to pay another full salary for a Minister of State.  The line only ever appears to be trotted out when it comes to supporting ordinary people.<\/p><p>It is a lie.  The idea that we cannot afford to pay people a minimum of &euro;350 a week to survive is a lie.  The reality is there is huge wealth in this country but the Government of millionaires is more focused on protecting the billionaires from taxes than it is on protecting ordinary people from poverty and from homelessness.  The reason the Government says we simply cannot do it is because it is unwilling to touch the amassed wealth of the super-wealthy and the billionaires in this country, it is unwilling to tax the massive profits of the corporations and it is unwilling to go after the likes of the Larry Goodmans, the Denis O'Briens and the elites in this country who have huge amounts of money.  It is unwilling to do it, but it is willing to make the supposedly hard political choice to stick the boot into ordinary people.<\/p><p>The truth is Ireland has the fifth highest number of billionaires in the world <i>per capita<\/i>.  The truth is Ireland is the fifth richest country in the world<i>per capita<\/i>.  There is enormous wealth in this society but the Government refuses to go after it because that is the nature of the capitalist system that it defends and the rule of profit that it defends.  There is a growing movement across Europe about who is going to pay for the coronavirus crisis, a movement which says ordinary people, workers across Europe, should stand together and we should refuse to pay.  We are not paying for this crisis.  Instead, we are calling for a Covid tax on the super-wealthy and the big corporations to pay for this crisis.<\/p><p>I will give an example of the amount of wealth that exists within our society.  One of the four demands of this movement for a Covid tax is the idea of a tax on the assets of investment funds and holding companies.  An emergency 1% tax on the assets of investment funds and holding companies in Ireland would bring in almost &euro;24 billion and it would still leave those companies with hundreds of billions of euro.  That is taking 1 cent from every &euro;1 of these holding companies and investment funds, a drop in their vast ocean of wealth.  A tax on property transfers at 2% would raise over &euro;1 billion.  Increases in tax on net corporate profits exceeding &euro;5 million and a wealth tax would bring in over &euro;10 billion between them.  Instead, the Government prefers to cut the income of some of the poorest in this State.<\/p><p>Many people realise that this rule of profit is what is responsible for the ignoring of the public health advice this week and for saying we cannot afford to pay people the minimum of &euro;350.  Among people who realise that is the nature of the capitalist system, many will say we cannot afford that system.  We cannot afford a system which puts short-term private profit first and which refuses to pay the basics for people to survive in the context of a global pandemic.  We simply cannot afford that system.  We need a different system, a socialist system, based on public ownership and democratic control of the vast sources of wealth, so that everybody can have a decent life.<\/p><p>To conclude, I want to make a particular point aimed at the Green Party.<\/p> <p>It should be ashamed of itself.  Its Members stood in the election claiming to stand for social and economic justice.  They claimed to stand for tackling inequality.  Despite that, only a small number of months in the door, they have already signed off on the cut to the PUP and, without so much as a squeak out of them, are agreeing to drive thousands into poverty.  Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies have been more sly, which is typical of the Fianna F&aacute;il approach.  They speak out of one side of their mouths and are supposedly campaigning to restore the &euro;350 but are actually letting it be cut.  Presumably, they will vote in favour of that cut in next week's budget.  Green Party Members have not even done that.  They have just sat there silently like a schoolchild in the principal's office doing whatever they are told to do by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  Those Green Party Members who previously spoke out against cuts to social welfare and in favour of social equality should speak up now.  They should support this motion to restore the PUP's &euro;350 payment, support arts and entertainment workers and taxi drivers, demand that the Government does likewise in next week's budget, and vote against any budget that attacks ordinary people further by maintaining this cut.<\/p> <p> We should remember where these cuts came from and the drumbeat of calls to cut the PUP, which was led by Mr. McDonagh from Supermac's and other businesses.  It was part of an assault on ordinary workers generally because businesses wanted to drive down general wages in our economy.  This is linked to yesterday's pathetic 1% increase in the minimum wage.  It is about using the pandemic to reshape the economy in the interests of the 1% and to drive down wages, conditions and rights generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700004#B00200","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602062400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;

<\/blockquote>  <p>I fully recognise the hardship that the Covid-19 pandemic has imposed on families and communities across our country.  When the pandemic first struck in March, the Government acted swiftly and decisively to introduce a range of income, employment and business supports that were unprecedented in scale.  The PUP and the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, were introduced practically overnight and ensured that hundreds of thousands of people were supported and incomes were protected.<\/p><p>The PUP was introduced by my Department as an emergency measure and was originally intended to be a temporary six- to 12-week payment.  It is important to remember that, when it was introduced in March, no one believed it would still be in place six months later.  It was introduced as a flat payment of &euro;350.  The flat payment was not perfect and, as many Deputies will be aware, it attracted plenty of criticism at the time, particularly in cases where people were being paid much more than while they were working.  The flat rate payment allowed us to issue payments to more than 600,000 people at speed and ensure that no one was left without an income.  It was a case of speed trumping perfection.  We needed to get money to people quickly, and that is exactly what we did.  Unfortunately, the impact of Covid-19 has been deeper and will last much longer than anyone anticipated in March.<\/p><p>The Government remains absolutely committed to supporting people impacted by the pandemic.  That is why we have kept the PUP open for new applicants and extended it until April 2021.  This means that what was originally supposed to be a 12-week payment will now be in place for more than a year.  By extending the PUP, the Government has ensured that anyone who loses his or her employment due to Covid-19 over the coming months, including those who have returned to work but are now affected by the new level 3 restrictions, can avail of this support.<\/p><p>In order to extend the payment and ensure that we could continue to support those who needed it most, we had to ensure that the rates of payment were sustainable in the long term.  In linking the payment to prior earnings, we have sought to protect those on the lowest incomes.  For example, people whose prior incomes were less than &euro;200 per week receive &euro;203.  They continue to be better off than when they were working.  People who previously earned between &euro;200 and &euro;300 per week receive a payment of &euro;250.  Most people on the &euro;250 payment are being paid in line with their pre-Covid incomes, which were &euro;248 on average.  Anyone whose prior income was more than &euro;300 per week receives a payment of &euro;300 per week.  Approximately 129,500 people, or almost 60% of payment recipients, are being paid at the &euro;300 rate.  On average, this represents in excess of 60% of prior average income for this group of workers.<\/p><p>It is important to point out that, where people have dependent adults or children, they have the option of applying for a jobseeker's payment, which may actually be more financially beneficial to them.<\/p><p>Contrary to what some Deputies opposite might say, the steps the Government has taken throughout Covid-19 have helped to protect people on the lowest incomes.  This is clearly supported by research undertaken by the ESRI, which found that 400,000 families would have seen their disposable incomes fall by more than 20% in the absence of policy measures such as the PUP.<\/p><p>This week, my Department issued payments valued at &euro;55.2 million to 205,590 people in receipt of the PUP.  To date, the scheme has supported approximately 800,000 individuals with a total spend of just over &euro;3.6 billion.  This spend is expected to increase to over &euro;5.2 billion by April 2021.  To put these figures in context, the amount of money spent on the PUP to date equates to over twice the total amount spent on jobseeker's allowance in all of 2019.<\/p><p>In this discussion, we need to be conscious of the other people in receipt of social welfare payments, including the more than 207,000 people currently on the live register.  We will have a budget next week, and I must take account of all the other deserving requests from some of the most vulnerable people and sectors in our society &ndash; carers, people with disabilities and people who live alone.  We need to be fair to them also.<\/p><p>Despite what some might believe, we do not have infinite resources.  Thanks to the economic decisions taken by previous Governments, which the Deputies opposite opposed every step of the way, we are able to borrow to help us through this crisis.  However, those borrowings will still have to be repaid.  That point seems to be lost on some people in the House.<\/p><p>I wish to be clear about the requirement to be genuinely seeking work when one is in receipt of the PUP.  My Department takes, and will continue to take, a responsible and flexible approach in respect of workers who remain temporarily laid off in sectors that have not reopened due to Covid-19 restrictions and who expect to return to their employment when their sectors reopen.  If someone is impacted by restrictions and is waiting for his or her job to resume, we do not expect him or her to be looking for a job elsewhere.  However, if someone has lost a job permanently and wants some assistance to help find work elsewhere, my Department is here to help.<\/p><p>As part of the July stimulus package, the Minister with responsibility for further education, Deputy Harris, and I secured an additional &euro;200 million to expand employment, training and education supports.  Any person seeking training or education support can contact the local Intreo centre, which will be happy to assist.<\/p><p>I am aware that self-employed people face a particular challenge in returning to work.  Unlike other workers, there is no certainty as to what income a taxi driver, for example, might make upon returning to work.  To address this issue, the PUP provides for special arrangements for self-employed people, in that a person does not lose entitlement to the PUP if he or she takes up intermittent or occasional work.  This is an important feature for the self-employed, including those in the arts and entertainment sectors who may be offered infrequent gigs and still retain their pandemic unemployment payments.  As part of budget 2021, I am exploring options with a view to providing some clarity and certainty to self-employed workers in this regard.<\/p><p>As the House is aware, the TWSS and the new employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, have been important supports operated by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to employers and employees.  The Government is committed to supporting employment by means of a wage subsidy until the end of March 2021.  The TWSS, which operated from 26 March until 31 August, provided &euro;2.85 billion to ensure that employees whose employers were affected by the pandemic could receive significant income supports directly from their employers through the payroll system.  Over that period, 664,000 employees received the subsidy through the scheme.<\/p> <p>At its close, 69,500 employers had registered with Revenue for the scheme.  The temporary wage subsidy scheme was replaced with the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, from the beginning of September.  This scheme allows employers to seek wage subsidies for a broader range of employees, including new hires and seasonal workers.  Over 38,000 employers have registered with Revenue for the scheme to date.<\/p> <p> The EWSS is in addition to the extensive range of supports and grants provided across Government to help business through this pandemic.  A total of &euro;550 million has been provided through the Government's restart grant to assist businesses to meet ongoing costs while closed and help fund their reopening costs.  There are also a number of sector-specific initiatives in place to support the sectors raised by the Deputies today, including the arts, tourism and hospitality sectors.  Across Government, we will be looking at further targeted supports to assist those sectors hardest hit by the pandemic.<\/p> <p> I assure the House that the Government will continue to support people and businesses impacted by this pandemic as we have done at every stage over the last seven months.  The pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme have been unprecedented supports in their scale and reach.  They have proven to be extremely effective in maintaining incomes and insulating people against such a sudden and severe income shock.  This is obvious from research conducted by the ESRI.  In addition, data published by the Central Statistics Office in the past week showed that household disposable income has actually increased year on year by about 5%.  Central Bank data also indicate that personal savings have increased dramatically.  In fact, they have trebled in value compared with 2019.  This Government will continue to act to protect people through the worst impacts of this pandemic.  My Department alone will spend &euro;28 billion this year.  That will go towards supporting our most vulnerable, such as pensioners, carers, people with disabilities, people who live alone, lone parents and low-income families.  We have spent &euro;3.8 billion already on supporting people through the pandemic unemployment payment and we will continue that support until next April.  Nobody can predict the trajectory of the virus and the payment may well be needed beyond next April, which is all the more reason that the Government must ensure that it is set at a level which can be sustained for the longer term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700005#C00200","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett is next on the list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700006#D00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Is the Leas-Cheann Comhairle sure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700006#D00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>That is what is on my list.

It is a very timely one, given that the level 3 nationwide restrictions came into effect at midnight.  The way we support workers through income supports is particularly important at this time.  We know how quickly the number of PUP recipients increased when Dublin and Donegal went into level 3 and so we know that many workers across the State will now reapply for the PUP.  This week, over 205,000 people received the PUP.  Of those, more than 121,000 received the rate of &euro;300, down from &euro;350 previously.  According to a recent reply I received to a parliamentary question, those on &euro;300 per week had average earnings of about &euro;568 pre-Covid and so that cohort of people, which is the vast majority of those receiving the PUP, is down over &euro;200 every single week.  Others who previously earned between &euro;200 and &euro;300 a week are receiving &euro;250, so some of them are down &euro;50.  People who have lost their jobs and who are now living on a reduced income still have to pay their mortgages because the mortgage break is over.  They have to pay their rent because the ban on evictions that gave these workers and families that small protection that ensured they would not be made homeless in the midst of a global pandemic is gone.<\/p>  <p>  Electricity prices increased at the start of this month when Electric Ireland increased its electricity rates.  Increases in carbon tax have also occurred and there has been mention of an increase in the public service obligation or PSO levy.  We already pay some of the highest electricity prices in Europe and utility bills are building for workers and families at this time.<\/p> <p>Not only has the Government cut the PUP, it has also taken away basic protections for people at a time they need them most.  The Minister is shaking her head but the mortgage payment break and the ban on evictions are gone now.  Those protections are gone.<br\/><br\/>A recent survey commissioned by MABS suggests that up to 1 million people are worried about meeting their debt repayments.  The Minister made reference to the fact that disposable income is on the rise but the reality is that up to 1 million people are worried about debt.  MABS has said that a &quot;tsunami of debt&quot; is coming down the track.  I carried out an online survey last month.  Almost 500 people participated, with nearly equal representation from urban and rural Ireland.  A total of 94% of the respondents were concerned about household debt, 80% have seen an increase in their debt since Covid-19 in March, 48% have had to increase their borrowings, 58% are in arrears with certain payments, including utility bills, while 38% were in arrears on their mortgage or rent.  What was especially stark about this survey was the number of people who left comments, told their story or shared their own experience.  More than 300 of the survey respondents did so.  I will give the House a flavour of the comments that were left.  One person commented: <\/p><blockquote>\tTwo jobs lost through pandemic, both permanently gone.  Had to cancel health insurance that we have had for 30 years due to not being able to afford it anymore. <\/blockquote> <p>Another commented:<\/p><blockquote>\tShopping on weekly basis is gone as we don't have it, as bills come first... [the] impact on our mental health and physical health is unreal.  I am trying to keep things together for the sake of my family.  I cry most nights going to bed so my son and husband don't see how much it's taken a toll.  My husband has never been out of work and he is finding this extremely hard.  <\/blockquote> <p>Another said:<\/p><blockquote>\tWe can barely manage to do a weekly shop and feed our kids at the moment and with the mortgage break up now, there's a possibility of homelessness.  <\/blockquote> <p>Another commented: <\/p><blockquote>\tI'm about to finish my mortgage break and still can't go back to my job.  Worried about getting into arrears.   <\/blockquote> <p>Another commented:<\/p><blockquote>\tNot sleeping, anxiety, depression, thinking what's the point anymore. <\/blockquote> <p>Yet another commented as follows:<\/p><blockquote>\tCan't put into words how horrible it is to have to say no to your children when you just can't afford things.   <\/blockquote> <p>What was most stark about that survey was not so much the impact of the loss of income but the impact on mental health, which is something I hope the Government will address in the forthcoming budget.  The survey makes clear that not only do people need income support, they also need mental health support because this is something that will have a long term impact on many workers and families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700006#D03300","speaker":"1604","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for tabling this motion.  I read in a newspaper this morning, as I am sure the Minister did, that some of her colleagues are anxious to get rid of the image of Fine Gael as being the nasty party and she has the opportunity to do so here.  The cut to the PUP, coming as it did at a time when advisers were being appointed to Government and some Deputies, although not me or my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in and others, are accepting a pay increase was appalling.  I do not know if the Government is just tone deaf to what is happening.  Is it just going to push on regardless?  Is it not aware of what is going on?  My colleague outlined the mental health impacts and I commend her on conducting the aforementioned survey and reaching out to people.  It is hard to say no to one's children when one cannot afford something.  It is really hard to make a choice between paying for electricity, which is increasing in price and the Government did nothing about that, or car insurance.  All of these things are happening.  Real life is continuing for people and all the while they are having the only income support available cut from under them.  The cut involved is enormous.  As Teachta Kerrane has pointed out, the average cut for some is more than &euro;200 per week.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the role of the temporary wage subsidy and employment wage subsidy schemes and I want to reference the plight of Aer Lingus workers.  She and I have spoken about this previously but it may come as a shock to her to learn that the issue has not gone away.  These people are still experiencing difficulties dealing with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, getting their forms stamped by the company and dealing with issues at Intreo offices.  The net effect is that some are being left with only &euro;75 per week.  As the Minister knows, due to the failure of the T&aacute;naiste to stand up to the banks, mortgage breaks are now coming to an end.  Mortgage payments are falling due and in some instances, through no fault of their own, people will end up in default because &euro;75 per week is just not going to cut it.  I ask her to consider appointing a person in her Department to liaise directly with Aer Lingus workers and the staff in Intreo offices.  The approach is a bit hit-and-miss, which is not doing anyone any favours at the moment.  These people are absolutely desperate.   <\/p>  <p>  The Minister talked about how effective the PUP and other supports have been.  She extolled the virtues of the various schemes and that is fair enough but when they were put in place, people might have had a small amount of savings and might have been able to access a payment break on their mortgage.  They did not have to prepare their children to go back to school.  All of those debts have now fallen due, along with an increase in the cost of electricity.  Their costs are going up as the Government is cutting the supports available.  Nobody is suggesting that our resources are infinite but politics is about making choices.  The Government made a choice to cut supports to a group of people who have had their work taken from them through no fault of their own.  They were working hard in viable businesses.  They are available for work but there is no work available.  People in the entertainment industry, for example, are available for work but they cannot work.  It is not the case that they will not work; they cannot work at the moment and they need support to get them through.  Their jobs were viable before they were shut down and the hope is that those jobs will come back again.  We know that 1 million people are worried about the tsunami of domestic debt that is coming at them.  It is the job of the Government to look after their mental health and their financial well-being.  The Government must give them the small amount of support that they will need to be able to get through the next few months.  They want to be back at work. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the plight of carers, who have been long-neglected by this and the previous Government.  I sincerely hope that she is not trying to pit carers, people with disabilities and those in receipt of the old age pension against those workers who have just lost their jobs because that would be an awful thing to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700007#E00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063600,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Covid-19 has been an earthquake for our economy and the epicentre of that earthquake has been among those in low-paid employment, predominantly in the retail, tourism and hospitality sectors.  The repercussions for them and their families have been enormous.  The introduction of the PUP was a lifeline for these workers and their families when it was introduced back in March.  However, it also highlighted the fact that our social insurance system is not fit for purpose, something that we must rectify as we emerge from this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The cuts to the PUP in mid-September came at the worst time for individuals, leaving workers and their families exposed to the impact of further public health measures and we cannot underestimate that impact.  As the State finds itself in level 3 this morning, the loss of jobs is inevitable.  In my own county of Donegal, PUP claims rose by 33% when we moved to level 3 just under a fortnight ago.  Instead of consolidating support for these workers, the Government has decided that this is the time to cut them which is a grave mistake.  We know that the average recipient of what is now &euro;300 per week under PUP was earning more than &euro;500 per week before being laid off, something that the Government failed to mention in its amendment.  Reversing the cuts to the PUP and reintroducing it at a rate of &euro;350 per week will offer these workers security as they face into the real and ever present prospect of unemployment in the weeks and months ahead.  <\/p>  <p>  I also want to talk about the EWSS, which is mentioned in the motion.  That scheme is not fit for purpose. <\/p> <p>As I said when it was introduced in legislation back in July, it provides no support whatsoever for workers earning below &euro;151.50 per week.  That is 153,000 workers who are locked out of the scheme and significantly it cuts the supports for employers for workers in comparison with the previous scheme by as much as 50% for some.<\/p> <p> As counties enter level 3, the scheme is inadequate and it needs to be addressed.  We need a scheme that guarantees 85% of take home pay for low-paid workers and that guarantees between 50% and 70% of take home pay for other workers, depending on the impact on their employers.  This virus will be with us for quite some time and we need to make sure that our income and wage supports can shield workers and families throughout this period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700007#E00300","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602064200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.

Those on the PUP have been told that they must face cuts of up to &euro;200 a month to their supports and yet this Government has seen fit to ignore the need for longer payment breaks for already hard-pressed borrowers.<\/p>  <p>  We have to be realistic.  Covid-19 will be with us for a long time to come.  Workers and businesses will require a major level of support from the Government.  Promises that we are all in this together ring hollow, particularly when the Government decides to cut supports like this.  We have certainly heard that message ringing hollow this week.  Workers and their families are facing into a period of intense disruption and uncertainty.  Many households are worried about debt and what will happen if the restrictions go on and we are forced to curtail the economy further.  We should be increasing supports and not lowering them.  We should be making the banks give loan repayment breaks, not allowing people to fall into arrears on their loans and mortgages.  We should remember that we bailed out the banks.  Now is the time for them to repay their debts.<\/p>  <p>  Household debt cannot be the inevitable consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic.  If we want to make it out of Covid-19 in one piece, we must ensure that workers and their families have access to essential financial supports now.  We are at level 3 now and NPHET has warned that if matters do not improve drastically we will be at level 5 before Christmas.

Now is the time for the Government to show leadership, to show people it understands the implications of the payment, to show that it understands that this was as mistake and to go back on this cut.  We have given D&aacute;il Deputies pay increases, we have appointed 64 special advisers, we have appointed super junior Ministers and there have been increases across the board for the Government and the establishment but ordinary people are only facing cuts.<\/p>  <p>  I found it shocking that in the Minister's earlier comment she said we must look at the comparison between carers and people with disabilities and to put them against people who have lost their jobs for no reason but the pandemic.  That is the attitude of this Government, to play the most vulnerable in society off against each other.  I am standing here asking the Minister and the Government to listen to common sense and reason for God's sake and to give this payment back to people who desperately need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700008#F00300","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1602064200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank the sponsors of this motion for bringing it forward.  This is a serious issue for people across the whole country.  Everywhere we went we came across families, even before there was a pandemic, who were living on the verge of poverty.  They are the working poor and they got up every day early in the morning, went to work and worked hard.  Yet, the level of remuneration they received from that work kept them just above the breadline and that was the case for many people.  When this pandemic came and they went on the pandemic unemployment payment of &euro;350 per week, they were in a worse situation.  Many of them have told me they have come to a situation where they have to reassess what they can do, what they can spend their money on and what they can plan for.  Holidays and so on are certainly out of the question.  Now we find the Government has cut the PUP back down to &euro;300 per week for many of them.  While the Government may try to claim that the money simply is not there for this payment to continue, the reality is we cannot afford not to protect and look after people in these circumstances.  This Government has to stand by the ordinary people of this country who are doing their best in the context of this pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Poverty is a huge issue across all sectors of our society, rural and urban, and many people are on the verge of it.  I recently spoke to someone who talked to me about young women going into his or her shop who were getting school uniforms and having to pay for them over a number of weeks because they would not have the money to pay for them straight away.  This shop owner told me that their mothers used to be in that shop 20 years ago doing the same thing and he asked if their children will be back in doing that again in 20 years time.  That tells us there is a cycle of poverty that needs to be addressed and this time of a pandemic is one when the Government should be reassessing how everything is looked at and how we look after our people.  That section of people, who work hard and who do their best, are the ones who are put to the pins of their collars.<\/p>  <p>  I know from speaking to accountants who are dealing with businesses that are trying to access the wage subsidy scheme that it is much more difficult to access than the original scheme.  They are finding it hard to access it and a whole lot of rules and regulations have been put in place which they do not need.  The Minister and the Government need to step up to the mark and protect people in these circumstances.  We have a choice here between looking after people and not looking after people.  It is as simple as that.  People can talk about the cost of it and at the end of the day, the cost of it will be people's mental health, which was referred to by Deputy Kerrane earlier on.  Many people across our society are really worried and stressed about this.<\/p>  <p>  I talked with that same shopkeeper I mentioned early about depression as well and we discussed whether or not people are depressed because they are poor or if they are poor because they are depressed.  The truth is that both of those factors are at play.  People in our society find that they are in really difficult circumstances because when they are under pressure and they feel they cannot afford the basic things in life, they cannot have a sense of future and look forward to things or try to develop a future for their children and themselves.  It is important that the Government supports this motion and restores the PUP payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700008#F00400","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1602064200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I want to speak in favour of the motion and to speak specifically about the cohort of workers who are in receipt of the payment of &euro;300 per week.  As we are in a level 3 lockdown, the inevitable consequence is that thousands more people will lose their jobs.  The Minister is telling us that approximately 129,500 people are in receipt of the &euro;300 rate and that this represents 60% of the prior average income for this group of workers.  That is the same cohort of workers who will feel the brunt of this lockdown, however, because they work in bars, restaurants, tourism and hospitality.  A lot of them are on modest incomes but a significant proportion of them are single income households with families who are earning anywhere between &euro;50,000 and &euro;80,000 per year, depending on where one works and what that establishment is.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>The Minister's suggestion that there is a jobseeker's payment that these people can move to and that those of them who have dependants will benefit on a <i>pro rata <\/i>basis by applying for a jobseeker's payment does not give us a real picture of the effects of the loss of income on that cohort.  We do not know how long the lockdown will last.  Even if it ended tomorrow, there would still be a lag effect before the relevant sectors returned.  The case in point, which all of us have articulated, is the entertainment sector.  Approximately 31,000 people in the sector have been seriously affected by this cut and would probably find themselves in that cohort.<br\/><br\/>Even if we take at face value what the Minister said on the payments of &euro;250 and the &euro;203, although I do not fully accept her argument that these people were worse off on a net basis, I still believe she has to look at those who are on the payment of &euro;300 a week because they include people with mortgages and many single income households with families.  Even when these people move to a jobseeker's payment or other such payment they will be net losers.  These are the same people who will have an obligation to pay their mortgages.  If the boiler breaks or a tyre change is needed on their car, the marginal effect of having to make these payments is much more adverse on families in that cohort.  In the context of budget discussions, I ask the Minister to revise the Government's position on that group of workers.  As we speak, that cohort of workers is not getting any breaks from the banks, as has been articulated already by the proposers and supporters of the motion.  If they fall behind on mortgage payments, I do not need to tell the Minister the consequences this would have for those families.  I ask that she take on board the pleas being made on behalf of that cohort of workers.  They are the people who go out to work every day and keep the economy going.  They have lost their jobs through no fault of their own.  Since 12 March, some of them, for example, those in the entertainment sector, will not be able to go into an Intreo office and say they can now go carrying a hod up a ladder on a building site.  They simply do not have the ability to pivot into or find work in other sectors.  This is the variable or factor that is not being taken into account.<br\/><br\/>As a Deputy, I have an excellent working relationship with officials of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection when acting on behalf of my constituents.  Those officials show professionalism <i>par excellence<\/i>when dealing with representations I make on behalf of my constituents.  The Minster, however, has a problem with Intreo.  The time lag, machinery and obstacles that apply to people in that cohort need to be sorted out.  They include the revision of forms and the seeking of further information when a person transitions from the Covid payment to a jobseeker's payment.  It causes major stress for families.<br\/><br\/>On balance, we would be better off if, for this very uncertain period, the &euro;350 payment was restored or reviewed.  That would give people some headroom to meet any overheads they have while society is going through this turmoil.  We have not seen the time lag effects of the lockdown that was announced this week.  It will have the effect of pushing more people into the Covid payment bracket.  The Government needs to revise its position in respect of the cohort of people on the &euro;300 payment.  These people are in entertainment and the tourism and allied sectors.  They have massive overheads.  They have children of schoolgoing age and car loans and we need to look after them.  When the economy comes back again they will jump back into work but we cannot put them into poverty.  That is the point I am trying to make to the Minister.  They cannot be reduced to poverty.  We need a social floor, a protection below which they will not fall.  I ask the Minister again to please consider the cohort within the &euro;300 bracket.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700008#F00500","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602064800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I thank the proposers for tabling this motion, which is very important, especially one week from the budget.  Effectively, we are talking about the very essence of a republic.  It strikes to the heart of the role of the State.  I believe the role of the State and the very essence of a republic is that it wraps its arms around citizens in times of greatest need.  There has never been an occasion when citizens have needed the protection of the State more.  I will discuss all that this incorporates over the next seven minutes or so.<\/p>  <p>  There was a time at the start of the pandemic when it genuinely seemed as if we were all in this together.  The pandemic rocked us to our core when it emerged and our responses were founded in the old principles of collectivism.  All of a sudden, things we were told could never happen started to happen very quickly.  We rid ourselves of private hospitals and had a single-tier health service because we were told we could not have a dual health service in the middle of a pandemic.  For a long time, people who argued and advocated for a ban on evictions were told such a ban would be unconstitutional.  Overnight, however, we had a ban on evictions.  We then had a recognition that the &euro;203 that had previously been paid to people who were unemployed was simply not enough to live a life of dignity.  We then made provision for a payment of &euro;350.  Across the political divide, we joined together in saying this baseline figure would give people the opportunity to live with dignity.<\/p>  <p>  I do not like to use the old phrase that a leopard does not change its spots but it certainly seems to be the reality.  As the weeks and months since the pandemic started have progressed, people have fallen back into their old ideologies.  This argument is very much about ideology and how we decide to protect our citizens.  Sudden, society is vulnerable again because our hospitals are vulnerable due to a lack of investment for decades.  As the pandemic engulfs us again, there are people whose main fear at the moment is that they may be evicted from their homes because the ban on evictions has long since gone.  In recent months, the idea has emerged, one that has been motivated by people who have exploited workers, that &euro;350 is too much.  The small amount of &euro;350, which has given people the means and capacity to feed themselves and not to have to worry about bills or where they will get their next three square meals, is suddenly considered too much.  I believe this is a fundamental debate about how and why we can provide a reasonable amount to citizens to give them the means by which they can live in dignity.  In recent weeks, the decision was made to reduce the pandemic unemployment payment to &euro;250 and &euro;200, which is simply not enough.<\/p>  <p>  I will strongly advocate for the reinstatement of the &euro;350 for those on the pandemic unemployment payment.  I do not do this naively.  I fully understand that it will be an expensive measure.  I absolutely accept that but so be it.  The need for the State to wrap its arms around its citizens and think big by providing the greatest degree of protection will never be greater.  It has been said time and again that we have access to the means to borrow.<\/p> <p>I dispute the Minister's statement that decisions taken in the past have given us the means to borrow.  This is revisionism and an attempt to validate the austerity suffered by people in this country after 2007 and to suggest it was a just approach.  I argue strongly against that.  The decisions taken during those times left individuals in positions of chaos, destroyed the recovery we could have had and prolonged the pain we suffered.  If austerity was the right approach then, we would be arguing for it now but that is not the case.  Every economist in Europe is saying that we need to flood the economy with cash.  It is suggested that, when we reopen, the cash we have will be spent as it has been.  It will not.  A sum of &euro;350 will not sit in bank accounts.  It will go into our local butchers, it will pay for shoes and it will revitalise every village, town and city in this country really quickly.  We need this money floating around the economy.  There are very strong economic arguments to invest now.  <\/p> <p> The amount being spent on the pandemic unemployment payment is mentioned several times in the amendment but there is no mention of the sums we are recouping in VAT, which would otherwise be lost.  I promise the Minister that almost every cent is being recouped for the Irish economy.<\/p> <p> I have very little time left so I will move on to the Government's amendments.  While still new to the D&aacute;il, I am fascinated by some of the commentary included in Government amendments to Opposition motions.  In many ways, this belies an ideology.  One particular line in the Government's amendment on which I would like to comment reads \"notes that those 47,900 recipients whose prior income was less than &euro;200 per week received &euro;203 this week, and are better off than when they were working\".  That is an horrific statement.  These people who are said to be better off with their extra &euro;3 are living in precarious positions, being exploited in the workplace and have absolutely no capacity to afford unaffordable childcare yet we are heralding the fact that they are receiving an extra &euro;3.  I promise the Minister that every single one of those people are feeling anxious and vulnerable and this will be scant comfort to them.<\/p> <p> Another part of the Government reads \"acknowledges that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has advised that it will take a reasonable and flexible approach in applying the &lsquo;genuinely seeking&rsquo; work condition to workers who remain temporarily laid off in sectors that have not reopened\".  The only people who will find any comfort in this are politicians who have never sat in an Intreo or social welfare office watching a person having to justify his or her poverty while being scanned and probed and having every aspect of his or her life up for discussion with an inspector.  Despite the fact that this seems to be intended as reassurance, the discretion of a social welfare officer is not the same as a legal protection and this never should be.  People need legal protections.  I will not stand by and see this become a precedent for allowing the Government to tell people not to worry as the Department has told its officials to go easy.  In the absence of legal protections, that amounts to absolutely nothing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700009#G00200","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602065400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>The Covid crisis is a serious threat to the life and limb of many people around the country.  We must do our best to reduce the number of cases within the State and do the simple things and avail of the low-hanging fruit as best we can.  I refer to working from home where possible, social distancing, wearing face coverings on public transport and in shops, and so on.<\/p>  <p>  The figures have increased worryingly over recent weeks but thankfully, hospital admissions, ICU admissions and fatalities are far lower than when cases were at a similar level at the start of the pandemic.  We have to thank our healthcare workers for employing new and better treatments to protect those who have contracted Covid.  We also have to thank those who work with older people.  They have protected them in a way in which they were not protected at the start of the Covid crisis.  It is worrying to hear of recent clusters such as the one in County Laois.<\/p>  <p>  Covid is hammering people in many ways.  The health service is being hammered.  It is now widely thought that the number of excess non-Covid deaths will be greater than that of Covid deaths because of the vast reduction in health service capacity.  The pandemic is also hammering people's mental health in a big way.<\/p>  <p>  As we are talking about today, Covid is also wiping out whole sections of the economy.  Many businesses are being totally wiped out by Covid.  This is also causing major poverty.  The truth of the matter is that the idea that we are all in this together was never true.  It was never the case that we were all in this together.  Not one person in Leinster House has lost a shilling in income during the Covid crisis.  Covid has focused much of its economic damage on those earning low incomes and on young workers.  That is where the pressure is felt.  Even with the PUP and the other supports the Government has provided, these sections of the economy have suffered radically due to the Covid crisis.<\/p>  <p>  If we want to protect workers, we need to be careful to protect their working environments both through preventative measures as regards Covid but also through being careful with restrictions.  I did some study on this issue this morning and Ireland is an outlier with regard to the severity of restrictions.  I will give an example.  There are a number of hotspots throughout Europe, including Madrid, Paris and Berlin.  All of these cities have a far greater number of cases of Covid per 100,000 of population over the last 14 days than Ireland but none has shut its restaurants.  Madrid, Paris and Berlin have kept their restaurants open.  We need to be very careful that we, as a well-paid body of politicians, do not take people's ability to work and earn an income away from them.  Counties Mayo, Kerry and Waterford all have extremely low levels of Covid in European terms but they are prevented from functioning.  That does not make sense.  We have to be careful and make sure that we do not see another rise such as we saw in April and May but we also need to make sure the country does not overstep the mark and become an outlier as regards restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  It is absolutely wrong for the Government to push these hundreds of thousands of people out of work while, at the same time, radically reducing the economic protections provided for them.  Removing the rent freeze while imposing restrictions on people's individuals' ability to earn an income, not proceeding with mortgage protections for families that are going to find it increasingly difficult to pay mortgages over the coming years, and reducing the PUP is absolutely wrong.  It is a disgrace that a person on the Minister's income would desire to reduce the income of people who have been forced out of their jobs and are now on incomes which make it impossible to pay for rent, food, housing, healthcare, education and all of the other aspects of life that are important to them.  If the Government is going to drive in a particular direction with regard to restrictions, it has a moral responsibility to help people along in economic terms and to protect them.<\/p>  <p>  When one measures the steps taken in respect of rent, mortgages and the PUP and compares them with the largesse of the Government when spending in its own circles, that largesse is absolutely incredible.  The Government feels the necessity for as many as 70 special advisers, many of whom are earning well over &euro;100,000.  The Government sees it as logical to give itself a pay rise in the middle of this pandemic.  It does not make sense whatsoever.  On the one side we are reducing the wages of people earning &euro;18,000 while, on the other side, we are increasing the wages of those on &euro;80,000.  Is any part of the Minister's mind uncomfortable with that?  Is she uncomfortable with people on such a low income being the target for wage reductions while those on substantial incomes receive pay increases?  In other words, the wealth inequality in our society is being actively pushed by the Government.  I ask the Government to think about the steps it has taken over recent weeks, to see the radical divergence between restrictions and income supports and at least to marry the two.<\/p> <p>The two should be put in the same direction.  As we go into the depths of winter with restrictions, we need to make sure we support workers.  <\/p> <p> People in this State are being told that if they experience symptoms of Covid, they should not return to work and if their children have symptoms or have been prevented from going to school, they should stay at home and mind those children.  That is all fair and well if the Government provides the income supports for them to do that but if it cuts the income legs from underneath them, they will not be able to do it and many of those individuals will find themselves in the workplace when they should not be there, thereby reducing the State's ability to fight this illness.  This is a serious illness.  We need to do the best we can to fight it but pulling the income rug from underneath people's feet at this time is not the best way to do that.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700010#H00200","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602066000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>The pandemic unemployment payment should be fully reinstated and backdated at the higher payment rate for all recipients.  The top rate of Covid-19 unemployment payment was reduced in September from &euro;350 to &euro;300 and it is due to be reduced in early in 2021 to &euro;250.  The cuts are putting thousands of individuals into poverty.  The rate of the payment should be restored for people who lose their jobs due to the imposition of level 3 restrictions in their county.  The &euro;350 payment should remain in place until at least the end of the pandemic to give anyone a chance of survival.  The last time a Government gave such a break was to the bankers in 2008, when &euro;64 billion was provided to bail them out.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government defended the measure.  Today, when ordinary people require a fraction of that expenditure, the same party defends the cuts to Ireland's most vulnerable.  This clearly underscores where the Fianna F&aacute;il and Government priorities are placed.  This is shameful.

This Government has refused to tax this wealth, including assets and investments, and as has been pointed out here already, a minimum 1% tax on that wealth could pay for what we are seeking.  Even if it did not, it would be morally correct for the Government to increase the payments to &euro;350 again.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State is a member of the Green Party, which should really consider what it is doing by supporting the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Government, members of which are clearly living in a bubble, complete with a salary for each Deputy of &euro;98,000 per annum, while telling other workers to live on peanuts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700011#J01100","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602066600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I fully support the motion, moved by the Members of People Before Profit-Solidarity and RISE.  This is very important in itself but it is even more important with what has happened this week and the way the news from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, has been received by the Government.  I specifically refer to the Trump-like reaction of the T&aacute;naiste, who rubbished the news when he got it but then told his party members, knowing full well that the news would be widely circulated, that it would happen anyway.  In the meantime, the base is getting a great boost from how the hard man is taking on the freeloaders who are putting the people who work for a living to the sword, as they will not be affected anyway.<\/p>  <p>  The motion we are debating attempts to protect those workers who are still feeling an impact from the Covid-19 response.  It is most important that the Government learns that it is not the much-lauded entrepreneur who makes business work but rather the workers staffing that business.  At the very least it is an equal partnership, with businesses becoming successful because of their workers.  The problem is that the Government does not see it that way.  The T&aacute;naiste sees freeloader workers seeking to screw money out of the State, and the State must protect the vital entrepreneur from all those workers who just want to screw extra or unwarranted money from those entrepreneurs.  I wonder how many others in the Government see it that way.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt some innovators out there are always trying to make new businesses or trying new things and they must be supported but so must the workers.  In most business there is an unequal balance between employer and worker, with the State firmly on the side of the employer when it should be on each side equally.  There is no doubt that if the State had been more balanced, the outbreak would not have been as severe as we have seen, although conditions in our hospitals would always have left things very difficult.<\/p>  <p>  What has been the common denominator in all the outbreaks?  Low pay is the main reason for them.  In this country workers cannot afford to get sick because if they do, they will not be able to pay their bills.  Nursing homes, meat factories, shops and restaurants all have low-paid workers with no rights and very little support.  There is not much surprise that these are the sectors in which we see outbreaks.<\/p>  <p>  My county of Donegal shows these indicators where the largest outbreaks are evident, as low pay is predominant and there is a high dependence on social welfare.  These people mainly work in non-unionised workplaces, and the rights of workers are the last thing on anybody's mind.  This is the case even with the workers, who may be afraid to put themselves in a position of perceived vulnerability in pushing for union representation, as they know they will be targeted by employers.  It is only by balancing the vulnerability of workers that this can be changed; we probably do not have the time to address this during the crisis so the only option is to maintain the Covid-19 payment at its previous level.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt the Covid-19 payment was introduced in a panic by the Government, which was under pressure to react quickly to what was happening on the ground.  This demonstrates how the Government naturally knows what is right but it is only when its members sit back and think that they want to penalise workers so inherently; what they are doing is wrong.  They cannot get away from that mantra of representing people \"who get up early in the morning\".  It is a problem for them.  In reality, the Government could represent all of us better by protecting workers and making it possible for them to take sick leave if required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700012#K00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1602066600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>We are all in this together; give me a break.  If the Government goes ahead with the cuts instigated for the PUP, not only will it do a great injustice to hundreds of thousands of workers who have lost their jobs and income as a result of the pandemic and the measures taken by the Government to address it, but it will also do something very dangerous in undermining the collective social solidarity that we need, now more than ever, to address the rising infection rates and the new restrictions that must be imposed, with more restrictions almost certainly coming down the line.  The Government would be playing with people's lives and livelihoods in a very dangerous way if it did not restore the PUP.<\/p>  <p>  In the self-absorbed and self-obsessed world that people like the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, seem to inhabit, where they are more interested in attacking the public health team in a cynical and politically motivated way, maybe &euro;50 or &euro;100 of a loss in income means nothing.  It may be a trifle, irrelevant to the political and self-obsessed considerations that seem to drive certain people in this Government.  For ordinary working people who are suffering, whose mental health has been affected and who have lost their jobs and incomes, &euro;50 or &euro;100 is the difference between keeping one's head above water and drowning in bills and loan or mortgage repayments that cannot be made or insurance costs.  There are daily costs that are hard enough to manage at the best of times but it becomes significantly harder when one loses a job and income is cut to &euro;350 and impossible when it is cut to &euro;300 or &euro;250.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the Government must step out of the bubble and get their heads around this.  I got messages about this all day yesterday.  <\/p> <p>For example, a musician said that he has his NCT coming up this week, and that costs &euro;55.  If he has to get his car fixed, it could cost him &euro;200.  He has the banks now crawling all over him because the Government has lifted the moratorium on mortgage repayments.  He has his landlord crawling all over him who could evict him if he cannot manage the rent.  What is that musician supposed to do?<\/p> <p> What is the taxi driver supposed to do?  In the next few months, taxi drivers whose cars are more than ten years old have to prepare now to decide whether they can afford a new car.  They cannot because they have lost a year's income.  Given the suitability test and the NCT that they have to take and the insurance they have to pay, how are they supposed to do it?  They cannot do it.  The Government needs to get their heads around this and get out of the bubble.<\/p> <p> The Government should note today the opinion polls, which show 63% of people are in favour of more severe restrictions to deal with the Covid threat.  That is a big sacrifice that people are making, just as they have made all year.  They will undermine that commitment people have to solidarity and to protecting our older and more vulnerable citizens and the front-line healthcare workers who are protecting us if they smash people's income and cut it to the point that they cannot manage.  I urge the Government to think about this.  They will be making a very dangerous mistake if they do not restore these payments.  Nothing has changed since March and April in terms of the costs that people have.  Nothing has changed in the rents or mortgages they have to pay, the insurance they have to pay, the childcare costs, the costs of feeding their family and all the rest of the costs that people have to survive, but the Government has cut their income at the same time and its measures mean hundreds of thousands more will lose their jobs.  People are willing to accept those job losses if it means that we get out of this mess and save lives, but if the Government does this, it will be stabbing in the back the people who are putting themselves on the line.<\/p> <p> I refer to some of the Government's excuses for not doing this, for instance, the cost.  Has the Government even bothered to listen to the fiscal advisory council?  I am a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which met the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC.  Yesterday, it its statement, the council made it absolutely clear there would be no fiscal problem in restoring the PUP.  In fact, if more restrictions were likely and if we continue in the period where there is grave uncertainty and large numbers of people out of work, they recommended maintaining and increasing the economic stimulus.  I asked IFAC officials directly if there was a fiscal problem with restoring the PUP payments and they said that the Government has latitude.  In fact, they were urging that money continue to be put into families, workers and households pockets for macroeconomic reasons as well as for reasons of economic justice and fairness.  That argument, therefore, is simply nonsense.  It is the Government reverting to type with a penny-pinching austerity ideology and a fundamental class prejudice about people who, through no fault of their own, must rely on social welfare payments to sustain themselves through this period.  The Government should drop that nonsense, and drop that dishonest argument that there is a fiscal imperative that requires it to cut the PUP.  IFAC does not think so.  Frankly, they are not exactly agents of the radical left.  If they are saying that, we can reasonably take it that from a fiscal point of view, it is entirely acceptable to restore the PUP.<\/p> <p> It is nauseating that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Varadkar, tried to present himself the other night on \"Claire Byrne Live\" as some sort of champion of the poor and the dispossessed.  We heard him state the reason the Government cannot restore the PUP is consideration of all the other people on lower social welfare payments.  That is a sickening argument.  In fact, the Government should increase disability, jobseeker's and all other payments to the same rate as the PUP.  The income that people on disability have to survive on is an absolute scandal as it is.  Similarly, there are no jobs to seek for tens of thousands of people who are out there who would like to work but are on the jobseeker's payment.  They should also receive the social solidarity of the PUP in the current extraordinary circumstances.<\/p> <p> On the grounds of fairness and maintaining the social solidarity, we need to deal with Covid-19 and, indeed, on the grounds of macroeconomic prudence to sustain our economy through this period, I urge the Government to restore the PUP and the wage subsidy payments or it will feel the wrath and anger of people.  It will demoralise people and it will add to the heavy burden and hardship they are going through having to deal with this pandemic if the Government pulls the economic and financial rug from under the families and workers that we depend on to protect us against Covid-19.<\/p> <p> I would like to say a particular word regarding some of the groups hardest hit by all of this.  Taxi drivers are due to have a drive protest on Friday.  They have cancelled it because of the restrictions but they will be outside the D&aacute;il tomorrow at 12.30 p.m. in small numbers to highlight their plight.  Music, entertainment and events people, bar and restaurant workers, caterers and tourism industry workers, all of whom have lost their jobs and incomes as a result of the pandemic measures, need to be supported.  If we are all in it together, the Government has no choice, morally or in any other way, but to restore the PUP payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700012#K00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602067200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for some very useful inputs on these important relevant supports.  As outlined by the Minister, I assure this House and the other House that the Government is fully committed to supporting people at this difficult time.<\/p>  <p>  At the onset of the pandemic, the previous Government was quick to take action and introduce the range of measures initially intended for a 12-week period to support people and businesses to cushion the sudden and severe income shock that the pandemic brought.  All the available data from the CSO, the ESRI and the Central Bank referenced by the Minister indicates that the measures taken by Government have worked very effectively.  Unfortunately, the impact of Covid-19 has been more persistent than anyone anticipated in March.  The Government has, therefore, extended the availability of the schemes so that they apply for a full 12 months.  In addition to ensuring that the schemes operate in a more equitable manner in respect of standard social welfare payments, the changes made in September also mean that they are sustainable over this much longer time frame.<\/p>  <p>  The PUP continues to support 205,000 people through a weekly income support.  Approximately 800,000 people have been supported since its introduction in March with a total spend of just over &euro;3.6 billion to date.  This figure will increase to &euro;5.2 billion by April next year.  These figures are not insignificant and Government must not only ensure that people are supported, but that the supports provided are both equitable and sustainable in order that we are not continuing to build up increased debt for future generations.  Calibrating payments such as PUP, as we did in September, to link them to prior employment earnings enables us to do that.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined earlier, access to the PUP scheme will remain open to new applicants until the end of 2020.  This means that anyone who loses his or her employment due to Covid-19 can continue to benefit from this support.<\/p> <p>I understand the calls to introduce a flat rate of &euro;350.  As Deputies are aware, however, the flat rate was introduced as an emergency measure which was paid at just over the normal two-adult household rate.  This was to ensure that the maximum number of claims could be processed as quickly as possible and that two-adult households would not lose out.  This was achieved, with about 800,000 people receiving a payment and a peak of just over 600,000 payments made was reached in early May.<\/p> <p> When circumstances changed, and weekly claims' volumes reduced, it was appropriate to revisit the design of the scheme to make it more equitable and to ensure that it could be more sustainable in the longer term.  The linking of the payment rate with previous income and earnings is fair and more sustainable.  As outlined earlier, the Government did not make these changes without considering their social impact.  The ESRI undertook a social assessment of the impact of the introduction of revised rates from September 2020.  As the new rates of payment are pay related, the data indicate that the impact of the changes on income distribution and poverty is very limited and that the PUP continues to provide a very strong support to those who lost their incomes, including people at the lower end of the income distribution.  The Government has protected those on the lowest incomes.  People who had prior income of less than &euro;200 a week now receive &euro;203 a week, while those who previously earned between &euro;200 and &euro;300 per week now receive a payment of &euro;250 per week.  The average earnings in that category is &euro;248 per week, so most people in the category still receive close to what they did when they were in employment and, on average, they are paid at a slightly higher rate with their Covid-19 payments.<\/p> <p> People who had a prior income that was over &euro;300 per week now receive a payment of &euro;300 per week, and approximately 129,500 people, or 60%, were paid this &euro;300 per week.  This rate represents in excess of 60% of prior average income for this group.  The PUP is payable to people aged between 18 and 66 years old, which is consistent with other social protection income supports paid to persons of working age, including jobseeker's payments.  The primary State income support for people aged 66 years or over, regardless of whether they are working, is the State pension, either the contributory State pension or the means-tested non-contributory State pension.<\/p> <p> The PUP rate was set in line with the two-adult household rate of payment for jobseeker's schemes and in this regard it is important to note that the two-adult household rate for the State pension is &euro;470 per week, which is much higher than the PUP rate.  In addition, people in receipt of the State contributory pension, which is based on PRSI contributions, can retain all of their State pension and employment income and retain that pension payment if they lose employment income, thus guaranteeing an income support.  People in receipt of the non-contributory or means tested pension who are also in receipt of an employment income may have their pension payment increased if they lose that employment or if it is reduced.  The payment of the PUP in addition to these pension payments would have resulted in many workers aged over 66 years receiving very high payments, greatly in excess of payments made to other people who lost their employment.  This would not have been equitable.<\/p> <p> Turning to supports for different sectors, I acknowledge the difficulties that certain sectors are facing, including the arts, entertainment, tourism, hospitality and taxi sectors as was mentioned.  As the Minister indicated, the social welfare system assesses and pays people as individuals and not as members of a particular occupation or sector.  This ensures that people are treated equitably and any differentiation of welfare payment rates based on people's employment sector would be inequitable.  Given that many occupations also work across sectors and many people work in more than one sector, any sector or occupation-based payment system would, in addition to being inequitable, be extremely difficult to administer.<\/p> <p> Recognising that self-employed people face particular difficulties in moving from the certainty of income on the PUP to uncertainty of income if they try to restart their trade, special arrangements have been introduced which mean that self-employed people will not lose their entitlement to PUP if they take up intermittent or occasional work.  This is particularly relevant to many of the sectors mentioned earlier.  The Government has also introduced a range of targeted supports for these sectors through the provision of various grants, loans, waivers and mentoring support and advice.<\/p> <p> In the context of the genuinely seeking work requirement for the PUP, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has again confirmed that the Department will take a reasonable and flexible approach in respect of workers who remain temporarily laid off in sectors that have not yet fully reopened due to the restrictions necessitated by Covid-19 and who can realistically expect to return to their employment when the occupational sector reopens.  Such workers will not be required to seek work in other unrelated sectors.  Supports will, however, be available to those who seek to take up training or education opportunities following the allocation of some &euro;112 million as part of the July stimulus package.<\/p> <p> Moving to the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and the new employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the Government has committed to supporting employment by means of a wage subsidy scheme until the end of March 2021 through the TWSS and its replacement, the EWSS.  These schemes are operated by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Under the TWSS, payments worth &euro;2.8 billion were made to more than 66,000 employers.  The design of the EWSS reflects the changing environment respecting the Covid-19 pandemic.  As a result, a number of flexibilities have been included in the scheme, such as the ability to claim a subsidy for newly hired employees and seasonal workers, while the rates and eligibility criteria have been modified so that the support is sustainable into the more medium-term.<\/p> <p> It is expected that payments worth a total of &euro;2.25 billion will be made in support of approximately 350,000 jobs in respect of the beginning of 2021.  The primary employer criterion for qualification for EWSS and TWSS is, appropriately, based on turnover rather than profitability.  To qualify, the employing enterprise must be able to demonstrate that it is operating at no more than 70% in respect of turnover or customer orders received from July to December 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.  This turnover test has been specifically designed to target the EWSS at otherwise viable employers whose businesses continue to be adversely impacted by Covid-19.<\/p> <p> Regarding Deputy O'Reilly's query concerning Aer Lingus, and to clarify, officials in my Department have engaged with Aer Lingus and an agreement process is in place for the company to provide any outstanding information to its employees to support their social welfare applications.  Applications for jobseeker's claims from Aer Lingus employees are being prioritised within the Department so that awarded claims are being paid as quickly as possible.  To date, more than 2,100 claims from Aer Lingus employees have been awarded.  A small number of clerical issues have affected some applications and I urge people in that situation to contact the Department again.<\/p> <p> Matters relating to workers' employment terms, conditions or entitlements, such as pay, are outside the remit of the EWSS and the TWSS.  Under both schemes, however, the employer is expected to make the best efforts possible to maintain as close to 100% of normal income as is possible for the duration of the subsidy.  Checks and balances are in place to ensure fairness to employees and employers.  I understand that Revenue has been conducting a programme of compliance checks on employers who have availed of the TWSS to confirm that they meet the eligibility criteria and that employees received the correct amount of subsidy due to them.  To date, checks have been initiated in respect of some 35% of TWSS employers, which represents some 67% of employment supported by the scheme.  These checks will continue for the next several months and I am advised further that inquiries to date have indicated high levels of compliance by employers with the requirements of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700013#L00200","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602067800,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I think we are out of time at this stage and we are already running late.

I will take seven minutes and he will take three minutes.<\/p><p>What jumps out at me immediately is that we must have this discussion, this debate, this row in context.  I state that because everything is always relative and proportionate to the whole.  This morning, I read in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that a report from the Swiss bank UBS stated that during the height of the pandemic, from April to July, the wealth of billionaires on the planet rose by more than one quarter, or 27.5% to be precise.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, from the Green Party to listen to these details because these are the types of issues that I am familiar with representatives of the Green Party raising in the past.  The wealth of billionaires on the planet is at a record high of some &euro;8.7 trillion and these billionaires achieved this record high by betting on the recovery of global stock markets during the lockdown.  We must, therefore, have this discussion about cuts to people's payments relative to the story I have just referred to, because, as the Deputy Paul Murphy pointed out earlier, Ireland has, shockingly, the fifth highest rate of billionaires <i>per capita<\/i>.  That means there is a great deal of wealth sloshing around this country.  We are talking today to tens of thousands of workers who, since 17 September, have lost &euro;50 a week and more who, since 1 September, have lost more than &euro;100 a week in the wage subsidy scheme.<\/p> <p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>Some Members might think that is not a lot to lose.  Both the Minister and the Minister of State quoted extensively from ESRI studies.  The ESRI was asked to undertake an impact assessment of the introduction of the revised rates of payment since September 2020 and it found that the changes had very little impact on the risk of poverty.  It is extraordinary that the ESRI could come up with that sort of finding 20 days after &euro;50 per week was taken from those families.  In the course of that 20 days, as moratoriums were lifted, they have been looking at bills from banks and landlords.  Many of them are facing the possibility of eviction.  We tried to have proposals for the restoration of the anti-eviction legislation introduced by the Government brought before the House today, but we were blocked from doing so.<\/p> <p> This is a hugely important issue.  Other Deputies have pointed out the cruelty of putting people in a situation where they cannot put food on the table or meet increased energy costs.  The House should note that Bord G&aacute;is is insisting on retrieving the &euro;100 it gave to people with card meter bills by way of a 60% recoupment each time they make a payment.  This means that on these cold days, if people put &euro;20 in their meter, they will get approximately &euro;8 of energy for it.  That has to end.  It is extremely cruel to families that are already struggling as we move into the winter.  It should also be noted that if people are out of work for a long period, because of the pandemic and through no fault of their own, they will use more energy to keep their homes warm and bright.  People are faced with more and more struggles but the Government thinks it is not so bad to take money from them.  It as an arbitrary and cruel mechanism to make the books balance and extend fiscal prudence.  Members of the Government should remember that this is not their money.  It is not coming out of the back pocket of the Ministers for Finance or Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  This money will ultimately be paid back by all of us, just as we are still paying back the bank bailout of &euro;64 billion.<\/p> <p> Under the EWSS, there has been a severe reduction in payments from &euro;410 to &euro;203 per week.  Many workers cannot claim a top-up unless they are not rostered for work.  In the case of Aer Lingus, for example, many employees are finding it impossible to get their bosses to sign their social welfare reforms.  They are struggling from week to week without any income because of shoddy or irresponsible administration by the companies for which they work.  In other countries, severe strictures are placed on companies that avail of a wage subsidy.  For instance, CEOs cannot receive bonuses and it is not permissible to engage in tax avoidance via offshore subsidies.  There is nothing like that in this State other than the requirement to show a 30% decline in turnover.  Companies that made vast profits prior to the pandemic, including meat plants, Boston Scientific, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, have reserves built up from those profits but they have their hand out to the State to avail of this scheme.  The cut in payments under the EWSS, which is hitting workers, is unjustifiable, as outlined in our motion.<\/p> <p> I refer to a point that was repeatedly raised by both the Minister and the Minister of State in speaking against the motion, namely, the relevance of the pay that people were on prior to receiving the PUP.  A total of 129,500 people are being paid at a rate of &euro;300 a week on average, which represents in excess of 60% of prior average income for that group.  Is it not clear to everybody that what is wrong in this country is the level of low pay that is predominant throughout the economy and is affecting the tens of thousands of workers who are the subject of this cut?  The levels of low pay are shocking and probably among the greatest in Europe relative to our cost of living.  If somebody is better off on PUP of &euro;300 a week, it means they had to be earning less than &euro;20,000 a year before the pandemic.  That is a shocking indictment of the system under which we live.  This week, the Government endorsed a 10 cent increase in the minimum wage.  Hooray to that.  It will go such a long way to enabling people to put more gas in their meter and make repayments to their landlords and banks.<\/p> <p> What the Government is doing is immoral, not just on its own but also in the relative context of the wealth that exists in this society and the emergency we are facing.  The previous Minister said that these supports were introduced in the context of the emergency arising out of the Covid pandemic.  The pandemic has not gone away.  The pandemic does not recognise bills and it does not recognise the desperation people are suffering.  I ask the Government to do the right thing by reversing these cuts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700014#M00300","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602068400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>It is amazing what one learns when one listens very carefully during a D&aacute;il debate.  I was under the misapprehension that what the Government did in September was cut the PUP by &euro;100 or &euro;50.  It turns out I was wrong and the payment was not cut at all.  Many people believed that was what happened.  They believed the Government, in taking &euro;100 from them, had taken food out the mouths of their children or, by taking &euro;50 from them, had endangered the roof over their heads.  It turns out they were wrong.  They should have listened to the Minister of State.  He is a member of the Green Party, whose deputy leader said this week that the party needs to have a focus on social justice.  He told us that the Government did not cut the payments in September but calibrated them in such a way as to link them to employment earnings.  George Orwell said many years ago in his tremendous essay, \"Politics and the English Language\", that the abuse of language in politics \"is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable\".  It is unfortunate to see the Green Party signing up to that type of language in this debate.<\/p>  <p>  I have to give it to the Government that it is not being inconsistent on this issue.  In fact, it is being entirely consistent in attempting to make working people pay for the Covid crisis.  We can see that is the case when the Government introduces an increase in the minimum wage of 10 cent an hour, which is less than 1%.  We see it in the move to end the mortgage moratorium and the blanket ban on evictions.  We see it in the cut in the PUP of &euro;100 or &euro;50 a week, with the threat of more cuts to come.  We will vote on this motion in this Chamber at 9.30 tonight.  I urge every worker who had &euro;100 or &euro;50 taken in September, with the threat of more to come, to tune in and pay careful attention to who votes for a motion in favour of restoring the PUP and who votes against it.

But having nothing to look forward to is working backwards for us.  She has nothing to occupy her or no possibility of seeing her friends or anyone she can identify with.  I've found it hard but she can't put her feelings into words to explain how she is.  And I'd say every parent or carer feels the same.

I accept that many families and many people with special needs and disabilities have had an extremely stressful and tough time during this pandemic with the withdrawal of services and the curtailment of services because specific Covid-19 health requirements have made the circumstances and conditions very stressful.  I acknowledge that it is on top of additional stress that was there already.  Throughout my political life I have worked hard on the disability issue, in particular in regard to special needs education.  I am determined to make sure that we do everything we possibly can to alleviate the pressures that families and people are currently operating under.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has not made this easy.  A three-phase plan has been outlined for the resumption of adult day services.  Additional funding has been allocated to that plan to enable services to resume.  There will be further difficulties and constraints now because of the fact that we have moved to level 3 and the pandemic case numbers are growing, which will make this particularly challenging.<\/p>  <p>  The budget is next week.  Disability and the need for additional funding has been discussed by the Government.  I know the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is particularly conscious of this, as are the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly and as is the wider Government on the need to do this.<\/p>  <p>  Day services have reopened at 40% capacity throughout August and early September.  That said, that is still far short of what people require and need.  We are also very conscious of the need to provide support for specific packages and intensive support packages for young adults with complex or high-support needs to remain at home and in their communities.  A total of &euro;2.5 million in additional funding is being provided to enable some 210 intensive support packages to be provided.  These will be person-centred and tailored to the needs of individuals and their families.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there will be constant engagement between the HSE and the service providers to make sure that there is a clear understanding about what is required and the need to provide the funding, while ensuring that the services can be restored in line with the Covid restrictions.  Approximately &euro;484 million was allocated to day services in 2020.  Additional costs have arisen for service providers in the provision of safe services.  That has been acknowledged by the Government and we will respond to that.  School-leavers who require a day service have been introduced to a new service during September and ring-fenced resources have been provided to facilitate that as part of the HSE's national service plan.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of children's disability services generally, we will continue to try to reopen them across all areas and to put in place the appropriate arrangements to resume assessment of need and intervention therapy services in line with public health guidance.  In addition, short-stay residential and emergency residential respite began to reopen in July and August as the first stage in a three-phase plan.  Activity is now increasing for the next two phases, namely, the September to November phase and then the phase from December to February 2021.  The budget is important in terms of making sure that we provide additional adequate resources to all involved in disability services.  We are working on that between now and the budget and also between now and the end of the year to see what additional resources we can provide to the service providers to enable them to reopen services consistent with public health safety requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700016#O00400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1602069000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>There is an absolute desperation in the experiences that I have shared with the House.

I am determined that the Government will respond in a comprehensive way to the needs of the disability sector.  In addition to that, we need change and reforms within the sector.  It seems to me that several service providers are in difficulty and some are moving out of the sector.  That needs fundamental change as well.  Resourcing will be provided, but we also need to look at the model of provision into the future.  In my view, the State must take a stronger role in terms of the provision of such services.  That is not casting aspersions on any particular service providers.  As society evolves, there is a need to modernise our approach to the provision of services.

On top of that, I have been hearing some very worrying stories.  I heard two such stories in the past week alone, involving people who believed they should have had treatments and diagnoses earlier and now have stage 4 cancer.  All Members are aware that that is not a very good place to be.  I wish them the best.  They are young people.

The Taoiseach should make those figures public and bring about a public awareness campaign to encourage people to attend their appointments.  He must also ensure that sufficient capacity is put into the system such that patients can be diagnosed and treated to the same standard as pertained last year.  We must not allow capacity in these areas to be soaked up because in that scenario non-Covid deaths may outnumber deaths from Covid.  I ask the Taoiseach to, please, provide the analysis I am seeking.  He is in a better position than I am to provide it so that we can get to the bottom of this issue.

I accept and agree with the Deputy that some people are now manifesting later stage conditions as a result, it seems to me, of delayed diagnosis.  Some people have told me they did not wish to go hospital.  One person to whom I spoke decided not to go to hospital but is now okay.  The person got a procedure done by a general practitioner that would ordinarily be carried out in a hospital.  That is one of the challenges of Covid.  The lockdown had an impact on non-Covid care.  There was a fear about going to hospital.  We are dealing with a new virus and I am not apportioning blame.

As the Deputy is aware, three of the four screening services have resumed screening using a phased approach.  It is projected that BreastCheck will resume screening this month.  That is on the screening side.  There is a fair degree of catch-up there.  Many clinical staff continue to work within the programmes and people who were in the system at the time of the pause have continued to be treated as hospital resources allowed.  For example, women availing of BreastCheck screening services who had been screened continued to have their assessments completed and their treatment plans mapped out by the services.  Surgeries continue to be scheduled and completed.  There is ongoing work on the screening side and that has resumed.  That is also the case in other areas.  Part of the winter initiative is designed to prevent people from going into hospital in the first instance in order to free up capacity for electives.

People trying to get to appointments in Dublin today have been held up on the M7 for more than two hours.

I frequently make the point that responding to every upsurge with a lockdown or further restrictions is not a strategy.  We need to identify those actions and the strategy that will give us the best possible opportunity to minimise the rate of the virus.  It is important to bear in mind that business, social and health concerns are different sides of the same coin.  The worst thing that could happen our social life and our business life is that the virus gets out of control.  All of these issues are connected.<\/p>  <p>  During the summer it was clear that there was concern about international travel.  The letter from NPHET in the middle of the summer said that 12% of cases were travel related but it went on to raise alarms about the impact of that 12% in terms of passing on the virus to family groups and other clusters.  It was very concerned about it at that stage.  It is strange that it has not mentioned it since but we should be listening to what it said during the summer.  That was in respect of travel.  There was a clampdown on travel followed by monitoring.  There were strict requirements to isolate and so on.  We now know, however, that there is no system in place.  In the first week of September, for example, approximately 60,000 people arrived into this country but less than one fifth of those were contacted with a call to check about contact tracing.  There was no monitoring of their movements and no monitoring of compliance.  Just last week, the Department of Health confirmed that the locator form and the system of engagement with arriving passengers are not conducted for the purposes of monitoring or enforcement of restricted movement.  We now have a system where there is no monitoring at all of anybody coming into this country.  The vast majority of travellers coming here are coming from non-green list countries.  If we look at what is happening in other countries, there is testing in Germany, for example.  In other countries there is a combination of testing with monitoring and quarantining but we have no system here now.  That is extraordinary, given the levels of the virus.  Why was the policy of trying to monitor people here and setting down clear guidelines changed?  There is no monitoring at all at this stage.

People out there know the basics in terms of preventing the spread of this virus - less congregation, fewer social contacts and the need to mask up.  Fundamentally, it is a behaviour issue and the implementation of level 3 across the country is now essential.  I met with the Chief Medical Officer this morning.  We had a very good discussion again and I paid tribute to his commitment to the country and the selfless way he has come back to help the country deal with the pandemic.  We both share a clear determination to get the country through Covid-19 with the help of everybody in this House and across society also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700018#Q01000","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1602070200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>The time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700018#Q01100","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1602070200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I am trying to organise a meeting with the party leaders.

A high area of risk is in terms of travel without any safeguards.  People come into this country from many red list countries and there are no safeguards whatsoever in place.  I asked the Taoiseach what happened to change that policy.  Why was that policy changed?  Surely it exposes the country to the importation of the virus.

If we were to introduce that now, Ireland would be in the red zone and we would be completely unprepared in terms of European requirements or standards for testing at our airports or for any kind of quarantining.  Currently, there is no system in place.  There are no plans under way to address that.  That is why I am saying we need a strategy to minimise the virus.

Listen to these words: &quot;We are having big outbreaks that we simply cannot get a handle on because we don't have the resources.&quot;  Those are the words of a public health employee that were reported in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>last night.  One of her colleagues reported that 150 new cases came in over the weekend but that none of her staff could go near any of them because they are run off their feet and did not have time to do so.  Dr. Ann Dee, a consultant in public health medicine, told the<i>Irish Examiner<\/i>: &quot;Unless the country wants to live in lockdown permanently every few weeks for the rest of the winter then the government needs to give us staff to be able to handle what is happening.&quot;  She added: &quot;The regional public health system is as close to collapse as it has been than at any time before.&quot;  The Government line is that there is a multimillion euro recruitment package that will benefit the regional public health departments soon enough.  Dr. Dee's reply to that is that she does not expect to see any new boots on the ground until early in the new year, which is at least three months away.  What will happen in the meantime?<\/p><p>I am a supporter of masking up.  I am opposed to the T&aacute;naiste's suggestion that people should be fined &euro;50 for not wearing a mask.  I am in favour of voluntary compliance with restrictions and I am confident the Irish people will accept increased restrictions if they are demonstrably necessary to defend public health and if the proper supports are put in place.  What sticks in the throats of people, however, are the facts that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have failed to build a strong public health service capable of withstanding a powerful wave of the virus and that lockdown may be necessary to compensate for those failures.<\/p><p>Dr. Chris Luke, based in Cork city, told <i>The<\/i><i>Echo<\/i>that there were no critical care beds available in Cork city hospitals on Monday night and that there were just five general beds available.  Is that a surprise when the State has 6.5 ICU beds per 100,000 of the population?  In Germany, by contrast, the figure is 38.7, which is six times higher.  In 2018, this country had 2.3 general hospital beds per 1,000 of the population.  Thirty years earlier, in 1988, the figure was nine, which was nearly four times higher.<\/p><p>When Dr. Mary Favier told &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; that she supports level 5, because she fears there will not be a bed available for someone who has had a bad traffic accident or needs emergency cardiac surgery in November, she made a point that was less about the power of the virus and more about the failures of successive Governments.  I have two questions.  First, can the Taoiseach fast-track the recruitment of the new public health staff that Dr. Ann Dee expects to see on the ground in the new year, and can the bulk of those staff be put into position within the next month?  Second, restrictions are on the increase.  There needs to be an increase in the supports.  What is the Taoiseach's view on restoring the pandemic unemployment payment to &euro;350, reintroducing the blanket ban on evictions and seriously extending the mortgage moratorium?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700019#R01000","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1602070800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>There will be no resources spared in the public health response.

Again, we are in agreement that anything we can do to fast-track the recruitment and appointment of other staff will happen.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, with regard to the testing regime, the first 500 community swabbers are through the interview process and are going into compliance checking.  The first new staff start on 8 October.  With regard to contact tracing, the first 400 people are through the interview process.  There were 65 new staff this week, on 6 October, and there are to be 70 next week, on 12 October.  We expect to continue to bring in 60 to 70 new staff every week, which will help to free up resources in the wider health service and also get a specific, stronger workforce in place on the contact tracing and swabbing side.   The public health service faces a challenge owing to Covid-19.  Of that there is no doubt, but the resources have been provided and will not be spared in ensuring that what must be done will be done.  I have made that very clear, and so has the Minister for Health.<\/p>  <p>  This year, because of Covid-19, the Government will have allocated substantial funding to intervene to support people regarding their incomes and to support employers to try to keep businesses viable.  That will continue.  We have to have a sustainable model for the pandemic unemployment payment.  The whole idea was to make sure we could sustain this until April 2021 and beyond considering the financial and economic implications.<\/p>  <p>  Moving to level 3 is already having a significant impact on the number of new claims.  As of the close of business last night, we have received 17,000 new claims for the pandemic unemployment payment.  Normally, there would be between 1,000 and 2,000 claims per day.  Given the move to level 3, additional claims are expected.  A rough estimate based on experience in Dublin and Donegal indicates that between 40,000 and 50,000 extra claims could be made this week as a result of moving to level 3.  That is how serious moving to level 3 or any higher level is.  It has clear financial and economic implications.  The Government has taken that on board and will have a very high deficit this year, of over &euro;20 billion.  Obviously, we will be recalibrating figures as a result of moving to level 3.  The economic consequences are significant, including for individuals who lose their jobs and so on.  We want to try to be fair to all concerned and give people a support, by way of the pandemic unemployment payment, that is close to what they were earning prior to losing their job in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700019#R01100","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1602070800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I note with great interest the information the Taoiseach has provided to the D&aacute;il.

In other words, people had suffered a cut of nearly &euro;200 in their household income before the Government decided to cut the payment by &euro;100, or &euro;50, in September.  Can the Taoiseach explain how &euro;350 was regarded as a reasonable payment in March but not in October, when the virus is spreading and there is a large amount of untapped wealth in the hands of wealthy individuals?

We have kept it open for new entrants.  We have also extended to April next and we will probably have to extend it beyond that for as long as the pandemic continues, to make it more sustainable in terms of the overall needs of the country.  The Deputy mentioned averages.  The reality is that 48,000 people whose prior income was less than &euro;200 per week will receive &euro;203 per week under the PUP.  A further 36,000 people who earned between &euro;200 and &euro;300 per week will now receive &euro;250 per week.  On average, most people in receipt of the &euro;250 per week will be getting a bit more than they would have received in employment prior to the pandemic.  I acknowledge that the remaining people, whose prior income was over &euro;300, will be getting less.  We are trying to be fair to all concerned because we are also conscious that there are over 200,000 people on jobseeker's allowance.  Someone who lost a job before the pandemic is, and has been for the duration of the pandemic, on jobseeker's allowance.  I did pose the question yesterday as to whether people were of a view that the new social welfare payment should be &euro;350 for all categories.

These people endure extreme stress and some would call it trauma.  We have had incidents where residents have ended up trapped in the car while trying to access a road close to their houses.  These people endure an awful lot of stress and cannot even get home insurance on their properties any longer.  <\/p>  <p>  Now, we have all suffered nationally in similar ways.  We are dealing with Covid-19 and have had to make huge adaptations to our everyday lives.  That is exactly what these residents endure every year.  We are talking about Christmas time as well.  People had to vacate properties for long periods, sometimes for two to three weeks, and stay in a hotel.  Like any other ordinary family, some families have children with special needs and children with their own needs that need to be looked after and they must to do this from a hotel room.  It is absolutely unacceptable.  One river agency is absolutely needed for the sake of the residents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700023#V01100","speaker":"1520"},{"type":"speech","time":1602073200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I am delighted to present this Bill to the D&aacute;il and to speak on it on First Stage.

The politicians go away, the floods recede and that is the end of it.  Then the floods come again and again.<\/p>  <p>  Families, businesses and farmers are affected and we really need to shout \"Stop\" because it keeps happening.  The River Shannon needs to be maintained and managed and that is not happening.  Pinch points have been identified and we have had report after report.  I do not suggest we should drain the Shannon.  I am advocating that people should go to those pinch points and clear it out.  I suggest we should manage and maintain it.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware environmental concerns are often raised and cited when it comes to this issue, such as protection of the flora and fauna and so on.  We are now at the stage, however, where there is no flora and fauna because they are not attracted to the river any more as it is so badly maintained.  Many parts along the river are in a poor state and I believe maintenance would improve the position of the flora and the fauna.<\/p>  <p>  We must put people first on this issue, that is, farmers, families and businesses who have been flooded repeatedly.  In some cases, homes have been absolutely destroyed and families have not been able to return and live in them again.  This Bill makes absolute sense.  I met with the Save Our Shannon group on Friday.  It cares about the river wants to see it maintained and managed.  The way to do that is to have a single authority for the River Shannon.

However, in one area of arts funding there has been great largesse and I call for an investigation into this.  It is on foot of a dossier that has been produced by the Irish Film Workers Association.  If these allegations are true and very credible facts are put forward, there is a scandal in the Irish film industry that dwarfs the scandal of the FAI and John Delaney.  It needs to be investigated as a matter of urgency.  According to this dossier, a relatively small number of producer companies have received over the past five years &euro;668 million in tax relief, money from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, money from RT&Eacute;, and grants and loans from Screen Ireland.  Under law, that money is conditional on quality employment and training.  The recipients of that money are required to sign a Revenue declaration that they comply with all legal and employment rights and issues such as the fixed-term worker's contract.  The very same groups that are getting this money are, as we speak, in the WRC claiming that they have no employees, that only designated activity companies are employers and that even though they receive the money from Government, they are not employers.<\/p>  <p>  Incredibly - this is shocking stuff - I have a letter dated 1 September in which the auditors of, for example, the producers of \"Vikings 5\", \"Vikings 6\", \"Badlands 3\", and another \"Badlands\" production, confirm that during the period no income was earned from profits derived from the exploitation of those series.  In addition, they have no employees even though they get the money from the Government that is conditional on quality employment and training.<\/p>  <p>  Even more incredibly, under EU law, Revenue is required to publish the state aid given to these companies.  The Revenue documents indicate that for those four productions by those two companies, they were given either &euro;40 million in section 481 tax relief, or &euro;120 million.  That is what Revenue is saying.  We do not know if we gave them &euro;40 million or &euro;120 million, even though under EU law, Revenue is required to be very specific about the state aid that is given to them.  That is scandalous and it needs to be investigated.  If there is a shred of truth - the evidence is very credible - something very rotten is going on.  Based on the allegations in this dossier, I want a commitment that the situation in that industry is investigated as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700024#W02200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1602073800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach will know that before the pandemic hit, 72% of artists in Ireland were earning less than the national minimum wage.  Yesterday the Government agreed that the national minimum wage should increase by a mere 10 cent.  On Monday in a very high-profile decision, the Government decided not to accept NPHET recommendations.  The T&aacute;naiste said that they had not been thought through.  However, yesterday it took the Low Pay Commission's recommendation of a 10 cent an hour increase even though union representatives had walked away from the table.  The Labour Party backs an increase of 20 cent.  The difference for a full-time worker between 10 cent and 20 cent is &euro;2.16 in take-home pay per week or just &euro;4.37 in additional labour costs for the employer.

I raised four different, absolutely distinct areas in my questions and would like to register my objection and ask that it does not happen again.<\/p>  <p>  Question No. 4 concerns plans for public service reform to be driven by the Taoiseach's Department.  I particularly want to raise again two long-running pay and pension issues.  The community employment, CE, scheme supervisors and their trade union representatives have, as the Taoiseach knows, been engaged in a protracted campaign that dates back to his previous term in government.  Thus far, three Governments have refused to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation that a pension scheme be put in place for CE scheme supervisors.  Previous Governments have taken the position, as they have with section 39 workers more generally, that CE scheme supervisors are not public sector workers.  It is to their very great credit that they have persisted with a campaign that now spans 12 years.  I understand the resolution proposed by the unions has been considered by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and is now with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for decision.  What comfort can the Taoiseach give to the supervisors that this Government will finally act on the Labour Court recommendation that goes back to 2008?<\/p>  <p>  I mention also the outstanding pay restoration for section 39 workers.  The Taoiseach will recall that they joined CE scheme supervisors on the streets earlier this year.  Governments past and present have sought to treat these workers as public sector workers for the purposes of deducting pay, such as under financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, provisions, for example, but have consistently failed to deliver on pay restoration.  I do not have to remind the Taoiseach that multiple pay increases have been advanced for politicians.  I do not need to tell him how that sticks in the craw of society generally but the craw of the aforementioned workers in particular.  I could say much more abut this but time is limited.  Their case has been proven.  The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, deal reached with the Department in 2018 included pay restoration for staff in 50 bodies on a pilot basis with further payment due in October 2020 and 2021.  These commitments have not been met and they must be met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700025#X00100","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1602074400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has a little over three minutes for a response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700025#X00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1602074400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I will address Deputy Boyd Barrett's question on the film industry first.  I have not seen that dossier and cannot really comment on its substance without having seen it in the first instance.  I do not know whether the Deputy has submitted it to Revenue or to other authorities which may be in a position to investigate it, if there was wrongdoing.  I am not clear on the status of the dossier.  The Deputy can certainly send it to my Department but again, as to the capacity to act on whatever information and how accurate the information is, I would have to wait until I saw what is being alleged.  I surmise that the vast majority of the resources relate to Revenue as this concerns tax relief and so on in the film industry.  Many would see such reliefs as a very significant catalyst for the creation of employment in the industry and for creating work for those employed more broadly in the film industry.  The Deputy is right that there are state aid implications and conditionality attached but again, I would like to see the dossier.  The divide between the tax relief issue and straight grants from the Irish Film Board or from RT&Eacute;'s procurement policies would all have to be broken down.  What is important is that the basic entitlements of people working in the industry are met and underpinned.  It would not be acceptable if unacceptable practices obtained in a particular sector of the economy to which significant State resources were allocated.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in raised the minimum wage increase.  Since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission, previous Governments have accepted its recommendations.  The Government decided to accept the recommendation that has been made.  There are obviously wider issues here.  I point out that the Government is supporting a lot of employment at the moment.  Under the wage subsidy scheme the State is essentially supporting about 350,000 employees.  As such there are issues about some employers' capacity to pay.  The rate of &euro;10.20 per hour is what the Commission recommended.  No one has ever intervened with the Low Pay Commission in terms of the statutory underpinning of that.  In fairness to the Deputy, moving to an <i>ad hoc<\/i>situation would not be the right approach.  We have to work on the unions and employers getting back together for future arrangements, albeit in the context of a living wage.  There certainly has to be a statutory system to arbitrate on the minimum wage and other issues pertaining to it.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Ministers will be looking at a sectoral approach with the budget.  We have already provided sector-specific supports in hospitality and in the arts.  The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, is very concerned about the situation because as I have said repeatedly, Covid-19 has had a terrible impact on the hospitality sector and arts and culture sectors.

I will engage with the Minister about that.  There have obviously been very significant challenges over the last three months since the Government was formed due to the impact of Covid-19, the financial and economic impact of the pandemic and the need to intervene across the board for a whole range of people in and out of employment, schemes and so on.  We will be examining that issue.<\/p>  <p>  On section 39 organisations, I raised this while in opposition.

Of course, Ministers, Taoisigh and Cabinet members have significant additional responsibilities but they also have a huge number of public servants and civil servants around them.

We then have this extensive layer of multiple advisers, who some might say do not seem to be giving great advice at present.  If we take the T&aacute;naiste's outbursts at the public health team, one wonders whether it was a result of very expensive advice.  It is just jobs for the boys and largesse for those who get the prize of power, which is being paid for by the public and really is doing nothing for ordinary people.  That is the perception out there.

I want to place on the record, as per figures from the Taoiseach's Cabinet colleague, that those who will be in receipt of the reduced &euro;300 pandemic unemployment payment on average earned &euro;568 prior to the pandemic and the circumstances in which they could no longer go to work.

There is a bit of a myth about this.  The Deputy made comments about this earlier.<\/p>  <p>  The public service works extremely well and has worked particularly well during Covid-19.  Many senior civil servants across the board have worked night and day and at weekends to cope with what has been an unprecedented challenge in many Departments.  Advisers are important.  The whole concept of what were then called programme managers was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with a view to having a clear strong relationship where there is a coalition Government to get the programme for Government implemented.  Political parties are elected on a programme of policies.  There was a view prior to that period that many elements of political programmes did not get implemented as strongly or effectively as they could have.  The Labour Party, and I mean this in a complimentary way, came up with the innovation of working with public servants.  Public servants appreciate the work of advisers in prioritising political objectives as manifested in a programme for Government.  The implementation of these priorities requires constant work and follow-through.  This is important because government is not a technocratic exercise and it was never meant to be a technocratic exercise.<\/p>  <p>  The idea of political advisers is not heresy.  It is not about jobs for the boys.  The Deputy is helping to create that perception by constantly saying that.  I have no doubt that if Deputy Boyd Barrett were in government, he would want people who are ideologically close to his position helping and assisting him in making sure his ideological position on a range of issues was followed through and that people would have a clear understanding of what his priorities were.  That is the purpose and objective of having special advisers.  Everybody is working extremely hard, be they in an advisory capacity or in a Civil Service or public service capacity.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald is no stranger to policy advisers either and Sinn F&eacute;in uses special advisers and has used them repeatedly in the Northern Ireland Executive.  Former elected representatives are now advisers in the Northern Executive.  This system has been in use in the North for some time.  They had a critical role in the recent inquiry into the renewable heat energy project and they were central to all of that.<\/p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>I do not think people should be feigning surprise about the use of advisers.  In the previous Government with Independents, there were again advisers representing Independent Ministers and Fine Gael.<br\/><br\/>There is a Cabinet co-ordination committee at which the three leaders meet in advance of the Cabinet meeting.  It works to ensure that Cabinet agenda items are dealt with if there are particular issues around those items with which a political party might have an issue because of its beliefs and ideas.  It works to ensure those issues get properly thrashed out and dealt with it.  The various chiefs of staff in each party meet regularly to make sure there is agreement on issues where there may be competing views and beliefs.  It is only natural in a three-party coalition Government that there will be parties who have stronger emphasis in some policy areas as opposed to others and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  There actually is a need to work through various issues that arise from time to time.  In the current climate with Covid-19, they arise frequently across the board in all sectors and Departments, requiring constant attention.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the leaving certificate issue, the overarching priority of the Government, the Minister for Education and Skills, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, along with the Minister, Deputy Harris, was the students.  It was important that the full details of the issue around the code was ascertained, its implications, scale, volume and how it would apply.  That was important rather than going half-cocked earlier publicly.<br\/><br\/>The Minister for Education and Skills handled this in the correct manner and dealt with it comprehensively.  Obviously, the decision to have calculated grades arose from the decision not to have leaving certificate examinations because of the impact of Covid-19.  That is why next year the Department's objective is to have the normal leaving certificate examinations back.  Work is under way already to get to that situation.  No one really wants to be in the position we were this year with a calculated grade system and the cancellation of the exams.  It has been very challenging for this year's leaving certificate cohort because of all that has transpired.  We are working in the best interests of the students concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700026#Y00500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","time":1602075600,"counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700027#Z00200"},{"type":"question","time":1602075600,"counter":220,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[28350\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700027#Z00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his attendance at the special European Council meeting on 1 October 2020.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1602075600,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I attended a special meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 1 and 2 October at which we discussed the health and economic impacts of Covid-19 and agreed the need to strengthen our co-ordination especially as regards the development and distribution of a vaccine at European Union level.

I asked explicitly whether the council would have a problem from a fiscal point of view if we restored the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the PUP, and the representatives basically said they had no problem with that and there was no fiscal difficulty because of the current extraordinary situation and the ability to borrow money cheaply.

I met the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, on the Thursday.  It was a very good meeting.  She reaffirmed EU support for Ireland on Brexit and emphasised the importance of getting an overall agreement.  The following day, President von der Leyen spoke to the Council and summarised how she saw the state of play in negotiations.  I was then given the opportunity to make observations from the Irish perspective.  There was one other contribution after that because it was not a general discussion on Brexit and we will return to that next week.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission President indicated to me and the Council that she would be speaking to the British Prime Minister over the weekend.  That has happened and I spoke to the Commission President again over the weekend.  We had a good discussion on the phone.  There has been agreement on both sides to intensify discussions between the UK and the EU.  There are significant challenges on the level playing field, fisheries, which is a difficult issue, and governance, that is, what arrangement will be arrived at to ensure any agreement finalised, if one was finalised, would be adhered to.  We have had an issue with trust being eroded in the context of the withdrawal agreement and the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol.  That is the position.  As of now, those talks are intensifying and the President of the Commission and the British Prime Minister have agreed to keep in close contact to oversee the talks and make sure momentum continues in them.<\/p>  <p>  On Belarus, the meeting was successful in that it broke the logjam on an issue between Cyprus and Turkey.  Cyprus had withheld its position in agreeing sanctions on Belarus, pending a resolution of the issue around the eastern Mediterranean and Turkey in particular.  The issue concerns Turkey drilling disputed Cypriot and Greek waters, which is an infringement of their sovereignty.  That issue took up a lot of time at the meeting.  It got resolved with conclusions, which will result in constructive mediation processes opening up that had started between Turkey and Greece and will now embrace Cyprus as well, utilising the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, with a view to arriving at a proper basis for a more satisfactory relationship between Turkey and the EU into the future.  That facilitated unanimity on Belarus and it was agreed at the meeting to impose restrictive measures and sanctions, including an asset ban and travel restrictions, on 40 individuals in leadership positions in Belarus.  EU leaders strongly condemn the indiscriminate detentions, harassment, intimidation and ill-treatment that continue in Belarus despite repeated calls for them to stop.  I am glad we managed to get unanimity on it and get that out as quick as we could.  There was no hesitation on the sentiment of the EU position on Belarus.  To be fair to Cyprus, it has real issues around what is happening in the relationship with Turkey and it felt these needed to be addressed by the Council.  <\/p>  <p>  On Lesbos, it has been agreed to take 50 refugees.  People say they want us to take more.  I share the concerns for the trauma people have gone through and the need to help them but we must make sure those we take in are properly and comprehensively looked after in all aspects of their self-development and life and so on.  That is something I am keen on.  I will talk to the Minister on it again following the representations that have been made here and the moral responsibility people have articulated that we as a country should take on in respect of this very difficult situation.  I know those involved want to make sure we do this properly and comprehensively for the longer term in terms of looking after those we take into our care and supervision.<\/p>  <p>  On the economic and fiscal situation and the fiscal council, that is one aspect of the issue and we are spending an unprecedented amount.  We are borrowing close to the middle twenty billions.  I do not know what the final figure will be.  As we are moving to level 3 now, a significant increase in the PUP was anticipated at today&rsquo;s oversight group meeting between the different Departments.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection suggests there could be 40,000 to 50,000 additional applicants by the end of the week.  There was a significant increase of 11,000 applicants at the close of business last night, which compares strongly to a norm of between 1 million and 2 million claims.  We want to make it sustainable and we are extending the scheme.  We want to look at other supports as well.  It is also about fairness.  There are people who lost their jobs prior to the pandemic who were never on the PUP but are on the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  A total of 213,000 people get the basic allowance.  There are issues there, to be fair to those, as well.  There are carers and so on that people spoke about.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald also spoke about the 400 Welcomes appeal and I think I have addressed that in my reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700028#AA00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602076200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Written Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Pre-European Council Meeting on 15 and 16 October:  Statements","time":1602076200,"counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700028#AA00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1602076200,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I will attend a meeting of the European Council next Thursday and Friday, 15 and 16 October.

Last week's meeting discussed a number of pressing external relations issues, including EU relations with Turkey and the importance of a stable and secure environment in the eastern Mediterranean; the situation in Belarus, in response to which we agreed targeted sanctions; the recent outbreak of violence in Nagorno-Karabakh; and the shocking recent assassination attempt on Alexei Navalny in Russia.  These issues are a stark reminder of the many challenges that continue to exist on the Union's doorstep.

While we have come to take its existence for granted, Covid-19 has also demonstrated how quickly it can be disrupted, including when member states do not act in a coherent and co-ordinated way.  As leaders, we agreed that the pandemic will have a lasting impact on European and global economies, highlighting both our assets and dependencies.  The Single Market will be a strong driver of our economic recovery with what we described as the \"twin pillars\" of the green and digital transformations helping us to foster new forms of growth, cohesion and convergence, strengthening the EU's resilience.<\/p> <p> In our discussion of Covid-19, it was clear that most member states are experiencing an increase in case numbers, with more younger people affected than was the case earlier in the pandemic.

Her intervention followed the conclusion of the ninth round of negotiations that day.

We also discussed progress on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and, in particular, the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p> As the House will be aware, on Thursday morning, the European Commission launched infringement proceedings against the UK as a result of its failure to withdraw elements of its internal market Bill that are in breach of commitments in the withdrawal agreement.  Over the coming weeks, the Commission will follow up in line with its procedures and the UK has the opportunity to respond.  For any deal on the future relationship to be possible, the UK will have to work to restore the trust of all member states by implementing the withdrawal agreement fully and in good faith.<\/p> <p> At Friday's meeting of the European Council, I shared my assessment of the current state of play, the remaining prospects for a free trade deal to be agreed in the period ahead and on the importance of sustained and positive progress on implementing the protocol.  Deal or no deal, the protocol will enter into force on 1 January 2021 and its terms must be honoured in full.<\/p> <p> Last week's meeting discussed a number of vitally important issues on the EU agenda and that will also be the case when we meet again next week.  We will return to the issue of Brexit.  President von der Leyen spoke to Prime Minister Johnson on Sunday, following which, in a joint statement, they asked negotiators on both sides to work intensively to try to bridge remaining gaps and agreed the importance of finding an agreement, if at all possible, as a strong basis for a strategic EU-UK relationship in the future.  It remains my firm view that the best outcome for all is a future relationship agreement between the UK and the EU based on free, fair and sustainable trade and which protects job standards and our respective economies.  I hope that when we meet on 15 October, real progress will have been made.  I wish the EU's negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his team every success in the important work ahead.  However, to guard against all eventualities, the European Council will also discuss work on preparedness for all scenarios after 1 January 2021.<\/p> <p> The European Council will also discuss Covid-19, climate change and EU-Africa relations.  The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, will provide details on what is envisaged for the discussion on EU-Africa relations in his concluding remarks.  We will discuss Covid-19 and take stock of developments since we last met in terms of EU co-ordination.<\/p> <p> On climate, the European Council will review progress towards the Union's objective of climate neutrality by 2050.  Since leaders most recently discussed this issue in December 2019, the Commission has proposed a 2030 climate target plan including a European climate law and a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.  At next week's meting, it is planned to hold an orientation debate on climate with a view to returning to the matter at our meeting in December.  Our commitments on climate are essential to protecting the well-being of this and future generations and that of the planet.  The green transition is also an essential pillar of our economic recovery.  The development of a European climate law is consistent with Ireland's domestic approach.  The climate action Bill under preparation and to be published later today will enshrine a national 2050 emissions reduction target into law.  I will discuss with fellow leaders Ireland's support for increased ambition at European Union level while asserting the importance of cost effective and fair sharing of the effort across member states.<\/p> <p> I will also have an opportunity to discuss these matters with the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, whom I look forward to welcoming to Dublin tomorrow.  In our meeting, we will discuss the important programme of work for the European Council for the period ahead, including matters on the agenda for next week's meeting.  I look forward to engaging with my EU colleagues, collectively and bilaterally, at next week's meeting of the European Council and will report back to the House in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700028#AA00500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602076800,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Brady.  The European Council meets next week as the deadline for a Brexit deal between the EU and Britain fast approaches.  The British Government continues to pursue an aggressive and destructive approach to negotiations, at the centre of which is Prime Minister Johnson's dangerous and reckless internal market Bill.  The Bill cleared its final parliamentary hurdle in the House of Commons on 28 September and, as the Taoiseach knows, the provisions of this Bill contravene international law and are a blatant attempt by the British Government to renege on the protections for Ireland as set out in the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement.  This cynical attempt by the British Prime Minister to use the future of this island as a bargaining chip is central to the looming prospect of a no-deal outcome and this has been rightly called out by the EU.  I welcome the fact that the Union has issued infringement proceedings against the British Government in light of the internal market Bill, especially given the very real threat it poses to the Good Friday Agreement and a prospect of the hardening of the British Border on our island.  The President of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, called it correctly when she said that the Bill is, by its very nature, a breach of the obligation of good faith laid down in the withdrawal agreement.  Moreover, if adopted as is, it will be in full contradiction of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The economic, political and social ramifications attached to any unravelling of these protections would be seismic.  It would represent a profound double shock as we struggle with the impact of the pandemic. It is right that the Machiavellian behaviour on the part of the British Government and Prime Minster Johnson's persistent pandering to the Tory Brexiteers is to be checked and challenged in the courts.  It is long past time that the British Government was relieved of the notion that it can simply walk away from binding agreements and treat Ireland and its people with such disrespect in the process.  That is what we are dealing with here.  We must remember that the Tories pursued their referendum in 2016 with zero regard for Ireland, engaged in a negotiating strategy with zero regard for Ireland and are dragging the people of the North out of the European Union against their vote to remain.<\/p> <p>That is still their mindset as they attempt to engage the EU in a dangerous game of chicken, using Ireland as a bargaining chip in order to secure a favourable trade agreement.  That is unacceptable.  The people of Ireland cannot and will not be treated as collateral damage in a Tory Brexit.  <br\/><br\/>Like the Taoiseach, I met Mr. Mick Mulvaney, the representative of the American Administration.  Last week, I had a call with the US Congressional Friends of Ireland caucus.  In both encounters I reiterated the very real need to stand up for Ireland and to ensure that the international community is aware and mobilised against the unacceptable threats from Britain.  I am happy to say that across the Atlantic, they are resolute in their previously stated position, that is, that there will be no trade deal between the United States and Britain if there is any hardening of the British Border on the island of Ireland or any damage incurred to the Good Friday Agreement.<br\/><br\/> It is vitally important that every diplomatic means possible is engaged to show a unity of purpose and to ensure the Good Friday Agreement and our peace process are protected.  Through its use of the Internal Market Bill, the British Government has undermined trust in its capacity to stick to any agreement that it makes.  That in turn erodes the prospect of reaching a deal. <br\/><br\/>Therefore, the Government must be energetic and determined in standing up to London when Ireland's interests are on the line.  That means the Taoiseach lifting the phone with urgency when Prime Minister Johnson does anything that endangers the agreed protections for Ireland.  It cannot be left to ambassadors, as effective as they are, to carry these messages.  It has to come from the Head of Government. <br\/><br\/>I hope that is the spirit and way in which he will approach this meeting of the European Council.  It is not too late for the British Government to pull back from the brink and do the right thing, respect international law and honour its agreements.  The Taoiseach must be to the fore in forcefully putting this position to Prime Minister Johnson.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700029#BB00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602077400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>The meeting of the European Council next week comes quite quickly after the special meeting of the Council on 1 and 2 October.  The Council afforded the Taoiseach the opportunity to address the floor on the issue of the impact and implications of Brexit on this country.  Brexit represents the critical issue on the European stage for Ireland at this juncture.<\/p>  <p>  In the midst of the deteriorating situation across the country, with the growing number of cases of Covid-19 and the reaction to the T&aacute;naiste's crass commentary on NPHET and the Chief Medical Officer, the fact that we have to address the potentially cataclysmic implications of Brexit compounds the sense of emergency at this time.<\/p>  <p>  While the Council will have its own agenda to pursue, there is no more important political issue on this island than Brexit.  On 1 January, Brexit will come into force.  We do not know for certain whether that will be in the form of a no-deal Brexit, although it is looking increasingly likely that this may, unfortunately, be the case.  The reality for this island is that a no-deal Brexit, particularly against the backdrop of Tory obtuseness and blatant disregard for international law, holds an alarming prospect for Ireland North and South.  It is particularly alarming when we look at the potential impact of Brexit on the Irish economy, which is finely balanced at present, as we absorb the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Against all expectations, the Exchequer returns for the Irish economy are much higher than anticipated, a fact which belies the devastating impact on the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers and their families who are suffering, in particular those in the domestic services economy that has been devastated by Covid-19.  This has been compounded by the decision of the Government to cut the pandemic unemployment payment.<\/p>  <p>  The resilience of the Irish economy is down to the performance of the export economy.  As recently as yesterday, the Central Bank argued that the recovery of the Irish economy will remain uneven but that a no-deal Brexit will seriously hamper any potential for growth that exists in the economy for next year.  We face into the coming months with our domestic economy devastated by the pandemic and our national finances and ability to navigate a recovery through the current political and health emergency being largely reliant on the expert economy.  We are faced with an equally potentially devastating crisis, namely, the phenomenon of Boris Johnson's Tory Government.  It is a Government which has single-handedly succeeded in manufacturing this mess through a litany of arrogance, dishonesty and abject disregard for the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland and the North of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The land bridge across Britain is effectively an artery which, in normal times, represents an important conduit for the Irish export economy to Britain and the European continent.  During the pandemic it has transformed into one of several critical arteries working to keep the body of the Irish economy alive.  Unless the Government, with time running out, possibilities lessening and confidence in its performance leave evaporating at an alarming rate, can live up to its responsibilities of leadership and deliver for the Irish economy, we are heading for serious difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  It is not difficult to visualise an Irish Dunkirk, where, rather than the beaches of France, a sizeable section of the Irish export transport fleet will be left to perish on the parking lots and in the traffic jams of southern England.  The Government must act now to protect the national interest.  It is simply not sufficient to offer platitudes that suggest that the market will sort out the issue of new transport routes to Europe.  This is one area where the Government must break with its performance to date and get the job done right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700030#CC00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1602077400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words about the upcoming European Council summit on 15 and 16 October.  The first thing listed in the published agenda highlights is EU-UK relations.  Apparently, the Council is going to take stock of the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and review the state of negotiations.  Other issues on the agenda include climate change and external relations, including EU-Africa relations.<\/p>  <p>  It is probably no surprise that most of us here will concentrate, in the few minutes we have, on the issue of EU-UK relations.  In truth, the Vice-President of the Commission, Maros Sefcovic , in a pessimistic presentation to the European Parliament, said that time is short to reach a deal.  He described the Internal Market Bill as a heavy blow to a British signature and to Britain's reliability.  <\/p>  <p>  Any deal will obviously require ratification in the European Parliament, across member states and within the UK Parliament.  That will take time.  We understand there are three outstanding issues, namely, fisheries, the so-called level playing field and oversight.  We are very grateful that the Minister for Foreign Affairs provided a very good overview on these matters today to the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  I had thought progress had been made on some of these issues but it seems that is not the case.  The Minister said in respect of fisheries that the positions were hardening.  I understood that there was almost an acceptance that there is no such thing as territorial waters and that what we are talking about is shared quotas but that is apparently now not the case.<\/p>  <p>  On the level playing field issue, there is an absolute commitment in the agreed declaration on these matters.<\/p> <p>Apparently, however, these will be resiled from.  All of us want to be optimistic that, notwithstanding our experiences to date, there will be in agreement at the end of the day but simultaneously we must be prepared for no-deal.  An enormous amount of work has been done in the past three years in preparation for a no-deal scenario.  We have been on the cusp of that on three occasions now.  This is the final hurdle.  Brexit will happen on 1 January 2021.  There seems to be within the Irish Government a fundamental dependence that we have legal certainty, an all-weather agreement that is enshrined in international law.  If we reach a situation where we have no deal, the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocols are there to protect us so there cannot be a hard border.  The problem is that not only has the British Government signalled its intention to resile from that but it has published legislation and threatened further legislation by way of amendments to its finance Bill which will fundamentally breach those international agreements.  I will be interested in hearing later on from whomever is replying to this debate whether we are absolutely confident in this. <\/p> <p> Our experience shows that we have great solidarity from our partners in Europe.  When push comes to shove, if Britain enacts this legislation, resiles from the agreement and breaks international law, what can we do other than take the UK to a court?  In that case, what would be the court?  Britain will not recognise the European Court of Justice at that stage.  Will we worsen our collective European Union position with the United Kingdom in defence of Ireland?  All the indications to date are that we have received enormous solidarity and there is dismay across Europe at the publication in Britain of the Internal Market Bill.  We have to ensure that if the worst happens, we have that solidarity that will see down any attempt by Britain to resile from its international agreements and solemn word on this.<\/p> <p> On the issue of connectivity, I represent the constituency that includes Rosslare Europort.  I have said this on many occasions that we need more direct services.  We need to invest in that.  We have a connectivity fund which we have not deployed.  We have invested in our ports but not our ferries.  We need to ensure we do this because the first test of our preparation for Brexit will be whether we can continue to get all our exports off the island of Ireland after 1 January next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700030#CC00300","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602078000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Next week, the Taoiseach will attend a European Council meeting which is, arguably, taking place in potentially one of the most pivotal periods for the future of our country for some time.  Many have alluded to the fact that Brexit will loom large.  Who knows but maybe between now and then, we will have seen some indication from the British Government that the theatrics will be put to one side and we can get down to negotiating a fair settlement.  The omens are not good. The fact that the British Government has already in a very blatant way acknowledged that it has breached international law in respect of the withdrawal agreement does not give much succour or cause for hope.<\/p>  <p>  One of the concerns that is coming from my constituency, which is right on the Border, is the premise being adopted, it appears, by Government speakers and other speakers we have heard today that in the event of a no-deal Brexit scenario, we would at least have the withdrawal agreement.  The actions of the British Government must raise concerns that in the event of a no-deal scenario, we could very much end up in a situation where the British Government attempts to renege even on that agreement.  We have to be cognisant of and prepared for that.  We have asked the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste numerous times to prepare for that eventuality.  One of the outworkings of such an outcome would almost certainly be that the people of the North would be given an opportunity to decide whether they wanted to be under the jurisdiction of a British Government that would act in such a way or whether they would want to take the legal, democratic route afforded to them in the Good Friday Agreement to return to the European Union via Irish unity.  We should be preparing for that eventuality, putting plans in place and ensuring that when people go to vote in such a scenario they know what they are voting for and that those who are advocating for the scenario of Irish unity, which I hope would include all parties in this House, will be united in saying what that would mean economically, constitutionally, socially and politically.  We do not want to make the same mistake the Brexiteers made by striving for a political outcome and having no idea how to implement that outcome the day after the referendum.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit will be a focal point for the Taoiseach at the European Council meeting next week.  In addition, there are other major issues that need to be addressed at European level.  The multi-annual financial framework still needs to be addressed, particularly how it pertains to the Common Agricultural Policy.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine yesterday, the Minister was not able to confirm what the position would be in January with regard to important Pillar 2 schemes, such as the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, other environmental schemes, the sheep welfare scheme and the beef payment scheme.  Recipients of payments from those schemes do not know what will be the position regarding their participation in these schemes, which are crucial not only to farmers&rsquo; incomes but for the rural economies that depend upon them.  When we are dealing with the post Covid-19 economic scenario, these are crucial issues that need to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Taoiseach to speak to his Spanish counterpart at the European Council meeting and tell him to engage with the people of Catalonia.  Spain's actions in imprisoning political representatives are unacceptable and it is shameful that Ireland has not been stronger in standing up for democratic rights and self-determination for the people of Catalonia.  I hope the Taoiseach will take the opportunity, if it is afforded to him next week, to make those points on behalf of the Irish people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700031#DD00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1602078000,"counter":237,"content":"<p>As I have said previously, the Achilles heel of the Northern Ireland protocol is that it relies on the UK to implement it.  I said that before the UK effectively broke international law.  There is a serious risk that we will have a Brexit without a trade deal.  That will potentially mean the loss of some 700,000 jobs across the European Union.  It is predicted that in the event of there being no trade deal, approximately 35,000 of those job losses will be in Ireland.  This is very serious and we are very exposed in the event of this happening.  Some 43% of Irish food exports are to the UK.  We are looking at potentially &euro;1.5 billion in tariffs being placed on Irish goods exported to the UK.  In the worst-case scenario businesses exporting to the UK would be hit by tariffs under WTO rules and those exporting to continental Europe through the UK land bridge would be hit by delays in transporting goods.  They could also be hit by the devaluation of sterling which would further wipe out demand for Irish goods in UK markets.  They could be further hit by an undercutting in consumer standards in the UK and changes to workers' rights and climate change protections, which would further undercut Irish goods in the UK market.  They could also be hit by the undercutting of Irish goods through state aid to UK competitors.  We have all of these factors.  For Irish businesses exporting to the UK to survive, we need to have a very hands-on approach from the Government and a major support from the European Union.  <\/p>  <p>  I will add to the comments made by previous speakers on the situation in Lesbos and the need to take more than 50 people from the Moria refugee camp, where a fire took place recently.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to look at that.<\/p> <p> On the situation in Poland and rule of law, the European Commission has published a report citing interference with judicial independence in Poland.  The Commission has also cited the increased Government influence over the media in Hungary and a weakening of safeguards against corruption, including a systematic lack of determined action to investigate and prosecute corruption cases involving high level officials or their immediate circle.  We have seen political protection of the Orb&aacute;n Government from some of the members of the European People's Party including, regrettably, Fine Gael, which is utterly unacceptable.  It is very important that we defend human rights, democracy and the rights of minorities, including the LBGTQI community around the world but especially within the EU.  The existence of so-called LBGTQI free zones in Poland is utterly unacceptable and an affront to our values as Europeans.  It is crucial, therefore, that before the &euro;750 billion is distributed as part of the recovery fund the Irish Government insists, at European Council level, that mechanisms to enforce rule of law are put in place and that the veto is withdrawn.<\/p> <p> Will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle indicate who is the representative of the Minister?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700031#DD00400","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602078600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, is in the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700032#EE00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1602078600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I am sorry; I cannot see from up here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700032#EE00300","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1602078600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>It is difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700032#EE00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1602078600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I cannot see him at all but I presume he is in the back row.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700032#EE00500","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1602078600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Is f&eacute;idir a dheimhni&uacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; anseo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700032#EE00600","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1602078600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

B'Tselem, the Israeli anti-occupation human rights NGO, provided video footage of the Israeli military bulldozing a series of houses that had been funded by the international protection consortium, the EU and Irish Aid.  This is not the first time we have seen demolition of EU-funded structures as part of the ongoing occupation of Palestine.<\/p>  <p>  The south Hebron hills is a particularly sensitive area.  There is a network of approximately 30 villages that are under constant threat.  They have seen a near complete ban on construction and the repeated demolition of roads, houses, water cisterns and other buildings.  Breaking the Silence, another Israeli NGO, published a series of testimonies from Israeli soldiers detailing the brutality of the military occupation of this area.  At the same time we have seen an explosion in the number of settlements, illegal outposts and wildcat settlements in the area that are putting significant pressure on what many commentators are calling a slow motion population transfer of Palestinians out of that area and Israelis into it.  Both the demolitions and the population transfer are grave breaches of international law obligations under the Geneva Convention.<\/p>  <p>  This is Irish Aid taxpayers' money that has gone in to try to provide some sort of support to the Palestinians living in the south Hebron hills whose villages are being demolished.  We need to use this EU summit, as we do others, to demand that there is compensation for these demolitions.  If we are building humanitarian structures, housing and providing solar panels and they are being confiscated or destroyed, we should be looking for compensation for them.  We cannot allow the impunity regarding breaches of international law to continue.  Until we stand up to them and demand consequences for them, that is exactly what will happen.  We are talking now about international law, Brexit, the UK's actions and how international law must be protected and upheld but if we are not willing to uphold it for others and to demand that others adhere to international law, what right do we have to seek the refuge of international law?  This is an incredibly important issue, both for the furtherance of international law in general but also with respect to Irish taxpayers' money that has gone to fund aid structures that are now demolished and are simply rubble.  This is an ongoing issue in the area and across Palestine and is one on which our Government needs to demand more action from our EU counterparts.<\/p>  <p>  I raise the issue of Brexit and environmental concerns.  We have talked a good deal about the level playing field but it is important to stress that one of the key issues is that the vast majority of Britain's environmental legislation comes from EU sources.  If that gap is not closed as part of that level playing field, we will see a serious deterioration.  That will affect us on this island because as I have said previously in this Chamber, nature does not give a damn about a line on a map or any sort of hard or soft border.  We are one island with one biosphere and if we are seeing a degradation and a deterioration in environmental standards North of the Border, we will be in a lot of trouble here in the South also.  It will impact on our farmers' ability to compete on a level playing field but it will also have much wider and detrimental impacts on Irish farming in general.<\/p>  <p>  If we are discussing EU-Africa relationships, while I have spoken about an occupation at one end of the Mediterranean Sea, we have an occupation at the other end in terms of Morocco and Western Sahara.  My hope is that through our position on the United Nations Security Council we can try to move the process forward.  The EU, as a neighbour, through its Euro-Mediterranean agreements and its Africa relations, needs to play a role here.  We need to raise the ongoing occupation and the transfer of population in the settlements within Western Sahara as much as we do the ongoing illegal occupation of Palestine.<\/p>  <p>  Many Deputies spoke about the importance of human rights and standing up for democracy.  While that is true in the EU, we must also look at ourselves  We still need to demand that of our neighbours and of those we trade with, particularly those who claim the name \"democracy\".  I hope the Taoiseach and the Minister of State can raise those very important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700032#EE00800","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1602078600,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I welcome much of what has been said.

At every opportunity we call on the Government to do the utmost on that because some of these situations we are entering into are far worse than we could have ever conceived years ago.  Many of these cases are a tragedy.<\/p>  <p>  A major issue for us at this point in time is Brexit.  I attended the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs earlier.  The focus from a governmental point of view needs to be on delivery and the possibility that the EU and the British Government can come up with some sort of solution, be that a trade deal or absolute clarity around the Irish protocol and the withdrawal agreement.<\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p> We may all believe or guess that Mr. Boris Johnson and company are only employing a negotiating gambit but it is incredibly frightening that they are willing to breach international law.  It is feared their Internal Markets Bill and possibly their Finance Bill will be used to circumvent an existing agreement.  We absolutely welcome the European Commission's legal action against the absolutely illegal action of the British Government.  People claim this is shocking but, from a republican perspective, British bad faith is something one gets used to and that has to be dealt with.  Lately, we have all seen on television shows, particularly \"Unquiet Graves\", the reality of what British rule in Ireland has been.  The reality is that there have been death squads.<\/p> <p> We believed that, with the withdrawal agreement and Irish protocol, we had mitigated the worst aspects of Brexit.  Now, however, we have no clarity on that.  I accept that, at this point, we seem to have international solidarity.  The T&aacute;naiste stated the European Union has stood firm on the Irish protocol, Irish requirements, the reality of what we deal with and our history.  His view is that the worst-case scenario is that Britain is not employing a negotiating gambit and is incredibly serious and willing to circumvent the rules and regulations, thus having an impact on the lives of people, particularly in Border locations such as Dundalk.  His view is that the European Union will stand firm.  We welcome the solidarity shown by the European Union and politicians in America.  We need to ensure this is maintained.  There is an absolute requirement on the Government to ensure this is delivered upon. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700032#EE00900","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602079200,"counter":248,"content":"<p>There are two issues I want to speak about.  The first is the very good news that emerged from Athens a few hours ago on the conviction of the fascist organisation Golden Dawn.  The top leaders of that organisation have been convicted of running a criminal organisation.  Its members have been convicted of the murder in 2013 of 34-year-old rapper Pavlos Fyssas, a left-wing activist.  Golden Dawn has been convicted of the attempted murder of Egyptian fishermen and a brutal assault on communist trade union activists of the All-Workers Militant Front, PAME.  I pay tribute to the anti-fascist lawyers involved and, in particular, the broader anti-fascist movement that drove this process.  It was not driven by the capitalist state; it was driven from below by the anti-fascist movement.  In fact, the state prosecutor at one stage recommended the acquittal of some of those who have now been convicted.  It is a victory for the acquitted and the entire anti-fascist movement.  If we consider the brutal violence and horrific stabbing of Pavlos Fyssas by a Golden Dawn activist and read the transcripts of the telephone calls throughout the organisation on the assaults on the communist activists and Egyptian fishermen, we see the threat the far right and fascism pose if they get a foothold in society.  It is a warning to all of us in Ireland, where the far right is trying to get a toehold.  It poses, even before coming to power, a serious threat in terms of assault and a threat to the lives of migrants, left-wing activists, LGBTQ activists, trade union activists and others.  They absolutely have to be stopped.  We cannot rely on the State to do so.  The infiltration of the police in Greece by Golden Drawn is a striking feature.  We must build a mass movement to stop the far right, using the slogan \"No paseran\", which means &ldquo;They shall not pass&rdquo;.  We must also build a left-wing political alternative to channel the genuine anger and alienation of people in a correct direction.<\/p>  <p>  My second point is that there is a growing European movement for a Covid tax, a tax on the super-wealthy and the big corporations here and across the rest of Europe.  The view is that they must pay the price for the impact of the coronavirus pandemic as opposed to hitting ordinary people with austerity.  It is a proposal for four sorts of taxes: the first on the assets of  investment funds and holding companies; the second on property transfers; the third on net corporate profits exceeding &euro;5 million; and the fourth on wealth.  It is vital that we make the rich pay for this crisis as opposed to ordinary people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700033#FF00200","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1602079200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>To follow on from that, I wish to add to the point I made to the Taoiseach earlier.  The EU fiscal treaty rules have been waived in the context of Covid-19.  Unless there is something we do not know, there is nothing whatsoever in those rules preventing the Government from spending the extra money that would be necessary to restore the PUP, the wage subsidy and other supports.  As Deputy Paul Murphy just indicated, we could achieve this by imposing a solidarity tax.  Considering that savings are growing among certain groups and profits are increasing in certain sectors, such as pharmaceuticals and IT, there is no reason whatsoever we could not impose a solidarity tax on those who are doing very well and use the proceeds to prevent our having to impose austerity, unfairness and hardship on people who have lost jobs and employment through no fault of their own as a result of the pandemic.  I urge the Government to do that.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said the deficit we could be facing at the end of the year is between &euro;10 billion and &euro;18 billion.  This is not an insignificant figure but, considering that &euro;64 billion was poured into the banks the last time we had a crash, it is a small price for ensuring solidarity and fairness for the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost incomes and employment as a result of Covid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700033#FF00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1602079200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I am thankful for the opportunity to speak during statements on the pre-Council meetings on 15 and 16 October 2020.  Three key issues are to be discussed, namely EU&ndash;UK relations, climate change and external relations with Africa.  I will take the opportunity to talk about the current status of the EU&ndash;UK relationship and various scenarios that will arise after January 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Thinking beyond the United Kingdom, I spoke last week in this House about how I believe our strategy for being Brexit-ready in the dairy sector has too great an emphasis on maintaining the status quo relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Notwithstanding my appreciation for the need to maintain a strong North&ndash;South relationship and that any approach we take must be embedded in an all-Ireland approach, Ireland should be openly talking to its EU colleagues about its position within the European Union when the United Kingdom leaves on January 2021.  This is not to say I do not highly commend the work the European Union has done in standing up for Irish interests in the negotiations with the United Kingdom; I am simply highlighting that it may happen that it will be more efficient for us to explore alternative areas of growth within the European Union than try to maintain a potentially unworkable relationship with the United Kingdom.  The level-headedness of the President of the European Council when he stated last week that we are united and very calm was quite welcome but a conversation now needs to begin on making adequate supports available to help countries, particularly Ireland, to realign themselves within the Single Market when the United Kingdom leaves.<\/p>  <p>  There is an important conversation on the rule of law in Europe at present.  There are calls for the Covid-19 recovery fund to be linked to adherence to the rule of law.  I very much support and agree with this.  While I recognise the need to uphold European values outlined in Articles 2 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union, which refer to \"respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities\", we must always ask ourselves what the impact of such measures will be on upholding these values.<\/p> <p>Will they make for stronger values by making the position of those who disregard them untenable and the people within the country call for change or will the EU be made a scapegoat by national governments, solidifying their power among their people even further, which is a major concern?<br\/><br\/>A large part of the reason for Brexit was that large parts of the UK felt they had been left behind.  This anger was taken by parties in the UK, turning the EU into a scapegoat and ultimately leading the people famously to want to take back control.  The EU should recognise the role that it must play in impacting the level of inequality across and within member states.  To uphold the integrity of the Union going forward this must be an issue that we take more seriously.  We must learn from the lessons of the reasons, perceived or otherwise, that caused the UK to leave the European Union.  Ireland experiencing first-hand the chaos that is caused by a fellow neighbour leaving the EU should be at the forefront of advocating for the EU to address seriously the issues that caused Britain to leave the EU.  If the EU is truly united on the issue of Brexit, it should be equally united in engaging on a level of self-reflection.<br\/><br\/>I understand that there is much that has to be done in the current negotiations and that altering some of the EU positions now may in some way weaken the EU negotiating hand <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the United Kingdom.  However, I think such a move would show the EU to be a more mature player in the negotiations and could potentially strengthen the ability of the EU to achieve the least disruptive form of Brexit, which would be incredibly important for people working in the agricultural sector, thousands of whom are living and based in my constituency.  It is of great importance to me to ensure that would happen.  This is not to say that the EU should lower itself to some of the, frankly, xenophobic tactics that have been used by some in the Brexit campaign.  It should reclaim the narrative of the benefits of the EU, while also working on the social reforms I outlined.<br\/><br\/>The United Kingdom Government has done a lot to make joining the EU the worst foreign policy decision the UK has ever implemented.  The EU should not only be strong in upholding the integrity of the Single Market, it should be firm on the benefits of it, of which there are many.  The balancing act of the reforms that are needed to prevent another Brexit, while also being more confident in asserting the positions of the EU are two points which I hope An Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, can express at the upcoming Council meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700033#FF00400","speaker":"1516","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602079800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>The threat of a no-deal Brexit cannot be overstated.  The Central Bank has stated that a no-deal Brexit could cost Ireland over 100,000 jobs.  Under a no-deal Brexit, the cost of food and other products in Ireland could jump massively.  The executive director of the Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association stated that 60% of flour exports from two mills in Belfast could be subject to &euro;172 per tonne.  Fisheries would lose up to 5,000 jobs.  In a no-deal Brexit, the &euro;5 billion of Irish agrifood exports to Britain would be in serious jeopardy.  The list goes on, the aforementioned being the tip of the iceberg.<\/p>  <p>  Beyond the economic cost, there is the major cost to the Six Counties of the North of Ireland.  I listened to the speech from Deputy Cian O'Callaghan a couple of minutes ago in which he spoke about the Achilles heel of Ireland in the Brexit situation.  The truth of the matter is the Achilles heel of Ireland's national interest is the fact that the Tory Government in London still has a radical influence over the direction of this country.  The Tories in London still determine whether or not we can trade North-South, whether we can move people North-South and whether we can act as an economic unit.  The Tories do not get a vote on the island of Ireland.  They have no interests in Ireland and they know nothing about it yet they determine our future and our self-interest.  As long as this continues, there is a weakness and an exposure with regard to Irish policy.<\/p>  <p>  One of the issues that has frustrated members of Aont&uacute; over the last while is the fact that the Government has been weak in its approach to Britain.  There is no doubt in my mind that Ireland's diplomatic approach, which is softly, softly and very quiet, may work with other European countries but it certainly does not work with Britain because Britain is an outlier.  Britain does not fulfil its word.  It has admitted that it has broken international law and yet it is the European Union that has done the running with regard to standing up for Ireland.  I have stated that it is a welcome decision of the European Union to take the British to a European court for its breaking of international law.  That was a positive and strong thing for the European Union to do.  However, I cannot understand why the Irish Government is so reticent to play hardball with the British because in fairness it is dealing with a country that is playing hardball with Europe.  It is a negotiation policy of the British to hold a gun to the head of the European Union with regard to the internal market Bill.  As a result, the Irish Government needs to step up to the plate with regard to its response.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most important documents ever written on the island of Ireland is the Good Friday Agreement.  It brought about a peace that many of my generation at that time did not think was possible.  It is central to the development of the country, especially to the unitary state that I would like to see some sunny day.  The truth of the matter is it is being radically abused by the British Government.  Until very recently there was very little response from the Irish Government in that regard.  The last time I spoke on this matter I urged the T&aacute;naiste to go to the United States and ask the special envoy to Ireland to visit the international capitals and impress upon them the necessity for them to stand up for international law and to renege on any prospect of a trade agreement with Britain until it fulfils its international obligations.  I am glad to see some of that has happened in recent times, but there is far more that could be done by the Irish Government in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  What is the Good Friday Agreement worth to us as a country?  How important is it?  Is it important enough for Ireland to threaten diplomatic relations between Ireland and Britain?  My instinct is that an international agreement of the importance of the Good Friday Agreement is so valuable that it would be a natural response from any government around the world in such a situation literally to threaten the aggressive behaviour of the other country, in this case Britain, with all of the tools available to it.  I would have liked to have seen Ireland take a legal case, if it were possible, against Britain for the steps it has taken.  I would have liked to have seen the Irish Government demand British diplomats attend Government Buildings and told in no uncertain terms that if Britain proceeds along this route of breaking international law, damaging the Good Friday Agreement, damaging peace and of potentially creating a hard border on the island of Ireland, diplomatic relations will be strained radically as a result.  I would threaten that if Britain proceeds down that route Ireland would break diplomatic relations with it.  Some people might say that is an extreme step to take but if the Good Friday Agreement is as important as all of that to us then there comes a time when Government has to take strong measures.  Thus far, we have remained behind the apron of the European Union.  The European Union has taken the strong measures.  I know from talking to people within the British political establishment that the legal case brought against Britain by the European Union has woken up many of the backbenchers, in particular in the Tory party, to just how severely the British have overstepped the mark on this.  Often times change in the Tory party is generated by backbenchers standing up against the Front Bench.<\/p>  <p>  If anything, the particular aggressive nature of the British in the negotiations that have happened needs to be matched by the Irish Government.  The British need to be told in no uncertain terms that we will not accept in any way any damage to the Good Friday Agreement or any damage to the unitary development of our State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700034#GG00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1602080400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I had prepared some notes and I will discuss them momentarily, but I must take exception to some of comments made by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  There appears to be a misconception that Ireland and the EU are somehow separate.  Ireland is the EU.  We are discussing our European Council meeting next week.  We are talking about an action taken in the Irish Government's name by the European Union, of which Ireland is an equal member.  The Irish Government has played a proactive role throughout the Brexit process.  Talk of cutting off diplomatic ties with the UK feeds into the extreme narrative of the very people Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n castigated on the Conservative Party's backbenches.  We are better than that, quite frankly.  We want a resolution of this.  Regardless of what happens on 1 January next, the UK will still be our nearest neighbour.  It will still be a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement which the Deputy mentioned.  We must act as the mature adult in the room and not separate the Irish effort from the collective European Union effort.  Michel Barnier is as much our negotiator as he is the European Commission's, Belgium's, Bulgaria's or any other member state's negotiator.  We have to state that and be very careful in our language.<\/p>  <p>  We are having statements before the European Council meeting.  We have not really had an opportunity to have post-European Council meeting statements, although the Minister of State attended for the first time last week.  It was great to see both him and the Taoiseach able to attend in person.  It is very important.  The issue I wish to raise regarding the previous Council meeting is that while I welcome the sanctions imposed by the European Union on the regime in Belarus, and I realise how difficult it was to get the agreement of all 27 member states on that, I am disappointed that the President of Belarus is not on the list, unlike in the actions taken by the UK, the US and other countries.  We must continue to look forward to that.  The sanctions against the Belarusian regime must include President Lukashenko and every key actor in his government.  The events we see in the streets of Minsk and across Belarus are galling, with people being taken from their families in the dead of night, beatings, intimidation and everything else.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the forthcoming European Council meeting, I expect the Council to ratify Mairead McGuinness as the new European Commissioner.  She came through the European Parliament's process today with a massive result.  It is a great testament to her 16 years as an MEP and the high regard in which she is held across the EU.  With regard to climate change, a challenge has been put down by the European Parliament to the European Council and each member state to raise their ambition.  Crucially, however, as regards Africa and the EU's co-ordinated approach to Africa, I believe this is something in which Ireland must play a more proactive role.  We must embrace the new embassies going to Ghana and across the continent.  Ireland has a proud history in Africa, be it through missionary work, its NGOs and, most importantly, its peacekeepers.  It behoves Ireland, as a small country that knows what colonialism and its legacy are, to play a proactive role in the European Union.  It is something on which we can lead.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs had a very worthwhile meeting this morning.  We discussed the update on Brexit negotiations with the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  It was a lengthy meeting and we covered a number of key areas.  I will not repeat them, but I wish to refer to the issues that pertain to next week's European Council meeting.  We must be wary of, and not feed into, the ongoing theatrics in London and the internal discussions within certain political parties or parliamentary chambers.  Once again, there is talk of artificial deadlines coming from British Government sources today.  That is inappropriate and we should not engage with, or feed into, it.  Of course, along with our European colleagues, we are aghast at the conditions contained in the Internal Market Bill and how they run a cart and horses through the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol, which is so vital not just to this island but also to the European Union and what it stands for when it comes to the rule of law, upholding peace treaties and being the most successful peace process in the world, as the European project is.<\/p>  <p>  More worrying, we look to what is coming down the track in the Finance Bill in the United Kingdom.  If measures that have been discussed are put into that Bill, at that stage we will know that the British Government simply is not serious about a deal.  However, it should never be the European Union which forces that.  The European Union has the absolute responsibility to debate to the last second and to ensure that we can try as much as possible to secure a future relationship between the EU and the UK.  That is why we look at the areas that provide the greatest difficulty and what the European response should be.  The European position and the mandate given to Michel Barnier by the Council and validated by the European Parliament is very important when it comes to the level playing field and making sure that the standards of the Single Market will always be maintained through any agreement with a third party.  That is what the UK is becoming.  It is a special third party, the only one that has ever left the EU, and is very close to the Union both geographically and economically.  However, in this member state we are aware of the importance of the level playing field for maintaining standards, be it in agrifood production or our approach to the environment.  Equally, there is the importance of state aid in that level playing field in the post-pandemic era, and ensuring that state aid is agreed and cannot be used to undermine the Single Market and its values.<\/p>  <p>  Moving parallel with the ongoing negotiations between Lord Frost and Michel Barnier, there is the joint implementation committee on the protocol.  I was heartened by the comments of European Commissioner Sefcovic yesterday in the European Parliament in which he made it clear that the joint implementation committee is not a negotiation.  The committee is about the implementation of the protocol.  It has been agreed.  The responsibilities of both the British Government and the European Union, and therefore the Irish Government, are quite clear in black and white.  We have seen great progress in places such as Dublin Port as we prepare for what will happen in the future, but that must be replicated in places such as Belfast Harbour, Belfast International Airport, Derry airport and Warrenpoint.<\/p>  <p>  The final point I wish to make is one we should discuss more.  It is not necessarily the negotiation between the UK and the EU, but the internal negotiation within the European Union.  I have been speaking to colleagues from other member states, either from our European People's Party, EPP, political family or contacts I have built up, and it is quite clear that the mood and opinion on Brexit are dimming ever so slightly among other member states.  It impacts on us and is important to us, but when speaking to colleagues the issue is making sure that we can keep it relevant.  Also, we must make sure that the impact of Brexit on Ireland, in an era when we are dealing with a global pandemic, is also reflected in the European Recovery Fund.  This is the major challenge specifically for the Minister of State, more so possibly than for the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach.  It is to make sure that we can deliver and that the Irish voice is heard on how acutely impacted we will be, regardless of what happens in the negotiation.  There is no such thing as a good Brexit for Ireland or Europe and certainly not for the United Kingdom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700035#HH00100","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1602080400,"counter":254,"content":"<p>With Brexit, I have seen today at first hand what happens if we do not get the ports right.

The potential disruption to trade flows between Ireland and the North of Ireland must be minimised.

That is very important.  Cattle are fairly good at the present time.  I have not been able to say that for the last four years while I have been up here in this House.  We do not want anything to happen that would be to the detriment of farm produce, whether it is the live export trade, the beef trade or any produce from Irish farms.  We must make sure.

The Brexit talks are rapidly coming to a head and we see from reports this week that there are only really two items holding up agreement.  One of those happens to be fishing.  We in the north west and in all coastal communities around the country are waiting to see what will happen.  Perhaps the British are using it to push for concessions on other matters from the EU.  If that is the case, what would be the <i>quid pro quo<\/i>?  If the deal comes, the question as to whether it will be of benefit to Ireland is vitally important too.<\/p><p>I am not so sure we should be confident that the EU is going to look after our fishing interests.  It has not done so in the past.  We are well down the EU pecking order in respect of fishing and it would not be beyond the EU to do a deal that looks after France, Spain and the Netherlands and leaves us behind.  Would that be the trade-off in respect of the Border?  Those are the things we need to know.  The fishing communities know full well that the EU has never had our best interests at heart.  Nor has our Government but that is another matter entirely.<\/p><p>The EU Council is pushing for more and more militarisation.  What is our role going to be in that?  We have troops already in Mali, Libya is very prominent in the EU's sights now and Mozambique appears to be next in line for EU troops.  The Portuguese Foreign Minister, Augusto Santos Silva, said there was a terrorist and jihadist insurgency there and that he was confident that the EU will respond positively to the Mozambican request for military help.  Maybe the EU could work towards the elimination of some of the root causes of terrorism instead such as insecurity, poverty, exclusion, unemployment, environmental degradation, corruption and the misuse of public funds, thereby contributing to the eradication of the terrorist organisations.  Such measures would respond to the needs of the Mozambican people, preventing them from being vulnerable targets of radicalisation through creating jobs and opportunities for young people.  It is important that the local population benefits from the exploitation of the natural resources which Mozambique possesses in abundance.  From the 1990s, the Mozambican elite was told the free market would end poverty and that by becoming rich they were helping the poor because wealth would trickle down to the poorest.  How long before there is an Irish contingent on a EU mission helping to prop up a corrupt elite and defending the interests of transnational mining and petrochemical corporations in Mozambique?  That is a question that should be asked at the next Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700036#JJ00300","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1602081000,"counter":259,"content":"<p>The next European Council meeting will concentrate on EU climate and digital goals and of course on Brexit.

As the Taoiseach indicated last week, the European Council held a number of discussions.<\/p> <p>He has asked me to outline the situation on EU-China relations, the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh and on the attempted assassination of Mr. Alexei Navalny.  I will briefly report on these matters and also discuss the issues of the EU and the African Union.  If I have time, I will go through some of the issues that were raised by Members.<\/p> <p> A planned EU-China summit in September was postponed in view of the Covid-19 situation.  At last week's European Council, leaders were briefed on a meeting held by video conference in place of the planned summit on 14 September between President Michel, President von der Leyen and Chancellor Merkel on the EU side, with Chancellor Merkel there on behalf of the German Presidency, and President Xi Jinping on the Chinese side.  <\/p> <p> In the discussion that followed, EU leaders emphasised the need to rebalance the economic relationship between the EU and China.  They also emphasised the goal of finalising negotiations on an ambitious EU-China comprehensive investment agreement by the end this year to address outstanding market access and level playing field issues that exist on various trading fronts.<\/p> <p> The European Council called on China to assume greater responsibility in dealing with global challenges, notably by taking more ambitious action on climate change, on supporting a multilateral response to Covid-19 and on debt relief with a particular focus on Africa.  Leaders also expressed their serious concerns about the human rights situation in China, which was also raised by the EU side at the meeting on 14 September.  Leaders at the European Council reaffirmed the EU's policy towards China and look forward to a meeting of all 27 leaders with President Xi next year.<\/p> <p> The European Council discussed the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, where the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan had escalated in the days before the meeting.  Leaders called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and for both Armenia and Azerbaijan to engage in substantial discussions without precondition.<\/p> <p> The European Council condemned the assassination attempt on Mr. Alexei Navalny with a chemical nerve agent from the novichok group.  They called on the Russian authorities to co-operate with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, OPCW, investigating this case.  The European Council will return to this matter next week following the release an OPCW report.  The matter is likely to form part of a wider discussion at the meeting on relations between the EU and Russia.<\/p> <p> Next week, the European Council will hold a strategic discussion on relations between the EU and the African Union.  This is crucially important.  This discussion was originally planned for the European Council in June of this year ahead of a summit between all 27 EU leaders and the African Union leaders at the end of October.  This summit has also been postponed but it is welcome that leaders will take the opportunity next week to discuss the EU's approach to Africa and the importance of strengthening relations between the EU and Africa.  The key strategic objective of the Government's new Africa strategy is to actively promote and contribute to a more effective EU-Africa partnership.<\/p> <p> The European Council may also discuss other topical external relations issues at the meeting next week.  Preparations for next week's meeting are ongoing and will be finalised at the General Affairs Council which I will attend in Luxembourg next week and the Taoiseach and I will report to the House following the European Council.  <\/p> <p> I will deal with some of the issues raised by Members.  I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for his comments on the multi-annual financial framework and the strong rule-of-law mechanism that is needed.  That is important.  The issue of Poland and Hungary is obviously important but there are other issues in Poland.  I assure Deputy O'Callaghan and the House that I had a bilateral meeting with my Polish counterpart and subsequently wrote to him specifically on rule-of-law issues.  Poland should be and is a long-standing friend of Ireland.  We are a country with warm relations with Poland.  As friends, we can say that we look at what is happening at the moment in Poland with confusion.  People simply cannot understand this is happening in the European Union and I urge Poland to look at what is happening.  I do so as a friend and do that to Poland as a country that has given us huge support and solidarity in the Brexit process.  I was glad to express our thanks to Poland for that at the General Affairs Council.<\/p> <p> The issue of Belarus has been mentioned and I am aware the Taoiseach discussed that.<\/p> <p> Deputy Carthy from Sinn F&eacute;in somehow blamed the Government with regard to the uncertainty on the European budget.  Through the Taoiseach in the summer, however, the Government agreed the budget for the European Union, including the agricultural budget, for the next seven years.  However, that must be approved democratically by the Parliament.  Negotiations are continuing with the European Parliament and it is looking for a much stronger recognition of rule-of-law issues.  As I understand it, the Sinn F&eacute;in Member of the European Parliament has signed up to a common position of the European Parliament on this issue.  Those negotiations obviously take time.  We hope they will conclude and I have no doubt we will be ready for what will be a massive financial package, not just to Irish farmers but to the broader EU, which then benefits us a small trading open economy.  If we have a strong Europe economically, our businesses and jobs will benefit.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputy O'Connor for his thoughtful at contribution.  He will be glad to know the issue of the conference on the future of Europe is very much on the agenda and I will take on board his points when we come to discuss that matter.  When that conference is set up, Deputy O'Connor and his constituents will have a huge opportunity to partake in that.  I certainly will encourage people to do that when it happens.<\/p> <p> The issue of ferries was brought up.  I visited Dublin Port this morning and we want to make sure we are ready.  The issue with shipping is that it is flexible.  It is not like a train line which goes from point to point and cannot be easily moved.  Routes are changing all the time and new routes have been added, allowing Ireland to trade directly with the continent.  That is happening already and I have no doubt more will happen.  I am not certain that a public service obligation, PSO, subsidy is needed.  I believe the market will react but, obviously, the Government keeps these things under review at all times. <\/p> <p> This morning, for example, I was able to visit a roll-on roll-off ferry that travels between Ireland and Portugal providing options that were not there before and it seems to suit quite a number of companies.  It was interesting to see the trading goods coming off that ferry this morning in Dublin Port.  I thank all our ports around the country for the work they are doing supported, obviously, by the Office of Public Works, OPW, the Revenue Commissioners and, particularly, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p> <p> As for Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's comments, I believe Deputy Richmond summed it up quite well.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n criticised Ireland for this mad proposal that we did not break off diplomatic relations on the one hand and he praised the European Commission for its tough approach to Britain on the other.  The European Commission acts on behalf of every member state of the European Union.  It is acting on our behalf.  That is what the agreement is with.  By publishing the Internal Market Bill and progressing it through the House of Commons, the United Kingdom is breaking an agreement with the European Union, which is all 27 members.  Therefore, the European Commission takes legal action on our behalf and it is doing so.  In praising the European Union for its action and in criticising the Irish Government for its alleged inaction, as outlined by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, the Deputy shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how the European Union works.  I have no difficulty in asking officials to discuss these issues in future with the Deputy if he needs to, because it is important we all have a good understanding of it.  <\/p> <p> The idea, however, that we would break off diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom at this particular moment or at any moment is completely mad, to put it mildly.  It is absolutely essential for us to maintain the Good Friday Agreement to which Britain, of course, is a party and that we maintain diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom and use our relations to influence them, to talk to them, speak honestly to them and be angry with them from time to time.  When one breaks off diplomatic relations, however, one does not have that connection or those relationships.  I am not even sure of the status of international agreements, when one breaks off diplomatic relations, such as the Good Friday Agreement.  Therefore, it is for the sake of the Good Friday Agreement.  I have said before that the agreement seeks to keep and maintain good relations between the communities in the North, to maintain good relations North and South and to maintain good relations between Britain and Ireland.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's position of seeking to break off diplomatic relations with Britain would, effectively, nullify the intention and purpose of the Good Friday Agreement.  Those three sets of relationships are key to maintaining peace on this island and key also to maintaining the allowance of the people of Northern Ireland to control their own destinies.  That is important.  <\/p> <p> I wish to thank our diplomats for the work they do.  We have read histories of what our diplomats have done over the years and history is repeating itself in terms of the good work they are doing in building up relations with key people, particularly, in the United Kingdom at this time.  We will probably read the history of that in years to come.  However, that work is ongoing.  We do not need to do as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n proposes and I am not sure anybody else in this House will take that proposal seriously.<\/p> <p> Make no mistake a Cheann Comhairle, the action taken by the European Commission on our behalf against the United Kingdom is absolutely necessary because what the United Kingdom did was completely wrong with regard to the Internal Market Bill.  That process will continue but we can take that hard line.  We can be angry with Britain and express it clearly, as the Taoiseach did to Boris Johnson while maintaining diplomatic relations, which are essential for all our futures on these two islands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700036#JJ00500","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602081600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.50 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1602082200,"counter":263,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700038#RR00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1602082200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputies Thomas Gould, Pa Daly, Rose Conway-Walsh and Martin Kenny - to discuss the crisis in local government funding due to Covid-19 measures; (2) Deputy Gary Gannon - to discuss expected strike action by school secretaries and ASTI members; (3) Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor - to discuss price increases for housing developments for first-time buyers; (4) Deputy Denis Naughten - to discuss a support scheme to ensure people with a disability have access to transport; (5) Deputy Fergus O'Dowd - to discuss the delayed appointment of staff in Drogheda to work on the national development plan; (6) Deputies P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan and Michael Moynihan - to discuss the provision of high-speed broadband throughout north Cork; (7) Deputy Jennifer Whitmore - to discuss the funding deficit in Wicklow County Council following delays in local property tax reform; (8) Deputies Chris Andrews and Louise O'Reilly - to discuss the lack of autistic spectrum disorders, ASD, places in Dublin; (9) Deputy Neale Richmond - to discuss rising concern over dissident paramilitary activity; (10) Deputy Sean Sherlock - to discuss the need to improve the condition of the N73 Mallow to Michelstown Road; (11) Deputy Carol Nolan - the need to prioritise the introduction of reforms to the fair deal nursing home support scheme; (12) Deputy Verona Murphy - to discuss the reinstatement of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers mobility scheme; (13) Deputy Mattie McGrath - to discuss the impact of new Covid-19 restrictions on the hospitality industry; (14) Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n - to discuss an update on implementation of the Scally and MacCraith reports on CervicalCheck; (15) Deputy Holly Cairns - to discuss the immediate suspension of commercial rates payments for small and medium enterprises, SMEs, impacted by Covid-19 restrictions; (16) Deputy Maurice Quinlivan - to discuss the reduction in funding for Shannon Heritage; (17) Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire - to discuss pay and conditions of school secretaries; (18) Deputy Ruair&iacute; &Oacute; Murch&uacute; - to discuss access to public liability insurance for the leisure and community sector; (19) Deputy Dessie Ellis - to discuss concerns of Aer Lingus employees about access to social welfare supports; and (20) Deputy Joe Flaherty - to discuss the need for a sustainable housing scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The matters raised by Deputies Thomas Gould, Pa Daly, Rose Conway-Walsh and Martin Kenny; Joe Flaherty; Gary Gannon; and Neale Richmond have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700038#RR00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1602082200,"counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700038#RR00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Fund","time":1602082200,"counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700038#RR00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1602082200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I spent 11 years as a councillor.

The reality is that 80% of the fund the Government gives to local authorities must be used for items that are already earmarked.  Therefore, there they have very little discretion in spending that fund.  I spoke to the chief executive officer of Leitrim County Council earlier today.  He told me that in his estimation the local authorities would need to get an increase of &euro;300 million in next year's budget and probably a further &euro;200 million in the following year to deal with the crisis they are facing now.<\/p>  <p>  This crisis has come about because many of the businesses from which they need to get rates are unable to pay those rates because they are not in business due to Covid.  In addition, many people in local authority housing are really stretched to pay their rents.  Many people also need other business services but they cannot get any money from them.

He should get his facts right before commencing this debate.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies for giving me the opportunity to speak on the importance of local authority funding and on the ongoing impact of Covid-19 on local authorities, and in particular their finances.  The challenges are common across the local government sector, notwithstanding the differences between urban and rural authorities in scale and sources of funding.  I addressed some of these issues in the House as recently as last night, and while there have been no significant developments overnight, I welcome the chance to hear Deputies directly on the financial issues.<\/p>  <p>  I want to reassure the House that my Department and I are continuing to make the case for the local government sector in the context of budget.  In this regard, the Department is engaging intensively with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the financial challenges facing local authorities as a direct consequence of the pandemic, both in terms of additional costs incurred as part of the strong local government response, and declines in local authority income streams.  These matters are under active discussion.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also working closely with the local government sector on these financial issues to secure additional support for local authorities and to ensure that any additional resources that may be available are appropriately targeted where they are most needed.  It is my intention, as part of this process, to ensure that local authorities, particularly those that suffered the impacts of the previous economic downturn most acutely, can recover as quickly as possible in order to drive local economic activity, and avoid significant deficits and additional debt as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, it is also important to recognise the role of elected members in the financial affairs of local authorities.  The adoption of a balanced budget is probably the single most important duty that elected members are called upon to carry out each year.  I fully recognise that this process is likely to require tough decisions by elected councils in the coming weeks.  While the Government is keen to support the local government sector and is working towards that end in the context of the forthcoming budget, it is important to reflect on the role of elected local authority members, who are best placed to determine the spending priorities in their respective counties.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>This is also a reserved function and local authorities must balance those priorities against available resources.  To achieve that balance, the elected members must make informed and necessary choices to balance the level of service provision with the available income.  In advance of budget 2021, I note that 22 of the local authorities throughout the country have opted to vary their local property tax, LPT, upwards while only three have opted to vary it downwards.  Arising from these variation decisions, the local authority sector will gain an additional &euro;11.5 million from LPT next year compared with 2020.  The elected members will now have to make decisions on how to balance the expenditure element of budget 2021 in line with the increase in LPT income.  Some authorities have already indicated to me that, in the event of the pandemic remaining a national issue in the medium term, it will be extremely difficult to present members with a balanced budget given the negative impact on certain services and income streams and also the increased expenditure required across an array of different services.  Notwithstanding that, the adoption of a balanced budget remains a requirement and I am confident that elected councils throughout the country will rise to the challenge and meet the requirements over the course of November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700038#RR00900","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602082800,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I will clarify something that the Minister of State perhaps does not know or has forgotten.

Cork City Council has increased the local property tax by 7.5% which should bring in an additional &euro;1.5 million but there will still be a shortfall of &euro;2.5 million.  The question for the Minister of State and the Government is whether they will betray local authorities this year, as they have done for years.

As the Minster of State shares a constituency with me, he will be very aware of the need for a similar scheme in six or seven counties, namely, a sustainable house-building programme.  County Longford will obviously be one of those.  The average price for a standard three-bedroom, semi-detached starter home should be &euro;229,000 whereas the average price of a house sold locally is only &euro;122,000.  The reason is that it is not commercially viable for builders to build houses in these counties at the moment.  In County Longford it has been almost 12 years since we last had a three-bedroom, semi-detached house built commercially.  In the intervening 12 years, the local authority estimates it has turned down more than 500 applicants for social housing on the basis that their income has exceeded the threshold.  That means they earn too much to qualify for social housing supports yet they will be unable, in all likelihood, to secure mortgages.  I am working with countless couples in such a bind.  They are working hard, trying to save for a deposit for a house that will not, in all likelihood, materialise because the supply simply is not there.<\/p>  <p>  Just 140 houses were built in County Longford last year and more than half of those were for social housing.  I appreciate that we got things wrong in the noughties when nearly 4,000 houses were built in the county in the four years to 2007.  Post-2008, a first-rate team from Longford County Council's engineering department rehabilitated many of these ghost estates and today the local authority housing stock is supplemented by an additional 1,000 houses through leasing and rental support schemes.  The housing sector in County Longford and other socioeconomically similar areas needs a cautious and measured intervention.  I earnestly hope the Department can roll out such a sustainable house-building programme.  Ideally, I envisage the State, through the local authority, providing up to &euro;60,000 of the &euro;229,000 cost of a starter home, which I mentioned, and the applicants could in turn raise their mortgage through the Rebuilding Ireland scheme.  This is the type of measured, assured and cautious intervention that will ultimately reinvigorate provincial Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700039#SS00700","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1602082800,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue we face in society.  The Government is absolutely focused on ensuring affordable, quality housing solutions are available to everyone in society and this is reflected in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.  The programme commits to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system through the progression of State-backed affordable housing.  This is a key priority of the Minister and since taking office, he has reviewed the situation on the ground with regard to supply, progress to date across affordability measures and options for the expansion of affordable housing delivery.<\/p> <p>The statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase in the State is Part V of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which was commenced in June 2018.  A total of &euro;310 million has been made available under the serviced sites fund to support the delivery of affordable homes by local authorities for purchase under the scheme.  The fund subvents the cost of facilitating infrastructure and a maximum funding amount of &euro;50,000 is available per home.  On this basis, at least 6,200 more affordable homes to buy or rent can be facilitated by this measure alone.  To date, funding of &euro;127 million has been approved in principle to provide infrastructural works and it will support 35 projects delivering 3,200 homes and 14 local authorities.<br\/><br\/>Serviced sites funding targets affordable interventions in areas where housing affordability is demonstrated as a challenge.  To identify this, all local authorities were invited to complete financial economic assessments to confirm whether the provision of affordable homes was required and economically viable.  Local authorities were also asked to assess housing affordability more generally within their areas.  I advise the Deputy that Longford County Council did not submit an economic case for assessment to the Department at the time.  This indicates the local authority did not identify a housing affordability issue in the county at that time.  It is incumbent on the Government that funds are directed to and utilised where demand is greatest and where there is a clearly identified need and the potential for delivery under the scheme.<br\/><br\/>In preparing to reply to this topical debate I looked at new house prices in Longford on <i>daft.ie<\/i>.  It indicates that of the 263 properties for sale in the county 143 of them, or 54%, have an asking price of less than &euro;200,000 and a significant number of these have prices below &euro;100,000.  CSO data shows the emergence of a significant new build premium in the home purchase market.  In the 12 months to June 2020, the difference between the median sale price of new and existing homes was &euro;104,000, or 44% higher for new properties at national level.  It is evident that many prospective purchasers in Longford are choosing to buy homes from existing housing stock rather than paying a new home premium.  Notwithstanding the fact that the new build home price quoted by the Deputy would be considered achievable for moderate income earners, I acknowledge there may be challenges for some in purchasing a home in Longford.  To support such households, other measures, such as a help to buy scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, are also available to eligible purchasers.  Nationally, to make up the ownership and make it more affordable, as part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus plan an enhanced version of the help to buy scheme was announced.  This will allow first-time buyers purchasing a newly built home or building one themselves to claim back up to &euro;30,000 paid in income tax or DIRT and bank deposit interest over the past four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700039#SS00800","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602083400,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, for the comprehensive overview and I emphasise the issue in Longford is not an affordability one but a sustainability one because we simply cannot get builders to come forward to build houses because it is not commercially viable.

One of the biggest shifts certainly has been in lifestyle choices and where people choose to live.  If we want to make it easier for couples and families to live in County Longford as it stands we simply do not have the housing stock to fulfil that aspiration.  Coming from the same constituency as I do, the Minister of State will comprehend the viability challenge that exists for builders, and if it is a case that we can tweak the existing affordability scheme to foster sustainable house building in counties such as Longford then it will be a major breakthrough in terms of re-energising rural communities and provincial towns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700040#TT00200","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1602083400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I will ensure the issue of new build viability is examined more, including the provision of serviced sites for local authorities in towns and villages.

As she is aware, the F&oacute;rsa Trade Union school secretary branch, which represents more than 1,000 school secretaries in primary and secondary schools nationwide, has indicated that notice of industrial action will be served shortly to more than 1,000 individual schools and the Department of Education and Skills.  School secretaries will hold three one day work stoppages on Friday, 23 October, Monday, 2 November, and Friday, 13 November, followed by an indefinite strike commencing on Monday, 16 November.  The continuing dispute with the Department is due to a long-standing two tier pay system that leaves most school secretaries earning just &euro;12,500 a year with irregular short-term contracts that force them to sign on during the summer holidays and the school breaks.<\/p>  <p>  I was very disappointed to find out that last week at the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department of Education and Skills failed to engage in the substantial issues of the claim in terms of pay regularisation and terms and conditions.  The fact that school secretaries, many of whom earn just &euro;12,500 a year, are completely undervalued in terms of the work they do means they will take this action.  It is unfortunate but I absolutely back them as they endeavour on this path.  There is still time to resolve the issue.  What occurred at the Workplace Relations Commission last week was very unfortunate.  If we can get in front of the issue we have to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I note the change in direction is a departure from the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party manifestoes, which committed the parties to ending the two tier system.  More surprisingly, it is also a change in direction from what was communicated by the Minister's predecessor.  He committed to using the workplace relations mechanism to address the unfairness experienced by school secretaries throughout Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious we are in the midst of a pandemic and I fully appreciate that the school secretaries to whom I have spoken do not take this decision lightly but they are no longer willing to be undervalued and underappreciated.  I hope that if this does come to pass we will not simply dismiss their claim and tell them they should have waited until the pandemic is over.  They have waited an incredibly long time.  These are people who have very scant access to sick pay, maternity pay or secure employment.  At present, in schools throughout the country they are the people who are the first port of call telling children to make sure their hands are sterilised.  They were carrying tables around schools ensuring they were all set up.  They are invaluable to the working of a school.  If they have to take industrial action nobody will cross those pickets.  This will mean our schools will close, which places everybody in jeopardy because we need to keep them open.  How has the Department committed, or how will it commit, to addressing this issue using the workplace mechanisms already at its disposal?

I have met F&oacute;rsa, which represents many of the secretaries working in our schools.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of their valuable role in our schools I have put in place special arrangements for the coming year, whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from Covid-19 cannot work on the school premises.<\/p> <p>I have also extended the employment assistance scheme towards school staff including secretaries.  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes.  Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions, those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment actually rests with the schools.<\/p> <p> On foot of a chairman's note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator.  The arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  Last year, the trade union, F&oacute;rsa, tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement.

The report found that a hard border would be highly likely to lead to an increase in terrorist attacks and any border structure would be a target for such attacks.  That is no surprise to the Minister of State, me or anyone who has been following discussions on Brexit over the past few years.<\/p>  <p>  Today, we saw further evidence before the House of Commons Northern Irish affairs committee where academics have once again stressed the point made previously by the former US Senator George Mitchell, former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern and many others.<\/p>  <p>  The report rates a threat of violence from dissident republicans as severe with the New IRA the most widespread dissident republican group.  This is a worrying fact on many fronts.  It is worrying for people who will be affected by these attacks, the families who will be torn apart by such violence and for those people on both sides of the Border who have lived in relative peace for over 20 years.<\/p>  <p>  This past summer we saw excellent work by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which contributed to the arrest by the PSNI of nine members of the New IRA.  These arrests led to sentencing of the effective army council of the New IRA.  While this is welcome, it is quite clear the threat has not gone away.  As per the report laid before the committee in Westminster earlier this week, we see an increasing amount of co-operation between the leadership and membership of the New IRA and the Continuity IRA.  While many people once referred to these dissident republican terrorists as disparate criminal gangs working sometimes against each other, this new level of co-ordination should not be taken for granted.  Any hard border could be used as a recruitment tactic for these groups, preying on disenfranchised youths on both sides of the Border and fanning the flames of anger and violence which have been diminishing since the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Dissident threats lie on both sides of the political divide.  In this report, there is a worrying reference to loyalist paramilitary activity increasing, particularly around certain parts of Belfast.  It does not really matter where it happens on this island.  It is a concern for the Government and the agents of the State regardless.<\/p>  <p>  We have been lucky to have such widespread support from our European colleagues to ensure there is no hardening of the Border on this island.

With the UK's Internal Market Bill, we see the risk to the withdrawal agreement and the protocol that were designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to ensure the Border remains seamless.

There are, of course, ongoing reviews of the threat assessment arising from the activities of these groups.  The Minister is kept informed of the threat assessment in this regard by the Garda Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  The security assessment of the terrorist threat level in Northern Ireland is classed as severe.  The dissident paramilitary groups continue to focus their efforts primarily on targeting members of the security forces in Northern Ireland.  I note that earlier this week, the UK's intelligence and security committee published a report on terrorism in Northern Ireland which underlined the ongoing challenge from dissident republicans.  While the threat of attack from these groups here is generally considered to be low, they still present a real and persistent threat, carrying out fundraising and planning preparatory activities to support attacks in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The authorities here are taking and will continue to take all necessary and appropriate measures to counteract the threat from dissident republicans.

The date of 31 December 2020 is drawing in and this signals a major change for Irish businesses doing business with the UK as it exits the EU Single Market and the customs union.  Businesses that move goods from or through Great Britain will be subject to a range of customs formalities, sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks and other regulatory requirements that do not apply to such trade today.<\/p>  <p>  I want to stress the importance for businesses to act now to get ready for the changes that we know are coming in January and to make it clear that these changes will happen regardless of the outcome of the negotiations between the EU and the UK on a free trade agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Businesses have already had to deal with a lot of change this year.  They have demonstrated that they can adapt rapidly to public health guidance and they will adapt to change again.  The Government stands ready to assist and guide businesses in dealing with the changes that Brexit will bring, including both the changes we already know are coming and those that might come to pass.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent round of Brexit negotiations concluded last week with Michel Barnier stating that there is still a considerable way to go before agreement can be reached.  The European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, also reviewed progress on the status of the negotiations in a call on Saturday, 3 October.  While their joint statement noted that progress had been made, &ldquo;significant gaps remained, notably but not only in the areas of fisheries, the level playing field, and governance&rdquo;.  They have instructed their chief negotiators to work intensively to try to bridge those gaps.  We know that unlocking these outstanding issues is crucial in moving towards a more intensified phase of the talks.<\/p>  <p>  A no-trade deal is in no one&rsquo;s interests and we want to forge the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, although this cannot come at any cost.  We cannot undermine the EU&rsquo;s economic interests or the integrity of the Single Market and we must have a level playing field, that is, a set of common minimum standards.  It is not acceptable for Great Britain to try to undercut us on standards when it comes to workers&rsquo; rights, the environment or health and safety.  The EU is continuing to negotiate in good faith to try to achieve the type of future partnership with the UK that was described in the political declaration, agreed less than a year ago.  That can only happen if the UK honours the political declaration and the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish protocol, in full.<\/p>  <p>  Our aim is a zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement, linked to a fisheries agreement, as well as measures to ensure that a level playing field will operate between the EU and the UK.  I believe a no-quotas, no-tariffs agreement with some form of minimum standards and controls on state aid and fishing is still possible.  But we are planning for the possibility that there will not be a deal.  Our message to businesses is to get ready, because deal or no deal, things are going to be different.<\/p> <p>In a nutshell, businesses need to get ready, get informed and get support.<\/p> <p> We will focus on the businesses that could be worst affected, such as those in agri-food and small exporters.  We want to help them to retain their market in Britain and to open up other markets, a task that is made all the more difficult by Covid-19 because of the restrictions on international travel.<\/p> <p> Even the smallest businesses need to take immediate steps to understand the impact on their operations of the UK exit from the Single Market and customs union.  They must be ready for changed customs and supply chains.  Failure to engage with and comply with new customs rules and other regulatory checks will prevent businesses continuing to trade with Great Britain.  In turn, this could lead to significant delays in moving goods to, from or through Great Britain from 1 January 2021.  The Government is working in partnership with businesses as they face these challenges and has taken a multifaceted approach to assist and financially support businesses through essential planning.  We have provided targeted grants and advisory services to assist with both these vital issues through our agencies, and I urge every business to engage now.<\/p> <p> In early September, the Government published a Brexit Readiness Action Plan.  This plan provides guidance and advice to business and individuals in a vast range of areas including trade in goods and services, customs and other sanitary and phytosanitary checks and controls, import duties, EU Single Market accreditations, use of the British land bridge, data transfer, recognition of qualifications, and many other issues.  The plan provides clear advice on steps that need to be taken by businesses to deal with these many and varied issues come 1 January 2021.<\/p> <p> The readiness work is complemented by a major national communications campaign under the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready brand.  Despite the impact of Covid-19 and the approaching Brexit deadline, many Irish exporters are resilient and optimistic.  A recent survey of Enterprise Ireland clients found that 57% expect to grow their exports in 2021, 83% intend to hire new staff in 2021 and more than eight in ten exporting companies are either confident or very confident about the international trading environment in 2021.  This optimism is encouraging and the results are encouraging for this cohort of exporting companies but, of course, this view is likely to be different for SMEs that are more domestically focused and therefore need greater assistance from the Government.<\/p> <p> New customs facilities will be the most immediate and visible impact on businesses on 1 January.  All businesses that want to continue trading with Great Britain in January must, at a minimum, have an economic operators&rsquo; registration and identification, EORI, number.  This identifier will allow them to submit the necessary customs declarations.  It is positive that over 67,000 businesses now have an EORI number but I am concerned that many businesses, though a small percentage in terms of trade, have not yet registered with the Revenue Commissioners.  As part of an intensified engagement, the Revenue Commissioners are now making follow-up phone calls to some 14,000 businesses it believes will be most significantly impacted.  <\/p> <p> The Government is also helping businesses to develop the skills and systems necessary to handle new customs requirements.  As part of the July jobs stimulus, the Government announced a &euro;20 million ready for customs package to help businesses to put in place the necessary internal arrangements, staffing, software and IT systems to be ready for the new customs arrangements and regulatory requirements.  As part of this package, Enterprise Ireland launched a new ready for customs grant through which businesses can claim grants of up to &euro;9,000 per eligible employee hired, or redeployed within the business, to a dedicated customs officer role.  I strongly encourage businesses to avail of this grant to assist them in hiring or redeploying employees to a dedicated customs role.  Enterprise Ireland is also running an online customs insights course for businesses dealing with customs for the first time.  Some 1,000 businesses have registered for Clear Customs Online 2020 since its launch on 9 September.  This free online training programme, provided by Skillnet Ireland, is also helping Irish businesses prepare for increased customs requirements.  <\/p> <p> Local enterprise offices are carrying out the second phase of their one-to-one successful Brexit mentoring and training Prepare Your Business for Customs workshops.  These will commence this month and will be supported by a full awareness campaign to target small Irish businesses.  <\/p> <p> Enterprise Ireland, local enterprise offices and InterTradeIreland are providing a range of initiatives to assist with getting Brexit ready.  These include planning vouchers, consultancy and mentoring, tariff advisory services, research on new markets and innovation.  Enterprise Ireland has launched a Brexit readiness checker.  The tool follows on from the Brexit scorecard and will produce a report assessing a company&rsquo;s readiness for Brexit across a range of areas and signpost users to resources to assist them on their journey.<\/p> <p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Act On initiative is helping Brexit-exposed companies to create strong action plans to deal with areas such as financial and currency management, strategic sourcing, and customs and logistics.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to help in the form of grants, mentoring and training to enable its clients to examine their exposure and their capability to meet both the challenges and opportunities Brexit presents.<\/p> <p> InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s Brexit advisory service offers a focal point for businesses working to navigate changes in cross-border trading relationships.  The Brexit advisory service has proved popular, with over 700 SMEs directly engaging with it in 2020.  As part of this service, InterTradeIreland has run a series of awareness-raising events to help improve knowledge of customs processes and procedures, as well as identifying actions businesses can take in areas like logistics and supply chain management.  InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s Brexit planning voucher enables eligible businesses to seek professional advice on how best to plan for Brexit.  This voucher helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, and regulatory and customs issues.<\/p> <p> Local enterprise offices continue to offer their grants to business including the technical assistance for micro exporters, TAME, grant of &euro;2,500 and the lean for micro grants to drive productivity improvements.<\/p> <p> Financial assistance is also available through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  For example, the Brexit loan scheme offers businesses the means to deal with short-term liquidity issues that could arise in buying stocks or for delays that could arise at the ports.  To help businesses secure longer-term funding for investment purposes, the SBCI future growth loan scheme was expanded at the beginning of the summer in response to very high demand.  It provides up to &euro;800 million in lending to eligible businesses to support strategic long-term investment, including for a post-Brexit and post-Covid-19 environment. <\/p> <p> The new &euro;2 billion credit guarantee scheme, launched in mid-September, is the largest guarantee scheme that has ever been provided for Irish businesses to date to ensure that low-cost loans are available for Irish businesses as they rebuild both through Covid-19 and Brexit.  We have also provided further funding to Microfinance Ireland to ensure it can meet the needs of microenterprises that cannot avail of bank funding over the coming period.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Finance has indicated that budget 2021 will be framed on the basis of a no-deal Brexit and we will consider what further targeted measures to help businesses and affected sectors measures are needed in that context as the shape of the final trade deal with the UK becomes clear. <\/p> <p> The launch of the Brexit Readiness Action Plan was accompanied by an intensified communications campaign under the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready brand.  The campaign targeted small businesses, including shops, hauliers, farmers, fishermen and fisherwomen, and others who trade with the UK, who are most exposed.  The campaign ran from 9 to 27 September with advertisements on national radio in English and Irish, as well as in the main daily, Sunday and regional papers.  This campaign is now being followed up by specific sectoral campaigns.  While it has raised awareness of the changes at the end of transition, we know that further work is needed.<\/p> <p> This morning, I chaired a meeting of the enterprise forum on Brexit and global challenges.  The group has been meeting on Brexit since early 2017.  The role of business representative groups is crucial in getting messages out through their membership and we will continue to use this forum and others to help get the message out over the coming weeks.<\/p> <p> Tomorrow, I will write to all 250,000 businesses that are registered in the State to inform them of the most important actions that they need to take in advance of 1 January and to provide them with a useful Brexit checklist of those actions and contact details of the Government agencies they can contact to help.  The Revenue Commissioners have written to over 90,000 businesses that have traded with the UK since 2019 to advise them of the essential customs changes that lie ahead.  That letter also included relevant information from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on exporting animals, plants and products of animal and plant origin.  As I mentioned earlier, Revenue is following up this by way of telephone calls.<\/p> <p>Earlier this week Revenue hosted a series of Brexit information webinar sessions covering a range of technical issues such as submitting customs declarations, understanding how the origin of goods is dealt with and managing goods in transit.  My Department presented on the enterprise and financial assistance available. <\/p> <p> Other agencies under my remit, such as the Health and Safety Authority, Irish National Accreditation Board and the National Standards Authority of Ireland, are actively engaged in a series of webinars this month and for the remainder of this year.  I encourage Deputies to visit their websites and access the virtual events at any time.<\/p> <p> As well as the challenges facing businesses in the customs and SPS area, changes are coming in the regulatory area due to the UK leaving the Single Market.  EU law in the area of product standards and certification will no longer apply to Great Britain.  This has a direct impact on businesses if they are, for instance, engaged in putting industrial goods on the EU market and had relied on the UK for product certification such as the CE mark.  <\/p> <p> From 1 January, UK notified bodies will no longer be authorised to certify the compliance of EU products with EU rules and standards in respect of specific regulatory controls, public safety, etc.  For businesses that currently rely on UK notified bodies for conformity assessment certificates, it is essential that they source an alternative approved notified body established in Ireland or another EU country.  This may involve transferring existing certificates to a notified body in another member state or obtaining new ones altogether.  Many businesses have taken the necessary steps to address this issue.  Businesses that source products requiring EU certification from the UK should engage with their EU-based notified bodies.<\/p> <p> Other impacts in this area that businesses may need to consider include: requirements to register products on EU databases; requirements to be established in the EU; and requirements relating to the marking and labelling of goods.  Manufacturers, distributors, importers and authorised representatives of industrial products must comply with their obligations and responsibilities under EU product legislation when placing a product on the EU market. <\/p> <p> To provide clarity to businesses in affected sectors on the new procedures and requirements at the start of next year, a wide range of webinars are being hosted by Government Departments and agencies, as I previously mentioned.  These webinars cover a wide range of issues, including implications for industrial products, how the supply chain may be impacted by Brexit, CE marking products post-Brexit and tariff classification.<\/p> <p> The introduction of new import and export processes, along with enhanced checks and controls on trade between the EU and Great Britain, may lead to disruption in the supply chains for Irish-based retail and other businesses.  It is important that retailers intensify their work on understanding and strengthening their supply chains in order to mitigate disruption and to limit potential congestion at the ports.<\/p> <p> The food supply chain is a matter of the highest importance to the Government and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, chairs the retail forum.  He is looking at the issue closely.  Along with other Departments, we will continue to work closely with stakeholders in the grocery retail and distribution sector to ensure that preparations are being undertaken by businesses to manage potential impacts on supply chains so as to minimise the risk of disruption in January.<\/p> <p> To ensure the highest possible degree of efficiency at Dublin port regarding customs checks and SPS inspections, effective planning is being put in place by the relevant State bodies and this work is being overseen by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  To assist this sector in bringing business online, Enterprise Ireland administers the online retail scheme. The objective of the scheme is to help companies in the indigenous retail sector with a pre-existing online presence to respond to domestic and international consumer demand for a competitive online offer.<\/p> <p> At European level, the European Council has approved the establishment of a &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment reserve to counter adverse consequences in member states and sectors that are worst affected by Brexit.  We expect the European Commission to present a proposal by November and as one of the member states most impacted by Brexit, we are working with the Commission to ensure the allocation criteria for the fund are targeted at those member states and sectors most affected by Brexit.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, met Commissioner Johannes Hahn in Brussels on 22 September and discussed with him Ireland&rsquo;s priorities and the need to target the most exposed sectors.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and I met Commissioner Margrethe Vestager today and I will be engaging with European and Government colleagues over the coming weeks and months to ensure Ireland makes the best use of the measures available to help deal with Brexit and Covid-19. <\/p> <p> As a small open economy, Ireland relies on external demand and international markets for sustainable and continued growth.  Exports lead to sustainable job opportunities and growth in revenues for firms beyond that available in the domestic economy, while having a substantial multiplier effect across the entire economy in terms of jobs and tax revenues. <\/p> <p> Export growth in recent years has been exceptionally strong, but should not be taken for granted.  Ireland's overall export performance over the past ten years has been marked by year-on-year growth, with total exports of goods and services reaching a further record level of &euro;366 billion last year.  This strong performance makes a continued significant contribution to our economic growth.  Indeed, despite the challenges posed for our economy, trade figures released by the CSO last month show that goods exports over the period from January to July increased by 6% compared to the same period in 2019.<\/p> <p> We have experienced two recessions in the past 12 years.  Many things make them different, but there is one thing that makes them similar, the fact that our multinational and export sectors have held up the economy.  I do not think anyone can doubt the value of being part of a globalised trading system and making Ireland an attractive place for multinationals to invest.  It is important that we never fundamentally change those economic policies that have ensured we will be able to export our way out of two recessions caused by very different reasons.  <\/p> <p> The Irish exporting landscape is strong and companies in Ireland have been succeeding in winning business worldwide for their products and services.  While the UK is, and will remain, a major market for Irish companies, expanding the Irish export footprint in markets beyond the UK is a priority.  In that context, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to help Irish exporters to be more innovative, competitive and market diversified.<\/p> <p> Enterprise Ireland client companies achieved record levels of exports in 2019 against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty.  In 2019, the eurozone region, which is a focus of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s diversification strategy, saw growth of 15%, with Germany, France and the Netherlands each exceeding &euro;1 billion in exports.  While Enterprise Ireland client companies&rsquo; exports to the UK increased by 2% in 2019, this accounted for only 31% of their exports compared to 42% in 2009.  The ratio has been falling steadily since then and provides assurances that Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s diversification strategy is being successfully implemented.<\/p> <p> Of course, retaining and strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a first-class destination for foreign direct investment is fundamentally important to our economic model.  That is why IDA Ireland continues to work closely with international clients from a range of sectors to attract job-rich investment from overseas firms, often in the face of increasing international competition for high-value investment projects.<\/p> <p> In doing so, the IDA has targeted new name investors and increased investment from companies already located here.  The agency has also restructured its global footprint in response to Brexit and other global challenges.  This expansion of the IDA&rsquo;s presence overseas has allowed IDA staff to secure new investment opportunities from non-traditional target markets and to further diversify our sources of investment.  The IDA continues to emphasise the core elements of Ireland&rsquo;s value proposition for foreign direct investment, particularly those with increased relevance in the post-Brexit landscape such as EU membership, access to talent, the common law system and the English language.<\/p> <p> Next month I will publish the national economic plan to set out a vision for what our post-pandemic and post-Brexit economy will look like.  It will look to the future and set out how our economy can be positioned to exploit opportunities for growth in the emerging sectors and how we can embrace the twin transition, which will be digital and green.  Drawing from the ambition of the programme for Government, it will set out how the State can facilitate new ways of working and prepare for the transitioning of enterprises and workers in response to technology and climate change developments.<\/p> <p> We cannot get away from the fact that the trading environment with the UK outside of the EU will fundamentally change from 1 January.  Our job is to encourage and work closely in partnership with businesses to help them work through these challenges and face the realities ahead.  I sincerely regret that businesses must face these realities while dealing every day with the ongoing struggles the health pandemic presents.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>I know it is a huge ask and I do not in any way underestimate the challenges.  For our part, Government will assist businesses as much as possible to face the realities of the changes that will take effect on 1 January, to overcome them and to prosper into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700042#VV00500","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602086400,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Brexit poses a huge threat to the economic future of the people of this island, with the land Border resulting in the North being forced out of the Single Market, with barriers to trade, potential devastation of agriculture, not to mention the potential implications for the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.  This is one area in which I am sure there is unanimity across this House and among sensible people throughout this island.  The only way to prepare for what is coming down the road with Brexit is a proactive detailed strategy to deal with the special and unique circumstances faced by the island of Ireland and the needs of our farming community, businesses and workers, all-island trade and the huge challenge for future trading relationships between the European Union and Britain.  <\/p>  <p>  This past year has been a very difficult time for business and workers in this State.  Covid-19 has rocked our economy and society to their very core.  It has shone a light on the need for big government and the steady hand of the State, the importance of public services and nationalised services, and the requirement for ambitious and assertive actions from Government.  We can debate whether such actions have occurred but when we look at those countries that have combated the virus best, namely, Germany, Vietnam, New Zealand and many more, we see a significant government response.  The reason I refer to this is that Brexit will not be any different.  It will take a great effort by the State and its steady hand will continue to be needed until Brexit has been concluded and for a considerable time thereafter.  While we will also need EU support, our Government will have to do the bulk of the heavy lifting.  <\/p>  <p>  As Britain withdraws from the European Union, protecting jobs and supporting business need to be at the forefront of the minds of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, his officials and everyone working on this issue in his Department.  There is probably little doubt that Brexit will exacerbate the current economic crisis.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long argued that the EU fiscal rules will stifle essential investment and starve public services of the funding they so badly need and on this we have been proven correct.  While the rules have been relaxed until the end of 2021, that relaxation must continue for this State beyond that timeframe, especially given the impending effect of Brexit.  These combined events constitute an exceptional circumstance and the EU should allow for continued derogation as per the fiscal rules so as to allow the Government adequate scope to invest North and South in order to protect against the fallout from Brexit and put the country in prime position to thrive in the aftermath of Brexit.  This means that we should be looking at grants and other economic supports that have been used throughout the Covid-19 crisis to help businesses which will be affected by Brexit.  Grant aid and wage supports have been successful in helping to stabilise many businesses and preventing their collapse.  As we approach Brexit and the implications that it will have for the agrifood and manufacturing sectors, the State must stand ready to support these businesses and the workers whose livelihoods depend upon them.<\/p>  <p>  On the matter of state aid, the European Commission published a temporary framework for state aid measures to support the economy during the Covid-19 outbreak until the end of 2021.  While Sinn F&eacute;in finds the idea that the State cannot invest in companies and businesses in its own jurisdiction somewhat ridiculous and a significant infringement of our sovereignty, the relaxation was nonetheless to be welcomed.  However, the relaxation of state aid rules for the purposes of Covid-19 will not cover this State in the event of difficulties arising post-Brexit.  It is imperative that the Government lobby the European Commission to allow the State to invest in workers and business and support them during the British withdrawal from the European Union and through the shock of any changes to our trading relationship after this withdrawal.  As with the fiscal rules, exceptions are permitted in some circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The EU treaty governing state aid leaves room for a number of policy objectives for which state aid can be considered compatible.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that Ireland should be exempted from state aid rules for the spending and investment that is required to offset the damage of Brexit.  Ireland should apply for and be granted dispensation to make direct investment and spending in ways that, under normal circumstances, would constitute state aid to combat the impact of Brexit into the future.  An exemption exists under Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which states that it \"may be considered to be compatible with the internal market\" to provide \"aid to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State\".  In any event, the Covid-19 crisis has now set a precedent that should be used to secure such a derogation in order that we can invest in jobs and businesses.  It should be stated that such investment should go further and allow us not only to offset the damage of Brexit but also focus on allowing our SMEs and micro-businesses to capture the market share of any available opportunities that may arise.  This will require the EU to engage with Ireland in a different manner from other EU countries.  It is imperative that the EU formulate a tailored plan outlining how it will help Ireland to overcome the negative economic shock following a new trade deal between the EU and Britain.  It is especially necessary that infrastructural investment is forthcoming to help Ireland to position itself to capture the market share of available manufacturing and services jobs and investment in a post-Brexit European Union.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that trade gaps will arise in the European market as a result of Britain&rsquo;s exit from the EU.  The Government should be working with SMEs and other businesses to help them expand to fill these trade gaps.  <\/p>  <p>  There also needs to be some fundamental changes around examinership and the costs for SMEs and micro-businesses.  Businesses will often say that the simple things are the one that make the greatest difference.  One change the Department should be examining immediately is the fast-tracking to January 2021 the use of examinership-lite, as it is known, for small and medium enterprises and micro-businesses.  Covid-19 has shone a light on the need for this fast-tracking and with Brexit ahead, it is even more necessary.  Many businesses with viable and functioning business models may not be able to trade their way into recovery despite the supports and measures put in place to date and those that have been proposed.  For those businesses, a fast-track, low-cost examinership model should be made available, that is, one that limits the exposure of the business and protects the rights of workers.  For many small businesses, the cost of examinership is a barrier to using the examinership tool to save their business.  The solution, therefore, may potentially lie in fast-tracking examinership-lite.  I would appreciate if the T&aacute;naiste investigated this proposal because it is worthy of debate.<\/p>  <p>  Has the T&aacute;naiste given any consideration to the establishment of an IDA-type body to specifically focus on micro-business, workers co-operatives and small and medium enterprises to help them find domestic and external investors?  As we move through the Covid-19 crisis and with Brexit on the horizon, such a move would be worthy of consideration.<\/p>  <p>  The response to Brexit must not be low pay and precarious work or the exploitation of workers.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the central plank in dealing with Brexit must be a real commitment to our micro-businesses, SME sector and family businesses, as well as a steadfast commitment to workers&rsquo; rights embedded in legislation and the creation of decent jobs with decent pay and conditions.  The State can and must protect workers and support businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700045#YY00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1602086400,"counter":302,"content":"<p>It is very apparent that several major obstacles remain as the EU negotiating team attempts to bring the British to an agreement on Brexit.  It appears that Tory attitudes and outlooks have retreated into an echo chamber where Boris Johnson and his cronies feast on their own toxicity.  While I understand that many of the EU negotiators have been shocked by the perfidious actions of the British, no depth of British mendacity comes as a surprise to us here in Ireland.  It is apparent to all that the British position is designed to discard two generations of social progress and protections brought about through EU membership.  Through the potential deregulation of the economy and the creation of their set of rules around competitive advantage, the British can position themselves to reap unfair business and trading advantages over EU member states through unfettered and unencumbered access to EU markets without cost or responsibility.<\/p> <p>Indeed, the term \"level playing field\" is enough to invoke a Tory to make a sign to ward off an evil eye, such is the anathema among Johnson's Tories for values, fair play and decency.<\/p> <p> We are now looking at a scenario where the Tories are looking to introduce the equivalent of a windrush 2.0 scheme designed to target EU and EEA citizens.  Under this EU settlement status scheme, EU citizens will have to pay a fee of &pound;65 and register an application to stay in Britain with authorities before 30 June 2021.  Under this scheme, by the end of August this year, just under 11,000 EU citizens were refused the right to stay in Britain.  This shameful Tory attitude to EU citizens has both business and human rights implications.  Many EU citizens who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic are being refused universal credit.  A Danish woman with breast cancer was challenged to prove that she had the right to be treated by the NHS.  The list goes on.  <\/p> <p> This has the potential to seriously impact cross-Border workers and businesses here in Ireland.  Businesses on both sides of the Border are often reliant on the expertise of citizens from other EU states and beyond.  That includes everything from IT specialists, diesel mechanics to general operatives.  We are conceivably looking at a situation where swathes of cross-Border workers may well be deported by the Tories leading to serious difficulties for businesses along the Border.<\/p> <p> At this moment, Covid-19 infection rates in the North are several times greater than here in the South.  A total of 828 cases were confirmed in the North today.  That has directly led to Donegal having the highest level of infection here in the South.  To arrest the rate of infection, political leaders in the North want to introduce what has been termed a circuit breaker, a temporary lockdown, but unfortunately they are powerless to do so.  The Assembly in the North is left dependent on a heartless Tory Government for the funding necessary to save Irish lives.<\/p> <p> This is a snapshot of the problems that lie ahead for both the North and for businesses and politicians in the South.  Under the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill, the Tories will have the right to impose legislation to destroy workers' rights to allow access to Irish markets of inferior food produce, whatever the protestations of local politicians.  We must remember that only yesterday the Central Bank warned that a no-deal Brexit could result in the loss of 75% of food trade with Britain.<\/p> <p> We are heading towards what is becoming the warmest year on record, yet the Tories have signalled an attempt to disavow environmental legislation at a time when our discourse on the issue is centred on how we may reconfigure our economy to become more environmentally friendly.  This afternoon, the Taoiseach described the environment as an essential pillar of our economic recovery.  Our inability to develop an all-island approach undermines all plans in this area.<\/p> <p> Ireland now has what can be described as a two-speed economy, which the Central Bank argues will recover at an uneven rate and remain vulnerable to the impact of a no-deal Brexit, which could potentially lead to the loss of more than 100,000 jobs.  Our continued capacity to withstand the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the nation's economy is primarily due to the strength of our exports.  With the domestic service economy under increasing pressure, with unprecedented job losses and unemployment now in the region of 15%, we are now even more dependent on exports.  Conversely, it is the export sector which is at most risk from Brexit.<\/p> <p> The Government needs to ensure the impending budget, which has been bolstered by better tax revenues than was initially anticipated, provides adequate supports for Irish business on several levels: first, to survive the onslaught of the pandemic; and, second, to provide businesses with supports to survive a no-deal Brexit.  We need business stimulus measures.  We need to see the export sector protected by Government action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700045#YY00300","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602087000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>There are two speakers listed, Deputies Matt Carthy and Rose Conway-Walsh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700046#ZZ00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1602087000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy Carthy's time if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700046#ZZ00300","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1602087000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Ceart go leor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700046#ZZ00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1602087000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>In February 2018, the Government published a report that it had commissioned on the impact of Brexit on the Irish economy.  The report deals with four possible scenarios, the most severe being a hard Brexit, which is a real possibility now.  It confirmed at the time what we already knew, namely, that there will be no good Brexit for Ireland, with a crash-out Brexit being all too real a possibility.  I read the report again and it highlights how rural Ireland would be particularly hit.  It predicted a loss of 30,000 jobs in the food sector in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Agriculture, fishing and food processing would be among the sectors hardest hit.  That would decimate rural Ireland.  These were the warnings the Government received two years ago.  Two years ago we knew rural Ireland would bear the brunt if there was a crash-out Brexit.  That was long before we ever heard of Covid-19.  In my constituency of Mayo there are twice as many working in agriculture and fisheries than the average in the State.  Ninety per cent of our beef is exported.  Of that, 50% goes to the UK, constituting a value of &euro;1.2 billion.<\/p>  <p>  A no-deal Brexit means tariffs.  A World Trade Organization, TWO, tariff would add more than &euro;3 to a kilo of beef and increase the price by more than 60%.  That would make it absolutely uncompetitive versus the South American imports that would be coming in to Britain.  The UK has the highest price in the EU while British consumers consider Irish beef as local.  That is important.  Ireland is the only imported beef supplier to the three largest UK supermarkets, namely, Tesco, Asda and Sainsburys, as well as to McDonalds and Burger King.<\/p>  <p>  Fishermen understand that their sector has become one of the key stumbling blocks in the negotiations but also that they catch one third of their landings in the waters that are controlled by Britain.  I am aware that is one of the key sticking points, as well as the State aid issue.  Thirty-four per cent of Irish landings are taken from UK waters.  That means 30% of Irish fishing is dependent on access to UK waters, with the top two catches being mackerel at 60% and prawns at 40%.  The UK vessel land is 20,000 tonnes in Irish ports each year.  The Irish vessel land is 12,000 tonnes in UK ports.<\/p>  <p>  Another stark warning came last September from the Central Bank which said that 70% of all farmers were economically vulnerable.  Beef and sheep farmers are facing an existential crisis.  The west, the mid-west and the midlands, the regions most reliant on cattle and sheep production, will be hit the hardest if Britain crashes out of the EU.  They do not blame the Government for Brexit but there is a real anger that successive Governments have failed to take on the meat factories that have driven prices far below the cost of production.  The budget needs to send a strong message that rural Ireland will be protected.<\/p>  <p>  This is the time for Ireland to stand firm.  The EU Brexit fund must be front-loaded by financial supports for agriculture and the fishing sectors.  I was glad to hear the T&aacute;naiste say that but it is very important that fund is targeted towards the regions and rural Ireland, and the west of Ireland in particular.  I am aware there are ongoing discussions with the sectors but those discussions need to intensify.  That funding needs to be targeted in a way that it will mean something real.<\/p> <p>Failure to do so would be intolerable and would certainly mean the destruction of fishing and farming.<\/p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste correctly stated much business is being done online.  It is likely that at least 100 extra pieces of paper will be required per export transaction.  It is vital that we have broadband to deal with this.  I am hearing reports all the time that it will take three to five years for many rural areas to have adequate broadband speeds.  I am aware of this because of my higher education portfolio.  Many students are contacting me to state they are being asked to do lectures online but cannot do so because they do not have broadband.  It is important, therefore, that we do not consider the impact of Brexit in isolation; our consideration must be intertwined with our approach to the broadband plan.  It would be really useful to have a very specific update on the broadband plan and its direction for the next three months.<\/p> <p> Another way to combat the negative impact of Brexit is with infrastructure.  We should invest in it now so it may carry us through to the future.  Knock Airport is crucial to the development of the west, as is the western rail corridor.  I was alarmed to see that the business section of the Mayo campus of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology is closed at this time.  I cannot understand that.  When education and the connection between education, industry and the development of the west in terms of sustainable energy projects are so important, why would we seek to close down the business section of the campus?  This is not unrelated to Brexit.  We have to invest in infrastructure and learning facilities in the regions if we are to stand any chance of fighting the negative impact of Brexit and Covid.<\/p> <p> I ask the T&aacute;naiste to consider all these points and work with the Opposition, particularly on the development of the western economic corridor in order we can have sustainable development and targeted investment, making use of EU Structural Fund and the Brexit fund so we will have long-lasting, long-term projects that will see us through to the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700046#ZZ00500","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602087600,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and thank him for his speech.  The Labour Party has always been pro-business and pro-Europe on the basis of what business and Europe can do for ordinary people, including workers.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste shares my party's concern over potential export losses to the tune of &euro;18 billion in respect of the UK land bridge.  Eighteen billion euro is 40% of our entire export revenue.  About 150,000 trucks are involved.  The T&aacute;naiste and many others who watch these matters carefully will know that the publication of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill caused absolute shock and dismay right across Europe.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste said that, today or tomorrow, he will be communicating directly with 250,000 businesses across the country.  That is a good initiative but a large number of businesses are so caught up in firefighting in respect of Covid that Brexit is far down the priority list.  I welcome the fact that the T&aacute;naiste is perhaps reminding them of what is potentially coming down the tracks.  We do not know what is going on and what political machinations are taking place in Downing Street, nor do we know the mentality of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  His actions heretofore have made me and my party believe we are not dealing with a stable government or ordinary politics and that we are potentially dealing with somebody who is pursuing a no-deal Brexit strategy for his own ends.  That means our relationship with the United Kingdom has been at its lowest ebb for quite some time.<\/p>  <p>  Although my constituency is urban, it has Howth Harbour and constituents who depend on fisheries.  Obviously, the agri-food sector is important in many regions.  I believe 20% of jobs in counties such as Cavan, Monaghan, Wicklow and Wexford are dependent on the agri-food sector, yet firefighting because of Covid has taken up most people's time.<\/p>  <p>  I suggest to the T&aacute;naiste that there are other factors that cannot be put to the bottom of the agenda.  I mentioned to the Taoiseach today that we must build a society and economy that are robust enough to withstand the shock of Brexit but we must also ensure we do not put things on the long finger on the basis that it is convenient to do so.  The T&aacute;naiste got major publicity for himself on Monday evening by telling NPHET it had not thought things through and by not taking its advice to move from level 2 to level 5, or level 3 to level 5, yet when the Low Pay Commission advocated a 10 cent rise to the minimum wage that was not accepted by those who think these things through, he accepted it.  The trade union movement walked away from the deal on the basis that it would not be fair to workers.  The T&aacute;naiste might say to me that an increase represents an unfair burden on businesses but we have operated heretofore in a low-pay, low-wage economy.  As I say constantly, 23% of workers are on low pay and 40% of workers under 30 are in insecure work.  That is the economic model that this country was showing to the world.  It has not been and is not sustainable.  When the pandemic hit, the impact was felt mainly by the poorly paid.  When dealing with Brexit and building a business model, we must ensure we can protect businesses but we must do so in a way that protects the people who work for them.  Sick pay, employment security and pay are important in this regard.<\/p>  <p>   Having said all that, I believe it is easy for people who share the Minister's political ideology to state members of my political party are not serious about business and its cost.  However, I have spoken to people in Dublin Chamber and other chambers around the country who are aghast that various political parties, including some purporting to be of the centre-right, have consistently cut the local property tax, thereby making councils depend disproportionately on commercial rates.  I realise the situation is different now because of the Government's actions but the model the T&aacute;naiste's local representatives are pursuing means councils cannot fund themselves or promote business and enterprise strategies to the best of their ability.  Dublin City Council is &euro;12 million down.  Some of the resources could be allocated for community infrastructure, community building, addressing issues within communities and anti-poverty strategies but they could also be allocated for enterprise and development strategies at local level.  Despite this, it was councillors in the T&aacute;naiste's party, and Fianna F&aacute;il in opposition, who consistently curtailed the potential of councils at local level to address these issues.  It genuinely makes no sense to my party.  If one is trying to provide supports for businesses and enhance the capacity of SMEs to survive the pandemic, one must realise businesses look not only for State supports but also for local authority supports.  A local authority has to be fully funded and have the capacity to deliver such supports.  One cannot say, on one hand, that the Opposition is not serious about its fiscal response, its demands regarding business and its talk of sick pay and tackling low-paid work while, on the other hand, not fund the local authorities, which are in many instances where SMEs and those in the local enterprise community go to look for support.<\/p> <p>If it was not for the pandemic, our minds and energies would be completely focused on the issue of Brexit.  I am satisfied that we have the support of partners around the European table.  It is of comfort to me that many of us in the Oireachtas have supported the European project over many generations on the basis that when it came to an issue such as this, we could seek solidarity from other member states and ensure that we have their backing.  <\/p> <p> I would like to summarise some of the points I have made.  The enormity of what we are facing has to filter down to people - &euro;18 billion worth of exports, 40% of our entire export capacity and 150,000 trucks that use the UK land bridge.  That is colossal.  If we are facing a no-deal scenario, that is potentially ruinous.  There is also an issue, as I mentioned, in regard to the agrifood sector and the number of jobs dependent on it.  I have not touched on the security or identity elements, on which I know the T&aacute;naiste shares my concerns.  <\/p> <p> His communication with businesses around the country and his contribution earlier are to be welcomed.  It is clear to the Labour Party, in particular to me as a local Deputy, that businesses are not equipped mentally or in any way for Brexit.  I do not attach any blame to them in that regard because I am aware of their daily struggles in regard to whether the levels are going up and down and their capacity to trade.  I reinforce the point that we cannot return to the model we had previously.  Notwithstanding the pandemic and Brexit, a low pay, low tax model is not a model we can return to.  The T&aacute;naiste's personal insistence on budgetary matters to keep income tax regardless of what one earns, or USC, regardless of what one earns, on people at the higher end to cushion them from any sort of impact from budgetary changes is indefensible.  Fine Gael party representatives on local authorities stripping away of moneys that could be used to invest in communities and to support business is also indefensible.  That said, the Labour Party will stand by the T&aacute;naiste and Government when it comes to having a united Oireachtas viewpoint and stance facing down a no-deal Brexit, which, unfortunately, it appears is the determination of the British Prime Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700047#AAA00200","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602088200,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute.  With all that is happening in the State and globally in terms of the pandemic, Ireland also has the threat of Brexit hanging over it.  The Government and previous Governments have been working hard to mitigate the harsh realities of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Coming from a rural constituency that has a flourishing agriculture industry, I am all too aware of the challenges facing that industry as we face into the Brexit negotiations.  I have seen much of the commentary in regard to the land bridge and our access to markets.  In the years since we joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was at the time, agriculture has developed enormously and an awful lot of people are engaged in farming.  The farmers of this country have worked might and main to produce a product that is internationally renowned and has been so for generations.  This is due in no small way to the first line of defence, namely, the farmer.  We should always recognise that when speaking about the agriculture industry.  We should always recognise the work that is being done on family farms.  <\/p>  <p>  I fear the biggest challenge in the Brexit negotiations is in respect of small to medium-sized farms that are the backbone of rural communities and many of our small provincial towns.  One hears all of the time when farmers have a good or a bad year weatherwise or in terms of prices that the farmers are doing okay and that they invariably spend all of their money from an agriculture viewpoint, be that in respect of contractors, diesel, raw material, inputs, merchandise and so forth in their local communities.  We should applaud them for what they have done.  As we face into Brexit, I ask the T&aacute;naiste and the Government to ensure they are to the fore of their thoughts.  The industry is worth in excess of &euro;10 billion in exports.  We want to ensure that the industry continues to thrive for no better reason that we have an excellent product that has been tested internationally in terms of its traceability and production and it benefits people's general health as well as everything else.  There are many issues arising in health but our agriculture industry is producing a product of which we can be justifiably proud.  In terms of what is happening in Britain and the commentary emanating from it, the agricultural community is worried for the future of the industry.  We also have concerns in regard to the dairy industry and the beef industry.  The beef industry, as with the dairy industry, has faced many challenges over the past number of years.  We want to ensure that they can remain viable.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the commentary that has been emanating from the UK over the past number of months, anybody who has studied Irish history will be well aware of the scant regard of many well-heeled Tories for Ireland, our institutions and our people.  The ignorance of some people when speaking about Irish history or the island of Ireland reiterates to each and every one of us that a small minority of people in Britain are making huge decisions about the future relations of Ireland with the EU and everybody else and that they have no understanding of the Republic, or Northern Ireland.  These people have made particular comments, in particular in the fall of last year, which left people aghast..  Any student of Irish history would be well aware that this is nothing new, that it has been happening down through the decades.  The British have been allowed to pursue these policies to the detriment of the Irish people, North and South.  We need to take a firm stance because we need to protect our island and our people in so far as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  Other issues are emerging.  The EU must be mindful of the number of businesses trading throughout the Union.  Over decades, we have built up massive exports across the spectrum.  In my own area of Duhallow there is a massive agricultural industry but there are other great industries also, such as Munster Joinery and APS Cork that export and small companies like Avonmore Electrical, which exports wind to the Scottish highlands.  These are small to medium-sized industries that will be badly affected by Brexit.  These companies are at the high end of their product.  They provide fantastic employment and high-end jobs and a fantastic service.  We want to keep them in our rural communities.  We want to benefit our rural communities but we need to recognise the challenges to the businesses, large or small, that would be affected by a no-deal Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Is it so terrible to hope for successful negotiations?  It is as simple as that.  We are hoping for successful negotiations.  Over the past week or so we learned of the passage of legislation in the House of Commons which disregards international trade and willy-nilly threw it to one side.  This would not have been heard of or dreamed of in any State over the past number of years, but the UK did it.  It is hell-bent on leaving the EU.<\/p> <p>We must ensure that the Union is on our side at all times.  There were times in the past when we had bought well into the European Union and it can be questioned, in our core, whether it was on our side in times of difficulty.  We must challenge it at every stage.  The information on negotiations and the talk from the European Union give the impression that the Irish Government and the Union are at one in trying to ensure we get the best possible deal.  We need that more than ever.<\/p> <p> We also must seek to challenge the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiations which have started or are being discussed.  We must ensure we get the best possible deal from that.  We have seen the cuts in the budgets of the European Union, and we cannot afford that.  We want to get the most money possible under the CAP.<\/p> <p> What is the current position?  International commentators have spoken about the challenges for the EU and Britain in successfully concluding a deal.  They have also looked at Ireland and its vibrant, open economy with massive exports.  We will be affected by the nonsense and, I must say, the absolute madness of the Brexiteers.  I cannot find any other way in the English language to describe it.  I could find other languages, but that might not be allowed in the House.  The absolute madness of the Brexiteers is that they have tunnel vision.  In my opinion, they believe that if they get rid of the EU they can go back to imperialism and the powers Britain had 200 or 300 years ago.  That is not going to happen in the world as it is now.<\/p> <p> This country must face the reality of its current position.  We must examine the challenges that are going to affect all of society.  Whether it is the large urban centres or very rural places, everybody will be affected by Brexit.  We must have a copper-fastened deal with the European Union.  We must hold the EU to account to ensure it is in our corner at all times.  Negotiations have shown over the last while that it is in our corner.  We are entering the last crucial stages.  Who would have thought this time 12 months ago that we would be in this position, heading into the second week of October, where there is no deal or proper structure in place for how Britain is going to exit the EU and for what the relationship will be after 31 December?<\/p> <p> We face challenges.  The Houses of the Oireachtas are willing to stand by the Government as it goes into very detailed negotiations.  We wish it well in ensuring that it brings the best possible deal for all citizens, not just those of the Republic of Ireland but all the citizens of the island, as we face a new and different Europe after Britain leaves the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700048#BBB00200","speaker":"1456","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602088800,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for facilitating the debate and for his hard work over the past number of months, along with the Ministers of State, Deputies English and Troy, as we enter the final months of the transition period.  I was impressed with the level of detail in the content of the Brexit readiness action plan published last month.  It was clear from the document that the remaining preparations have taken account of the added pressure related to Covid-19 being experienced by business owners.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the clarity that the Government will focus its remaining efforts on three specific work streams, one of which is communicating with and supporting sectors and businesses most directly impacted.  Much of the communication efforts on the ground are no longer possible due to the pandemic and it is important that additional effort is put into Brexit-related communications as we approach the end of the transition period, including the post-transition period.  I commend the work of the local enterprise offices in assisting businesses that have reached out to them, and on their range of supports and training on offer to businesses.  However, I am still concerned that some smaller business owners are unprepared for what will happen early next year and about their contingencies if they experience potential disruptions to sourcing raw materials for their businesses.<\/p>  <p>  There are some very practical tools such as Enterprise Ireland's currency impact calculator, which will greatly aid businesses in determining their exposure to foreign exchange risks.  We need more of these practical tools.  The use of webinars and customer training programmes must continue to be resourced after the transition.<\/p>  <p>  While Mayo is not a Border county, it is approximately a 90-minute drive from Charlestown to Enniskillen.  The agricultural and tourism sectors play an important role in local communities in Mayo.  One example which binds our communities is the Mayo Peace Park in Castlebar, which I invite the T&aacute;naiste to visit if he has not already done so.  During normal public health circumstances, one would regularly see tourists visiting from Northern Ireland and the UK to search the monument for the names of their Irish ancestors.  The protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland, in addition to reaffirming the common travel area, has resulted in a greater degree of certainty for Mayo businesses.  Even on a personal level, some people commute weekly from Ireland West Airport Knock to London or other UK cities for work in financial services or construction.<\/p>  <p>  The emerging fear in recent weeks is about what happens if there is a significant difference in public health guidelines in the UK.  I fear that public health guidelines may end up circumscribing the progress that has been made in North-South and east-west relations.  I have spoken in the Chamber previously about European plans to promote a common approach to travel restrictions and movement within the EU.  It is important that there is some alignment between public health guidelines and common approaches to travel, which also must be considered with our closest neighbour.<\/p>  <p>  Communication from the Government and business support agencies will continue to be a key factor in how Irish businesses respond post the transition.

Now they face the double whammy of a novel virus, about which little is known, and a British Government that is novel about Brexit in ways that some never imagined.  However, what is imaginable and reachable now is a united Ireland in the broader context of Brexit.  My party leader, Deputy McDonald, is quite right when she says that a united Ireland is everybody's business now, not only North and South, but also east and west and in my constituency of Kildare North.  This is something my party will be bringing to all the people in the time to come, and doing so serenely and with pride.  It is unfortunate for Irish politics that while the Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach excoriates his fellow citizen and Sinn F&eacute;in leader, Deputy McDonald, he simpers over the Tory Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and the three ring Brexit circus he is running.  Fine Gael has \"the United Ireland Party\" in its subtitle.  I hope Fine Gael will put more thought into effecting that united Ireland than it did into commemorating the Black and Tans, as if any Irish person could forget them.  That might bring us further along in our joint endeavour.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency, there is concern among local businesses and those working in the equine industry about what Brexit will mean for them.  I applaud them for the way they have risen to the regulatory and bureaucratic challenges, not to mention their nerves of steel in the face of the political shenanigans across the water.  Businesses in north Kildare, particularly in the non-food retail sector, still feel bruised as the county is now into its fourth extension of restrictions.<\/p> <p>We must discuss business and Brexit in the context of the virus.  Self-employed people in my constituency, too, are suffering the effect of Covid poverty.  The Taoiseach might think the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, is not tenable but neither is poverty, as the T&aacute;naiste noted on Monday evening.  I am currently working on the case of a taxi man, an essential worker and fine gentleman who has worked hard all his life.  After being struck by Covid and being on a ventilator for 12 days, he is now being denied the PUP.  This has left him and his family stricken.  There is Covid poverty in my constituency and throughout the county.  We turn a blind eye to banks that broke a country and almost collapsed a currency yet we put hard working men and women under the microscope for a relative pittance by comparison.<\/p> <p> We cannot face the economic shock of Brexit unless we take a big picture approach.  The many self-employed and small businesses facing into Brexit need a citizenry with money in their pockets.  That is why we must face Brexit with policies that protect our workers and look after small businesses, many of which are family businesses.  We must face it with policies that make the economy work around society and not vice versa as we have seen.  Covid-19 has laid bare all the fault lines in society.  It has shown us that the shallow politics of PR has nothing to offer us in times of crisis.  Unless we have the kind of Government and policy that put people and their life stories first, not elite profit, those fault lines will deepen and broaden under Brexit.  <\/p> <p> We are facing a winter like no other.  The Chief Medical Officer has said tonight that the Covid situation is rapidly deteriorating and that NPHET is seriously concerned.  I want to assure businesses and workers across North Kildare that Sinn F&eacute;in is and will be on their side.  We will be calling for every possible support from the Government for them.  Our alternative budget will outline this in detail.  I refer especially to our small businesses which are already hanging by a thread and suffering acutely from the Government's lack of competence, courage and clarity in its handling of the virus.  These are difficult times but they are also opportune times to imagine a better, deeper and kinder way of doing business as a society and as a State.  Brexit and Covid need to be tackled on an all-Ireland and a united island basis.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700049#CCC00300","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602089400,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I back the comments on low pay by a previous Deputy.  The best way to ensure economic recovery is to get money circulating in the economy by tackling low pay.  When people on low pay get a pay increase it goes straight back into the local economy.  It is circular.  We can see from the data at the moment that people on higher incomes have a higher level of savings.  Part of that is because there is less opportunity to spend with the current Covid restrictions.  There is nothing more circular than tackling low pay and having that money go straight back into services and jobs.<\/p>  <p>   On the very real threat of a Brexit with no trade deal, all of us in this House hope a deal is done as it is massively in the interests of Ireland, the UK and the European Union.  Brexit with no trade deal is a threat to business, jobs, workers' rights, tackling low pay and tackling climate change.  The biggest threat to the Irish economy in that scenario is the WTO tariffs.  We could be looking at &euro;1.5 billion being imposed in tariffs, which would have a devastating effect on the exporters of Irish goods into the UK.  Some 43% of all our food exports, as the T&aacute;naiste will know, go into the UK.  In the event of those tariffs being applied, projections are that Irish food exports could drop by about a third, according to the London School of Economics.  The Halle Economic Research Institute in Germany has projected 700,000 jobs potentially being lost across the European Union in the event of a Brexit with no trade deal, and some 35,000 of those jobs would be lost in Ireland, which is almost 2% of our workforce.  This is very serious indeed.  It means that Ireland is more exposed than almost any other EU state.  The agri-food sector and dairy, in particular, would be especially affected.  There is a double danger that if we had the WTO tariffs in place, we could see the UK Government deciding to devalue Sterling which would somewhat cushion them in terms of the cost of tariffs on their exports.  It would be to their advantage but would have a double effect on us and our competitiveness.  <\/p>  <p>  I refer to the 150,000 Irish trucks that use the UK land bridge every year to export 3 million tonnes of goods to continental Europe.  About 40% of Irish exports, in both value and volume terms, or &euro;18 billion in exports, use the land bridge, which is essential for delivery of just-in-time goods to continental Europe.  As it currently works, the land bridge can mean transport times of about 20 hours compared to 40 hours for goods moving by direct ferry to continental Europe.  The UK Government is predicting potential two-day delays of trucks from 1 January, as the T&aacute;naiste is aware, with queues of up to 7,000 trucks.  Flow rates across the Dover-Calais strait will be heavily disrupted.  At its worst, this disruption will last for the first three months initially.  It is imperative that every effort is made to improve our connectivity to mainland Europe in terms of direct and fast ferry routes.  It would be a mistake for us to be entirely reliant on the land bridge.  Indeed, given the current breaches by the UK Government of the withdrawal agreement and international law, it would be a grave mistake for us to be entirely reliant on the commitments that have been given under the common transit convention.  I welcome reports of a six-day ferry service being put in place.  A frequent and fast service is required.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade told us last night that the Government had considered subsidies and had decided for the time being not to go forward with them.  That needs to be looked at again.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was saying that currently there is a lot of capacity on the ferry routes to mainland Europe but we can expect that to change quite quickly.  We are now just 12 weeks away from 1 January.  The time on this is running out and it is essential that the Government takes a very hands-on approach.  It is concerning that there are reports that Dublin Port is not yet ready for Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Businesses in Ireland may face an extra disadvantage in exporting into the UK market in respect of state aid.  If a deal is not done, UK companies will potentially benefit from state aid.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  If we had been talking about this a few years ago there would have been no prospect of a Tory Government pushing so heavily on state aid.  In the last Parliament, it was the Corbyn leadership that was pushing for state aid, not the Tories, so it is quite a turn of events.  It also makes no sense in terms of the EU state aid rules, which are there to ensure that investment is based on the principle of preventing a race to the bottom in terms of different cities and regions competing for subsidies and so forth.  The state aid rules are also about transparency and avoiding cronyism.<\/p>  <p>  Irish businesses and exporters could be also undercut in respect of consumer standards.  The National Farmers' Union in the UK has called on the UK Government to bring in legislation to ban chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef from supermarket shelves.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>No such legislation is in place at the moment.  We run the risk that come 1 January, we could not only be competing on tariffs and, potentially on state aid, we could also be competing in terms of consumer standards for exporters into the UK.<\/p> <p> As for workers' rights and climate change, Irish businesses again could be undercut when seeking to maintain our business and exports into the UK.  There have been several reports of sweatshop conditions in manufacturing in the UK at present and of workers being paid as little as &pound;3.50 per hour and of completely lax enforcement of employment laws and minimum wage payment.  The essence of the Brexiteers' project from the outset was really to attempt to gain access to European markets but to undercut in respect of workers' rights, environmental protections, consumer protections and standards.<\/p> <p> The &euro;5 billion in the EU emergency fund for Brexit is significant.  In a worst-case scenario, however, with those potential multiple hits against Irish businesses and jobs and given that we will only get a portion of that &euro;5 billion, there is a possibility that we will need additional support from the European Union.  In the wrap-up on this, I ask the T&aacute;naiste to address the event of a worst-case scenario with all these factors carrying in and our share of the support from the European Union not being sufficient.  Will the Government push for more and has there been discussion on that scenario so far?<\/p> <p> To conclude, we are talking about the survival of sections of our economy, which will be severely put to the test in the case of an no-trade-deal Brexit.  I very much hope it does not come to that.  The Government must do everything it can to actively support Irish businesses, exporters, the agri-food sector and dairy in particular, as well as the protection of Irish jobs.  We need a hands-on approach in this regard, especially by directly intervening to ensure direct and fast ferry services to continental Europe.  The Government should do everything it can to ensure additional capacity is put in place.<\/p> <p> We must ensure any action by the Government or the European Union will support both the immediate hits caused by Brexit and a no-trade deal Brexit, if that happens, but also will have an eye on long-term sustainability in terms of both jobs and in tackling climate change and workers' rights.  In the future, we need to make sure we maintain high standards in those areas as well as meeting these significant challenges we face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700050#DDD00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602090000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I have spoken many times in this House about the need for Ireland's Brexit strategy approach to not merely focus on maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>relationship between Ireland and the UK.

There is a need for a two-pronged approach to the situation, that is, the need to get clarity on international travel on and off this island and the need to put a stimulus package in place to sustain the aviation industry over time.  We must recognise that the Covid-19 virus will be with us for the long term and we need to plan accordingly.<\/p><p>In terms of Cork Airport, passenger numbers fell by over 95% during lockdown when compared with the same period last year.  Air traffic is not expected to recover to 2019 levels until 2024 and the impact of Covid-19 on Cork Airport is expected to cause the loss of more than 2 million passengers this year and more than &euro;23 million in lost revenue by the year end.<\/p><p>Cork Airport is Ireland's second largest international airport with 2.4 million passengers in 2018.  The airport offers more than 50 routes to destinations across the UK and Europe.  Such a loss will result in both a huge loss to jobs in my region and a huge loss to connectivity in Cork East and the south of this country more generally.  We need this connectivity for the Cork region to economically thrive in a post-Brexit world.  We should also look at improving the runway at Cork Airport during the upcoming review of the national development plan to help expand current routes and protect the future of our country's second airport.<\/p><p>Easing travel restrictions will not immediately repair the aviation sector and other European governments have already moved to provide substantial financial assistance.  A stimulus package should be put in place for Cork Airport to encourage the rebuilding of traffic.  I will quote the final report on the task force for aviation recovery from July 2020.  It states, &quot;As part of this package, the State should directly provide the airports with a common fixed sum per passenger which will be used by the airports to stimulate traffic by reducing airport charges for airlines and restoring and growing passenger numbers.&quot;  This scheme would represent state aid and should be notified to the European Commission for approval in accordance with state aid rules.  It should apply for the duration of the aviation sector's recovery from this virus.  <\/p><p>We must adapt and champion the green list at a European level.  Ireland has continued to deviate from the approach of our European partners, ignoring the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, guidelines and adopting a failed quarantine strategy.  Green and amber countries should have no restrictions in terms of moving through the European Union, meaning free movement within these countries if a legitimate negative test can be obtained.  We need to bring in a better testing regime, which other countries have in place, for countries deemed to be in the red zone.  Quarantine is a blunt instrument.  The DAA has investigated the ability to facilitate pre-departure rapid testing at Cork and Dublin airports.  They could conduct up 15,000 tests a day, which is absolutely staggering.  We need to look at investing in and investigating better testing such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP, testing.  The market is constantly getting better at being able to adapt to the airport environment during Covid-19.<\/p><p>Ireland should be at the forefront of ensuring such investments are made and we need to ensure a return to international travel in this country.  If we want to Brexit-proof our economy, it is more than necessary.  It is dangerous to think the routes that have been removed from our airports will re-emerge overnight.  Therefore, we need to add act now.  The restoration of routes requires a huge effort and it could be 2024 before we see a recovery within this sector.  It is a recovery that Ireland can and should champion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700051#EEE00200","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1602090000,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I wish to express my concerns that when all the talk is about Covid-19, we seem to have forgotten the other major disruption facing our lives, that is, Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit will impact all of us from every sector of society.  Last week, I met local farmers in County Carlow and we talked not about Covid-19 but about Brexit.  The Irish farming and food sector has a higher dependence on the UK market when compared with other sectors in Ireland and is, therefore, the most exposed sector to any negative economic impact of the UK Brexit decision.<\/p>  <p>  Farmers have done much for this country since the first settlers farmed our lands years ago.  We cannot forget them.  Farmers need a dedicated examination of Brexit risks.  At present, beef farmers are living without any certainty on beef prices or markets.  There have been massive losses in our economy because of Covid-19 and now we are looking at the potential of &euro;740 million in tariffs being imposed.  Yet, the meat industry, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Bord Bia and Teagasc have not been clear on what is happening.  We cannot allow all our focus to be on Covid-19.  It is a pandemic and we must deal with that but we must be able to multitask and prepare for 2021 to be another intense year with Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Beef farmers need a coherent plan to develop suckler beef as a premium product, a guarantee for funding for developing a suckler brand and assistance for start-up farmer producers who wish to sell their beef directly to the market.  Preparations are already under way for next year's lambing season and there has been no word on whether the sheep welfare scheme will be rolled over into next year.  Sheep farmers need this scheme to roll over into 2021 and for all avenues of providing additional financial support to sheep farmers to be explored.<\/p>  <p>  We must do all we can for dairy farmers to retain the tariff-free access to the UK market, particularly for Irish cheddar exports.  Any loss or reduction of access to the UK market could have a destabilising impact the overall value of the Irish dairy sector.  It is vital we do not leave anyone behind.<\/p> <p>We cannot forget the close relationship tillage farmers have to the Northern Irish market, nor can we lock away our mushroom farmers, for whom the UK represents 90% of the value of exports.  I insist that we do all we can to protect all our farmers, our farm families and our future.<\/p> <p> Naturally Brexit impacts all sectors of society.  The devastation Covid-19 has brought to our doors could very well be compounded by a no-deal Brexit.  Ireland's economy and society will be tested in the coming months in ways never experienced previously.  It is important, therefore, that we ensure emergency supports issued during this pandemic, which are very welcome to many sectors but which are due to expire in the first half of 2021, are followed by a new suite of policy measures to support economic recovery while we prepare for a no-deal Brexit.  A second shock on 1 January after all we have been through may be too much to bear if we do not prepare.  Let us use some of the lessons we have learned during the pandemic to our advantage in the event of no deal.<\/p> <p> As some sectors were very hard hit by Covid-19, some indigenous sectors boomed.  Our garden and hardware sector, our pharmaceutical industry and other multinationals all have potential to be key drivers of the economic resurgence and jobs throughout the country.  It is time for us to be bold and brave because as Joseph Campbell once said, \" Opportunities to find deeper powers within ourselves come when life seems most challenging.\" <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700051#EEE00300","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602090600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>In less than 90 days, the UK will be outside the EU Single Market and customs union.  While the work of Government and the Union to salvage a Brexit deal continues, the message for businesses here at home continues to be to get Covid ready.  Unfortunately for small and medium-sized businesses scattered throughout the country, Brexit and Covid are aligning as a perfect storm and bringing all the stresses and calamities associated with that.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this week I met some small business owners and tourism providers in west Clare.  They told me that the pillar banks still insist on negotiating interest rates and repayment terms of existing loans when cash-strapped business owners approach them for Government- and EU-backed capital.  This is fundamentally wrong and entirely contrary to the Government's July stimulus.  Small and microfinance loans provided by Government must always be considered to be in a separate purse from other loans that the banks generally provide.<\/p>  <p>  In Clare and the wider mid-west, our regional economy lives and dies by Shannon Airport.  I welcome the news that the Government plans to adopt EU-wide flight protocols next week, but this needs to be more than just giving a political thumbs-up to the protocols, it needs to be backed in meaningful ways at the point of departure and arrival.  I was concerned that at today's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks, the Minister for Transport suggested it may take some time to implement the traffic light system of enforcement measures.  We do not have time to dither on this.  The aviation sector, especially Shannon Airport in my county, is on its knees.  It is essential that we move with full expediency and urgency.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to road haulage.  As I drove to Dublin this morning, I noticed at Kill, County Kildare a tailback about 4 km or 5 km long on the opposite side of the motorway with all three lanes fully backlogged with traffic.  This tailback was as a result of a Garda Covid checkpoint.  Where these Covid checkpoints are set up, we need a fast-track facility for haulage trucks that are hard pressed on time to negotiate their way across Ireland to ferry ports and onwards to Britain and continental Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Murnane O'Connor mentioned farming.  Like many Members, I have been briefed and pressed by the IFA in my county in the past week.  This is the winter they fear most.  Yesterday I was out in my old clothes helping a friend with cattle testing of weanlings that will hopefully be sold at mart in Sixmilebridge next week.  Farmers such as him, who are so reliant on the beef sector, which is turbulent in the best of years, need next week's budget to be a good budget for farming so that they can approach the next few months of uncertainty buoyed up in the knowledge that the Government has their back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700052#FFF00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1602090600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>This has been a year of nothing but uncertainty.  Up to now all the talk has been about Brexit, but as we know the Covid-19 pandemic has spread around the world and has made the complex process of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU even worse and has wasted time that could have been devoted to more important matters.  Brexit has presented challenges that we could not imagine.  It has put the future and prosperity of many of our businesses in jeopardy.  It has caused uncertainty leaving businesses unable make plans or at least limited in their plans for the future.<\/p><p>I will take my county of Tipperary as an example.  For many communities in my constituency, agriculture is the lifeblood of the local  economy.  It provides jobs across the board in transport, machinery hire, food production and export.  The list goes on.  It is vital to the flow of money locally.  However, all that has been threatened with the uncertainty we now face.  Our agri-sector relies heavily on its ability to export.  The free movement of goods is vital in this respect.  With Brexit threatening to disrupt this, there are many unanswered questions about what the future holds.<\/p><p>At the yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine, many of these challenges were outlined.  These include compliance with customs and regulatory requirements that will increase the cost of trade, and delays in the movement of goods with the potential to disrupt the flow of trade and the supply chain.  I relayed to the committee a call that came from IBEC for radical investment in our ports, particularly Rosslare.  This requires infrastructure and a new vision on how upgraded infrastructure in our country can benefit the flow of trade.  This is of particular importance in the two regions that straddle my constituency, the south east and the mid-west.<\/p><p>The N24 is a key artery route between the east and west and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It runs through my constituency but, despite its importance, it has been neglected.  Its potential as a more free-flowing arterial route from one side of the country to the other, from Rosslare Port to Shannon Airport, is not being tapped into.  Along with my constituents, I have been calling for this route to be upgraded to improve its ability to cater for heavy goods traffic.  At the moment it is used heavily but traffic is congested in many towns on the way, especially Tipperary town.  If the N24 was upgraded and given motorway status, and if bypasses or ring roads were developed near a number of those towns on the route, it would serve to improve traffic flow to our ports and the connection between east and west.  It would not disimprove our infrastructure while also serving to streamline the transportation of goods across the country at a time we will need to facilitate trade in whatever way we can.<\/p><p>This is just one element of many that could be used for our benefit and to facilitate trade.  It may require a comprehensive and immediate review of the regional development plan.  I have spent much time talking to hauliers.  While they have been given some advice about what might be required of them in a new trading environment, there is still no certainty about what lies ahead.  Will they be stuck in queues in Kent while trying to cross the English Channel?  What will happen if they have perishable goods on board?  When it comes to our use of the UK land bridge post-Brexit, what agreement can be devised to ensure that whatever assurances our hauliers are given on prompt transit are not rowed back on like so much of what we have seen so far?<\/p><p>I want to discuss how the Covid pandemic affects this transition.  The ability of our businesses to absorb a so-called Brexit hit is lower now than it has been to date.  Our public finances have also taken a serious hit due to Covid.  When the transition period ends, unforeseen issues may arise meaning we are operating on a new playing field.  Can the Government guarantee that it will be able to provide this kind of assistance while also providing Covid supports?  Can the Government outline its plans to source the money needed if this arises and assure us that the most vulnerable will not be targeted for cuts in this scenario?<\/p><p>I refer to how this whole process has damaged trust.  The six counties in the North of this country have been used by the UK as a bargaining chip in the process of the negotiations so far.  Commitments have been broken on several occasions.  The interests of the people in the Six Counties who voted to remain in the EU have been ignored by the British Government, which has tried to manipulate the situation for its own economic purposes.  The Six Counties are being used as leverage to stop the old imperialistic legacy of the past from fading away.  The arguments and the distrust we have seen in recent years have made the case for one course of action very clear and that is the pursuit of a united Ireland.<\/p> <p>The Government must remember that by not having a discussion on a united Ireland, it has failed to address the key stumbling block in Brexit talks over the years.  It is the only plausible way of resolving the majority of the issues we are facing today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700052#FFF00300","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602091200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his address earlier and the great level of detail he went into.  I commend the very many actions taken heretofore by the Government in co-operation with various State agencies as well as EU partners.  Even though the work has been exhaustive, there will always be more work because it is very hard to wholly prepare for Brexit, particularly when we are at this very late stage in negotiations and we do not know exactly what form Brexit will take.  It is providing much concern and indeed worry for many sectors of the economy and wider society.  This transition period was to be used to prepare and negotiate but here we are at the beginning of October and negotiations are ongoing.  Indeed it seems there are some people who want to reopen negotiations on matters that have been resolved and are legally binding.  That said, there are still so many supports open to our businesses and our enterprise sector as a whole.  More can be done however, not necessarily by Government, but particularly by the business sector itself.  While I have met many businesspeople around the country who are in large organisations and have the luxury of appointing a Brexit-preparedness officer, our SMEs are dealing at the moment with the economic onslaught of a global pandemic, the likes of which has not been seen for more than a century and they do not have the time to appoint such an officer.  They are talking about supply-chain management and where they get their export markets from.  Their supplier may be in D&uacute;n Laoghaire but where is their supplier's supplier?  That is providing uncertainty and it is still so important that they continue to work with Government and agencies to prepare.   Driver's licences are one area where quite a simple thing has been done and I commend the Road Safety Authority, RSA, on this.  People resident in the State can no longer drive solely on a British driver's licence.  Approximately 70,000 are in this situation.  I found out in a reply to a parliamentary question to the Minister for Transport that 53,000 people have switched over their driver's licences but a considerable number of people still need to do that before 31 December.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to push the T&aacute;naiste on his remarks about the &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment reserve created by the EU, as well as the EU recovery fund.  This is something I challenged the Minster of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, on during pre-European Council statements.  This is something where we have to be proactive.  One of the great achievements made by Irish diplomats, the permanent government and everything else, over the past few years is to lean on our EU network - a very strong network and one we are very proud of - to ensure we have that level of solidarity when it comes to Brexit and the withdrawal agreement.  We need to once again dip into the well to stress to European colleagues how deeply affected Ireland will be by Brexit and how important it is that we get those vital supports.<\/p>  <p>  One are that falls under the T&aacute;naiste's own brief and that is going to be particularly difficult, albeit vitally important, is looking at our diversification and at the markets Ireland can appeal to.  Over the past couple of years, our reliance on the British market has declined.  Let us not forget that when we joined the EEC in 1973, 60% of our exports went to the UK alone, which is a massive number.  At the moment, products such as cheddar cheese and others are wholly reliant on the British market but much more work can be done.  First and foremost is exports to other member states.  We have seen the rise in exports to France and Germany.  Equally, we will see that expand further into other member states and we need to continue the development of our diplomatic footprint within the EU.  It is brilliant that we are opening embassies in Auckland and soon in Accra but we need to maintain our diplomatic presence in all member states.  I spoke earlier of our soft power and the importance of European solidarity.  The fact is that Ireland was able to maintain its diplomatic network within the EU through the very difficult years of the financial crisis and not closing a single embassy was vitally important to that.  We have to maintain that representation both within the member states and with our permanent representatives in Brussels to ensure that influence is maintained.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to consider where else we can trade through the EU.  We must use the new European trade deal with Japan, a deal that is not only agreed and ratified but is in operation.  We must likewise use trade deals with South Korea, Canada and more important, soon to be agreed deals with countries such as Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia as well, potentially, as ones with Australia and New Zealand.  That is particularly relevant to the T&aacute;naiste's Department.  I acknowledge, however, that it will be extremely difficult to do a trade mission via Zoom as it is not something that necessarily comes to us very easily but we have to adjust to that.  I spoke to the Irish-Australian Chamber of Commerce only last week.  It was 10 a.m. in my office and we were speaking to people who were going to bed in Sydney and all of these other places staying up for the conversation.  It was a frank conversation.  They now see Ireland as the gateway into the single market.  Equally, other countries are gateways, such as into south east Asia.  Improving our trading ties with north America and elsewhere is important and again, this falls on the Minister of State, as does ensuring that the Commission and the new European Commissioner for Trade, Mr. Valdis Dombrovskis, pushes the need for increased external trade.<\/p>  <p>  Returning to the core issue we are discussing, one of the most important trade deals will, hopefully, be decided in the next couple of days, if not the next couple of weeks.  Maintaining a trading relationship with the UK is vitally important for the EU.  It is a lot more important to the UK than to the EU despite what some people say in certain tabloid newspapers but it is vitally important for Ireland and certainly for key sectors.  I assume Deputy Cahill will address the agrifood sector shortly with a level of expertise I can only dream of.  That is why we need to ensure there is a deal.  A thin deal would be extremely disappointing but it would be something and it could be built upon.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste on the work of his Department over the past number of years and the work ahead which it faces.  We are less than 90 days away from Brexit.  We need to continue to prepare at all levels of society.  There is no such thing as a good Brexit but we have to prepare and make the best of what will unfortunately be a bad situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700053#GGG00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1602091200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>In 90 days, the UK will be outside the EU Single Market and the customs union.  This is going to have very significant implications for every business that moves goods to and from Great Britain.  Even if a free trade agreement is concluded between the EU and UK, there will be significant and enduring change.  Not since the economic war of the 1930s will Ireland have been deprived of access to the UK market.  We have spent centuries feeding and watering the UK market.  It is our nearest market and the one we depend on and trade with the most.  Businesses large and small are going to be impacted.  If we do not act to shield vital employers and producers in the economy from the shock of a no-deal Brexit, the economic situation our country finds itself in is going to become a lot more troublesome.<\/p>  <p>  I give an example of a large industry in my own constituency of Tipperary.  Other Deputies have businesses in their own constituencies facing similar problems.  Bulmers is a very big company in Clonmel, south County Tipperary and the south east region.  It is a major employer in our area and Brexit is a major threat to the economic viability of this County Tipperary-based operation going forward.  Bulmers' parent company, C and C Group, employs 800 people nationally, many of them in Clonmel.  On top of this, other businesses such as apple farms and transportation services also benefit from Bulmers being located in south County Tipperary.  It adds enormous value to the local community.  The plant pays approximately &euro;1.6 million in rates to the county council annually.  The council is prevented from giving a waiver on rates to any business whose annual rates exceed &euro;100,000.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to act in this regard.  A total of 50% of the Clonmel plant's output is exported to the UK.  Its revenue is down approximately 70% due to Covid and the resulting closure of pubs, lack of matches and all of the social restrictions that are in place.  Brexit also brings a unique threat to this industry, in the form of a threat of a proposed tariff on cider imported to the UK of 6.90 per 100 l.  No tariff is proposed on beer.  This is going to place cider at a major competitive disadvantage if that tariff is not eliminated.<\/p> <p>Bulmers produces 12.5 hectolitres annually and this tariff is set to cost the company &euro;6 million.  The danger is that if the production plant in Clonmel becomes uncompetitive the company will have no choice but to move its operations abroad to another plant owned by the parent company C&amp;C Group.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  Losing the employment it provides, the annual payroll of &euro;12 million and the &euro;1.6 million in rates that it pays to Tipperary County Council would be devastating for the county and the south-east region.  A no-deal Brexit would be detrimental to the work of the Clonmel plant and could very well result in its relocation to the UK.<\/p> <p> On the Good Friday Agreement, we have won a hard-fought peace on this island.  The actions of Boris Johnson and his Government in recent times are worrying in the extreme.  A Brexit deal cannot under any circumstances result in a border on our island.  The Brexit we see on 1 January next year must respect the Northern Ireland protocol.  Protecting jobs is vital, saving industries that are the backbone of our economy in rural Ireland is essential and the agrifood industry is dependent on retaining access to the UK's premium markets but ensuring peace and stability on our island for all people North and South must be paramount.  I very much welcome the position of leading US politicians such as the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and the presidential candidate, Joe Biden, who have stated there will be no trade deal between the UK and the United States if the UK breaches its obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  Protecting peace at all costs is essential.  The Government has an obligation to do this for all the people on the island.<\/p> <p> The beef sector is hugely dependent on the UK market and it is the highest returning market available to our producers.  Half our beef goes into that market.  It would be a long haul to get alternative markets for that beef and getting alternative markets with the same economic return would be extremely difficult.  This is why when we have proposed plants, such as the one in Banagher, we have to do everything possible to ensure they are built.  Here we have a Chinese consortium that wants to build a plant in the midlands where there is a ready supply of cattle.  It would create extra competition and, most importantly, it would provide us with a route to an alternative market such as China.  We have had an awful lot of fanfare about gaining entry into the Chinese market but, unfortunately, up to now the beef that has gone there would fit in a wheelbarrow.  Here we have a consortium that has a route into the market but, unimaginably, obstacles are being put in the way of building that plant.  This is nonsensical.  We have to get these routes to markets outside the UK.  It will take a generation or more to reduce our dependence on the UK.  When we have an opportunity we have to use it.<\/p> <p> The other industry that will be under huge pressure is cheddar cheese.  It is produced almost solely for the UK market.  We have developed it over the centuries and 80% of all cheddar cheese we produce is sold into the UK market.  If we are denied access to that market, or if a tariff is put on our product, it will create huge problems for the dairy industry.<\/p> <p> The amount of milk that moves between North and South in the country is significant.  A total of 25% of liquid milk sold here comes from Northern Ireland but Glanbia, Lakelands and Aurivo all import a lot of milk from Northern Ireland.  We have to ensure this trade can continue unhindered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700053#GGG00300","speaker":"1611","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602091800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>It has long been mooted that Brexit will cause pressure and strain on our businesses, in particular our small and medium enterprises.  Throughout the country we have seen devastation rippling through our businesses as they have been forced to close to assist our country in our time of need.  Some reopened but closed again last night.  The effects of these closures and the loss of business will be felt for some time to come and we need to ensure we support business during this very difficult time.  Brexit will throw another spanner in the works for our businesses as we move towards the end of the year.  The fact that there is such uncertainty around how exactly the UK will leave the EU is causing a huge amount of angst throughout the business sector.  Will there be restrictions on travel?  Will there be restrictions on the movement of goods?  These are all very important questions on which we need answers.<\/p>  <p>  The UK Government is leaving us all in the lurch by claiming it is leaving on 1 January, deal or no deal.  It sounds more like the game show than political leadership.  This is not acceptable and we need to put on the pressure to ensure we have a deal that does not hamper peace on this island in any way, shape or form.  However, aside from what I have mentioned already, there is plenty the Government can do regardless of what Brexit will bring.  While I accept a number of grant schemes are available for companies to become Brexit ready, we have to ensure our businesses have recovered from Covid before they hit the Brexit issue.<\/p>  <p>  Only last week, I met the Loop Head tourism group.  It has called for the same proposals that we have been demanding for some time now.  We must reduce the VAT rate for the hospitality sector.  One business owner was able to tell me that when he last availed of the lower VAT rate he was able to install and extend the kitchen in his business, which then directly led to the hiring of three additional staff from the local community.  These small measures cannot be underestimated, especially in rural areas where employment opportunities are thin.<\/p>  <p>  I have also been asked to raise the plight of the travel agents.  This is yet another industry that has been let down by the Government, with little or no supports.  The rollback of the temporary wage subsidy scheme to the new employment wage subsidy scheme has been seen as regressive by this sector in particular.

We need to ensure this happens but at the end of the day we are dealing with something that is somewhere between a bad Brexit and an absolute nightmare Brexit.  While we might only be dealing with a British Government gamble or a negotiating gambit we do not know this for sure.

We need to keep the pressure on with regard to the British Government because we have the difficulty coming down the line of the internal market Bill combined with a possible finance Bill that is looking to circumvent the protections given in the withdrawal agreement and the Irish protocol.<\/p>  <p>  Beyond this, the fact we are dealing with a circumstance and a British Government that does not care about hauliers or farmers, whether on the island of Ireland North or South, means we need to prepare for the only solution for the North-South relationship, which involves having a proper conversation about Irish unity and giving the people in the North a proper choice if we are down to a nightmare scenario where their choice will be to stay in the European Union or to stay in an utterly dysfunctional so-called United Kingdom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700054#HHH00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1602091800,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Coming from a Border area, I know more than most the devastating effects a hard border is going to have.  I remember the last time we had a so-called hard border and, believe me, it is not what anybody wants but I fear it is where we are heading.  I am also realistic and we need to prepare now for a hard border that is coming in less than three months time.  This is the worrying side of all of this.  We are only three months away from going back to a hard border on the island of Ireland.  I have consistently warned the Minister, Deputy Coveney, about the real prospect of a hard border, and on each occasion I was told that a deal for the island of Ireland was secured and that we had nothing to worry about.<\/p> <p>I only wish that was true today.  We have to face the fact that a hard border will be in place in fewer than three months and we will have to deal with it.  Even if a deal is reached with the UK Government at the last minute, can anyone still trust it?<\/p> <p> There are so many unanswered questions for the people on the ground, particularly for those who have to cross the Border every day for either work or personal reasons.  It is true that we did not vote for Brexit.  It is also true that the North did not vote for it but the reality is that it is coming.  I speak with people along the Border every day and these are some of the questions they ask me.  Is there going to be a hard border?  Will there be customs checks at the Border?  How will cross-Border workers be affected?  How will standards be maintained and even implemented?  How will farmers operate along the Border?  Will mobile telephone roaming charges be reintroduced?  Will security services on each side of the Border still have the same level of co-operation?  Will the North-South bodies remain?  Will students who cross the Border to go to school or college be affected?  These are just a small example of the many questions I am asked every day.<\/p> <p> The truth is that none of us have any real answers to these questions because nobody knows.  We can say the plans are in place but what are they?  How are businesses supposed to know what is happening when the Government is not even sure what is happening?  This is too serious a matter to leave to the last minute.<\/p> <p> We need action and plans now.  I appreciate the difficulty of negotiating with the UK Government and the fact it seems to make it up as it goes along.  We cannot allow that to stop us planning for the worst-case scenario, however.  For example, today it was reported that Dublin Port is behind its plans for Brexit in that an inspection facility is needed but has not yet been delivered.  We are fewer than three months away from Brexit and our main port is behind in its plans.  How are hauliers supposed to have confidence in the system when they see this reported so close to the deadline?  Why is Dublin Port behind in its plans?  This is not acceptable.<\/p> <p> Hauliers will also read in today's newspapers that Irish operators will face significant delays and blockages at UK ports come 1 January.  Can the Minister imagine owning a haulage company business and reading this with less than three months to go to Brexit?  We cannot sleepwalk into this.  We must take the lead now and start the process of implementing measures to deal with a hard Brexit.<\/p> <p> The Minister and his colleagues do not like to be told bad news.  Coming from a business background, I know that we have to deal with what is in front of us, namely, a hard border.  In business, people have to deal with difficult situations and make difficult decisions every day of the week.  All businesses are looking only for the truth.  Businesses are resilient and will deal with any situation to find solutions.  To find solutions, however, they need to know what is coming down the track.<\/p> <p> The Government website on Brexit states, \"When the transition period ends, Brexit is likely to affect how one's business operates\".  It advises businesses to review their supply chains, understand the rules for importing and exporting to the UK, review all the regulations, licences and certification requirements.  With all due respect, this is stating the obvious.  This is not real or practical advice.  The bottom line is that businesses are still in the dark when it comes to Brexit.  What is happening is quite simple.  We have gone from having a backstop arrangement to a technical solution to a border down the Irish Sea to a hard border on the island of Ireland, with nobody seeming to know what is happening.  This is simply not good enough.<\/p> <p> In the event of a no-deal Brexit, will third level students who attend college across the Border have the same rights and entitlements as of now?  Will the current rules for cross-Border healthcare arrangements stay in place?  Will the tax treatment for cross-Border workers remain the same?  Will there be customs and security checks at Border crossings?  Will driver licences and motor insurance remain the same after Brexit?  Will North-South co-operation in respect of security be affected?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700054#HHH00400","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602092400,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Since Britain first announced its intention to break away from the European Union, it has generally been acknowledged by all onlookers that the fortunes of the Republic of Ireland would suffer most from this event.  Not alone do we share social, cultural, economic and political ties with the UK, we also share a common Border which, with the advent of the Good Friday Agreement, has become a well-travelled route of commerce on the island of Ireland with over 33,000 movements daily.  A significant amount of this transport is commercial in nature and represents the transit of national and international goods and services traded between Ireland, the UK, mainland Europe and beyond.  Political and social integration that was achieved with the Good Friday Agreement has also led to economic integration, particularly in the areas of agrifood, with beef, lamb and milk products crossing the Border daily.  This seamless transfer has provided for business models to develop to the benefit of all communities on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The idea of severing relations between Britain and the EU was a construct of the Tory Party, which has championed its nationalist fervour in order to achieve its wish list of financial sovereignty, self-regulation and the idea that the UK economy would power ahead when freed from the shackles of European legal and fiscal oversight.  Europe was deemed at fault for the destruction of the British car, coal and aviation industries.  Unemployment in the north of England was sold to voters as the result of European meddling in UK fiscal management.  The changing demographic face of the UK - the result of freedom of movement of those impacted by the UK's colonial past - was instead presented as the fault of access mandated to EU citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The result of all of this messaging was that British society became somewhat fractured and implemented the decision to leave the EU.  The consequent guarantees and commitments given to protect the Good Friday protocol in the recently negotiated withdrawal agreement now also appear subject to the new iteration, depending on the whims of the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and his trusted Brexit advisers.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever our political opinions on the actions of the current UK Government, we in Ireland must remember that our significant economic and cultural ties are forged with the British people and not their political elites.  Britain has long been one of Ireland's largest trading partners and will likely remain so after Brexit has been dealt with.  Britain and Ireland share significant export and import requirements that each rely on the other to provide.  Although some trading trends may change based on price fluctuations, it is likely that it will still prove easier for Irish medium-sized businesses to develop UK customers as opposed to customers in Europe, the US or Asia.  The geographical position of our countries will not change after a delivered Brexit.  We will continue largely to speak the same language, consume the same media and eat the same meals, although the food provenance may change somewhat for certain people in the UK.<\/p>  <p>  I urge all those in the Government who are dealing directly with the Brexit issue to continue to negotiate with integrity and good faith.  While relying on our EU friends to mind our economic interests, it must be remembered that the UK is still an important ally and economic friend to Ireland.  Ireland will most likely have to pick up the economic pieces as a result of Brexit.  Doubtless our national trading relationship with the UK economy may change to a significant degree.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit will also challenge the UK population.  Within that challenge will come opportunity to redefine our economic ties and to continue in close co-operation as the only two islands on the western edge of Europe.  Brexit must not become a UK-Ireland divorce but rather a managed separation that allows each party to continue to respect each other's differences and to work in co-operation while working closely to our mutual benefit and security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700055#JJJ00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1602092400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>What is the point in encouraging Irish firms to move their trade from the UK, to source their raw materials from anywhere other than the UK and instruct businesses to try fellow EU countries to broaden their horizons and find alternative markets?  The Government is constantly telling Irish firms to prepare, only for it to then not play its part in ensuring a riskless transportation operation in which they can do so.<\/p>  <p>  A former political adviser told me this week that the Government strategy's is not one of risk management but of crisis management.  In adopting a strategy of allowing a crisis to evolve instead of preventing it, the Government is fettering the EU in terms of its ability to negotiate and putting us at risk.  Jobs and businesses are being put at risk all because the Government's attitude is that it is better to have a crisis to manage than not have a crisis at all.  A crisis is not good for the country.  To allow one to manifest itself in order that the Government can display its crisis management skills is unconscionable.  Businesses, jobs, farmers, fishermen and hauliers are all at risk because of the Government's strategy.  We need to get out of the business of crisis management and into the business of risk management and crisis prevention.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is allowing a crisis to develop to ensure that it can get more bang for its buck on political payday by displaying its crisis management skills instead of heading it off at the pass.  Since I have become involved in politics, I have noted it is all about crisis management.  Dare I say it but the Government is getting plenty of experience.  Its strategy is costing the country a fortune in terms of housing, health and Covid.  It is across all Departments.  We have a crisis in forestry.  Everything the Government does involves firefighting.<\/p> <p>Good managers are the ones one does not hear from while bad managers are the ones one hears from every day because they are out explaining themselves.  The Government is full of them.  This needs to stop.  We need a good manager to ensure we have a riskless transportation alternative to the UK land bridge and such an alternative, as the Government has been told by everyone in the know, is a fast, efficient, daily, direct ferry service from Rosslare to mainland Europe.  Those in the know are not the civil servants or the Department Secretaries General.  They are the operators who safeguard the exports and imports of the country.  It brings us to the old saying that a chain is only as good as its weakest link.  To ensure our exporters and importers can make the most of their opportunities, all the links in the chain need to be strong.  There needs to be recognition that, after Brexit, Ireland is geographically much more isolated within the EU.  That requires transportation solutions so our economy&rsquo;s potential is not stunted by geography and distance and by the Government&rsquo;s failure to prepare, as it would prefer to manage the crisis it is allowing to develop.<\/p> <p> Here is a map.  There is little old Ireland, 300 miles from mainland Europe, as it will be after the transition period.  It includes only EU countries on the map, not the UK, and it should bring it home to the decision-makers just how geographically isolated Ireland is from the rest of the EU.  We are out on a limb.  The map clearly show the importance of good transportation links to negate that geographical disadvantage.<\/p> <p> The Government must be able to see these things.  If the Minister of State does not see them, it is time he went to Specsavers.  Leaving our naked vulnerability there for this UK Government to attack and coerce us with is like a boxer fighting while voluntarily holding one hand behind his back.  It is madness and so is the Government&rsquo;s crisis management strategy.  Businesses and Brexit go hand in hand and so do jobs and livelihoods.  The Government needs to practice what it preaches and start to prepare with the knowledge it has.  Please start the crisis prevention. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700055#JJJ00300","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602093000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>It is remarkable that less than three months prior to the UK leaving the EU, there is no agreement in place and the UK still does not know what the nature of its trading relationship with the EU will be after 1 January 2021.  What we need to learn from this is that if we ever go down the route of having a significant referendum in this country, as we may in years to come, we have to be sure to do our homework in advance.  Clearly, the British Government and people, unfortunately, did not have the homework done for them in advance of the Brexit vote.<\/p><p>Irrespective of whether the EU and the UK reach an agreement within the next three months, we know for certain that on 1 January 2021, the UK will leave the Single Market and the customs union.  That is remarkable because I do not think anyone who was proposing Brexit in advance of the referendum in 2016 was seriously contending that the UK, if it voted to leave the EU, would automatically take itself out of the Single Market and customs union.  That has come to pass, to a large extent, because of the political manoeuvring within the UK political system that took place in the aftermath of the referendum.<\/p><p>Let there be no doubt that the Single Market was probably the most significant development that this country undertook that led to our remarkable economic achievements over the past 20 or 30 years.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle does not have to believe me on that but anyone interested in Brexit and the development of Ireland in the second half of the 20th century should read Kevin O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s book <i>A Short History of Brexit<\/i>.  It reveals that the really remarkable performance of Ireland since 1980 was due to our membership of the Single Market.  That is what really transformed the Irish economy.  We need to recognise that will be significantly affected by the fact that one of our largest trading partners in the Single Market, the UK, is going to depart from that market on 1 January next.<\/p><p>I had the benefit of being at my second finance committee meeting yesterday and it was attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Fleming.  We had an opportunity to consider some of the figures that were being put forward by the Minister of State in respect of this country&rsquo;s preparedness for Brexit.  In particular, the Minister of State told us that the State through the Revenue Commissioners has hired considerably more officials for the purpose of performing custom duties on goods arriving from the UK, which will be necessary in light of the fact the UK is departing from the customs union.<\/p><p>One point that was repeatedly emphasised by the Minister of State was that he has a concern - and it is one I share, having listened to what he said - that there are many smaller businesses in Ireland which may not yet be fully prepared for the consequences of Brexit.  It appears to be the case that the larger, more well-resourced businesses in Ireland are prepared.  They have had expert advice and they know how their business will be affected.  Unfortunately, that is not the case for smaller businesses, which may be exporting only a small part of their produce into the UK.  It is important that we, as a State, and the Government as the persons ultimately responsible, provide as much information as possible, even at this late stage, for those small businesses.  Those small businesses should consult with their trade associations and their local chambers of commerce to find out what it is they must do to ensure they are protected when Brexit arrives on 1 January.  If they are not protected and have not completed their preparations, they will face difficulties for business down the road.<\/p><p>It is inevitable that there will be problems arising on a practical basis from the UK departure from the Single Market and customs union and it will have a significant impact on our economy, whether we like it or not.  I had the benefit of reading the quarterly report prepared by the Central Bank, published earlier this week.  It reveals that if we have a no-deal Brexit and there are World Trade Organization, WTO, terms, the effect that will have is that Irish gross domestic product, GDP, next year will reduce by approximately 2%. That is a very significant impact on our economy.  I suspect, however, there will be even more significant impacts as a result of it.<\/p><p>We need to recognise that we can now see the importance of the Irish protocol that was appended to the withdrawal agreement.  If we did not have the Irish protocol, we would now be preparing to deal with the prospect of having a land border with a country outside of the Single Market and customs union.  It would be a horrific prospect for this State to deal with.<\/p><p>It is important that one becomes aware when looking at the Central Bank report of the threats posed to the Irish economy by the combination of Covid and Brexit.  It makes stark reading and one of the things that is apparent from it is that our export business is so strong that it has not been greatly affected by Covid.  What is under threat, as the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, will be aware, is our domestic economy, that is, our small and medium enterprises.  They face significant challenges by the opening and closing caused by the Covid restrictions.  We face a daunting task but it is something this country will be able to deal with.  If people in this House think they are exposed to unprecedented challenges, let us think of what our forefathers and foremothers went through 100 years ago, when, during the time of the Spanish flu, they were able to fight for and achieve Irish independence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700056#KKK00200","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1602093000,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Communities across the midlands are already reeling from Covid-19 and now we find ourselves facing significant uncertainty as a result of Brexit and how it will ultimately play out in our community.  I appreciate the Trojan work done by the previous Administration on this issue and I know a number of our Ministers, our Taoiseach and our T&aacute;naiste are assiduously working to ensure there is no negative impact from Brexit on the midlands region.  However, regardless of whether the UK ultimately yields to a deal on Brexit, the reality is the transition will be hugely difficult for the midlands.  More than two years ago, an IBEC report on the challenge identified Longford as one of four counties at greatest risk from Brexit, owing to the large concentration of businesses involved in engineering, food production and logistics.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>That report did not take account of the agricultural sector and the challenges therein.  I recently met a number of Longford farmers in an airy slatted shed in Oldtown, Ardagh.  The shed was not too dissimilar to this building although it had significantly more atmosphere and character.  Those Irish Farming Association, IFA, farmers had issues and concerns.  They referenced Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, transition funding, the suckler herd, sheep farming, forestry, the fair deal scheme and farm safety.  Ultimately, their greatest cause for concern was the uncertainty presented by Brexit.  I know that the Brexit piece is foremost in the mind of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, he is conscious of the significant shift in farmer profile over recent generations and that a troublesome Brexit will deeply unsettle a fragile ecology.<\/p> <p> County Longford is already reeling as a consequence of Covid-19.  We expected just over 50 pubs to reopen in the county a number of weeks ago but, sadly, within a ten-mile radius of Longford town, ten family-run bars did not open.  In essence, we lost 20% of the county's bars, the reality is that they will not be back and with them have gone focal points for many of our local communities.<\/p> <p> It is a similar story for our retailers with a notable shift to online trading.  This week's additional restrictions, while necessary, are another hammer blow to beleaguered rural communities.  There is no doubt that the restart grant and other supports have been hugely supportive and the hope is that next week's budget will include additional measures.<\/p> <p> Since March, Longford's only travel agency, Kanes Travel, has remained open to assist its customers with getting refunds and still there is no likelihood whatsoever of any income throughout this period for the family-run business.  At best, it will be next April before the business sees any actual sales.  We do not want to lose the travel agency in Longford town which has been at the heart of our community for 60 years.  We are desperately hoping that many of our local businesses will be able to see some dividend from the Christmas trading season this year.<\/p> <p> Provincial towns have faced numerous challenges over the past couple of years and the reality is that Covid will rob them of a full year's trading.  It will, unfortunately, be the death knell for many of these businesses.  Cork, Dublin, Galway and all the other large urban centres will bounce back once the visitors and investors return but for rural Ireland, the challenges are considerable and will be further emphasised by the looming Brexit crisis.  After Covid, and regardless of whether we see an agreed or unilateral British withdrawal in 90 days' time, rural Ireland will suffer.  Accordingly, it needs to be prioritised in terms of funding and support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700056#KKK00300","speaker":"1597","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602093600,"counter":337,"content":"<p>For more than 30 years, I worked in the private sector before being elected to the D&aacute;il and I understand the fear and uncertainty that businesses and employees are facing as a result of Brexit.  Approximately 15% of Irish goods and services are destined for the UK and, in the agrifood sector, that figure goes up to 40%.  In a report commissioned by the Government, Copenhagen Economics found that a Brexit resulting in the application of World Trade Organization trading regulations - in other words, a no-deal Brexit - could see Ireland lose 7% of GDP.  Current trade costs could rise from 4% to 32% in a no-deal scenario.  It also found that regions outside Dublin are more exposed to Brexit with rural areas bearing much of the brunt.  Let us not forget that 80% of Irish businesses are small or microbusinesses.  Those individuals and families are the people who will feel the sting of Brexit the most.<\/p>  <p>  With two thirds of Irish goods exporters using the UK land bridge, the situation facing business is dire.  We need to find alternatives and invest in our ports, build ferry capacity and ensure there are no delays of our exports to Europe or the rest of the world while protecting our continued sustainability in the face Brexit.  This should be a key priority for the Government.  In 2018, Cork Port handled almost 10.6 million tonnes of goods.

Business in that area is always somewhat hampered by the Border.  In every area across Europe, it is recognised that a border corridor is a disadvantage and problem.  Particular disadvantages exist when the border in question is totally unnatural, as is the case in Ireland.  Much of the economics and commerce that goes on across the Border, which has thankfully, by and large, disappeared over the past 20 years, runs over and back.  Cows are milked in the South, processed in the North, brought back into the South for further processing of the milk, before it is brought back into the North again for further processing.  That is going on all along the Border.  That problem is going to be magnified if we have a situation where we have any kind of posts, checks or infrastructure placed at the Border.  We need to make certain that cannot happen under any circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The British Government's intransigence towards Ireland and the particular predicament that all the people on this island will face because of Brexit has been farcical.  We need to be looking at how we can resolve that issue here and now.  We also need to look at the broader picture.  Many of my colleagues have mentioned issues about exports.  Large amounts of our produce are exported through Britain and into Europe.

The EU wants to maintain its access to UK waters based on historic fishing patterns.  The UK has emphasised its sovereign control over its waters and wants fishing quotas to be negotiated on an annual basis.  The worries for the fisheries sector in Ireland are many.  Britain, which has long been seen to hold the upper hand in fisheries talks, is looking for a much larger share of fish quotas from stocks which cross into its waters, with the ability to reduce the amount of access EU vessels can have to UK waters after Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The EU, in turn, wants to stay as close as possible to current quota shares and access rights under the much hated Common Fisheries Policy.  Now member states are piling the pressure on Mr. Barnier to stick to his negotiating mandate.

The grave danger to the Irish fishing industry is linked to the wider trade negotiations.  We have heard that the UK linkage is there, but what use or abuse of the linkage is being made?<\/p>  <p>  There is a complete lack of transparency being provided on this issue.  It is time that the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, updated the industry and the D&aacute;il on the matter and on what steps he is taking to protect the sector.  For example, 400 vessels from the EU are known to fish between the North Sea, the Irish Sea, the French channel and off the Shetland Islands.  They are fishing inside UK waters.  What happens if they are denied access?  <\/p>  <p>  Can the Minister confirm, in respect of the cross-border directive which has become a major concern as the clock is ticking, that an order will be made to allow Irish residents to continue to travel to Northern Ireland and avail of the EU cross-border directive after 1 January 2020?  I believe that the Act that was passed by the House in 2019, the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act, allows for this to happen.  It is not only in the public interest and an effective use of the resources of the State, it will also remove the need for citizens to make a journey to France or further afield if they wish to use the EU directive.  Given that many of them are elderly, in pain or have poor sight, if the Minister and Government does not confirm that an order will be made, these citizens will be left to wait for the HSE or the National Treatment Purchase Fund to act instead of being able to make a personal choice to fund surgery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700058#MMM00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1602094200,"counter":342,"content":"<p>An economic research body based in Germany has forecast in its latest publication that Ireland could lose over 35,000 jobs in companies directly or indirectly involved with exporting to the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The majority of these jobs are in rural areas.  They have been badly affected as it is, without being hurt any further.<\/p><p>The part of the country that I come from and represent has Munster Joinery<i>, <\/i>Liebherr Container Cranes and Fexco, all of which export to and deal with the UK day in and day out.  They provide thousands of jobs and if they were to be hurt or closed down, or to reduce their number of jobs, that would affect our local economy in a desperate way.<\/p><p>Farmers and those who own SMEs are very worried at the present time because, as we know, the greater part of their work and products is being exported to the UK.  They need serious help.  Wonderful people work in London and elsewhere in the UK, such as Dan Tim O'Sullivan who is from the heart of south Kerry and employs over 2,500 people.  Mike Jack Cronin, who is from Killarney, employs people in Killarney and London.  We are very proud of him and his venture with Thermohouse insulated homes.  He is making headway and has been making progress in the UK.  If there is a hard Brexit, we hope it will not affect these honest and hard-working people.<\/p><p>We are importing and exporting.  Like Deputy Collins, I am very worried about the fishermen and the prospect of England taking back some of her waters.  This could greatly reduce the ability of our fishermen to eke a living out of the sea.  They need financial support right away.<\/p><p>We need to invest in our ports and ferries.  We are very worried about the land bridge to Europe.  We must have our own facilities, mechanisms and ways to get to mainland Europe.  We are a small island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.  The Government needs to realise that and deal with it.  If we have to buy ferries and upgrade our ports, that is what we have to do.  We have to ensure that our farmers and business people are not compromised.<\/p><p>In regard to the North of Ireland, we greatly respect our interaction with it.  It is part of our country.  Only a ditch separates North and South and trade is going on up and down the country.  We hope this is not interrupted or interfered with in any way because it would have a devastating effect on local work and business.<\/p><p>I appeal to the Government to ensure that tariffs and customs regulations are dealt with expeditiously.  Why are we leaving everything to the last day?  There is too much left to do and the Government has lost a lot of time.  I know the coronavirus is taking up a lot of time, but we have to delegate and make sure that these matters are properly and expeditiously dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700058#MMM00300","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1602094200,"counter":343,"content":"<p>On the subject of expediting things, I thank the Deputy.

I ask him to remind me when I have spoken for six and half minutes.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to have an opportunity to make a few points on Brexit and business.  I am from the north west of the country, as the Minister knows.  Sadly, many businesses in my region are concerned about whether they will make the Brexit deadline in business such is the impact of Covid and our dependency in the north-west region on the hospitality sector.  I will come back to that.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of budgetary preparations and with regard to the north-west region, as the Minister will probably know, due to continuing neglect over many decades of investment in the north-west region we have been reclassified from a developed region to a region in transition.<\/p>  <p>As a result of that, the Government will qualify for up to &euro;350 million in grant aid under the Cohesion Fund, whereby &euro;60 of every &euro;100 committed is payable to the Government by the EU.  It is vitally important that we do not repeat the mistake of the period 2014 to 2020 in the next period 2021 to 2026 by reprofiling pipeline projects to take advantage of a funding scheme from the EU.  That is not what it is intended for and it will not be the medicine that is required for the illness, which is the lack of improvements in the north-west region to get it to that developed stage which will ensure that counties like Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan are capable of performing to potential and making a contribution to the national effort which is sustainable.<\/p> <p> To achieve this the Northern and Western Regional Assembly has appealed to the Government to introduce, and I am supporting it by asking the Minister to ensure that the Government introduces, an integrated territorial investment vehicle to ensure that the EU funding that we qualify for, as I have outlined, is targeted in that region, and that in line with the principle of subsidiarity, those moneys are controlled and made available through the existing apparatus in that region, with the input, obviously, of the Northern and Western Regional Assembly.  There is no question that to be creative in accountancy one could probably draw down this money and buy PPE for the north west region with it.  We are buying that anyway.  I ask that this money is put where it is intended to be, which is to improve the overall region and to allow it to develop.<\/p> <p> On the current situation with Brexit, we hope we successfully secure an agreed future relationship so that we do not go totally off the cliff.  The reality of this region of the north west and my area is that any Brexit will be a hard Brexit.  We have such an interdependency with Northern Ireland and with the export market, together with the fact that we suffer high levels of unemployment already, that it is critically important that we get the money to the people and businesses that need it and prioritise that.<\/p> <p> In that context it is very difficult not to talk about the current Covid-19 pandemic.  I will give one example again of the hospitality industry.  It has been totally wiped out by Covid-19.  The superficial suggestion that level 3 plus is supportive of pubs, restaurants or hotels is ridiculous in the extreme.  It has got to have been thought up by somebody at a desk who was never in a pub, restaurant or hotel in Ireland because 15 people cannot eat out in the rain and hail or during Storm Alex last weekend.  They cannot have pints or Coca-Cola outside in the rain or hail.  Within our own county we will not be having staycations for people from Collooney in Sligo town.  These businesses need the required level of supports to allow them to survive.  Brexit is not even on their list of concerns at this stage.  They are worrying about having a future in business at all.<\/p> <p> I have seen correspondence from the T&aacute;naiste's office which confirms that the top-up grant of 40% for the restart grant, which was payable to businesses here in Dublin such as pubs and so on, only entitles businesses in Donegal, which have been at level 3 plus for several weeks, to a further 10% on top of the 30%, whereas this would be a net 70% top-up if the pubs were in Dublin.  This is being done on the basis that the pubs in Donegal are allowed to open, that is, they are entitled to have 15 people out in the rain.  That is just ridiculous.  All of these businesses are going to close.  There may be an odd exception where a business may have a huge semi-covered deck area which has central heating, but in the main all of these businesses are gone.  I ask the Minister, please, to revisit this to ensure that the full top-ups are available to all of the businesses.  This applies not just to Donegal, where it has arisen, but also now to all the other 24 counties outside of Dublin.  If we are going to support businesses, let us do that.<\/p> <p> I very much hope that the Minister can take this on board to ensure that we are giving the appropriate supports, because we have wiped out hospitality as an industry in this region.  Unless we take a more strategic approach to managing the Covid-19 situation which permits some level of safe trading for that industry, it is quite simply finished.  It is not good enough for us to say that we must do this.  \"Must\" is not an option.  We have to protect people's lives, as the Taoiseach has said, and livelihoods.  Our plan as outlined at the moment will not achieve this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700058#MMM00500","speaker":"1606","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602094800,"counter":346,"content":"<p>We cannot discuss Brexit without including Covid-19.  One cannot have a discussion about Covid-19 without including Brexit.  Both of them have shown the State to be far less effective than it should be.  It has shown that the reforms that were suggested over the years and were not implemented are now playing against us.  How ready are we to deal with the Covid-19 nightmare into 2022?  How ready are we for Brexit?<\/p>  <p>  I will point to a number of issues that are of grave concern to me.  One is the hospitality sector.  I come from Kilkenny, which is a tourism city, and during this summer there were one to two buses at the castle park where regularly the whole line of the street in front of the castle would be full of visitors and buses from all over the world.  That has led to a serious problem for the hospitality sector because we rely on tourism.  Those who are involved in tourism who were badly affected by the downturn and the financial crash and are only barely recovering out of that now face into other huge issues, which are Covid-19 and then Brexit.  They are struggling financially, in spite of being big employers both in the hotel sector and in the services supporting the hotels, to keep their doors open and are being shown no support from the banking sector, the sector that brought this country to its knees.  Now it is meting out a second beating to those businesses that are willing to take the risk, that have a good product, but are not backed by the banks because their credit rating has been lowered due to their history from the financial crash.  The State should be providing some form of refinancing for those businesses so that they can continue in the work that they are doing and to give employment.  That is not happening.<\/p>  <p>  The second big sector in the country which is affected by both Covid-19 and Brexit is coach tour and bus operators.  They have been brought to their knees by Covid-19 and by the actions that had to be taken by Government.  We should be giving a tax rebate on their fuel directly to that sector, a tax break on the buildings that they occupy, and financial support to assist them through this time into 2022, because it is that year that is being forecast as a year that, maybe, the tourism industry may turn itself up again and people will begin to travel.<\/p>  <p>  If we do not take these dramatic steps now to support these sectors, they will not be there when the turn comes in the economy, with Brexit or, indeed, with Covid-19 if we get a vaccine.  There are so many things that we can do to help that may not cost the State money and we need the support of the banks to achieve those.  Are we strong enough as a Government to tell the banks to support individuals with difficulties in their mortgages and businesses that are the backbone of this country at this difficult time?<\/p> <p>The previous Government was not able to do it.  I know the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, were to meet the banks again.  I believe the banks will ignore them.  We need to encourage another banking competitor into the market such as Sparkasse or one of those community banks that will give interest rates similar to those in Germany and support our businesses as we go through this, because what is happening in the economy, in pubs and in the general hospitality sector is shocking.  It is shocking to see family businesses close down.  It is shocking to see pubs boarded up.  As Deputy MacSharry outlined, some of the measures are not supporting the reopening of those pubs or hotels in real terms.<\/p> <p> I encourage the Government to look even beyond those sectors at the many small businesses that at one stage employed up to 1 million people and give them support because they are outside of most of the businesses that are represented at national level.  They are family run businesses.  They are in our communities and villages and, believe me, we will want them in the future.  We will want to see those shops open to keep villages alive in the future, but if the Government does not invest in them now, we simply will not have them.  Having someone creating a small number of jobs in any community is a massive benefit for that community.<\/p> <p> Lastly, in the context of Covid-19 and the money that is being spent, the Minister cannot overlook the usual supports that are needed in such areas as the disability sector.  In Kilkenny, I have seen the disability sector and its supports decimated.  People cannot get respite.  They cannot get special care in homes.  Regardless of what we do to deal with the impact of Covid and Brexit, let us not forget those who are marginalised and less well off.  Let us not forget those on hospital waiting lists.  Let us put them first.  This country has to be brave in terms of the risk it is going to take because it will be the saving of the next generation and those who are in business now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700059#NNN00200","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602095400,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, previously, but this is my first time to speak to him in the D&aacute;il, so I wish him luck as a new Minister.<\/p>  <p>  The uncertainty around Brexit is ferocious.  Whether people like it or not and whether they live in a city or a rural area, we must realise that food is transported between Ireland and England by lorry and by ships going back and forth.  We need to make sure that we understand that 60% to 70% of our beef goes to the UK.  It was alarming to see Asda's statement yesterday that it will buy only British beef, which would not be a welcome development for Irish farmers.  We have to make sure that we put the funds in place.  Be it state aid or whatever and regardless of whether the EU blocks it, we have to support the agricultural sector, be it the beef, dairy or sheep sector.  While 300,000 to 400,000 lambs are transported here from across the Border, some of them come from the UK.  It appears that will continue with the agreements that are in place.  However, in terms of our beef getting to the UK, if a deal is not done, there will be tariffs imposed, and with the current price of beef, the farming sector cannot withstand the likes of that.  There must be Government intervention to make sure our farmers continue to be viable.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the business communities, especially those in the Border areas, we have to make sure that we put a foot under them, so to speak, because not only are they going through the torment in respect of Covid-19, which was highlighted earlier, Brexit is a double whammy coming at them.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the timber industry, last Friday, for the first time in 30 years, there was a mill in this country that did not have any timber.  We must realise that much of our timber goes to the building industry in the UK, and for pallets.  We have to put a foot under that sector also which employs 12,000 people.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the haulage industry and roll-on, roll-off services.  In terms of our new models of where we will be going in the future, are we ready in ports such as Rosslare?  I am aware a review was done earlier in the year by the EU and I believe Rosslare will go into a core node in TEN-T, but will the Port of Galway get help?  Will the infrastructure be put in place under, say, the core network for TEN-T funding from Donegal, along what we call the western arc, through the Minister of State's constituency, and I have often advocated on behalf of Mullingar, to Castlebar?  We need the infrastructure to make it linkable in terms of traffic going back and forth.<\/p>  <p>  On a note of caution, we had a meeting with IBEC via Zoom last week attended by the pharmaceutical sector and other businesses in the west.  They have highlighted the major problem that Ireland is losing foreign direct investment, FDI.  The CEOs or the people who make the decisions about FDI are not coming to this country because of the need to quarantine on arrival.  I am not saying they should be allowed be in contact with people on arrival, but we need to put in place a system that facilitates those who are spending money here to get through our airports, without having contact with others, and travel to where the business they will make the decision on is located.  It has been stated to us bluntly that we will not get the FDI that other countries are getting currently because of such regulations in place.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to a business today and it seems that the banks are putting people through the ringer with respect to the Covid credit guarantee fund.  I believe a decision will be made with respect to that business tomorrow but the bank involved was AIB, which we bailed out.  It asked for a business plan to be done but subsequently requested another one.  They then had to do a business plan indicating that they will be doing almost no business next year.  With the current situation, no one in business can foresee more than six months ahead let alone look into a glass bowl and say what will happen in the next year.  The Government is prepared to stand 80% behind a business but some of the people in the credit committees of the banks, especially the State-owned banks like AIB, who are making the decisions seem to be putting people through the hoops.  It is as if they do not want to give them money.  We have to keep businesses in operation.  We have to take risks at times.  No one knows what the Covid situation or Brexit will bring in the next six months or year.  Through no fault of anybody's things are happening and we have to make sure that we protect the existing jobs.  If we do not, what comes in goes back out.  If the Government is not getting in the money in taxes, rates and other revenue, more people unemployed will be a problem.<\/p> <p> Coach hire was talked about by Deputy McGuinness, as was the hospitality sector.  They have got a hammering this year, including from Covid.  If there are many rules and regulations coming in under Brexit, it will be problematic.<\/p> <p> Prices are going up all the time.  It is necessary to be competitive to survive in this world.  Last week, the PSO levy was increased.  We talk about the great new world we are going to enter but households will have to pay &euro;54 more for electricity because of the increase.  We are talking about climate action again and introducing a carbon tax.  Basically, rural people will suffer.  While everybody is willing to make an effort and help in every way, we are dealing with crises.  We are dealing with Brexit and Covid and now we are talking about introducing climate action legislation that will basically screw people more in the rural areas if there is to be a carbon tax increase of &euro;6 or &euro;7 per tonne this year and next year.  When under pressure, it is necessary to pull back on certain things.  The health and wealth of the people are more important than deciding that we, as a nation, are going to save the world when others are giving the whole lot the two fingers.  I am not saying we are ignoring the issue but people cannot be left as I describe.  Do we want an Ireland in which we are looking out a half door and drawing the dole while saying we are a great country and that our emissions levels have come down?  Alternatively, do we want to keep creating work?  We are emerging from a tough time that began in 2010.  We are now in the middle of a very tough time and we must ensure we put incentives in place so businesses can continue right around the country, but we must also ensure there are links between all the relevant Departments, including those responsible for agriculture and transport, to be sure we are as Brexit ready as possible.  People talk about being Brexit ready but how do we solve the problem if a heap of lorries are banged up together with food in them, resulting in shortages here and there?<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to take my points into account.  This debate is well worthwhile but at the end of the day we do not know what is going to happen.  We hope the issue will be resolved and that an agreement will be reached.  If not, we have to be prepared to step in for the people of this country and help them in their hour of need because they have put their shoulders to the wheel over recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700060#OOO00200","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602096000,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their constructive contributions on the topics of business and Brexit.  Deputy Fitzmaurice is dead right that the banks must step up to the mark, particularly when the Government is underpinning lending by up to 80%.  I have engaged with people in my constituency in this regard.  It is regrettable that the banks are not stepping up to the mark.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies raised the issue of additional supports for businesses in the contexts of Covid and Brexit.  We have had our July stimulus.  That was one of the biggest cash injections in the history of the State.  It was the first part of a three-part approach to supporting our businesses and economy.  The budget is next week and I believe there will be extensive supports for businesses, followed by the national economic plan later this year.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of questions to be answered arising from the UK's decision to leave the EU Single Market and customs union on 1 January 2021.  I acknowledge the efforts of Mr. Michel Barnier's negotiation team to bring about a satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations.  I disagree with Deputy Mattie McGrath that the time for talking is over.  The time for talking is very much now because we want to reach an agreement to avoid a hard Brexit.  The only way we can do so is through negotiations and talks.  While we do not know the ultimate outcome, we know substantial and lasting change is coming on 1 January 2021.  We also know we need to prepare businesses for that change.<\/p>  <p>  On 1 January, businesses will be affected most immediately by the terms of the new customs procedures, which will affect what has up to now been the seamless movement of goods through ports and airports and via the UK land bridge.  Most businesses, unless exporting to third country markets, will be completely unfamiliar with the procedures, checks and controls concerning customs and with other regulatory checks.  These changes mean businesses must get Brexit ready within a short period.  It is important to emphasise that the changes will occur regardless of the outcome of EU-UK negotiations and regardless of whether there is a trade deal.  That is why I urge businesses to prepare for the change and take action now.  They need to get ready, get informed and get support.<\/p>  <p>  This morning I took part in the Department's enterprise forum on Brexit and global challenges with the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy English.  Having listened to stakeholders, I note there is still concern about the level of preparedness among businesses.  I commenced a regional roadshow with Enterprise Ireland and, in kicking off the tour, I prioritised the north-east region given its exposure to Brexit.  From discussions, I realise companies engaging with State agencies are confident but a priority concern for me is that many small business communities are not engaging with State agencies and not engaging in Brexit preparedness activity because of competing demands on their time as they continue to deal with the impact of Covid and many other challenges.  We must ensure no one is left behind and everyone is engaging with the process.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and State agencies are here to help and provide support for businesses navigating the changes.  The T&aacute;naiste, in his statement, outlined a full range of State supports to help to get businesses Brexit ready.  With just 11 weeks to go until the end of the transition period, I ask all Deputies to ensure they bring these supports to the attention of local businesses that can make best use of them.<\/p>  <p>  Using the UK land bridge also remains a key issue.  I visited Dublin Port last week and saw for myself the amount of work under way to get it prepared.  In fairness to it, it has been preparing for more than two years, but it is important to remember that if businesses wish to continue using the land bridge, customs formalities will be necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Direct sea link options provide a viable alternative, and businesses should be considering these to avoid future risk and backlogs.  My understanding is that there are approximately 20 direct sailings from Dublin Port to mainland Europe weekly and in the region of six direct sailings from Rosslare Europort weekly, depending on the time of the year.  From listening to some Deputies tonight, one would swear there were no direct sailings from Ireland to mainland Europe.<\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise the issue of customs training and familiarisation, in addition to the training and support initiatives available to get businesses up to speed on new customs procedures.  This will probably be the area of greatest impact on businesses, and it is the one with which they will be least familiar.  In a recent Enterprise Ireland survey of over 600 companies, customs proved to be the matter of greatest concern.  From 1 January next, businesses wishing to continue trading with the United Kingdom will need, at a minimum, to have an EORI number and to complete the relevant customs declarations.  Businesses will also need to decide whether to complete these declarations in-house or use a customs agent.  To help to build businesses' in-house capacity in the area of customer familiarisation, one of the measures associated with the July stimulus included a ready-for-customs grant, available through Enterprise Ireland.  Under this grant, businesses can claim up to &euro;9,000 per eligible employee hired or redeployed to a dedicated customs role within a business.<\/p> <p>Once again, I urge businesses to look into what supports are available.  Skillnet Ireland's FREE Clear Customs training and Clear Customs Online 2020 are accepting applications for their online training courses, which are free and available 24-7.  The local enterprise offices are also holding a one-day Prepare Your Business for Customs workshop throughout the country, while Enterprise Ireland also has a customs insight online course available.  I am concerned with the low take-up of some of these supports and I have raised these concerns with employer representative groups.  We must continue to raise awareness of the supports to enable businesses to avail of them, particularly small businesses who are unaware of them.  <\/p> <p> Beyond customs supports there are numerous initiatives available from Government to help businesses get Brexit-ready, ranging from vouchers and financial supports to consultancy, mentoring and advice.  These are offered through agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise offices and InterTradeIreland.  Those starting their Brexit preparations should consider Enterprise Ireland's Brexit-readiness checker or the Brexit planning voucher to seek professional advice on how best to plan and get ready for Brexit.  There are many other supports under consideration.  For more substantial financial supports, business should consider the Brexit loan scheme and the future growth loan scheme, which offer short to long-term loan facilities.  Microfinance Ireland is also an option for micro-enterprises.  We know that Brexit will bring many changes.  Addressing these changes may seem daunting and overwhelming in equal measure but Government is here to help and steer business in the right direction.  <\/p> <p> While we are aware of all of the challenges of Brexit, we must also use this time to look at the opportunities to diversify our market reach through its existing free trade arrangements and work with the new Commissioner for Trade on building a new roadmap for EU trade.  There is huge benefit in being an EU member.  We need to leverage all of the advantage that we have.  Trade in this country has taken a battering over the last number of months.  It is essential for the country as we move forward.  As Minister of State with responsibility for trade promotion I reiterate the need to look to 2021 as the year we can expand our global footprint, encourage businesses that are trading currently to expand and scale-up and to encourage new businesses to trade internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700061#PPP00200","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602096600,"counter":352,"content":"<p>May I comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700062#QQQ00200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1602096600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700062#QQQ00300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1602096600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>The Minister of State said in his statement that there are 20 plus sailings per week from Dublin.

Regulators can impose a range of sanctions on a practitioner following a fitness to practise inquiry.  The most serious of these include cancelling a person's registration, suspending the registration for a period of time or attachment of conditions to a person's practice.  Before these sanctions take effect they must be confirmed by the High Court.  Regulators can also choose to impose minor sanctions such as advice, admonish and censure.  Currently, these minor sanctions do not require a High Court confirmation but cannot be appealed to the court.  The Bill changes this such that any sanction can now be appealed to the courts.  The Bill, as initiated, introduced amendments to the five Acts to provide that the minor sanctions would in future require High Court confirmation before taking effect.  Concerns were expressed in this House at the earlier Stages of the Bill that this measure would impose an unnecessary additional cost, would delay the finalisation of proceedings and may bring an additional degree of publicity to registrants on whom the most minor of sanctions were being imposed.  Having reviewed the matter and consulted with stakeholders, the Minister introduced these Seanad amendments to the Bill, which remove the proposed requirement for a High Court confirmation of the minor sanctions.  This was welcomed by Senators across the House.  The Bill, of course, continues to provide the new right of appeal for minor sanctions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700062#QQQ01900","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602096600,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602096600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 5.<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602096600,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":372,"content":"<p>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/p><p>Seanad amendment No. 6:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 7:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1602097200,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I propose to take amendments Nos. 7, 19, 27, 50 and 61 together.<\/p>  <p>  As with the previous amendments, these relate to the treatment of the minor sanctions of advice, admonish and censure.

Colleagues in both Houses expressed concern that this measure would have a disproportionate impact on those receiving minor sanctions.  Following consultation with the regulators and representative bodies, it was agreed that the publication of minor sanctions will instead be subject to a public interest test to be applied by the regulator.  This will allow regulators to exercise discretion and only publish information relating to minor sanctions where they are satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so.

They relate to section 29 of the Bill, which amends the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 to allow a small cohort of practitioners to apply for registration with the Physiotherapists Registration Board.  The Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il amends the 2005 Act in two ways.  It deletes a restrictive date requirement for receipt of a particular qualification and, consequently, extends the time allowed for persons to apply for registration with this board from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2021.  However, as currently drafted, extending the registration window from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2021 was dependent on the Bill being enacted before the end of 2019.  This did not happen and the registration window closed on 31 December 2019.<\/p>  <p>  If the Bill is enacted as currently drafted, it will incorrectly imply that the registration window has remained open.  Accordingly, the amendment proposed here is a corrective measure.  It addresses the fact that there is now a period when a cohort of applicants is unable to apply for registration with the Physiotherapists Registration Board.  It also allows applications which were received by Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU, prior to 31 December 2019 but where no decision has been reached by the board on them to be considered as valid applications, removing the need for an applicant to make a second application.  Furthermore, it extends the window of registration for qualifying applicants from the date of the commencement of the Bill until 30 June 2022, which I trust will provide adequate time for these applicants to avail themselves of these registration provisions.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment also clarifies that any application received during the current period when the application window is closed, that is, between 31 December 2019 and the commencement of the relevant section in the Bill, is not to be considered by the registration board, although it is open to any applicant to reapply when the application window reopens.  Finally, the amendment also provides that applicants seeking registration under this provision will be required to comply with return-to-practise by-laws in the same way as is required for other applicants for registration on the Physiotherapists Registration Board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700063#RRR01300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 12:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 13:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 14:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 15:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":394,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 16:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":395,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":396,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 17:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":397,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 18:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 19:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 20:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 21:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":406,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 22:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097200,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 23:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1602097200,"counter":409,"content":"<p>This amendment relates to pharmaceutical assistants and was proposed and supported by a number of Senators.

The Bill inserts a new subsection (15)(c) into section 20 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  This section deals with the membership, functions and procedures of committees of council and subcommittees of committees.  The new subsection (15)(c) provides that subcommittees of the fitness to practise committee may perform any of the functions of that committee as if it were the fitness to practise committee.  However, section 11 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, which sets out the power of the Medical Council to make rules, does not reflect the breadth of functions intended by the new subsection (15)(c).  The Committee Stage amendment in the Seanad replaces the wording \"different grounds founding a complaint\" with \"complaints referred to that Committee\", which ensures that the regulator's powers to make rules for committee are consistent with the functions that are assigned to those committees.

This amendment, recommended by the Office of the Attorney General, makes clear that a person, irrespective of whether they are a medical practitioner, is not unlawfully practising medicine when carrying out tasks in the context of the other specified health profession and so they are not contravening section 37 of the Medical Practitioners Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700064#SSS01000","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 37:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 38:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":445,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 39:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":446,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":447,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 40:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 41:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":450,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 42:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 43:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 44:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":457,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 45:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 46:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 47:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 48:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":464,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 49:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":467,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 50:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 51:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1602097800,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I propose to discuss Seanad amendments Nos. 51, 52 and 62 together.<\/p>  <p>  Sections 88 and 89 of the Medical Practitioners Act set out the duty of the Medical Council in respect of education and training for medical qualifications.  They require the Medical Council to approve programmes of training and the bodies which deliver the training.  However, while the Act is explicit that the council may refuse to approve a body as a body which may deliver undergraduate or postgraduate training programmes, the Act does not explicitly provide for the council to refuse to approve an individual training programme.  A similar issue arises in section 85 of the Nurses and Midwives Act in respect of the training of nurses and midwives.  This is problematic for both regulators in that while they can attach conditions to a programme, they do not have the express power to refuse to approve a training programme which does not meet the required standard.  Both the Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland have identified this as a weakness to their respective Acts and accordingly these technical amendments give both regulators the express power to refuse to approve training programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700064#SSS04200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 52:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 53:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 54:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 55:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":480,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 56:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":481,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 57:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 58:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 59:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":487,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 60:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 61:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 62:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 63:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1602097800,"counter":495,"content":"<p>The Bill, as passed by this House, amends the Health Act 2004 to give the Minister for Health the power to designate the HSE as the competent authority to compare the equivalence of non-Irish qualifications with the qualifications assessed for certain health professions.  These are professions which are not regulated on a statutory basis but which are regulated for the purpose of the EU professional qualification directive and for which the Minister is currently the competent authority.  Concerns were raised on Committee Stage in the Seanad on behalf of the Environmental Health Association of Ireland regarding the HSE being the competent authority for environmental health officers, EHOs, one of the professions for which the HSE would become competent authority if so designated.  I understand that the Environmental Health Association of Ireland believes this would be a conflict of interest if the HSE were to act as both employer and deciding body in respect of qualification recognition.  The association is also concerned about the appropriateness of the HSE acting as competent authority for environmental health officers when the executive is not the exclusive employer of the EHOs, with many employed outside the health sector including, for example, by local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Department received advice from the Office of the Attorney General on how to eliminate any potential conflict of interest arising in respect of the HSE undertaking the dual role of employer and competent authority.  However, the Minister recognises the concerns raised by the Environmental Health Association of Ireland and these will need to be reviewed and fully considered by officials.  Until such time as these can be fully considered, the Minister is satisfied that it is appropriate and safe for the status quo to remain and it is proposed, therefore, to remove this provision from the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700064#SSS06700","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Seanad amendments reported.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1602097800,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Agreement to the Seanad amendments is reported to the Houses and a message will be sent to Seanad &Eacute;ireann acquainting it accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700064#SSS07000","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602097800,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 9.18 p.m. and resumed at 9.48 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Dying with Dignity Bill 2020: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1602098400,"counter":500,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100700065#UUU00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602098400,"counter":501,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Gino Kenny on Thursday, 1 October 2020:\r\n\r\nThat the Bill be now read a Second Time.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602098400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1602098700,"counter":503,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 is in the names of the Ministers for Health and Justice and Equality.
