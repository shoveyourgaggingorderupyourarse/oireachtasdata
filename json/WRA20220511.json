It has been approved by the European Commission on the basis that it will be used by viable businesses for working capital\/liquidity requirements and investment purposes to meet the challenge of a changed working environment arising from COVID-19.  <\/p><p>The CCGS was developed as a time-bound loan scheme with a state guarantee to provide loans to meet working capital and liquidity requirements.  Loans can also be used for investment purposes as businesses deal with a changing working environment as a consequence of the pandemic.  Typically loans for investment purposes relate to purchasing new equipment, a refit of premises or investment in a new product or process. <\/p><p>The scheme is available to a wide range of sectors with a small number of exceptions which includes the financing of real estate activity.

In negotiations with the Commission, the Government sought the inclusion of much more of the country. We will do so again at the mid-term review in 2023 when the data from the census is available. <\/p>  <p>  Regional Aid does not involve any European money or grants and should not be confused with structural funds which Ireland qualified for in the past. Rather it delineates the areas where Regional Aid can be granted by the Irish exchequer, based on specified criteria.<\/p>  <p>  The Regional Aid Map for every Member State must be developed within the criteria laid down in the European Commission&rsquo;s Regional Aid Guidelines, issued in April 2021. Ireland&rsquo;s economy has shown strength and improvement since 2014.  As a consequence, the European Commission proposed to reduce the overall coverage of Ireland&rsquo;s Map, as a proportion of total population, to 25.6%. Following intensive negotiations with the Commission, this was increased to 35.9%.  This is a reduction of almost one third from the 51.3% which applied previously.  This adjustment was part of a European wide review and Ireland was not unique in facing a reduction in coverage. With a more limited population coverage, and the strict criteria set by the Commission, it was important that the optimal allocation was achieved.<\/p>  <p>  To achieve this, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, working with stakeholders, including Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, developed a multi-dimensional model that provided a depth of analysis within the Commission&rsquo;s set criteria.  This was an objective and impartial approach, though final approval of the Map, for Ireland and for all Member States, rests with the European Commission. The Commission announced its decision on 22 March 2022.<\/p>  <p>  To meet the Commission&rsquo;s current criteria for inclusion on the Regional Aid Map, the area must be in a NUTS 2 or NUTS 3 region that has a GDP per capita below or equal to the EU-27 average, or an unemployment rate above or equal to 115 % of the national average. Under European law, Athy is the in Mid-East NUTS 3 Region, alongside Wicklow, Meath and Louth, which does not meet this criterion. <\/p>  <p>  Alternatively, an area could form part of a contiguous area that is proven to be undergoing major structural change or in serious relative decline. A contiguous area cannot be formed by areas selected based on different criteria of paragraph 175 of the Regional Aid Guidelines; the entirety of a contiguous area must be proposed and justified under a common criterion.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, Athy Municipal District could not be assessed independently from the surrounding area. The Commission&rsquo;s criteria are assessed at NUTS level and apply only to contiguous areas. Therefore, some Municipal Districts with specific challenges, may appear to be eligible, but they do not meet the criteria.<\/p>  <p>  LEAs not included on the map can still access all other types of State Aid. Only approximately 7.4% of Ireland&rsquo;s State Aid is in the form of Regional Aid and other aid remains available to enterprises, irrespective of their location. For example, enterprises in Athy LEA and other areas not included on the Regional Aid Map may still avail of Research, Development and Innovation Aid, Environmental Aid, Training Aid, and Consultancy Aid, under the General Block Exemption Regulation.  Aid under the De Minimis Regulation, i.e., aid to an undertaking of less than &euro;200,000 in any rolling 3-year period, offers a further avenue, particularly for smaller sized grants and investments to small enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  While the Regional Aid Map coverage has reduced, Enterprise Ireland offers are still available to SMEs in all areas of the country, including Athy. Measures include:<\/p>  <p>  -  the Capital Investment Initiative (CII) Fund.<\/p>  <p>  -  the Job Expansion Fund (JEF); and<\/p>  <p>  -  tailored expansion projects (i.e., Company Development).<\/p>  <p>  As a result, the ability of SMEs in Athy Municipal District to avail of capital and employment support from Enterprise Ireland has not changed.<\/p>  <p>  In March, we launched the Mid-East Regional Enterprise Plan (REP) to 2024. The REP brings together the three counties of Kildare, Wicklow and Meath, to work together with all the business development agencies, LEOs, local authorities, education systems and chambers of commerce.

This will also allow the Central Bank to collect data on the size of that market.<\/p>  <p>  This will also allow the Central Bank to apply the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (and any other relevant code, or any relevant regulation or direction the Central Bank may make under the Central Bank Acts) to such credit providers.

The Notice of Intention is available to view on the consumer protection section of the Central Bank&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to reporting to the central credit register (CCR), the provisions relating to the operation of the CCR are governed by the Credit Reporting Act 2013 and, under those provisions, lenders are obliged to submit information to the CCR on a credit agreement or loan for &euro;500 or more and are obliged to enquire on the CCR when considering loan applications of &euro;2,000 or more.  These requirements apply to any type of credit, irrespective of the terminology of the particular credit, which falls within the scope of the Credit Reporting Act.  <\/p>  <p>  The increased regulation of the credit market will enhance the level of consumer protection associated with the provision of credit and will over time facilitate the increased monitoring of the operation and level of the market for indirect credit. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission ('CCPC'), which is under the remit of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, published consumer advice on 'Buy Now Pay Later' credit agreements in December 2021.

The RTB, receives information from different sources regarding whether a tenancy is registered or not, including local authorities, members of the public, RTB checks and follow-ups and the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  The RTB has a dedicated Investigations and Sanctions unit to investigate certain potential breaches of rental law by a landlord referred to as improper conduct under Schedule 2 to the RTA, one of which is a failure to register a tenancy with the RTB within one month of the tenancy commencing. The Investigations and Sanctions Unit can initiate an investigation either as a result of information received from members of the public or as a result of information gathered from records that the RTB has access to under the RTA.  If a landlord is found to have engaged in improper conduct, a sanction may be imposed on them by an independent decision maker which may comprise one or all of the following - a written caution,  a financial penalty of up to &euro;15,000 and a payment of up to &euro;15,000 in respect of related RTB investigation costs.<\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the RTB is fully resourced to deliver on its ever increasing mandate, I secured &euro;11 million current funding for the RTB&rsquo;s operational costs in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The RTB received sanction for an additional 41 staff since 2019 to ensure that its enhanced powers and the new legislative provisions are fully implemented and enforced. The authorised staff complement for the RTB is now 106.4 Whole Time Equivalents.<\/p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, The Government will also facilitate increased enforcement of registration of tenancy requirements. Enforcement will be generally enhanced through measures such as the expansion of data-sharing arrangements between the Revenue Commissioners and the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to assist in enforcement of residential tenancy obligations.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with the RTB to guarantee that it has the funds and staffing that is required to carry out its role as a regulator of the rental sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100063#WRD05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100064#WRE00300"},{"type":"question","counter":191,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[23639\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100064#WRE00350","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount of funding allocated and drawn down by Kildare County Council for re-let works on council properties for each of the years from 2018 to 2021 and date in 2022, in tabular form.","asker":"1588","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[23640\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100064#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the funding deficit for 2022 in relation to local authority property re-let works in County Kildare; if his Department is planning to provide increased funding to Kildare County Council to deal with this shortfall; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 113 together.<\/p>  <p>  The management and maintenance of local authority housing stock, including pre-letting repairs to vacant properties, the implementation of a planned maintenance programme and carrying out of responsive repairs, are matters for each individual local authority under Section 58 of the Housing Act 1966.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities also have a legal obligation to ensure that all of their tenanted properties are compliant with the provisions of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations, 2019.

The Directive requires projects listed in Annex I of the Directive to be subject to mandatory EIA and provides that Member States may determine whether projects listed in Annex II of the Directive shall be subject to EIA. Solar farm developments are not listed in either Annex I or II of the EIA Directive.<\/p>  <p>  Projects requiring an EIA by a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la (the Board), as appropriate, in respect of an application for planning consent are listed in Part 1 and Part 2 of Schedule 5 of the Planning and Developments Regulations 2001 (the Regulations), which transpose the list of projects in Annex I and II of the EIA Directive into planning legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Proposals for individual renewable energy development projects may be subject to EIA as part of the planning process.  Part 2 of Schedule 5 of the Regulations includes certain renewable energy development projects, such as wind energy and, in accordance with the Directive, certain thresholds have been set below which certain developments need not necessarily be subject to EIA. EIA is also required in the consideration of planning applications, other than in the circumstances referred to above, where a development that is under the threshold in Part 2 of Schedule 5 of the Regulations (sub-threshold development) is likely to have significant effects on the environment, having regard to the criteria set out in Schedule 7 of the Regulations. Schedule 7 criteria include assessment of the characteristics of the proposed sub-threshold development having regard to its size, its cumulation with other development, pollution and nuisances, and the risk of accidents as well as the location of the proposed development having regard to the existing land use, the environmental sensitivity of the geographical area and the absorption capacity of the natural environment in the area of the proposed development.<\/p>  <p>  Two High Court judgments issued on separate judicial review cases in 2020, provide further clarification on the scope of the EIA Directive as it applies to solar farm developments. The judicial review case references are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  1. Sweetman v. An Bord Plean&aacute;la &amp;amp; Ors [2020] IEHC 39 Judgment delivered by Mr. Justice McDonald on 31 January 2020 <\/p>  <p>  2. Kavanagh v. An Bord Plean&aacute;la &amp;amp; Ors [2020] IEHC 259 Judgment delivered by Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Moore on 29 May 2020<\/p>  <p>  The implications of the two judgments are of significance in that they affirm the understanding that solar farm developments of the nature of those the subject matter of these judicial reviews do not fall within the classes of projects in either Part 1 or Part 2 of Schedule 5 to Regulations that transpose the Annex I and II of the Directive.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is not necessarily the case that solar farm projects could never require EIA. Circumstances may arise in which a solar farm project may be subject to a requirement for EIA if, for example, one or more aspects of the project potentially comes within the scope of any of the project classes listed in Annex I or Annex II of the Directive and consequently, Part 1 and Part 2 of Schedule 5 to the Regulations, also noting the criteria for sub-threshold development as set out in Schedule 7 of the Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  It would be a matter for a Planning Authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la to assess a planning application for a solar farm development in accordance with the requirements of the EIA Directive, as transposed in the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Regulations, and to determine if an EIA is required or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100064#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":204,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100064#WRE01600"},{"type":"question","counter":205,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[23725\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100064#WRE01700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of HAP properties;

One such programme that AHBs progress projects through is the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF).<\/p>  <p>  CALF funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units.  This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount. Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority.

Since June 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service.<\/p><p>In addition to this, and to complement staffing recruitment through the Public Appointments Service, the Passport Service is running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers with a view to assigning additional staff and to maintain staffing levels throughout the year to meet the demand expected in the coming months. This competition is currently underway and once completed, will see staffing numbers of over 900 at the Passport Service, which represents a doubling of staff numbers since last summer.<\/p><p>In April, the volume of queries to the Oireachtas line increased by 20% to over 3,300 cases. An average of 66 members of the Oireachtas called the line each day in April. Each call can handle up to 5 queries.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is developing an online portal that will allow Oireachtas Members to query the status of passport applications on behalf of their constituents. <\/p><p>The testing element of this project is yet to be completed. Once the online portal is finalised, the Passport Service expects to roll it out over the summer of this year. <\/p><p>Passport applicants can also track the status of their passport application online via the Passport Tracker which is available on my Department's website - <i>www.dfa.ie\/passporttracking\/<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100065#WRF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":259,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[23542\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100065#WRF02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if passports will issue for children (details supplied) in County Donegal in time for intended travel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[23578\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100065#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will ensure that passport applications by persons (details supplied) will be processed urgently by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1620","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[23607\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100065#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if a passport will be processed on time for a child (details supplied) in order that they can travel with their family; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":262,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[23846\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100065#WRF02300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the passport for a person (details supplied) will be expedited.","asker":"1568","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":263,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 140, 142 and 154 together.<\/p><p>With regard to the specific applications about which the Deputies have enquired, the Passport Service has provided an update on the status of the passport applications to the applicants. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100065#WRF02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":264,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100065#WRF02500"},{"type":"question","counter":265,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[23557\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100065#WRF02600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will condemn comments from United States officials which refused to rule out military action against the Solomon Islands; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1522","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":266,"content":"<p>As a small island, Ireland recognises the challenges that many island nations face.

Passport applications from all citizens - whether at home or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices, on the basis of the type of application rather than county or country of residence of the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  Over 90% of all passport applications, including first time applications, are now being made through Passport Online. The Passport Service is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including an offline service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use the Passport Online service.<\/p>  <p>  Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.<\/p>  <p>  The paper-based, mail-in \"Passport Express\" service is available to citizens at almost 1,000 An Post post offices and at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and Passport Express very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport.<\/p>  <p>  In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an Urgent Appointment service for passport renewal with a 1 or 4-day turnaround.

This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers to over 900, which represents a doubling of staff compared to June 2021.<\/p><p>- Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.<\/p><p>- The Passport Service is prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. Passport Service staff are working targeted overtime in this regard.<\/p><p>- The Urgent Appointment Service is available for customers who wish to renew their passport at short notice. Customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin, within 4 days in Cork and within 5 days in London.<\/p><p>- In February, the Passport Service increased the number of appointments at its public offices by 100%, providing an extra 170 Urgent Appointments per week.<\/p><p>- A new document management system was put in place at the beginning of March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the Passport Service offices, and subsequent turnaround times for the applicant. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are being prioritised and complete applications can then be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants.<\/p><p>- Public information media campaigns reminding citizens to check and renew their passports will continue during this busy year.<\/p><p>- There is an updated Department of Foreign Affairs website, which includes a new passport service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application.<\/p><p>- The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly.<\/p><p>I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p><p>I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined as follows in tabular form.<\/p><p>The table also breaks down the number of applications from each county that are currently being processed by the Passport Service and the number of applications from each county that require further action from the applicant, such as the submission of additional documentation. <table>    <tr>       <th>County <\/th>       <th>Total applications in system<\/th>       <th>Passport Service processing<\/th>       <th>Further action required by applicant<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare <\/td>       <td>4,343 <\/td>       <td>2,603<\/td>       <td>1,740<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois <\/td>       <td>1,366 <\/td>       <td>811<\/td>       <td>555<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly <\/td>       <td>1,199 <\/td>       <td>710<\/td>       <td>489<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100065#WRF04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":282,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100065#WRF04800"},{"type":"question","counter":283,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[23620\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100065#WRF04900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps that will be taken in 2022 and 2023 to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s network of embassies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":284,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s Global Ireland programme, launched in 2018, envisages an expanded and strengthened diplomatic presence across the world, with a target of opening of 26 new Missions in the period to 2025.

The timing and context of any such decision would affect whether such a loss of influence would be matched by a commensurate benefit for the Palestinian people and a positive impact on the peace process and a two-State solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100066#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":295,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100066#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[23630\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100066#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on recent discussions he has had regarding the proposed convention on the rights of older persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":297,"content":"<p>Ireland is committed to strengthening the protection of the human rights of older persons and to promoting a better mainstreaming of the human rights of older persons through the work of the UN. <\/p>  <p>  We engage with the Open Ended Working Group on Aging through the European Union, in partnership with fellow EU Member States.

In order to protect the integrity of the Irish passport and also the rights of parents or guardians and children, it is important that forms are correctly completed and verified by the Passport Service by calling the Garda station to confirm the Garda's signature.<\/p>  <p>  It is stated in a note to the witness on the Identity and Consent forms that they may be contacted to confirm the validity of their signature. It is the responsibility of the witnessing Garda to ensure that the signature is correctly recorded in the logbook, so that when the Passport Service calls at a later date the signature can be verified.<\/p>  <p>  There are a small number of cases where the Passport Service has difficulty contacting a Garda station in order to verify the Garda's signature. Whilst the Passport Service makes every effort to contact the Garda station in these cases, unfortunately, the passport application may be delayed. In some cases, the applicant may be requested to submit a new witnessed form where the Passport Service has been unable to contact the Garda station. A new document management system that was put in place at the beginning of March is ensuring that these applications which require further documents are being turned around within 15 working days of receipt of the additional documents.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is continuously looking at ways to make the application process easier for child applicants and advises during the online application process to make sure that the consent form is correctly witnessed once they have completed the online process. It is not the experience of the Passport Service that contacting part-time garda stations to verify witnesses is a widespread issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service provides instructions on how to correctly complete these forms on the Department's website dfa.ie\/passports\/how-to-get-your-application-witnessed\/).<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly.

This advertisement includes the information that Passport Service will ring the Garda station to verify all first time passport applicants&rsquo; consent form details.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service takes its responsibility to protect the integrity of the Irish passport very seriously. The Irish passport has a strong international reputation due to the strength of the security features within the passport book and the robust processes involved in its issuance. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to amend the process for the witnessing of Identity and Consent forms by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100066#WRG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Birth Registration","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100066#WRG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[23713\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100066#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive a decision on their Irish citizenship application which was submitted in April 2020.","asker":"1547","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>My Department is responsible for citizenship by descent through the Foreign Births Register under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  The processing of Foreign Birth Registration has resumed and will be gradually scaling up in line with the recruitment of additional resources.

Any provision to extend the programme to the newly added schools to the DEIS programme will need to be considered as part of the budgetary process. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100068#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":403,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100068#WRJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":404,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[23579\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100068#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if an application by a person (details supplied) will be expedited; and if she will provide an update on this matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":405,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the Department received an application for disability allowance (DA) from this person on 30 March 2022.  <\/p><p>On 6 May 2022 the person concerned was requested to supply supporting documentation required by the deciding officer in order to make a decision on their eligibility.

On 6 December 2021, the South Leinster CIS Regional Manager on behalf of the Board informed CIB that they had made the decision to discontinue services in their Wicklow town office due to health and safety concerns. The Board had undertaken an internal assessment of the premises and identified that they were unsuitable under a number of areas, including the issue of lone working.

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work. <\/p>  <p>  In March 2020, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to Illness Benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19. <\/p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate of illness benefit, for a limited period.  The enhanced rate is &euro;350, with additional payments in respect of dependent adults and children. Over 578,000 claims had been processed by 6 May 2022 &ndash; of those, 55% were diagnosed with Covid, 41% were a probable risk of Covid and 3% had made former Covid-19 claims.

In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility. <\/p>  <p>  After this time, doctors should certify people according to the primary reason for incapacity for work &ndash; this varies greatly among people experiencing long-Covid and may include a wide range of physical and mental health conditions.

It is not possible to state how many people have long-Covid.  By way of illustration,  a person experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder following a period in intensive care may be certified by their doctor for PTSD rather than for Covid-19.

Under the new funding stream, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase, providers will be supported in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures. <\/p><p>It is important to support services with staff costs, which comprise approximately 70% of a service's operating costs. In this respect, Core Funding includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million) and for administrative staff\/time (&euro;25 million). Employer costs are factored in to the staff costs allocation in Core Funding. A further &euro;38 million will be distributed in line with ELC graduate qualifications of ELC Lead Educators and Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. <\/p><p>Core Funding will also make a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (for example, utilities, rent) that make up the remaining 30% of providers costs. In a full year, there is an allocation of &euro;20 million for a contribution to non-staff overhead costs through Core Funding. This includes an increase since the original allocation was announced in the budget.<\/p><p>The significant majority of ELC and SAC services will see substantial increases in income through Core Funding. It is important to state that no service will lose out because of Core Funding.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 also announced that the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) would continue to be available to the ELC and SAC sector.

The main conditionality of access to the Transition Fund will be that services do not increase the fees charged to parents above September 2021 levels.

Core Funding aims to facilitate a new partnership between providers and the State that reflects the importance of ELC and SAC for the public good. This new approach will offer better financial sustainability to providers in the context of this shift to a partnership relationship between providers and the State. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has been strongly supportive of the sector, particularly since the onset of Covid-19.\u00a0 Substantial additional supports have been provided to allow services to operate sustainably throughout the pandemic, acknowledging that there were higher delivery costs and extra practical and financial challenges to be met. One of the objectives of these supports was to ensure that the higher costs were not passed on to parents, either directly or indirectly.<\/p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) was a special measure that was in place to support employers with the impact of Covid-19 pandemic. Between October 2020 and January 2022, the enhanced rate of EWSS equalled &euro;34 million per month for ELC and SAC employers, covering, on average, 80% staff costs or 50% total operating costs. From 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week applied; amounting to &euro;22 million per month for ELC and SAC employers, covering, on average, 50% staff costs or 38% total operating costs. For March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week applied and the scheme ended on 30 April 2022; this amounted to &euro;11 million per month in the sector, and covered, on average, 25% staff costs or 11% total operating costs. <\/p>  <p>  Between the end of the EWSS and the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund will be in place to support providers. The main conditionality of access to the Transition Fund will be that services do not increase the fees charged to parents above September 2021 levels.<\/p>  <p>  From September 2022, Core Funding will be introduced. Under Core Funding, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase, providers will be supported in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures. Fee management\u00a0will start with the requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels to access Core Funding. This feature of the scheme will ensure that parents feel the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.<\/p>  <p>  The allocation of funding for Core Funding will be based largely on a service's capacity. By basing the funding stream on capacity, providers will have a stable income source based on the service they deliver. Higher levels of funding will be available for capacity for younger children, to support the higher operating costs for these children arising from the higher staff ratio requirements. The significant majority of ELC and SAC services will see substantial increases in income through Core Funding. It is important to state that no service will lose out because of Core Funding.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of fee management measures is one of the recommendations contained in the Expert Group report,\u00a0Partnership for the Public Good:\u00a0A\u00a0New Funding Model for Early\u00a0Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, as approved by Government. <\/p>  <p>  Sustainability Funding also continues to be available to providers where there are sustainability difficulties and I have requested that providers would exhaust this route before considering increases in fees for parents. Providers facing sustainability challenges should contact their local City\/County Childcare Committee.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to qualifications and quality, First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families, recognises that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality early learning and care for children. Evidence indicates that children achieve better outcomes when staff are well qualified. First 5 seeks to continue to build an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce, and includes a commitment to achieve a graduate-led workforce by 2028, with the aim that all room leaders, assistant managers and managers would hold a relevant degree by 2028. <\/p>  <p>  Core Funding has a number of objectives, including to support improved quality, affordability, sustainability and the achievement of the commitment to a graduate-led workforce. Of the total of &euro;221m in full year costs for Core Funding, &euro;38 million is allocated to support graduates to be Lead Educators and Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. <\/p>  <p>  In December last year, I launched Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028. Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In particular, Nurturing Skills commits to introducing a minimum qualification requirement for Managers of early learning and care (ELC) services by 2028 of a Level 6 qualification in early learning and care (ELC), with a target of all Managers having a level 7 (or higher) qualification in ELC.<\/p>  <p>  To support achievement of these commitments, Nurturing Skills also commits to the provision of funded places on flexible education programmes at levels 6 to 8 for current early years educators. This new funding will support upskilling and strengthen career development pathways for those working in the sector, reducing the cost to educators of undertaking further and higher education qualifications. The new funding scheme will also develop and introduce mechanisms for providing financial support to early learning and care services to help meet the costs of releasing staff to go on student practice placements and study leave. Plans for the new funding scheme are currently being developed. <\/p>  <p>  This planned new funding for educators and managers to upskill is in addition to financial supports that are currently in place for those undertaking qualifications. Existing financial supports include the Free Fees Initiative. My Department has since 2014 provided a number of rounds of funding for early years educators to undertake qualifications through the Learner Fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100069#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services","counter":454,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100069#WRK01100"},{"type":"question","counter":455,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[23581\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100069#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the options that are available to ensure that a child (details suppled) receives their ECCE year.","asker":"1485","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":456,"content":"<p>I am very concerned to hear that this family has been unable to secure an ECCE place for their child.<\/p>  <p>  First and foremost, I would strongly advise that the family contact the local CCC who can work with the family to try to \u00a0identify a provider who will\u00a0provide ECCE for\u00a0the child mentioned in your correspondence.

Services opening longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher. Greater levels of funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher than older children.<\/p><p><b>Table 1 Number of Providers in County Dublin<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>County<\/th>       <th>Total <br \/><br \/>2018\/2019<\/th>       <th>Total<br \/><br \/>2019\/2020<\/th>       <th>Total <br \/><br \/>2020\/2021<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin - Dublin City<\/td>       <td>445<\/td>       <td>450<\/td>       <td>432<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin - D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown<\/td>       <td>185<\/td>       <td>187<\/td>       <td>178<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin - Fingal<\/td>       <td>326<\/td>       <td>322<\/td>       <td>303<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin - South Dublin<\/td>       <td>255<\/td>       <td>259<\/td>       <td>237<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <b><\/b><\/p><p><b>Table 2 Vacant Places in County Dublin<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>County<\/th>       <th>Vacant places <br \/><br \/>&amp;amp;Vacancy rate<br \/><br \/>2017\/2018<\/th>       <th>Vacant places &amp;amp; Vacancy Rate<br \/><br \/>2018\/2019<\/th>       <th>Vacant places<br \/><br \/>2019\/2020 &amp;amp; Vacancy Rate *<br \/><br \/><\/th>       <th>Vacant places<br \/><br \/>2020\/2021&amp;amp; Vacancy Rate<br \/><br \/>**<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin - Dublin City<\/td>       <td>581<br \/><br \/>(4%)<\/td>       <td>627<br \/><br \/>(4%)<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>       <td>1,662<br \/><br \/>(20%)<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin - D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown<\/td>       <td>224<br \/><br \/>(4%)<\/td>       <td>173<br \/><br \/>(2%)<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>       <td>403<br \/><br \/>(11%)<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin - Fingal<\/td>       <td>450<br \/><br \/>(4%)<\/td>       <td>536<br \/><br \/>(5%)<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>       <td>1,176<br \/><br \/>(20%)<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin - South Dublin<\/td>       <td>373<br \/><br \/>(4%)<\/td>       <td>424<br \/><br \/>(5%)<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>       <td>983<br \/><br \/>(18%)<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>*Due to the impact of COVID-19 no data is available for 2019\/2020<\/p><p>** 2020\/21 figures carry higher margins of errors due to extrapolation based on reduced response rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100069#WRK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Support Services","counter":469,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100069#WRK02800"},{"type":"question","counter":470,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[23843\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100069#WRK03000","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of international protection applicants deemed vulnerable since the commencement of the pilot project; the most common vulnerabilities identified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":471,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[23844\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100069#WRK03100","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of persons who have been invited to undertake a vulnerability assessment since December 2020; the number of persons who have subsequently undergone the substantive assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":472,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[23845\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100069#WRK03150","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"when the vulnerability assessment pilot ended; if the evaluation will involve external stakeholders such as residents and NGOs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":473,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 to 212, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The vulnerability assessment pilot programme is still ongoing.

It examines the prevalence and trends of overweight and obesity among adults and children in the WHO European Region between 1975 and 2016.  The report finds that levels of obesity in the region have increased by 138% in that period, and the levels of overweight (including obesity) by 51%.  It notes that &ldquo;Alarmingly, there have been consistent increases in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the WHO European Region and no Member State is on track to reach the target of halting the rise in obesity by 2025&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The Healthy Ireland Survey 2019 (representative of the population of those aged 15 and over), and the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative for children, indicate that the levels of obesity in Ireland have been stabilising, albeit at too high a level. The HI Survey 2019 reports that 23% of Irish people aged 15 and over are obese, with a further 37% being overweight, which are the same percentage as in the 2015 study.  However, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on obesity levels is not yet reflected in the official statistics, with the pandemic itself impacting on data collection in this area. <\/p>  <p>  Data for the current wave of the Healthy Ireland Survey is at present being collected and will include self reported weights and measures which will provide an indication of the long term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on overweight and obesity in Ireland. It is envisaged that the Report will be published in Q4, 2022<\/p>  <p>  The WHO report notes the complex and multifaceted nature of obesity, and that no single intervention can combat the rise in obesity rates.  It emphasises that efforts to prevent obesity need to consider the wider determinants of the disease.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a comprehensive, whole-of-government strategy in place to combat obesity.  &ldquo;A Healthy Weight for Ireland&rdquo;, the Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025 (OPAP). The Plan recognises the complex nature of obesity and that there is no one simple solution, and that every sector of society will need to play its part.  <\/p>  <p>  The OPAP prescribed the following short-term (five-year) targets for overweight and obesity: <\/p>  <p>  - a sustained downward trend (averaging 0.5% per annum as measured by the Healthy Ireland Survey) in the level of excess weight averaged across all adults; <\/p>  <p>  - a sustained downward trend [averaging 0.5% per annum as measured by the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative (COSI) in the level of excess weight in children, and <\/p>  <p>  - a reduction in the gap in obesity levels between the highest and lowest socioeconomic groups by 10%, as measured by the Healthy Ireland and COSI surveys. <\/p>  <p>  While the data in relation to the targets in the OPAP are not complete due to the data collection issues outlined above, it is unlikely that these targets have been met.  For this reason, there is a renewed focus on combatting obesity by this government, and a particular emphasis on addressing health inequalities in socio-economically disadvantaged areas.  <\/p>  <p>  The WHO Report makes a number of policy recommendations, many of which are already being either implemented or being examined under the Obesity Policy and Action Plan.  These include a sugar-sweetened drinks tax, which was implemented in Ireland in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also published a &ldquo;Roadmap for Food Product Reformulation in Ireland&rdquo; in December 2021, which is being implemented through a dedicated Food Reformulation Task Force in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, funded by the Department of Health through Healthy Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of obesity management and healthcare, the HSE Model of Care for the Management of Overweight and Obesity was launched in March 2021.  This sets out how healthcare for children, young people and adults living with overweight and obesity in Ireland should be organised and resourced now and into the future.<\/p>  <p>  To support and educate families about nutrition and healthier choices, particularly those from socio-economically disadvantaged areas, Healthy Ireland has funded the recruitment of 19 Community Food and Nutrition Officers as part of the Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Communities Programme, who will work within the 19 communities. <\/p>  <p>  Under the overall Healthy Ireland Framework and Healthy Ireland Strategic Action Plan, work is being advanced to address the social determinants under the Obesity Policy and Action Plan and the National Physical Activity plan, and through initiatives such as the Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Communities Programme.

Welcome improvements in health outcomes and extended life expectancy have changed our expectations for how older people should live within their communities. <\/p>  <p>  For the most part, older people clearly indicate their preference to live in their own homes and communities, for as long as possible. The Programme for Government 2020 commits to creating an Age Friendly Ireland, while Sl&aacute;intecare aims to provide the right care, in the right place, at the right time.  <\/p>  <p>  The provision of enhanced integrated health services in the community, with a focus on prevention and early intervention of chronic disease conditions, aims to support older people to live well at home and to reduce the likelihood of hospital admission and is a key priority for me.  <\/p>  <p>  Through the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2022 I have secured from government an overall budget for home support for older people of approximately &euro;670 million. In addition, &euro;195 million has been secured to enable the continued delivery of the Enhanced Community Care Programme across all Community Healthcare Organisations.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE &ndash; partnered by Age Friendly Ireland and ALONE &ndash; also provide complementary &ldquo;support coordination&rdquo; models to link older people with services such as befriending and signposting to local community groups. As highlighted by the Health and Housing joint policy statement, Housing Options for Our Ageing Population, these initiatives play an important role in connecting older people with their communities, reducing the poor outcomes associated with social isolation and helping them to access services that they need quickly and easily.  <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government agreed in 2020 commits the government to &lsquo;Introduce a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes, which will provide equitable access to high-quality, regulated home care, and I am keen to introduce this scheme as soon as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  Consequently, work is ongoing within my department to progress the development of the new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services. Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery  <\/p>  <p>  Access to day centres can make a very important contribution and provide invaluable support, advice and social interaction for older people, who may, for any number of reasons be experiencing isolation and loneliness. They play a key role in enabling older people to live independently in their own communities.  <\/p>  <p>  It remains my priority to ensure that day centres reopen as quickly and as safely as possible, following their necessary closure in 2020 in response to COVID-19. The process for reopening day centres commenced in 2021 and the HSE continues to actively work on their reopening for older people as a priority in line with current public health guidance. Currently 264 centres (80%) for older people have reopened. It is planned that a further 14 will open this month.  <\/p>  <p>  Although the direction for Government policy is to support individuals to remain in their homes, long-term residential care will continue to be necessary for some older people in order to meet their health care needs. The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, also known as the NHSS or &lsquo;Fair Deal&rsquo;, is the State&rsquo;s means-based system of financial support for people who are not in a position to pay privately for their long-term residential care. Its aim is to ensure that when residential care is necessary, it is accessible, affordable and regulated to provide a high quality of professional care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100071#WRM04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100071#WRM04700"},{"type":"question","counter":597,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[23642\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100071#WRM04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if any refugees are being housed or intended to be housed on properties in the ownership of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":598,"content":"<p>The responsibility of providing emergency accommodation for Ukrainian refugees and others seeking international protection rests with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH) is focusing on the medium and long-term accommodation challenges for persons arriving in Ireland as a result of the conflict in Ukraine.

More complicated cases require referral to Infectious Diseases clinics, which are currently present in all but one level 4 and all but two level 3 hospitals in Ireland.<\/p><p>The Infectious Disease clinical program, which has been in place for one year, has a workforce strategy to establish a network of Infectious Diseases clinics that will address any current geographic inequity. The publicly funded Infectious Diseases clinics all support the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines regarding the diagnoses and treatment of Lyme disease. These clinics do not currently have waiting lists and patients are seen in a timely manner.<\/p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) is Ireland's specialist agency for the surveillance of communicable diseases.  The HPSC provides guidance on protection against contracting Lyme disease and publishes significant amounts of information on its website - <i>hpsc.ie<\/i>- for the general public and health professionals.  <\/p><p>In relation to medical cards, under the Health Act 1970, eligibility for a medical card is based primarily on means. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.<\/p><p>The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.<\/p><p>However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100072#WRN02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":630,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100072#WRN02600"},{"type":"question","counter":631,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[23777\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100072#WRN02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department classifies Alzheimer's disease as an official disability as this would allow people to attain the rights and entitlements that being declared a disabled person would allow them to have; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":632,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive (HSE), funded by the Department of Health, provides and funds a range of services and supports for people with disabilities in order to empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.<\/p><p>These services include adult day services, respite, home support, personal assistant services, residential services and therapy services. <\/p><p>Access to services is provided for on the basis of individual need and not of any specific diagnosis. <\/p><p>I have asked to HSE to respond to directly to the Deputy with regard to pathways of care available for people with Alzheimer's disease, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100072#WRN02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wildlife Conservation","counter":633,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100072#WRN02900"},{"type":"question","counter":634,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[23858\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100072#WRN03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department and public bodies and agencies that operate under his remit have policies in place to install artificial structures that provide shelter and habitat space for wild species such as, but not limited to, insect hotels, bat boxes, nesting towers and beehives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":635,"content":"<p>My Department's 'Green Team' are in a continual process of investigating options to encourage biodiversity within Miesian Plaza.

As the Deputy will be aware, in Ireland, fishing quotas, including quotas for pelagic stocks such as Mackerel, are a public resource and are administered to provide for the proper management and conservation and rational exploitation of fishing stocks. It is worth noting that within the EU, most quota systems have been privatised for their main commercial stocks. In Ireland, allocations are not owned by the vessel and when an allocation is not fished, it cannot be transferred to another boat but is returned to the State for redistribution to the fleet in the normal way. The substantial advantage from a macro perspective of these arrangements is that it supports an Irish-owned and operated fleet which makes the bulk of its landings to Irish ports and bases its operations in Ireland. If the fleet were not Irish owned, there would likely be a rapid concentration of ownership in a small number of international companies which are not likely to operate from Ireland and may not have any commercial links with Ireland. The result of this long-standing policy is that the Irish fishing fleet involves a balanced spread of sizes and types of fishing vessels who have retained a strong economic link with our coastal communities and have delivered economic activity including vital employment in these communities, where there are  limited alternative economic activities.<\/p>  <p>  Atlantic Mackerel is a widely distributed, migratory pelagic fish that inhabits much of the north-eastern Atlantic shelf.  The setting of Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas each year for this stock is based on annual scientific advice by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) and given the international dimension of this stock, TACs are set within the relevant international fora.  <\/p>  <p>  Management arrangements for the State&rsquo;s fisheries, including the Mackerel fishery, have been set and developed over many years since the commencement of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the introduction of quotas.  Pelagic stocks such as Mackerel are managed on an annual or seasonal basis with catch limits set based on allocation regimes developed over many years and related to historical catch records. Amendments to the mackerel policy in 2010 and 2017 were introduced following a full review and public consultation. It should be noted that the 2017 policy is subject to a legal challenge in the Courts.  <\/p>  <p>  Consultation on the management of quotas within National Policy is carried out each month at the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC) meeting involving fishing industry representatives from the catching and processing sectors, the Department and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA). The QMAC operates by examining in detail the operation of each fishery, available quota and uptake patterns for the different metiers of fishing vessels. There are detailed discussions each month in respect of the various fisheries taking account of the divergent situation of the fleet and of the market. The purpose of these meetings is to make recommendations to me on the management of particular stocks within national policy and, as far as possible, I follow their recommendations, subject to the proper management and rational exploitation of our fisheries. Any issues relating to the management of the Mackerel quota allocation as set down in National Policy, where relevant, are discussed by the QMAC and recommendations are brought to my attention to inform my decision. <\/p>  <p>As recommended by the QMAC, National Policy for Quota Balancing has been put in place to support the landing obligation for both demersal and pelagic stocks including Mackerel. Quota balancing is a conservation measure that aids industry in matching available quota to actual catch so that incentives to discard are reduced.  Quota balancing by the Department operates independent of any action being considered or taken by the control authorities.   Where a vessel exceeds its catch limit, a balancing adjustment is made from future allocations of fishing opportunities. Furthermore, where a vessel has reported landings of a pelagic stock for which it does not hold a valid authorisation\/notification at the time of the fishing operation, such landings will be subject to quota balancing and a balancing adjustment is made from a future allocation of a fishing opportunity.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100073#WRO03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":695,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100073#WRO03700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":694,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100073#WRO03600"},{"type":"question","counter":695,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[23571\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051100073#WRO03700","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the reason that rural areas in north County Dublin are excluded from the local improvement scheme.","asker":"1467","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":696,"content":"<p>As part of Our Rural Future, the Government is committed to ensuring that the Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) is funded into the future.
