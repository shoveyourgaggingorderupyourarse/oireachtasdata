The survey also showed that 40% of households had to borrow money last year to pay household bills and almost one quarter of those had to resort to moneylenders.  People have been subjected to increases in the cost of school transport, carbon taxes and a whole raft of other costs, including an increase in the third level registration fee, which was not supposed to happen, according to a solemn pledge signed in full view of the nation on television.

What I said was that the sample number of cases, ten, out of a total of 89,000 was part of the organisation's caseload for the current period and very small.  They were particular cases in which Focus Point had dealt with individuals with problems.  None of the individuals included in the study was unable to access accommodation ultimately.  However, having looked at the cases included in the sample, I was surprised that two of the individuals were aged only 20 or under 20 years.  As the report did not go into their family histories, I am unaware of the particular problems.  However, I am concerned that young people of that age have left home.  I would like to see the emphasis in public policy on young people of that age being encouraged to remain at home with their families.  In addition, two of the cases concerned families, the members of which had described themselves as Travellers whom they felt suffered discrimination.  This, therefore, was not an issue of homelessness but another issue.<\/p><p>  All I am saying is that the sample chosen only amounted to ten cases.  The Department has settled 42,000 housing rent cases under the new arrangements this year.  The new rent levels are designed to ensure rents reflect what is considered to be an appropriate level to meet the circumstances of the family or individual involved.  It is important I ensure the Department which holds a share of approximately 30% of the private rental market does not drive up rents.  Some people in work, students and older people are renting and paying their own rent.  If the Department, as a large participant in the rental market, drives up rents, it will have consequences for people who are working, families paying for students going to college and older people paying their own rent.  Given the fallen values in the property market, the reductions sought in rent supplement which are extremely modest constitute an appropriate action.  The collapse in values in the property market ought to be reflected in lower rents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300007#E00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1352817000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>The Minister is in denial of the reality in the property market and the rental market, in particular, in this city, Cork and Galway, as seen in the <i>Daft.ie<\/i> rental report for the second quarter of this year.

I support a fail-safe mechanism which looks after young people who have left their homes for some reason, perhaps in the circumstances described by the Deputy.  That mechanism is also supported by the State.  As a matter of public policy, we should try to ensure as few people as possible experience the particular circumstances of leaving home.

It operates independently of the Department and the Minister.  The appeals process has a statutory basis in secondary legislation.  As appeals officers are quasi-judicial, they are required to be free and unrestricted in discharging their functions.  The high level of appeals allowed - 42% in 2011 - is evidence of the independence of the process.  Significant resources are being assigned to improve initial decision-making and thereby reduce the number of appeals.  A formal two week deciding officer training course was designed and launched in November 2011 for staff working in the areas of jobseekers' claims and decisions.  The course includes scheme conditions, legislation, best practice procedures and areas such as natural justice, good decision-making and proper customer service standards.  Initial work has started to develop further training for deciding officers in other scheme areas relating to decision-making, reviewing decisions and appeals submissions.<\/p><p>  As Deputies are aware, the rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals since 2009 has placed extraordinary pressure on the social welfare appeals office.  Significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving processing times for appellants.  For example, 15 additional appeals officers have been assigned, retired experienced officers were retained for 18 months ending in December 2011, business processes have been improved and a new operating model has been implemented.  As a result of these measures, there has been a significant increase in the number of finalised appeals, from an average of 13,500 some years ago to 34,027 in 2011.  Processing times were reduced by 10.2 weeks overall in the nine months to September 2012.  The oral hearing time is down by 12.5 weeks, while the summary decision time is up by 2.3 weeks.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>  I am advised by the chief appeals officer that eight very experienced retired appeals officers were retained from July 2010 until December 2011.  Their employment resulted in the front-loading of summary decisions during this period.  As a result, during 2010, a total of 11,985 cases, or 69%, were decided on a summary basis as against 5,514, or 31%, which were given following an oral hearing.  The corresponding figures for 2011 were 16,569, or 65%, and 8,821, or 35%.  To the end of October 2012, some 10,602 cases or 57% had been decided on a summary basis, as against 7,992, or 43%, following an oral hearing.  Consistency and transparency in decision-making are crucial for people in accessing their rights.  This is addressed by the Department through training and information provided for deciding officers.  It is the statutory responsibility of the chief appeals officer to convene meetings of appeals officers for the purposes of ensuring consistency.

Claiming that headline or primary rates of social welfare have not been cut means nothing because the Minister is actually cutting the amount of money per week that people have to live on.  I thank her for the lecture on how the economy is working and the amount being expended on social welfare, but the reality is that those people on social welfare can barely survive.  If the Minister cuts their rates, whatever sort of spin she wants to put on it, this will leave them in an even more dire situation.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Dea pointed out the facts from the Irish League of Credit Unions survey.  It has been quoted so much at this stage that it is putting Shakespeare into second place for quotable documents in this place.  Unfortunately, no matter how often we quote it, the Minister does not seem to listen.  Either that or she does not believe the survey.  Her cuts, whatever she calls them, are having the same impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300013#L00100","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1352819100,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I am sure the Deputy knows that the reason people have suffered such a fall in their living standards-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300013#L00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1352819100,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Yes - Fianna F\u00e1il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300013#L00300","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1352819100,"counter":95,"content":"<p>-----is not social welfare.

If it is their sole income they rely on it for their living expenses, to buy the messages and to live their lives.  I disagree with the Deputy that the core social welfare rates - the weekly payment on which so many people, particularly pensioners, rely - are not significant.  They are very significant, in my view.  The Government has been correct in seeking to protect that payment.  The previous Government on two occasions cut the core weekly social welfare rates by \u20ac8.  People still mention that cut to me all the time.<\/p><p>  I do not wish to be dishonest.  The country is in a difficult place and we need to find savings.  This commitment was agreed to by Fianna F\u00e1il with the troika.

There are currently 23,300 places, including about 1,400 supervisory positions, available on CE and the revised budget for 2012 is about &#8364;340 million.  There has been no reduction in the number of CE places or in the number of supervisors for 2012.

So far, savings have been achieved in audit and insurance costs.  There has been a refocusing on the importance of the programme in the lives of individual jobseekers and the supports the CE schemes give to local communities.  The Department is committed to reforming CE to ensure delivery of service, value for money and the progression of individuals under the programme.  The broad policy direction for CE in 2013 and future years will be based on the main action points coming from the CE financial review which was recently published by the Department.  These include restructuring smaller schemes into more cost-effective units of provision.  This will involve bringing together similar types of scheme and strengthening the viability of schemes, particularly in rural communities.  For sponsoring organisations that have a number of CE schemes, it will involve amalgamating these into larger entities, thus saving on operational costs such as audit fees.

He is now threatened with homelessness.  The other man was a barber who lived in the place where he worked.

The Supreme Court was clear that there was a misstatement contained in the material produced by the Government as well as, &quot;extensive passages in the booklet and on the website which do not conform to the McKenna&quot; judgment, where &quot;it was held that the Government in expending public moneys in the promotion of a particular result in a Referendum process was in breach of the Constitution.&quot;, and that the Government had &quot;acted wrongfully in expending or arranging to expend public moneys on the website, booklet and advertisements in relation to the Referendum on the Thirty First Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Bill, 2012, ...&quot;.<\/p><p>  For some reason, the Government obviously decided to formulate its own information and advocacy campaign parallel to the information campaign of the Referendum Commission and, presumably for its own political purposes, to use some of the taxpayers' money to advance its own situation.  This is despite the fact that Mr. Justice Kevin Feeney, following his report on the referendum campaign on the fiscal treaty, stated that research found that dual campaigns cause problems and confusion.  The Government had that report for quite some time and took a long time to release it.  That should have been a warning sign to the Government not to go down the route on which it subsequently decided.  In essence, what seems to have happened is that the Referendum Commission had its funding pulled back, the Government took a tranche of that funding and used it to produce its own materials.

Most importantly, I thank the people who went out and voted, and clearly and specifically, those who gave a clear majority verdict in respect of this.<\/p><p>  The McKenna judgment has been around for more than 17 years, with a second appraisal in 1995.  No court has ever set out specifically what are the parameters, confines and meaning of the McKenna judgment.<\/p><p>  The Government, in so far as putting this question to the people was concerned, followed a call more than 20 years ago by Mrs Justice Catherine McGuinness that the Constitution be amended.  There have been all the different attempts over the years.  Inside 18 months, we have put four questions to the people, including this one which has been endorsed.<\/p><p>  The Government set out to uphold the principles that apply in this and the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, followed a clear line in dealing with the requirement to have information given to people and to deal with misinformation.  After all, there were groups stating that there would be compulsory vaccination of children and the State might step in and prevent parents from bringing their children to Mass if that was their wish.  There was a great deal of misinformation going around on this matter.<\/p><p>  Deputy Martin will be aware that the High Court gave a clear 11-page judgment on the information in respect of the website, advertising and booklet, and what the Government was doing.  Clearly, on 8 November, when the Supreme Court made its decision, the Government responded immediately, in fully accepting its decision and in acting accordingly.<\/p><p>  It is important that we do not prejudice or comment unduly on the reasons the Supreme Court gave its judgment in the way it did.  The Supreme Court has produced a preliminary judgment.  It is important for Deputy Martin and everybody else to await the detail which will be outlined in the Supreme Court judgment in December and that the House reflect on that taking into account the background to this, the McKenna judgment, the question for future referenda and what, in respect of the people's Constitution, we as the Oireachtas should do for the future.<\/p><p>  The bottom line here is that the people have changed the Constitution.  They have gone out and voted by a clear majority to give children protection and recognition in the Constitution and the Government will now move on to introduce the necessary supplementary legislation to give effect to that and to change forever the nature of the way children were treated in this country.  This amendment is for the benefit of society, in particular, children, those in vulnerable situations and those in the limbo land of foster care where a minority have no prospect of adoption.

An aonta\u00edonn an Taoiseach le seo?  Students and their families are facing significant financial hardship due to the failure of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, to process properly student grant applications.  This morning, at the insistence of Teachta Jonathan O'Brien, the head of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, CDVEC, was before the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection and claimed that the system is working.  This refusal to acknowledge the crisis is insulting to students and their families.  Does the Taoiseach agree with this assessment?<\/p><p>  An e-mail from one student who is still being assessed by SUSI reflects the frustration and anger of many.  He writes, &quot;Anyway, it is irrelevant now.  I'm leaving the education system.  I'm leaving a course I thoroughly enjoyed.  I'm leaving my goals and dreams.  I will most likely be leaving Ireland very soon.&quot;.  Emigration is not a solution and plainly it is not a lifestyle choice.  In a real republic, access to education should be the entitlement of all citizens.  It should not be conditional on one's family income.  This young citizen's plight is an indictment of this Government.<\/p><p>  Does the Taoiseach accept that there is a crisis and that it is totally unacceptable that, as of yesterday, only 18,000 out of 66,000 applications to SUSI have been processed?  Does he also accept that the Department of Education and Skills has mismanaged this entire process and failed to provide adequate resources to ensure that SUSI can do its job?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300019#R03300","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1352821800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Adams that this is an unacceptable position.  This is the official position of both the Minister for Education and Skills and the Government.  The Minister has already written to the CDVEC, which won the tender for this service, and instructed it to increase the personnel numbers to deal with the backlog.  We have had similar issues before when various new structures were set up which were intended to deal with this professionally, competently and efficiently.  Clearly, there are serious teething problems with this service.  As I understand it, as of Monday, 12 November, the situation regarding the 66,000 applications is as follows: 20,000 are now complete and have been awarded, provisionally awarded or refused.  Of the 8,000 grants awarded 3,010 have been paid into bank accounts, with approximately 5,000 awaiting bank details from students.  Approximately 2,500 grants have been provisionally awarded, pending final confirmation of attendance from students, while 9,600 applications were refused or cancelled.  SUSI is still awaiting documentation on almost 21,000 applications.  Of these, 15,000 applicants have provided no documentation whatsoever and SUSI does not expect them ever to complete their applications.  It is not, therefore, all one-sided.  SUSI has 26,000 applications for processing at present and has a target of 5,030 decisions to be made on applications over the next week.  If these targets are met, all successful applicants will receive their grants by the end of September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300019#R03400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1352821800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1352821800,"counter":204,"content":"<p>In order to help with that, SUSI has received ten additional temporary staff from the Public Appointments Service, who will come on board on Monday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300019#R03600","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1352821800,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Is that September of next year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300019#R03700","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1352821800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>The processing of documentation is outsourced to Abtran, which is located in Cork.

My concern relates to the disparity of pay levels between lower-grade civil servants and those at the top, because that gap has grown wider.  Many of the issues that have been under public discussion with regard to public servants at lower and middle income levels concern allowances that were given as alternatives to pay increases, which should be considered as core pay.  Under Fianna F\u00e1il, payment for Secretaries General rose from \u20ac100,000 in 2000 up to \u20ac285,000, while lower-paid workers had to rely on these allowances.  Clearly, if indefensible allowances are being paid, these should be withdrawn, but allowances paid to lower and middle-income public servants are part of their core pay. <\/p><p>  We have a difficulty as we try to work our way through this recession.  One element, the upper echelons, have a huge amount of money, but those at other levels are paid very meagre incomes.  Senior civil servants, public hospital consultants, special advisers and Ministers are all paid significantly more than their EU counterparts.  The Taoiseach is paid more than the French President or the Spanish Prime Minister.  I have two suggestions.  First, if we are going to start cutting pay, we should start at the top and show an example to the citizens.  The Taoiseach may have provided a breakdown of the allowances paid in his Department, but I apologise if I did not pick up on it.  How do we get that breakdown of the allowances being paid in the Department and the salary scales of those in receipt of them?

Details of the changes made to a number of the allowances paid to staff in the Department of the Taoiseach are being circulated in the Official Report.  Deputy Gerry Adams is right to suggest some of these allowances have been paid in addition to basic pay to personnel on the lower scales of public service salaries.  They are set out in the details to be circulated.  The details do not include information on the salary of each individual.  The information can be seen by category, depending on whether the individual is a clerical assistant or a clerical officer, for example.  The details can be amended to include the number of public servants in each of these categories in the Department.  If such details are required, they can be circulated.<\/p><p>  In a wider sense, it should be noted that \u20ac1.4 billion was spent on allowances and premium payments in 2011.  Following the review, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has brought proposals to the Government whereby allowances worth \u20ac720 million would be abolished, not paid to new beneficiaries or would be subject by review by sectoral management to secure additional savings.  The annual cost of paying to current incumbents the allowances that will not now be paid to new beneficiaries is approximately \u20ac475 million.  A further range of allowances with an annual value of \u20ac245 million will be subject to modification of their payment terms.  The allowance paid to officials who travel outside Ireland and the United Kingdom to represent Ireland at meetings of EU or other international organisations, or who act as chairpersons of EU committees, has been abolished for new beneficiaries and existing staff.  This allowance is known as the chairpersons and delegates allowance.  The immediate value of these decisions is estimated to be \u20ac3.5 million in 2012, increasing to over \u20ac16 million by 2015.  All of these matters have been referred to in some detail by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the information is available on the official departmental website.<\/p><p>  All of this is part of the process of major reform of the way we view the public service and the public sector.

A number of staff on the lowest salary scales have traditionally received some of these allowances.  That is the case not just in this Department but across the Civil Service.

I put to the Taoiseach my contention that this exercise was completely oversold from the beginning.  It was suggested it would yield massive savings.  The massive spin machine employed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in particular, came to naught.  It was suggested savings of \u20ac150 million could be made from a \u20ac1.5 billion pot, but a figure of just \u20ac3 million was realised.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House the total amount in allowances paid in his Department?  What percentage of the overall allowances paid in the Department will be saved as a result of the savings he enumerated?  If he does not have that information to hand, he might be able to forward it to me at a later stage.  As I have no interest in rewriting history - Deputy Gerry Adams may have - I would like to remind the House that the pay of all public servants was increased significantly during our time in office, for which we have been criticised.  Over a sustained period, substantial increases were awarded across the ranks to the various grades in the Civil Service and the public service generally through procedures such as social partnership, benchmarking and independent pay reviews.

Clearly, the Department is engaging with staff on other allowances subject to review or negotiation.

It would be far preferable if the allowances were modified or changed to become part of the pay of those involved.  As the Deputy suggested, they should not be tagged with allowance X or Y which have been paid for many years for various reasons.  As part of the concept of reforming the public sector, it has to be made more efficient and meaningful.  I agree that these tags should not be attached to workers who might be at the lower end of the pay scale.

Clearly, these matters need to be considered at the other end of the scale in the context of the budget that will be presented by the Minister for Finance in December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300022#U00500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IFSC Clearing House Group","time":1352824200,"counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300023#V00050"},{"type":"question","time":1352824200,"counter":260,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[44100\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300023#V00100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of times since the D\u00e1il recess that the International Financial Services Centre Clearing House Group has met; the issues that were discussed; the actions that have been taken as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","time":1352824200,"counter":261,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[44239\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300023#V00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of times officials from his Department attended Clearing House Group meetings in relation to the International Financial Services Centre; the main issues being discussed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","time":1352824200,"counter":262,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[44240\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300023#V00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the progress made to date in his Department in relation to the strategy to create 10,000 jobs in the International Financial Services Centre sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","time":1352824200,"counter":263,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[48419\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300023#V00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of times the Financial Services Clearing House Group has met and the issues they discussed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","time":1352824200,"counter":264,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[49613\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300023#V00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has met representatives of the International Financial Services Centre recently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","time":1352824200,"counter":265,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[49712\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300023#V00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of times officials from his Department have attended Clearing House Group meetings; and the issues that were discussed.","asker":"954","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1352824200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 8, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  The IFSC Clearing House Group has met once since the D\u00e1il summer recess on 25 September and is due to meet next on 22 November.  Its associated working groups meet regularly, typically on a monthly or bimonthly basis.<\/p><p>  My Department has supported the international financial services industry in Ireland since the establishment of the IFSC in 1987 by providing a forum for the exchange of views and the co-ordination of efforts through the mechanism of the IFSC Clearing House Group and its related working groups.  During this period the IFSC has grown to employ 33,000 people and contribute over &#8364;1 billion annually through corporation tax and payroll taxes.<\/p><p>  I have met representatives of the international financial services sector, as I do representatives of all sectors, on a number of occasions at various events since the launch of the IFSC strategy in 2011.  For example, I addressed the Irish Funds Industry Association at its annual conference this year and spoke at the Financial Services Ireland annual dinner in 2011.  My Department is represented at all meetings of the Clearing House Group which has since its establishment been chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach.  <\/p><p>  Membership of the Clearing House Group comprises public and private sector representatives and reflects a wide range of experience and expertise in order that its objectives of identifying opportunities to develop sustainable business and employment in the various sectors of the international financial services industry can be achieved.  The primary focus of the group is to identify and consider issues of importance to the long-term development of the international financial services industry in Ireland in line with the programme for Government which states the Government &#8220;supports the future development of the IFSC as a source of future employment growth, subject to appropriate regulation&#8221; and commits to the development of the financial services sector to maximise employment opportunities.  In 2011 the group contributed to the development of a &quot;Strategy for the International Financial Services Industry in Ireland 2011-2016&quot;, framed on the basis of an objective to create more than 10,000 net new jobs, protect existing employment and business and consolidate the sector as a key driver of the economy in the next five years.  The group monitors progress on implementation of the strategy.  Since its launch, both the public and private sectors have been actively involved in executing the strategy across a broad front and considerable progress has been achieved, including significant progress on initiatives such as green finance and Islamic finance; notable investment wins by IDA Ireland, including Northern Trust, MasterCard, PayPal, HedgeServ, ICBC Leasing and CIMB Principal Islamic; a technology centre in financial services has been launched with initial research projects approved; and among a range of related initiatives, Enterprise Ireland is promoting the Payments Ireland initiative to brand Ireland as a centre of competence for payments companies.<\/p><p>  In addition to a series of initiatives to ensure the availability of an appropriately skilled workforce for the financial services sector in Ireland such as Finuas, Financial Services Ireland has recently launched the FSI CareerStart programme.  This one year training programme offers participants the opportunity to gain new skills in the area of international financial services, while providing an in-depth knowledge of the industry.  The programme is funded by Springboard, an initiative funded through the Department of Education and Skills to provide education and training opportunities to support unemployed persons.  Other issues considered by the Clearing House Group in the past year include the marketing and promotion of Ireland's strengths in the international financial services industry and how best to enhance and support the competitive position of the international financial services sector in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Since the inception of the IFSC, close co-operation between industry and the public sector has been a foundation of its success.  It is entirely appropriate that the public sector works with companies that employ tens of thousands of people, with a view to protecting and creating jobs and maintaining Ireland&#8217;s competitive position as a leading centre for international financial services. <\/p><p>  In line with the Government&#8217;s focus on increasing the transparency and openness of government, a number of measures are being taken with regard to the IFSC Clearing House Group to ensure transparency and accountability in its work.  First, the minutes of meetings of the group which have taken place since my election as Taoiseach to the end of September this year will shortly be published on my Department's website and <i>www.merrionstreet.ie<\/i>.  Second, a report on the work of the group during this period will also be published on the websites.  Third, I have asked the Secretary General of my Department who is chairman of the group to write to the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service offering to brief it on the work of the group.  These initiatives will ensure increased awareness of the continued importance of the international financial services sector to the economy and highlight the progress being made by the private and public sectors working together in creating and protecting jobs for Ireland, a priority which is shared by all parties in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300023#V00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1352824200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>When the issue was raised in the D\u00e1il last March, the Taoiseach told us he was unaware whether the IFSC Clearing House Group had discussed the issue of a financial transaction tax.  Then, in information revealed to <i>The Irish Times<\/i> by way of a freedom of information request, it became clear that the group and its sub-groups had discussed the issue of a financial transaction tax at 13 meetings between October 2011 and May 2012.  Interestingly, the public positions of Ministers dovetailed exactly with the consensus in the financial sector.  The Clearing House Group is a <i>Who's Who<\/i> of the banking and finance sectors and was actually successful in having changes made to the Finance Bill to allow a 30% tax exemption on incomes of between &#8364;75,000 and &#8364;500,000.  Further tax reliefs on school fees of up to &#8364;5,000 were included at its behest, despite opposition from Revenue.  What I am trying to get at is the relationship between the Government and an elite group such as this.  Those citizens in mortgage distress - 160,000 households - do not have a clearing house group and do not have access to the Government at this very top level.  Is it not time to review the Government's relationship with the IFSC Clearing House Group?<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach said there was a commitment to creating 10,000 new jobs.  It would be interesting to find how many of these jobs have been created since the launch of the strategy way back in July last year.  We have since had AIB announcing the loss of 2,500 jobs.  There have been 1,000 job losses in Bank of Ireland, in addition to 3,700 who have left since 2009.  In Ulster Bank there were almost 1,000 job losses in January 2012.  In Permanent TSB there were 250 losses in July, while National Irish Bank closed 20 branches, resulting in 100 job losses, in June.  It does not give me any satisfaction to recite that litany of bad news items, but I am trying to get between the propaganda and the reality in terms of jobs growth in this sector.  I am hugely concerned that the Government, in whatever sector we are dealing with, has a different relationship with the elites - in this case, the financial sector.  Compare the Government's relationship with the Clearing House Group and the bankers' attitude to Oireachtas committees.  Last week the Taoiseach said the way they were treating Oireachtas committee representatives was totally unacceptable and that the huge bonuses they were receiving were totally unacceptable-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300023#V00800","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1352824200,"counter":268,"content":"<p>We are straying a little from the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300023#V00900","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1352824200,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Is it not time to review the Government's relationship with the IFSC Clearing House Group?

It is not a case of cosy relationships.  It is a forum chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach which draws together representatives of the private and public sectors to look at issues of importance to the country.  When the question of a financial transaction tax was first raised, a range of different views were expressed.  The matter was discussed extensively in the media and raised in other quarters, including this House.<\/p><p>If I am correct, the spokesperson on finance for the Fianna F\u00e1il Party spoke in the House in October last year and raised the prospect of difficulties being created in terms of job creation and job retention if a financial transaction tax was not considered properly.  The Departments and the Clearing House Group did consider the issue.  The Departments discussed the matter with various elements of industry and those involved in the financial services area.  Independent research was carried out by the ESRI and the Central Bank.  It is quite in order that the Government should consider such matters carefully before it would agree to a change.  The decision announced by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government was that we would not be supportive of a financial transaction tax unless it applied universally.  The reason is that one does not want to place Dublin and the IFSC at a disadvantage in comparison to London where such a tax might not apply.<\/p><p> Deputy Gerry Adams is aware that stamp duty is applied in this country.  As part of the process of the European Union, he is also aware that enhanced co-operation applies where a majority of countries wish to pursue a particular course of action.  Eleven countries wish to introduce a financial transaction tax.  As the incoming holder of the Presidency, I have made it perfectly clear to colleagues in Europe that we do not support a financial transaction tax for the reasons set out, but that will not prevent us from processing the enhanced co-operation element under the rules that apply and the eleven countries that wish to introduce such a tax can go ahead and do so.  It is not a case of the Clearing House Group making policy decisions; it is only a forum for interaction on the development of information and the analysis of views between private and public in the interests of the financial services area and the retention of jobs and the promotion of job creation.  As always, policy is a matter for Ministers to develop and Governments to accept and disseminate.  I hope that clears up the issue for the Deputy.  The Clearing House Group is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and there is no question of cosy relationships being adopted.  I have met representatives of the industry on a number of occasions.  It is perfectly in order for them to say the regulatory position, in so far as regulator X or Y is concerned, is too restrictive and needs to be adapted or modified in order that decisions can be made about business that will make it easier to retain and create jobs.  As the Deputy is aware, the number of jobs in the IFSC has grown to 33,000 from 8,000 20 years ago.<\/p><p> Since 2011 more than 3,000 jobs have been created as a result of the advantageous decisions taken with IDA support for investment in this country.  We hope that, as part of the strategy for the international financial services industry,10,000 net new jobs can be created by 2015.  This figure is based on the reckoning of the industry.  I will forward a copy of the strategy to the Deputy, if he does not already have one.  A good start has been made with the first 3,000 jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300023#V01100","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352824800,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Does the Taoiseach accept that a balance is always required in dialogue with industry, which is necessary \u2013 the Clearing House Group has been effective in that regard \u2013 to ensure relations are not too cosy and that there is clear guidance on how to proceed and rules of engagement between the sector and Government officials?  The financial services area is a competitive world.  I regard the fact that 33,000 people are employed in the IFSC as a significant factor to be taken into consideration in any policy position we adopt.  The creation of this initiative is an extraordinary and enduring legacy of the Fianna F\u00e1il Government in 1987.  There was a seminar on the subject in the Global Irish Economic Forum.  The concern articulated by many who are aware of what is happening around the globe is that the challenge for the IFSC is to move to higher value activities and that there is a deficit in terms of the quality and skill sets of personnel required in view of the type of people we need to attract to this country from other centres with their products and companies over and above what we already have.  It has been said certain of the activities ongoing for some time are vulnerable to migration to other low-cost regions and that we must attract higher value activities to the IFSC.  The point has been made that there must be a combination of upskilling education and working through arrangements to encourage or incentivise individuals to move from one sector to the next.<\/p><p>  If the Taoiseach reads what Paul Krugman or others have to say, he will be aware that they are clear that the Great Recession, as they dub it, that we are now experiencing is fundamentally one that initially was a factor in causing the collapse of the financial and banking world.  First and foremost, it was a global financial and banking collapse, followed by sovereign iterations of the problem when they took on board the financial collapse.  I often believe there is an absence of contrition in the financial and banking world about this reality.  It is in that context that I ask whether the Clearing House Group has discussed the issue of pensions or salaries.  One invariably hears about global benchmarking in the setting of salaries and some countries tend to do it better than others.  We have had discussions in recent weeks about the pensions and salaries of bankers.  I presume the issue has been discussed between the Government, departmental officials and the representatives of the financial services sector.  The sector has much work to do, with other sectors, to regain respect and credibility from the person on the street who is aghast, annoyed and angry at the scale of the salaries and pensions enjoyed by bankers.  Were these issues discussed with the Clearing House Group and what has emerged from it?<\/p><p>  Apart from the ESRI and the Central Bank, did the Government commission research on the likely impact on the industry in this country and the IFSC of a financial transaction tax?  The proposal ultimately emanated from Brussels.  Do we have hard evidence-based research on potential job losses or the impact of such a tax?  I have heard various estimates, ranging from \u20ac150 million to \u20ac3 trillion worth of activity.  We must have clear answers on that front.  I would be interested in hearing whether specific research has been conducted in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300024#W00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1352824800,"counter":273,"content":"<p>It is only right and proper that there be balance in the dialogue between the public sector and the private sector.

These are areas that are always under consideration.<\/p><p>  A detailed report was produced by the European Commission on a financial transaction tax.

I will ensure whatever research is available will be presented to the Deputy.  I am not sure whether the Government commissioned a formal report on a financial transaction tax, but we came to the view that if such a tax was to be imposed in this country and not in London where the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, was clear in his view on the matter, it would place the IFSC at a disadvantage.<\/p><p>We have moved on to making that clear at a European level, pointing out that the enhanced co-operation-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300024#W00300","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352825400,"counter":275,"content":"<p>It might be no harm to do a study.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300025#X00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1352825400,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I will look at what was done and follow it through.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about pensions.  There are five working groups in the IFSC and their roles are clearly set out.  The first is the IFSC banking and treasury working group, which deals with banking, asset financing and corporate treasury, as well as taxation issues that arise from all areas of the international financial services industry in Ireland.  It makes recommendations for improving the competitiveness of the industry in these sectors.  Many of its proposals have been reflected in the recent Finance Acts, largely in respect of regulation.  The IFSC banking and treasury working group includes representatives of the industry sector, banking and corporate treasury, industry financial advisors, accountants dealing with taxation issues and public sector representatives from Departments and agencies.  I do not know whether they have discussed the question of bank pensions.  This area is about asset banking and corporate treasury.<\/p><p>  The second group is the IFSC CF funds working group which considers the administration and management of investment funds and examines the future of the funds industry in Ireland.  Its work involves recommending the right legislative, regulatory and taxation issues, co-ordinating the market effort between IDA Ireland, Government and industry, and maintaining awareness of the impact of international developments on competitiveness.  We hear about the last point all the time from industry.  The group has as its mission statement that it will ensure that the quality of the environment and infrastructure for the wider funds industry in Ireland is comparable to and competitive with what is called &quot;best in class&quot; internationally.  It states that this forum should be where experts in the public and private sectors can together prioritise relevant issues for resolution, which can be taken at a higher level, if appropriate.  This group includes representatives and practitioners, relevant Departments and agencies in the Irish Stock Exchange.<\/p><p>  The third group is the IFSC insurance working group, which considers issues of relevance to the continued development, expansion and competitiveness of Ireland as a reputable centre for the provision of insurance products and services.  It includes proposals for and monitoring of fiscal and regulatory changes, and any other improvements that are deemed necessary to enhance and protect the international insurance sector, the co-ordination of marketing efforts and promoting and fostering working relationships between IDA Ireland, the Government and the industry.  It maintains awareness of and analysis of the impact of international developments and aspects of business which affect the overall competitiveness and attractiveness of Ireland as a centre for insurance.<\/p><p>  The fourth group is the IFSC pensions working group, whose role is to promote Ireland as a prime location for the centralised management of pension funds.  That objective is best achieved by active collaboration and appropriate representation on the working group of the main interested parties, as well as individuals with particular experience, including industry representatives of multinational companies.  The Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance, the Pensions Board, IDA Ireland and Financial Services Ireland are all members of the pensions group.<\/p><p>  The fifth group is the IFSC asset management working group, which considers issues of relevance to the development of a broader based institutional asset management business in Ireland.  Its focus is to advise the IFSC clearing house group on the fiscal and regulatory measures that are needed to promote Ireland as a centre for international asset management activities and to identify impediments - fiscal, regulatory, skills or otherwise - and suggest appropriate remedies.  It also validates and supports the implementation of an appropriate marketing strategy.<\/p><p>  These groups are all designed to fit in promoting Ireland and making it a better place for asset management business.  Included are the Irish Association of Investment Managers, IAIM, industry practitioners, Departments, the Central Bank and State agencies, which all meet on a regular basis.  I do not have the detail of what they have discussed but we will shortly publish on the website the minutes of the clearing house group meetings since last September.

In my initial reply I also indicated that I met representatives of these groups on various occasions - at business functions, etc. - as is my responsibility and as is part of my remit.  I have not been in attendance at seven or eight meetings of the IFSC Clearing House Group.  I have been at pains to point out how that forum operates and also who chairs it.  Perhaps the Deputy might include that information on the flag to which he refers and bear it in mind on the next occasion on which that banner is flown.<\/p><p>  There are people who live in Deputy Boyd Barrett's constituency who work for one of the many companies that have invested in the IFSC.  Just as he got his answer in the referendum on the fiscal stability treaty, the Deputy should bear in mind that some of those who live in his constituency work for companies which have invested in and operate out of the IFSC - Zurich, AXA, Generali, Allianz, Citibank, State Street International, J. P. Morgan, BNY Mellon, Bank of Montreal, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Prudential, Northern Trust, UniCredit Bank Ireland, Pioneer Alternative Investments, HSBC and many more.  Is he saying it is not appropriate that these institutions should invest in our country or that they should not have created, developed and maintained 33,000 jobs here?<\/p><p>  The Government has made its view on the corporation tax rate of 12.5% - 11.9% effective across the board - very clear.  For many years this rate has been a cornerstone of this country's ability to attract investment.  However, it is not the only factor.  Our position with regard to technology, our track record and our pool of talent are all factors when it comes to attracting investment.  When one adds to these the fact that ours is the only English-speaking country in the eurozone, in the words of former US President Bill Clinton, this makes Ireland enormously attractive to investors.  Whether it is in the wider sense outside the financial services industry or in the context of investment in Ireland in general, there are over 1,000 companies that have come here and that are driving our economy.  Their efforts will play an enormous part as we make progress towards exiting the bailout.<\/p><p>  I do not accept the Deputy's assertion that there is some kind of conspiracy at play or some type of cosy cartel in operation here.  I am sure he has visited the Irish Financial Services Centre.  He may have met and spoken to the people there - he may even know some of them - who work in the interests of this country in the context of creating job opportunities.  We want not only to maintain what is happening at the centre but also to enhance and expand it.  The financial services industry has indicated that it wishes to create a further 10,000 net new jobs by 2015.  That is the value of this industry to our country.  As I pointed out to Deputy Adams, some 3,000 jobs have been created in this area alone since 2011.  We want to maintain and develop our strategy in respect of this sector in the interests of both the economy and our people, some of whom Deputy Boyd Barrett might meet on the streets of his constituency.  He should not decry those individuals for the work they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300026#Y01700","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1352826000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Does the Taoiseach not find it extraordinary that what is essentially an arm of the Government is an institutionalised conduit for the world's financiers and financial speculators to have a decisive influence on Government policy in respect of crucial issues - the taxing of super wealth, financial speculation, etc. - which could have an effect on their profits?

If I were to ask whether he would consider establishing an Irish care for the elderly clearing house in order that home helps and representatives of elderly people could meet regularly to engage in discussions, etc., the Taoiseach would probably scoff at the idea.

In the context of how it does its business and what it does, the IFSC is in a different league from commercial banks - with their lending policies, moves into the area of property and all the rest of it - which created a bubble that exploded, left the country in the lurch and saw to it that 150,000 construction workers became unemployed.  Nor is this an institutionalised conduit of Government for dealing with the institutions in question.  There are, after all, 33,000 men and women who are employed at the IFSC.  These people do an enormously important job for both the economy and the reputation of the country.  The Deputy should not brand them as being the same as those who operated in the other arm of banking, whose incompetence led to a debacle.<\/p><p>Policy is not set by the banks or the Clearing House Group; it is set by the Ministers and by the Government.  It is perfectly in order for Ministers or for the clearing house group to hear the views of the industry, which after all employs 33,000 people, about the changing nature of advantages and opportunities for business abroad and how that might impact on this country.  While these matters are subject to regulation, such regulation should be effective but not over-restrictive.  That is a very important element for creating further advantage, brand image and the opportunity for people to work in it.<\/p><p> I had the privilege of launching its document last year.  It describes the opportunities for future business in different and more creative ways.  The clearing house group is a forum for the public and private sectors to come together.  It is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and its brief is to look at the long-term development of international financial services.  It is absolutely above board.  There is no cosy cartel in operation.  The minutes of the meeting will be on the website very shortly.  I have written to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform with the intention of giving the committee members a full briefing.  The report which has been published will also be put up on the website of the Department.  Far from it being some form of secretive, clandestine, conspiratorial, institutionalised conduit of the State, as the Deputy calls it, this is a very effective forum for dealing with job creation, improved investment in the country, the development of our economy, the creation of jobs and a much happier country.

I raise it because of the low number of visits to Laoighis-Offaly by companies invited here by IDA Ireland.  The figures are actually unbelievable and astounding.  I have raised this locally and regionally with IDA Ireland.  I welcome the fact that the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, is present.  He will recall my raising this in his office last year with representatives of industry and commerce from Laoighis-Offaly, the county manager and other Deputies.  The taxpayers of Laois and Offaly are wondering what is happening in regard to their contribution to the IDA Ireland's budget of \u20ac86 million, which I understand is its allocation.  Given the number of visits to countiesd Laois and Offaly last year, one wonders how such a cost arises.  If the NRA and Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport stopped funding roads in the area, the people of counties Laois and Offaly would not be expected to pay road tax.<\/p><p>  The figures are absolutely astounding.  In the past three years there have been but two IDA Ireland-organised visits to County Laois by prospective companies.<\/p><p>There have not been any visits so far in 2012.  There were two in the entire three year period in County Laois.  County Offaly has had nine visits: seven in 2010, one in 2011 and one so far in 2012, yet Laois has had only two.  In the same period Dublin had 484 visits.  I understand that the capital city would have more visits as it is a large population area but Laois-Offaly should have had more than two.  There is a major discrepancy in that regard.  I understand IDA Ireland's budget is \u20ac86 million, which is a huge amount of money, and those of us in Laoighiss-Offaly are wondering about our part of that.<\/p><p> There are huge opportunities in Laoighiss-Offaly  There are enterprise centres and vacant IDA Ireland premises across the counties in Portlaoise, Mountrath, Mountmellick, Portarlington, Birr, Edenderry and Tullamore.  To take Portarlington alone, there is a huge Avon factory in Portarlington mainly under the control of NAMA because of the current position.  There is a huge opportunity there and I know NAMA and other interested parties would like to see that used for something more purposeful.  I ask the Minister to give his attention to that.<\/p><p> Regarding the jobless figures in the two counties, there are 17,856 people on the live register in both counties.  That is a huge number of people who are unemployed.  Myself and other local representatives have tried to highlight that and to seek ways to improve the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300028#AA05900","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352827800,"counter":407,"content":"<p>The Deputy must conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300029#BB00200","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1352827800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>The local authorities in both counties are making substantial efforts in providing enterprise centres and other incentives to attract people to locate in the area.<\/p><p>  Where is the accountability of IDA Ireland in this matter?

As he rightly pointed out, Deputy Charles Flanagan organised a delegation to my office recently to discuss this very issue.  We went through in some detail the challenges and where we might seek opportunities in this area.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy acknowledged in his question, the difficulty of getting IDA Ireland activity in the counties of Laois and Offaly has been a huge challenge for many years.  This problem did not arise today or yesterday.  The structure of employment in Laoighis-Offaly is that approximately 4,000 people are employed in indigenously owned companies while 800 people are employed in IDA foreign owned companies.  We need to build on our enterprise base.  There is no doubt that in recent times the manufacturing base of foreign owned companies, and it has been predominantly manufacturing within Laois-Offaly, has been under severe attrition throughout the country and there have been difficulties in the manufacturing sectors whether foreign or Irish owned.  <\/p><p>  Manufacturing is a key priority within enterprise policy and one of the things I have done since taking office is to establish a manufacturing development forum to set out a strategic vision for 2020, not just for foreign owned companies but also for indigenous owned companies which, in the case of Laoighis-Offaly, are a far greater proportion of the employment base.  We must recognise that there are opportunities in manufacturing.  It has been too easily allowed slide from the national focus of enterprise policy.<\/p><p>  I am taking other steps to help drive increasing activity from our industrial base and employment opportunities across the country.  These include the launch of the new potential exporters division in Enterprise Ireland to support more indigenous companies trade in foreign markets; Enterprise Ireland's lean business offer which enables manufacturing clients to improve productivity; the launch of the development capital scheme aimed at indigenously owned companies which are finding it difficult to grow to scale and expand into export markets; and the improvement in the research and development scheme.  There is a good deal of activity going on seeking to build our broad indigenous engine of growth.<\/p><p>  In terms of the challenge for IDA Ireland, when I go on IDA Ireland trade missions leading corporations are seeking pools of highly qualified talent in very substantial number.  That is the difficulty we face.  Increasingly, they are looking at areas where there are many companies in similar sectors already established.  The Deputy will be aware that increasingly the profile of IDA Ireland wins we are seeking are in areas of information technology, research and development and in the pharmaceutical sector.  They are activities that tend to be drawn to magnets where there is already a substantial presence in those clusters.  That is what poses the challenge for regional policy.  Effective regional policy will have to rely on indigenous development as well as multinationals.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked where the money goes from the \u20ac86 million.  It is true that the strategy is designed to create 62,000 jobs in 640 investments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300029#BB00400","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1352827800,"counter":410,"content":"<p>The Minister's time has concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300029#BB00500","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1352827800,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I welcome that manufacturing is getting priority, and the Minister mentioned in particular the research and development credit scheme.<\/p><p>  Regarding the pools of qualified talent, there would not be a shortage of those in the midlands.  It is easy to get to an area from a commuter point of view because of improved motorway and rail links, which was one of the reasons given in the past for holding it back.  I ask the Minister to speak to the IDA Ireland about having a flexible approach to the midlands, particularly towards some of the empty units I mentioned such as the Avon factory in Portarlington, the IDA Ireland factories in Portlaoise and Birr, and the other centres and to impress on it the need for balanced regional development.  Everybody would agree on that.  There are pressures on water and other resources in Dublin but we do not have the same level of pressure in the Midlands.  There is a good road network in place.  There are good facilities which are ready to have the key turned in them.  That is the key point.  Smaller units can be used in clusters.  On the day we met the Minister I discussed the question of companies that want to expand and start a new operation in the Midlands in that some of those smaller units could be used for that.  I urge the Minister to use his good offices to keep the pressure on IDA Ireland to have that focus on balanced regional development, and particularly to ensure the midlands does not continue to be ignored by IDA Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300029#BB00600","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1352827800,"counter":412,"content":"<p>IDA Ireland has significant property development in the midlands and it continues to press that as a location in the context of gateway development.  Obviously, the midlands is part of a wider gateway network.<\/p><p>  In addition to that specific IDA Ireland activity, there is also Connect Ireland which is developed through a private company but is essentially a link seeking to find people who will invest in Ireland and using connector fees to do that.  That is a source of job creation which is likely to have a much better regional spread.  We are hopeful that initiative will see a broader spread of activity.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is right to highlight the short and good communications.  A significant decision was the decision of PayPal, having originally invested in Dublin, to have its expansion in Dundalk.  It moved from a Dublin location to a Border, midlands and western, BMW, location where it had the confidence, having been established, that it could get the supply it needed and it had the communication connections.  Expansions of that nature present an opportunity for achieving better regional spread.<\/p><p>  I meet IDA Ireland regularly.  We are seeking to promote regional spread but it is not our Department or the IDA which ultimately decides where companies locate.  They decide that against their criteria.  It is not a question of Portlaoise competing with Dublin; it is a question of Ireland competing with the United Kingdom, Switzerland or Singapore.  That is the competition IDA Ireland predominantly faces, and the Deputy must understand that to understand the difficulty we are facing.<\/p><p>We have to have a broader regional strategy rather than simply looking at IDA Ireland as being the driver.  I will continue to emphasise to IDA Ireland, as the Deputy asked, the importance of seeking to meet the target of 50% of investment outside Dublin and Cork.

ComReg has since come into increasing conflict with An Post and I can best describe their relationship as dysfunctional.  The financial health of An Post hangs in the balance.  Workers, their unions and the management of An Post are working together to secure the financial health of the company.  ComReg, however, is pursuing a policy that will result in damage to An Post's financial standing and threaten service provision across communities.  It is pursuing what appears to be a pro-privatisation agenda towards An Post and has done so in a manner that has played fast and loose with the public interest.<\/p><p>  ComReg pursued a legal action against An Post which it subsequently lost in the High Court.  An Post opposed ComReg's original decision on the grounds that it amounted to an unacceptable form of micromanagement of its postal delivery service by the regulator.  An Post must bear the cost of the High Court case, as well as the cost of a Supreme Court appeal.  Worse still, it will also be picking up the legal bill for ComReg.  This action by ComReg will be responsible for financially damaging a valued and necessary public utility and the only winners will be the lawyers, certainly not consumers.<\/p><p>  ComReg recently fined An Post \u20ac12 million for its quality of service levels.  This seems to be an outrageous amount of money and I question the metric used to arrive at this levy.  There is little point in comparing the efficiencies achieved by An Post with those of other universal service operators in other countries, given our low population density and spread.  Will the Minister establish the impact of this fine on An Post?  Will he ask ComReg to forward to us the metric used in arriving at this fine?<\/p><p>  An Post is forced to pay for two sets of private consultants to measure the quality of service in dispute.  Why not only one?  The additional cost imposed by ComReg by the requirement to have two consultants is racking up millions of euro for An Post and impacting on the service provided for consumers.  While the independence of the regulator from ministerial or political interference is to be valued, there must be accountability to this House.  The regulator should be compelled to answer questions on its role from Oireachtas committees and the Minister, not hide behind legislative shields.  No officeholder in the State should be permitted to exercise the functions of his or her office, a trust given by the Oireachtas, without a degree of accountability.<\/p><p>  ComReg\u2019s actions threaten the interests of consumers and communities across Ireland.  Is the Minister considering proposals to review the operation of the regulator, alter the focus of its office and ensure an impartial approach to how An Post\u2019s functions are refereed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300030#CC00200","speaker":"1043"},{"type":"speech","time":1352828400,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter in the House which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, who is unavoidably absent.<\/p><p>  ComReg is statutorily responsible for the regulation of the postal sector and independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions.  Furthermore, the EU regulatory framework for the postal sector requires the regulatory function to be discharged separately from the shareholder function which the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources administers.  The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act, passed in August 2011, put in place the regulatory framework for the newly liberalised postal service market.  The Act enshrines the universal service obligation, a legal obligation on the State, guaranteeing the collection and delivery of mail to every address in the State on every working day.<\/p><p>  Recognising the importance of universal service, the postal Act was strengthened by the Minister, reflecting commitments given in the programme for Government, to give him a direct role in ensuring the continued delivery of a universal service obligation by An Post.  In terms of the hierarchy of objectives being discharged by ComReg which was recognised by the chairman of ComReg at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications last week, maintenance of universal service is the most important function assigned to it.  In the programme for Government the Government is committed to a universal postal service as an essential public service, with a publicly owned, commercially viable, profitable and efficient An Post critical to the long-term viability of the postal market.<\/p><p>  I watched with interest the proceedings of the Oireachtas committee and was heartened by the interest shown by all Deputies in An Post and the nationwide services it delivered.  As many Deputies acknowledged, An Post is facing many challenges, not just financially but also from the development of communications technologies.  As shareholder, the Minister has a strong concern regarding the ongoing commercial position of the company.  The reality is its core mail business has suffered a major fall in recent years which has impacted seriously on the company's revenue flow.  The scale of the decline obliges all stakeholders to work constructively to ensure An Post's capacity to fulfil its core mission, meeting the universal service obligation, is not undermined.<\/p><p>  Turning to the role of the Minister in this area, clearly he has no direct role in legal proceedings between ComReg and An Post, the costs incurred in legal actions or the amount of management time devoted to these issues.  His preference would be a focus on the fundamental problem facing An Post - the drop in mail volumes - and, in addressing this challenge, the importance of maintaining a secure future for An Post.  In his view, State bodies must service the interests of the taxpayer and pursue value for money.  He has advised both parties that his preference would be to see the issue in question resolved speedily, outside the courts and in a way that did not incur inordinate and unnecessary costs.  An Post has indicated it would prefer mediation.  The Minister, while fully respecting the statutory independence of ComReg, agrees this would be the best option.  Generally, it is the Government\u2019s policy that State agencies ought not to become involved in unnecessary and expensive litigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300030#CC00300","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1352828400,"counter":417,"content":"<p>It is clear ComReg receives its current funding from the industry it regulates.

An Post\u2019s financial position is between the red and the black.  Will the Minister discover from ComReg the basis for which it arrived at a fine of \u20ac12 million?

I wish to put on the record that I support reform and reconfiguration in the health services as long as it is in the best interests of patients and patient care.<\/p><p>  The regional hospital network is in danger of being dismantled and fragmented despite the fact that vast human and capital resources have been invested in these hospitals over many years to deliver a more integrated health service for the region.  The hospitals serve a population of approximately 500,000 people in the south east, the optimum level required for a regional health service.  If we fragment this population there is a great fear that demand for critical tertiary regional health services will become unsustainable and that eventually they will be lost.  I note the Minister's recent assurances that cancer care, trauma and cardiology services will be retained in Waterford Regional Hospital in any proposed reconfiguration.  However, this would require reassurance with regard to parallel budgets and governance and oversight in the region and the securing of the necessary resources for the continued viability of these services.<\/p><p>  The vast majority of the stakeholders in the hospital services of the south east support the retention of the network in the region.  I note the HSE South organisation is based in Cork and Kilkenny.  It has made a strong recommendation to the Minister and Professor Higgins for retention and to exploit the full potential of the regional hospital network in the south east.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, an independent academic organisation with strong links to hospitals in the region and throughout the country, is fully convinced that the south east hospital network is the most integrated and efficient network in the country at the moment.  It has stated that the network should be used as an example for other hospital networks in the country.  The vast majority of consultants in the south-east region, including those from Wexford General Hospital, South Tipperary General Hospital and Waterford Regional Hospital, are in full support of retaining the network.  Those in Kilkenny have reserved judgment.  Therefore, I urge the Minster to ensure full collaboration between all hospitals and to ensure health services are protected in the best interests of patients.<\/p><p>  This case is the opposite of the case of Roscommon General Hospital.

I put it to the Minister of State with all sincerity that the people are very angry and concerned.  We are their representatives in the D\u00e1il and we need some assurances about what is happening in Waterford and the south east.  The demonstration was organised in one week, indicating the outcry and concerns of the people there.  I walked in the march with an old school friend whose father died when he was a young man.  He put it to me that he does not want anyone else to have to get in a car to access services two or three hours away.  This sentiment has been replicated by many public representatives throughout the south east who believe those days are done.  Those days must be done.  We must retain these services for our people in the south east.  This is not only an issue for Waterford but for the south east.<\/p><p>  If the Government decides to withdraw, dismantle and break up the health care framework provided in the south east on the whim of Professor Higgins then where is the region?

We need assurances for the thousands of people and their families throughout the region who depend daily, weekly and monthly on the provision of jobs by the HSE in the south east and, more important, on access to and provision of adequate and top-class health care currently on offer.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this important discussion.  I echo the sentiments of Deputies Conway and Coffey on the importance of the regional hospital.  Much upset, anger and frustration exists in the region as a result of a partially leaked report by Professor Higgins in respect of the reconfiguration of hospital services throughout the country.  Everyone understands that medical treatment regimes which have been in place perhaps for a long period should be examined.  Nothing can be cast in stone forever.  However, I echo the comments of Deputy Conway with regard to the south eastern region and the hospital network.  The four hospitals, in Waterford, Clonmel and Wexford and St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny, comprise arguably the most integrated unit in the country in terms of delivering health services.<\/p><p>  I am in the somewhat unique position of being a Deputy for Carlow-Kilkenny while I live in and I am from the part of Kilkenny served directly by Waterford Regional Hospital.

The 15,000 men, women and children had one thing in mind: to send a clear message to the Minister of State and the Government that they will not tolerate an end to the south eastern hospital network that could lead to the services being transferred to Cork.  We will not tolerate an erosion of our hospital services to serve a political agenda focused on severe cuts in the health system.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has confirmed that no decision has been made yet on the issue.<\/p><p>However, the dogs in the street seem to believe the Government's expert group is recommending a break-up of the south-east hospital network.  It is crucial that the full spectrum of health services remain in place, not only for those living in Waterford but for the 500,000 residents of the south east.  Any change in the current system would have major health consequences, not to mention an adverse economic impact on a region already devastated by one of the highest unemployment rates in the country and the obvious lack of investment by the Government and its predecessor.<\/p><p> At an earlier meeting which all of the Deputies from the south east and members of the medical profession right across the region attended the Secretary General and the Minister gave a commitment, but we want to hear it made in the D\u00e1il.

I note Senator Maurice Cummins is here also.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.<\/p><p>  A key stepping stone towards the introduction of universal health insurance will be the development of independent not-for-profit hospital trusts in which all hospitals will function as part of integrated groups.  The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit for patients.<\/p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals, rather it is about bringing together groups of hospitals into single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery.  It is about ensuring hospital groups are broadly comparable in size and scope in order that they can attract high quality staff and trainees across all health care specialties and professions.  It is about creating efficiencies by using common business processes and economies of scale and avoiding unnecessary duplication.  Most importantly, it is about maximising the range of services available to deliver internationally comparable quality care services for patients, regardless of where they live.<\/p><p>  Specifically with regard to Waterford, the hospital will retain its current suite of services - oncology, cardiology and emergency department.  It will provide invasive cardiology and trauma services and continue to be an NCCP centre.  It will retain the same population referral base for cancer patients.  Joint consultant appointments such as general surgery shared with Wexford across the groups will continue to support the specialist cancer services provided.  In addition, there has been significant capital investment in the provision of a new emergency department and neonatal unit which has been fully constructed and is being fitted out.  As part of the project, the existing emergency department is being refurbished and will be completed in February.<\/p><p>  To assist the Department in advising the Government on the formation of hospital groups, in June the Minister appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a strategic board on the establishment of hospital groups.  The strategic board is composed of representatives with both national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions.<\/p><p>  A project team was established to make recommendations on the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, current management frameworks and linkages with academic institutions for the consideration of the strategic board.  The consultation process to inform the project team has been rigorous and comprehensive.  It has included meetings with every acute hospital, including consultations on two separate occasions with each hospital in the south-east region.  It has involved the receipt of a significant volume of formal submissions from hospitals, clinicians, regulatory bodies and citizens, all of which have been considered.<\/p><p>  The Minister has also made clear to the project team and the board his determination to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely and appropriately in smaller, local hospitals.  On this basis, the organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the ongoing development of the HSE clinical programmes and the smaller hospitals framework which defines the role of smaller hospitals.  It outlines the need for smaller and larger hospitals to operate together and, therefore, is intrinsically linked with the ongoing work on the development of hospital groups.  The Minister expects to receive the report of the strategic board later this month and will be able to bring this matter to his Cabinet colleagues for decision shortly thereafter.  <\/p><p>  It should be remembered that the hospital groups are an interim, collaborative measure pending the legislation required to establish hospital trusts.  Before these trusts are established, the composition and functioning of the groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary, they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300032#EE00400","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1352829600,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputies that they have one minute each.

This is a critical health care issue that needs to be deeply analysed before a Government decision is made and requires the full attention of the Minister and the Government.

As we all know, we are in the midst of a severe economic downturn and large numbers of people are unemployed.  The only way to get many of those people back into employment is to get them back into education.  However, getting people back into education requires financial assistance.  The back to education allowance provides such financial assistance but there is a serious anomaly in the scheme.  Some people who have recognised qualifications are forced, through no fault of their own, to change direction and study for a new profession.  This is most obviously the case with construction-related qualifications.  The anomaly is that such students do not qualify for the back to education allowance because, in many cases, their chosen courses will result in a qualification which is the same, or less than, the one they currently hold.  This is an enormous issue for some people, many of whom are still very young, who have reached the highest level of their profession and now find themselves unemployed.  We all know of architects, quantity surveyors, engineers and a host of other construction-related workers who are unemployed.  It is not long since we were crying out for these experts to service the construction industry.  Their qualifications demanded a huge investment of time, energy and money and many of them thought they had a job for life.<\/p><p>  Last week in a written reply to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Creed, the Minister stated the back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunity scheme.  She qualified this by saying that the courses chosen must lead to a higher qualification than the one currently held.  Most architects, for example, would have studied for between five and ten years but because of the dramatic downturn in the economy and in the construction sector in particular, many of them will never work in their chosen field again.  Many of them are only in their thirties and it seems very unfair to leave them on the shelf for the next 30 or 40 years.  Their continued unemployment is soul-destroying for them and an enormous burden on the State.  For many unemployed professionals, their careers were so short that there was no scope for them to accumulate wealth.  Very few of them can now afford to return to full-time education if it means giving up their social welfare payment.  It seems crazy that if they do not go back to education they will continue to receive their jobseeker's allowance and other social welfare payments.  Many highly qualified unemployed people cannot afford to re-educate themselves and may never work again.  An entire generation will be lost.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister to reconsider the qualification criteria for the back to education allowance.  Most of the conditions are reasonable but the progression requirement, as currently set out, is a major obstacle to many people who are willing and able to re-educate themselves.  The Minister advised Deputy Creed in the aforementioned reply that her Department is currently reviewing a wide range of supports, including the back to education allowance.  The anomaly in the criteria must be amended to suit the needs of the Ireland of today, not the Ireland of five or six years ago, when we were dependent on the building industry.  We must give young people who are more than willing to go back to education a second chance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300033#FF00500","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1352830200,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.<\/p><p>  The Department estimates that expenditure on employment supports will be over \u20ac960 million in 2012.  This substantial expenditure, which is against a backdrop of significant fiscal consolidation, underlines the Government's commitment to enhancing support for activation and assisting people return to employment.  As outlined in the Pathways document, the Department will offer 85,650 job placement, work experience and education initiatives in 2012.  Included in the supports available is the back to education allowance, BTEA, scheme which is a second-chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education.<\/p><p>  A person wishing to qualify for the BTEA will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being of a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full-time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held, with reference to the national framework of qualifications, among others.  The BTEA scheme covers a large range of full-time courses of education in approved colleges spanning basic foundation courses to third-level courses across all disciplines.<\/p><p>  The BTEA guidelines are, in the main, in line with the mechanisms in place for student support type schemes administered by the Department of Education and Skills.  Progression in education is a condition which is not unique to the BTEA.  Indeed State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one.  This is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur, in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level.<\/p><p>  Resources allocated and numbers supported through the BTEA have increased steadily in recent years.  It is estimated that over \u20ac200 million will be spent on the BTEA in 2012 as compared to 2008 when, for example, just over \u20ac77 million was spent on the scheme.  Some 25,700 participants were supported in the 2011-12 academic year which represents a significant 120% increase compared to the 2008-09 academic year.  It is expected that numbers availing of the scheme for the current academic year will be similar to last year.  Persons wishing to pursue a part-time education course may be able to do so while retaining their jobseeker's payment under the part-time education option, PTEO, of the back to education programme.  Examples of courses that may be pursued under the PTEO are the 6,000 part-time higher education places for unemployed people made available under the Springboard initiative announced earlier this year by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairi Quinn.  In addition, the Department also supports the provision of a wide variety of training courses through networks of private sector companies in a range of sectors and regions, supported by Skillnets Ltd., through the PTEO.  It should also be noted that F\u00c1S, as the national training authority, anticipates the needs of, and responds to, a constantly changing labour market.  It strives to do this through the provision of tailored training programmes that suit various needs and access to many training programmes is not determined by a person's welfare status.<\/p><p>  The Department is reviewing a wide range of activation supports available to Department of Social Protection customers, including the BTEA and it is intended to canvass the views of stakeholders as part of the implementation process resulting from the review.<\/p><p>The intention is to canvass the views of stakeholders as part of the implementation process resulting from this review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300033#FF00600","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352830800,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

As the courses they are now pursuing are level six or seven, they do not qualify for support even though they may currently be receiving an equivalent amount through the jobseekers' allowance.

There is a responsibility on politicians and others to weigh up the outcomes of the proposals they make.  The fiscal advisory council has provided the Oireachtas and the public with a huge amount of detailed analysis and data.  Even if I did not support its recommendations, I would say it fulfils a valuable function.  It would be strengthened if it had a responsibility to outline the impact of policies on the aforementioned areas.

As Deputy Doherty noted, we thrashed this issue out on Committee Stage, but it is worth stating my position once again.  The Fiscal Council has been established to address gaps in fiscal policy analysis and provide assessments and recommendations in regard to fiscal policy.  Imposing a wide mandate on the council would require a much greater level of resources in terms of staff and budgetary allocations.  Furthermore, expanding its mandate would be likely to impede its ability to fulfil its core functions, including those specified in the treaty.  It is imperative that the council has the resources it needs to complete its core functions.  Expanding its functions may stretch its resources to a point at which its attention is distracted from its primary role.  We do not want this to happen.  If other functions were to be assigned to the council, legislative amendments would be required.  A number of bodies already supported by the State, such as the ESRI and the National Economic and Social Council, produce reports which consider all aspects of policy development, including social impacts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300034#GG01000","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1352830800,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I support the amendment.  When this compact was first presented, the emphasis was almost entirely on debt and deficit reduction.  These are the key targets defined in the treaty.  However, pressure from popular opinion, protests and alternative analyses by economists has slowly but surely started to shift the powers that be from their sole focus on debt and deficit targets while ignoring the impact on economic growth, unemployment and public services.  The Government has claimed that it is among the leading advocates in the European Union of emphasising growth and jobs in order to counterbalance the austerity required in meeting these targets.  In developing the Fiscal Council's role, is it not reasonable to require it to consider the matters set out in the amendment?  Even the IMF has now acknowledged that the impact of austerity was much worse than initially anticipated and that it will ultimately affect economic growth, thereby increasing the difficulty of meeting the very targets set out in the treaty.  If growth does not occur we may not be able to meet the targets.  In that context, it is reasonable to widen the role of the council to include a focus on the impact of financial and economic policies on these areas.<\/p><p>  The resource argument is not compelling.  The fiscal advisory council was at pains to tell us that its costs were not significant.  I do not think its members receive any payments other than certain expenses.  What are the resource implications of broadening its mandate or even bringing other organisations onto the council to offer a closer focus on growth and employment than the particular economists chosen by the Minister might bring?  The amendment appears to be minimal in terms of expanding the council's mandate to include assessments of growth and employment.

On amendment No. 13, the Minister said we could arrange this with the Whips, and that is fine.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform already has discussions with the Fiscal Council on its reports.  They are discussions, not debates - a significant difference.<\/p><p>  This amendment would place an obligation on this Chamber to have debates on the reports of the council.  The Fiscal Council would continue to issue reports as it has done in the past.  The amendment would not oblige the House to have a debate on any of those reports, although we can have one if we so desire with the agreement of the Whips.  The amendment is specific to section 8(3) of the Bill, which states that assessments issued by the Fiscal Council must state whether exceptional circumstances exist or no longer exist - which is significant, because the targets need not be met in exceptional circumstances; whether there is a failure to reach the targets as defined within section 6(1); or whether, during any period under the plan, progress is being made in accordance with the plan.  Such a report would be big stuff.  That is not to diminish any of the other reports the Fiscal Council would issue in the meantime.  Its proposals on budgetary matters are significant.  However, this is about complying with the legislation and with the treaty that has been passed in the State.  It is not a routine report.  Hopefully, this report will never need to be issued and we will not have to develop plans.  I hope there will be growth in the economy and we will see these issues dealt with through those measures.  However, in the event that exceptional circumstances do exist or that there is non-compliance with section 6(1) in the eyes of the Fiscal Council, it must issue a report.  The provision states that if the Government agrees with the report, there will be no debate.  However, if the Government disagrees with the report, it must, within two months of the report's publication, lay before the D\u00e1il its assessment of why it does not agree.<\/p><p>  This amendment is quite small.  Basically, it suggests that given the significance of this, we should allow for a debate.  I am the last person to want to tie the House up in debate after debate, but this would be in the event of a significant report from the Fiscal Council with regard to the core issue of the treaty and the legislation.  The Minister is correct in stating that if the Whips get together and agree this it is fine, but where the advice is not complied with, which would put us in breach of the treaty obligations, there should be a debate in the House.  That should be the norm.<\/p><p>  We both know that if the Fiscal Council were to issue a report on these issues and the government of the day rejected it, a debate would take place.  Any fair-minded person believes that is the case.  However, we cannot predict a situation in which a future government might be in unique circumstances and might decide not to have a debate.  This amendment just establishes a safeguard by providing that this House of the Oireachtas debate such a significant decision, given that such a report is being rejected by the government of the day despite the fact that it is core to the European obligations to which we signed up in the referendum.

It might be self-evident for all of us in the House, but it is no exaggeration to say that the provisions of the Bill impinge on the lives and economic prospects of hundreds of thousands of people right across the State.  Its measures will have an impact on the social and economic lifeblood of hundreds of communities in this country, including the people of Louth and east Meath whom I represent.<\/p><p>  The credit union movement is often the glue that keeps communities together.  It was founded on the ethos which informs and influences my political thinking and philosophy and those of many Members of this House, namely, solidarity, fairness and equality of opportunity.  I favour a description used by others which states that local credit unions are the people&#8217;s banks.  When banks were inaccessible and unwelcoming places for many in my community, the credit union took on the mantle of lender and savings institution of first and often only resort for the majority of people who work for a living.<\/p><p>  No organisation or institution has been left untouched by the economic collapse in this country.  That includes a number of credit unions.  There is a necessity to regulate and manage appropriately and proportionately and a requirement to ensure the highest standards of governance apply to this sector as well as to all of the other significant financial institutions active in the State.  In accepting that, I am anxious to point out that the panoply of provisions contained in the legislation must be at one with the need to maintain and support the strong and unique ethos and philosophy of the credit union structure.  When we emerge, as we are doing, from the economic crisis, we must be sure we do so in a way that, to coin a phrase, does not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  There is a growing role to be played in developing the social economy in this country.  There appears to be a fear in the credit union movement currently, as a result of the risk assessment models which will be applied and which are implicit in the Bill, that credit unions may be prevented from prudently lending to community-based companies that may, for example, have access to State funding and thus are to some extent supported by the State.  From my experience I am aware that credit unions have responsibly engaged in lending processes with sporting, social and cultural institutions and would do so again because it complies with their unique ethos, <i>modus operandi<\/i> and philosophy.  Crucially, it represented good business for them in many cases.<\/p><p>  It is important to allay the concerns expressed by some across the country.  I am sure the opportunity will be taken to do that.  We will proceed with the legislation.  Nobody should have anything to fear from it.  However, concerns that prove to be legitimate and valid should be addressed.  I urge the Minister to accept sensible amendments where they allow a balance between the need for a robust regulatory regime and the continuation of a successful credit union movement based on the kind of community-based philosophy that most Members of this House support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300038#LL00200","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1352832600,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Credit Union Bill.  I am more than aware of the significant role each credit union has played and continues to play every day in communities across the country.  I have been a lifelong member of a credit union.<\/p><p>  The Bill will strengthen the regulatory framework for credit unions and provide the basis for a restructuring of the sector over time, which will protect credit union members.  Such protection is of vital importance.  Credit unions in this country have provided a safe and secure depository for savings of both low and middle-income families, and are a source of lending.  They are for many a financial haven, one of the first places to which we turn in times of financial difficulty or hardship.  As we are aware, it was the basis of communities at a time when many families and individuals were not entertained by the banks.  The only place to which one could turn was the credit union.<\/p><p>  Many credit unions had their humble beginnings in parish halls.  They now have more than \u20ac15 billion in customer deposits and remain open for business.  It is important this message is conveyed.  It is important also to convey the message that deposits of individual credit union customers are secure, as the \u20ac100,000 deposit guarantee scheme applies also to credit unions.  Therefore, individual savings are protected.  One of the primary aims of the Bill must be the protection of its members.<\/p><p>  A core recommendation of the Commission on Credit Unions was that the credit union sector should be restructured.  Part 3 of the Bill deals with restructuring.  Section 41 establishes a credit union restructuring board to exercise the functions assigned to it by this Part.  As per section 41(3), the &quot;ReBo&quot; will be a body corporate with the power to sue and be sued.  The creation of a restructuring board which will facilitate and implement restructuring on a voluntary basis is a welcome move.  The idea that strong credit unions will be used to support restructuring is a sensible approach to what could be described as an intricate undertaking.  One must also acknowledge the necessity of controls, in the public interest, on the management of credit unions.  I hope the statutory governance and statutory stabilisation provisions will reflect good practice in other countries.<\/p><p>  Credit unions have also been affected by the economic downturn in this country, although it must be noted that the degree of the problems in the sector cannot in any way be compared to those of other financial institutions.  I am a great believer in the saying &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;  If I were to be in any way critical of the Bill, which has been broadly accepted by the management teams of credit unions, the Irish League of Credit Unions and other interested parties, it would be in the area of regulation.  One must admire the huge voluntary and civic role played by so many people right around the country in making credit unions possible.  For that reason, I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has conferred to such an extent with the positive people in the Irish League of Credit Unions in preparing the Bill.  He has acknowledged that their input is reflected in specific recommendations in the commission report, which were agreed with credit union stakeholders.  However, I am concerned that the Central Bank may be too involved in the regulatory process.  One of the recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions was that the new credit union legislative framework should provide the Central Bank with powers to make regulations that set prudential controls, limits, standards and requirements for credit unions.  While recognising this, we must uphold what the credit union represents at the coalface and what we could turn it into.  In his statement, the Minister indicated that the regulatory requirements would be calibrated according to the &quot;nature, scale and complexity&quot; of credit unions, allowing for the tiered regulation approach recommended by the Commission on Credit Unions.<\/p><p>  I commend the Minister on the provision of \u20ac500 million in support of the credit union sector.  The importance of credit unions lies in the fact that they are rooted in the community.  We would very much like to keep them there.  We have all appreciated their hands-on approach when people go down on a Friday to seek a loan or pay a subscription.  It is a private and one-to-one approach that I would like to see continued as far as possible.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300038#LL00300","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1352832600,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan, Thomas Pringle, Richard Boyd Barrett, Mattie McGrath and Michael Healy-Rae.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300038#LL00400","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1352832600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

That could come back to bite us.<\/p><p>  The credit union movement started in this country in the 1950s, a time very similar to now, with poverty and emigration, and a difficult time for the construction industry.  It was very much a response to pawnshops and moneylending, and it fulfilled a need.  Part of the reason the credit union movement has been so successful over the decades is that it was built in communities in which people knew each other.  That is as much a strength as it is a weakness.  I would like to see that strength at local level being knitted into our political structure, because of the trust involved.  The credit union movement is a good example of this, as are the GAA and other organisations.<\/p><p>  Although there have been failures in the movement and I have no doubt there is need for regulation, these factors pale into insignificance when the movement is compared to the so-called pillar banks.  There is a demonstrated trust in the community where people live.  In a survey done not long ago, people were asked what was the first payment they made.  Credit union loans were preferred to loans from banks.  I do not doubt there are bad loans in credit unions, even in sizeable numbers, but this response shows a respect for the movement.<\/p><p>  I am concerned by the recommendations for governance and term limits.  The implication is that there is an endless stream of volunteers.  We could quickly run into serious problems because we are setting up some of the credit unions to fail.  There are to be limits on the number of people and a strict regulatory regime is to be put in place.  Another point at issue is the kind of authority involved.  The Bill contains many instances of &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;may&quot;, which will obviously be teased out on Committee Stage.  It is not at all clear what role the Central Bank will play, nor how strict it will be.  We must be specific in that regard if we are to be fair to the credit union movement.  <\/p><p>  I refer to the sharing of services.  It is good that some services are to be shared, because that will cut costs, but some measures that could be positive, such as debit cards, cannot be shared.  Such a measure could allow the credit union movement to offer real competition to the banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300039#MM00100","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1352833200,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I was a member of the ASTI credit union for many years and also come from a community, East Wall, where there has been a strong credit union since 1968.  There was a great tradition of savings made by parents in the community.  They saved and borrowed and passed that practice on to their children, who in turn kept the tradition going.  In addition, there was a great voluntary effort in the community in regard to both the work of the credit union and the work of the board.  There is merit in the proverb about throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  When it comes to reform and change, it is vital that we hold on to what is good and positive, that we maintain and strengthen those features and that we do not lose good practice.<\/p><p>  One of those strengths, as borne out by my experience, is in the area of loans.  Unlike the banks in the Celtic tiger years, credit unions did not give out 100% loans.  According to credit union standards and regulations, loans were related to savings and there had to be a certain amount in a member's savings account before he or she was allowed to borrow money.  There is an irony in the attempt to apply standards from the banks, which have been a dismal failure, to an institution which was working efficiently and which, had there not been recession and unemployment, would now be doing extremely well.  Credit unions did not over-extend or get involved in banking excesses, greed or irresponsibility.  They were there for their communities and have done far more than banks to create a positive awareness of saving money, even at times when people did not have much money or surplus cash.  They were there to give loans that were commensurate with people's ability to repay them, a central tenet of the credit union movement.  They looked after expenses such as Christmas, weddings, the house extension, the car and the holiday.<\/p><p>  Most of the time since the founding of the movement, all of this has all gone on in an ethical and responsible way.  People in communities did not go in fear and trepidation to their credit union as they did to their bank manager.  Credit unions were  helpful and sympathetic.  A point made to me in my local credit union was that people came along in a neighbourly and sympathetic way.  Today, banks are trying to do away with that personal service.  Branches are closing and there is a changeover in personnel.  When one goes into a bank one is directed to a machine rather than a person.  Credit unions have a personal touch which must be maintained.  They have definite characteristics which I hope will not be lost in the Bill.<\/p><p>  I understand credit unions are 90% in favour of the Bill, but there are some questions.  Why are we applying so much in terms of banking regulation to an institution that has been working for more than 70 years?  Why are we applying secondary legislation to the credit union, which has a different ethos?  I refer to the issue of shared services.  Why is this limited to sharing at member level?  In electronic payments, where is the risk in a prepaid debit card?  Why can credit unions not use the significant amount of cash they have on deposit in the banks?  They may be propping up the banks for social benefit.<\/p><p>  Credit unions were founded on the principle of voluntarism.  They placed an advertisement in newspapers today that asks &quot;Why would you bin your most valuable asset?&quot;.  Their most valuable asset is the volunteers.  I am all for preventing conflicts of interest, but where is the conflict if a person who is a member of one credit union wishes to serve on the board of another?  That person is not allowed to do so.<\/p><p>  Inner-city Dublin is plagued by moneylenders who charge huge rates of interest and trap families.  There are credit institutions now that offer the same rates.  Credit unions are vital, and I hope their ethos and status can be maintained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300039#MM00200","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1352833200,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Credit Union Bill.  The credit union movement is one of the largest voluntary organisations in the country.  In many areas, credit unions are the only source of loan finance for many people who have difficulty accessing bank services.  Many of them probably would not want to access those services in any case.  There is great distrust of banks and financial institutions throughout the country, but in most cases credit unions have retained the full support of local communities because they are owned by the members, are run for their benefit and provide services to them.  Banks are not there to serve their customers but to make large profits and look after their shareholders.  That is the critical difference between the credit unions and the bank system.<\/p><p>  It is a mistake to apply in this legislation the full raft of regulations from the Central Bank when there have been 70 years of regulation of the credit union sector.  The legislation should recognise that this sector is different and has a different role to play in society.  This role could be developed to make it stronger and even more important.  What we need to develop is an alternative to the banking system.  Credit unions have the potential to play that role as they are owned by and work for their communities.  If we protect that ethos in legislation and in Government policy, we can ensure that we develop an alternative to the banking system - a credit union system that works on behalf of its members.  In order to do that, credit unions need to be able to access the clearing system of the banks and introduce services such as debit cards and direct debits, allowing people to serve their financial needs through the credit union system.<\/p><p>  It is crazy that while banks are closing branches throughout the country, removing services from their customers and forcing elderly people to use the so-called hole in the wall to make deposits and carry out other financial requirements, credit unions are required to lodge their funds in banks.  Banks can withdraw their services safe in the knowledge that if people save money in the credit union, that money will be given to them on deposit so they can use it for whatever they want.  In the past we saw how they used it to the detriment of everybody.  If we allowed credit unions to access the clearing system and provide services for non-members and other legal entities, that would ensure the development of an alternative to the banking system.  The banks would certainly fight this tooth and nail because they would not want to see a viable and real alternative that was in the ownership of local communities and individuals rather than under their own corporate ownership.<\/p><p>It would be of major service to the country if the credit union movement could be developed into such an alternative model.  A third financial pillar of this nature could provide real services for real people.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister to consider, between now and Committee Stage, allowing credit unions to provide services for people who cannot, for whatever reason, access their own credit union.  I refer to individuals who may find themselves some distance from their credit union and may wish to withdraw or lodge money.  It seems nonsensical to refuse to allow people to do this.<\/p><p> Credit unions have loan-to-deposit ratios of 40%.  In other words, only 40% of the funds held by credit unions are out on loan at any one time.  Earlier today those at Bank of Ireland were patting themselves on the back because that institution is on target to reach a loan-to-deposit ratio of 130%.  Rather than being used to prop up or recapitalise the banks, the money held by the credit unions could be used for community and Government-supported projects.  If, for example, credit unions were allowed to invest in community wind farm projects, this would generate both a revenue stream and a return for them.  Credit unions could also be allowed to invest in Government-supported and guaranteed projects.  This would be of assistance in dealing with the infrastructural deficit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300039#MM00300","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352833800,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The way in which the Government is dealing with the credit unions and the way this debate is being conducted is both telling and instructive, particularly when one considers how it deals with the banks, other financial institutions and the IFSC Clearing House Group.  The latter ensures the policies of big for-profit financial institutions are translated, almost word for word, into Government policy.<\/p><p>  The Bill before the House has the potential to do serious damage to the ethos of the credit union movement, which is deeply ironic.  We must ask whether credit unions should be made to look more like the banks more or whether the banks should be made to resemble the credit unions more closely.  Do we not need a financial system which operates much more along the lines of the model offered by credit unions rather than on the basis of the for-profit ethos of the banks and major financial institutions which caused the economic crash?  Most ordinary and sensible people would say the credit union movement offers the sort of model we require.<\/p><p>  It was not the credit unions that got us into the current crisis.  They offer an alternative model for a financial and banking system, but some of the measures contained in the Bill seriously threaten to undermine their ethos.  These measures will also give rise to the possibility of some credit unions either being forced to close or merge with each other.  Furthermore, they will undermine the democratic principle which lies at the heart of the credit union movement.<\/p><p>  As a result of the fact that a guillotine is being imposed on Second Stage, we do not have the time to elaborate on the issues involved.  That is outrageous, particularly as we were only informed about the use of the guillotine at the last minute.  The term limits being imposed by the Minister seriously threaten to undermine the volunteer basis on which credit unions are run and will be particularly detrimental to small credit unions.  The prohibition on family members serving on the boards and committees of credit unions also seriously threatens to undermine the volunteer basis on which the movement operates.  The move to abolish the position of treasurer will shift the balance away from members controlling credit unions and towards full-time managers doing so.<\/p><p>  The imposition of decades' worth of banking legislation on the credit unions is a serious mistake.  It is also a misapplication of the type of regulation needed for the out of control banking sector but which is not required for the very sensible and functioning credit union movement.  The regulation to which I refer may well threaten to undermine that movement.  Credit unions only lend approximately 40% of the money they hold.  Rather than being obliged to deposit that money in the banks or send it to other countries, they want to be able to use it to finance valuable community projects.  They also want to lend it to the Government in order that it might initiate job creation projects, etc.  However, the credit unions are not being facilitated in this regard.  As the previous speaker indicated, credit unions want provision to be made for the sharing of services in order that their members might access such services in their own credit unions but also at others throughout the country.  It was promised that the legislation before the House would facilitate the sharing of services.  However, it does not contain specific provisions in that regard.<\/p><p>  There are many other issues which arise.  I urge the Minister to listen to the credit unions and their members and pay heed to their ethos.  Credit unions offer a model that the for-profit banks have completely failed to offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300040#NN00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1352833800,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Credit Union Bill 2012.  I object to the fact that a guillotine is being imposed on the debate on the legislation.  When the previous Government was in power, those in opposition complained day in and day out about the imposition of the guillotine.  The Administration has used the guillotine more than any other in my experience, although I accept that this is only my second term as a Member.  The Government is running with the idea of the use of the guillotine.<\/p><p>  There is a need for legislation to deal with the banks.  Such legislation was not put in place in the past.  The financial regulators were asleep on the job and subsequently went off with their rewards.  Mr. Kevin Cardiff, formerly of the Department of Finance, ended up working with the European Court of Auditors.<\/p><p>  The Minister should not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  I salute the credit unions throughout the country which, in the main, are run by ordinary people on voluntary boards.  The credit unions helped ordinary families to survive in the bad times before the boom.  During that boom, they did not go mad and offer people 100% funding.  They displayed sanity at the time.  Credit unions provide people with money for their children's christenings and First Holy Communion, to help them build extensions to their homes, pay for schoolbooks, etc.  I am sure that today they are offering loans to ensure many of our students can attend college because that lady, SUSI - Student Universal Support Ireland - on whom we cannot get a handle does not appear to be able to cope.  The lady to whom I refer should have triplets to help her to deal with the problem.  I do not intend what I am saying in this regard in a frivolous way.<\/p><p>  We must support the credit unions.  I accept that one or two may have strayed to some degree and these should be dealt with.  However, we do not need to introduce a raft of legislation to drive the credit unions into the ground and kill community involvement and community initiatives.  What we need is to see a return of the meitheal.  People must support one another and their credit unions must support them.  I appeal to the Minister to make haste slowly.  Legislation is needed to deal with those whom we might term &quot;gangsters&quot; or &quot;banksters&quot;.  However, it is not required for the credit unions which are of good standing and doing their best.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to that fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300040#NN00300","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1352833800,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the Technical Group and Deputy Mattie McGrath for sharing time.  I compliment the credit union movement and the 3 million who avail of the excellent service it offers on a daily basis.  Credit unions operate prudent saving and lending policies.  Theirs is a vital service which is provided by the community for the community.<\/p><p>  Despite statements to the contrary, very little real consultation has taken place with ordinary credit union activists who are now genuinely concerned about the consequences the proposed changes contained in the Bill will have for their credit unions and, more importantly, individual members.  The proposals to introduce term limits and overly restrictive conditions on board membership will have major implications for recruitment of new directors in the future.  There are also huge difficulties in the context of implementation of the proposed policy under which the prior approval of the Central Bank will be required for nominees going forward for election to officer positions.  Further restrictions on the tenure of the chairman of a credit union, as well as additional responsibilities in the monitoring his or her fellow directors, will give rise to serious difficulties for credit unions.<\/p><p>  The requirement being placed on credit unions to appoint remuneration committees appears to indicate that the directors of the future will be paid for their services.  This will impose further costs on credit unions and sound the death knell for voluntarism within the movement.  Despite the fact that directors will remain responsible for the control and direction of credit unions, the significant post of treasurer will be abolished.  One would have thought that at a time when the clamour for corporate accountability and openness is deafening, the post of treasurer which provides credit union boards with the required degree of oversight and inquiry would be retained in some form.  Furthermore, it is the treasurer who reports on behalf of the board on a credit union's performance to the general membership at its AGM.  As a result, treasurers have a special relationship with the members of credit unions.<\/p><p>  I salute the credit unions and hope they will be in place for a long time.  They have proved to be far more sensible and prudent than the banks.  If they had more to do with banking, we would not be in the mess in which we find ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300040#NN00400","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1352834400,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor who is sharing time with Deputies \u00c1ine Collins, Peter Mathews, Martin Heydon and Se\u00e1n Kyne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300041#OO00100","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1352834400,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Imelda May has jazzed up the credit union image.  The recent advertisements highlight the fact that credit unions know their customers, that they care about their needs and that they are at the centre of their communities.  This is true of the credit unions in the constituency of D\u00fan Laoghaire.  The credit union movement tag line, &quot;We look at things differently&quot;, is its main selling point.  Credit unions look at their market differently; they look at profit-making differently an d they look at their customers differently.  Unfortunately, they, too, were affected by the economic crisis.  They have experienced investment losses and an increase in bad debt losses.  The Irish League of Credit Unions which represents the majority but not all credit unions had a deficit of &#8364;45.691 million in 2010, compared to a surplus of &#8364;15.394 million in 2009.  The economic crisis is making it difficult for credit unions to retain their unique co-operative character. Credit unions are a vital part of the financial system.  They are a distinct alternative to other providers of credit such as banks, particularly in the current financial climate.  There are over 3 million credit union members in 404 credit unions.  This fact, coupled with total assets of the Irish League of Credit Unions of &#8364;13.9 billion in 2010, makes regulatory reform a very important undertaking.<\/p><p>  The Credit Union Bill acknowledges this reality.  It sets out a framework for the prudential requirements to apply to credit unions.  It sets out requirements for reserves, liquidity, lending and risk management.  It also provides scope for Central Bank regulation of standard procedures and other more detailed matters.  This must be a welcome advancement.  In total, it gives effect to over 60 of the<i><\/i>recommendations made in the final report of the Commission on Credit Unions.  The commission comprised experts in the field, including the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association and the Credit Union Managers Association.  They had an opportunity to voice their concerns and make recommendations.  They were listened to and their expertise was drawn on, respected and utilised.<\/p><p>  The Department of Finance also engaged in public consultation on the general scheme of the Bill.  This allowed stakeholders an opportunity<sup><\/sup>to make submissions to help to inform and develop the legislation  In addition, the Joint committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform met stakeholders to discuss the Bill, as published.<\/p><p>  Care and consideration have been given to this important legislation because credit unions are at the centre of their communities.  Credit unions are a vital financial institution for many.  Credit union staff and boards do their best to better the lives of the people in their communities.<\/p><p>  Part 2 of the Bill deals with governance issues.  In my experience, all the credit unions in D\u00fan Laoghaire-Rathdown are very professional in their conduct.  However, it will be beneficial for credit unions to have proper governance rules laid down.  Section 53 states directors of credit unions must be suitably qualified to undertake their role.  This is a common-sense regulation.  <\/p><p>  I ask the Minister to comment or write to me on an aspect raised by a credit union in my constituency - the guidance note on investments by credit unions published in 2006.  Credit unions are allowed a 24 month period in which to bring their investment portfolio exposures into compliance with the single institution exposure limit contained in the guidance note.  I ask the Minister to come back to me on this aspect.  The credit unions are extremely concerned that it will limit them to one or two institutions in Ireland and that they will be forced to look abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300041#OO00200","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1352834400,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Recently available statistics show clearly that citizens and communities trust their credit union.  They appreciate that credit unions are non-profit making, community-based organisations run by community volunteers.  People who borrowed from their local credit union are making Trojan efforts to repay their loans.  This demonstrates how people do not regard credit unions in the same way as they regard banks.  They have not lost trust in credit unions in the same way as they have lost trust in banks.  They realise credit unions are there to serve them and their communities.  They know that they provide a very beneficial local service.  Very often credit unions provide credit lines for people with whom the banks would not necessarily deal.  Generally, the types of loans given are different from those given by the banks.  During the boom years a minority of credit unions got caught up in the madness, with a few lending more money than was wise for projects that were not really within the remit of credit union lending policy.  However, only a minority of credit unions behaved in this manner.  The economic situation in the country was bound to affect, to a certain extent, the ability of its members to repay loans.  For that reason, the Minister for Finance has committed to recapitalising the credit unions by \u20ac500 million and up to \u20ac1 billion, if necessary.  In the mad noughties there was a perception that there was no end to the money available, but the credit unions have emerged relatively well.  This must be considered in the context that there are 399 registered credit unions and 3 million members throughout the country.  We all accept that financial regulation is necessary, but, as has been proved, credit unions are not banks and cannot and should not be treated in the same way.  A credit union is a voluntary, member-owned organisation where people save and lend to each other at affordable rates of interest.<\/p><p>  The Bill provides that the Central Bank will be the regulatory authority which will set the requirements and standards in various areas, including reserves, liquidity, lending and risk management.  The Bill gives the bank the power to make regulations, but these regulations will only be made following consultation with the Minister the Finance, the Credit Union Advisory Committee and the credit union representative bodies.  Therefore, the credit union movement will have a say in how the bank drafts and implements the regulations.  The Bill is only the beginning of this process.  In this context, it is imperative that the bank continue to recognise the uniqueness of credit unions as institutions based in communities and working for individuals living in them.  The Central Bank is a key institution of the State.  It must take into account the spirit in which the Oireachtas means this legislation to be interpreted, just as the Supreme Court takes account of Oireachtas debates when deciding on constitutional issues.  There is a danger that because most of the bank's emphasis will, of necessity, be on regulating profit-making financial institutions, it may overlook the unique place in society and the distinct style of the credit union movement.  Any regulation can only be introduced or changed over time after serious consultation and agreement with the representatives of the credit unions.<\/p><p>  The Minister and all Members recognise the uniqueness and importance of credit unions, especially in an economy that has lost faith in the banking system.  I have read the submissions from the various credit union representatives and some progress has been made in dealing with their concerns.  I am confident that as the Bill passes through this and the other House more progress can be made in reconciling both sides of the argument.  I am sure the final outcome will be in the best interests of credit unions and their continued valuable service to local communities.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300041#OO00300","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speech","time":1352834400,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution to this debate.

The Bill will provide a framework which has been well discussed and researched and is appropriate to the conditions that obtain in the wake of the the financial meltdown which has affected the entire economy.<\/p><p>  I use the opportunity to read an email I received from a constituent because it sets out the context and the inter-relationship where credit unions provide money, where the banks have failed in their objectives in recent years and where we are now trying to negotiate a restructuring and recalibration of the entire financial system in this country, to include a writing down of debt in order that households and families can get on with normal business and normal life.

I spoke last year in the House on the credit union movement, its unique place in society and the important role of voluntarism.  I firmly believe that now more than ever, when so many individuals have lost faith and trust in many of the banking institutions, that the credit union movement needs to be supported and strengthened in order that it can act as a trusted alternative.  This is one of the fundamental purposes of the Bill.<\/p><p>  I note from a recent article by Mr. Kieron Brennan of the Irish League of Credit Unions that credit unions continue to welcome new members every day.  More than 40,000 new members joined credit unions last year.  This is a strong testament to the ethos and core values of the credit unions that we need to retain.<\/p><p>  Obviously we all recognise that, with the \u20ac500 million the State has set aside, we must change and develop as new regulations come into force.  However, while trying to set out the terms of restructuring and increased oversight of the movement, we should not lose sight of the many positives associated with the 403 credit unions in communities throughout Ireland.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the long process engaged in and the excellent work carried out by the Commission on Credit Unions on the recommendations of which much of the Bill is based.  The process of direct engagement, consultation and surveys of stakeholders on the sensitive issues involved is an example that could be used in many other scenarios and lays a strong foundation for many of the provisions included in the Bill.<\/p><p>  I have met representatives of the credit unions in Kildare South and taken on board many of their concerns about the changes proposed, some of which I would like to address.  The tiered system of regulation is a welcome initiative, but we need to ensure the tiers are set at appropriate levels.  I am aware of two very diffident credit unions in Kildare, one with 4,500 members and assets worth not much more than \u20ac10 million and another with over 20,000 members and assets worth just under \u20ac100 million.  Obviously, the issues facing these two credit unions are different and any tiered regulation system would need to reflect these differences.  Tiers need to be about more than asset size alone.<\/p><p>  Like many other financial institutions, the credit unions are dealing with many more arrears cases than before and need to be given the flexibility to be able to assist their members as much as possible.  We are constantly encouraging the mainstream banks to engage with those in arrears and come up with flexible solutions.  Credit unions are no different.  If we do not provide for this flexibility within the tried and trusted credit union model, we will inevitably drive more of those in financial difficulties into the hands of illegal and completely unregulated moneylenders.<\/p><p>  The investment model for the credit unions needs to be addressed to allow some funds to move from short-term liquid investments.  I welcome recent comments by the Minister indicating that he is open to proposals from the credit union movement on the issue of investment in schemes with a social function.  I look forward to seeing these being developed.<\/p><p>  Let me mention Newbridge Credit Union, with which the Minister is familiar.  While the special manager continues to carry out his role, the members have great concerns and their frustration is increasing on foot of the lack of communication or information from the manager on the ongoing financial review process.  Members who will foot the considerable cost of having the manager appointed are very anxious for an AGM to be held in order that they can receive some information and have their concerns heard - never mind the fact that they have not being paid a dividend for two years.<\/p><p>  I welcome the commitment shown by the Government to the credit union movement with the setting aside of \u20ac500 million to address problems within the sector at a time when there are many calls on public funds.  In the 1950s the founders of the credit union movement recognised the considerable difficulties and lack of confidence caused by mismanagement and the lack of money.  They resolved to identify a system that would allow people to gain more control over their finances.  Now, almost 60 years later, the same principles apply.  There is a great need for credit unions.  We need to ensure the legislation and regulatory framework created to secure their viability are particularly suited to them and allow them to continue to function as intended.  I look forward to working with them and their members to ensure that this is so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300042#PP00200","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1352835000,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Credit unions play an extremely significant role in Irish life and have done so for over 50 years.  The innovative institutions have opened up financial services to large sections of society previously ignored by banks.  Figures from the World Council of Credit Unions clearly demonstrate the considerable significance of credit unions in Ireland by revealing that over 3 million citizens are members of some 500 unions across the country.  This is in stark contrast with the data for Britain which show that fewer than 1 million out of a population of 60 million are members of credit unions.  Inevitably, the absence of credit unions has increased social exclusion and compounded poverty and disadvantage in other countries.<\/p><p>  As we are all too well aware, the financial and banking sector has experienced serious problems in recent years, with negative impacts in all areas of our society.  A major cause of these problems has been a failure of regulation.  Much work has been undertaken to rectify the regulatory shortcomings in the banking sector, with a corresponding financial investment by taxpayers.<\/p><p>  Credit unions have, understandably, been affected by the challenging economic conditions, with some experiencing substantial falls in income and the appearance of deficits.  Most will agree that circumstances have changed since the last comprehensive statutory framework was put in place in 1997.  Various changes were permitted to enable credit unions offer services which were more traditionally associated with banks such as the introduction of ATM cards and the provision of mortgages for the purchasing of property.  Within this context, some credit unions grew substantially in size and gradually became exposed and vulnerable to problems more traditionally associated with banks, including bad debts, arrears in repayments and so forth.<\/p><p>  It is in the face of these issues which require urgent attention that the Credit Union Bill has been introduced.  There are many positive aspects to the Bill and it must be noted that it incorporates many of the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on Credit Unions, which recommendations included a public consultation process.  The Bill will promote prudent, responsible activities in the core functions of credit unions, safeguard members' savings and promote sound, sustainable lending practices.  It will provide for enhanced governance structures and independent regulation which will also protect members and bring greater stability to the sector.  However, we need to realise the possible and probable impact of certain provisions of the Bill on many smaller, more community-focused and often but not exclusively rural credit unions.<\/p><p>  I have received a number of communications, including from the Irish League of Credit Unions and local credit unions, including the Cashel-Connemara Credit Union and St. Columba's Credit Union.  I met representatives of the latter some weeks ago and listened to their concerns.  As many of them have been highlighted by other Deputies, I will highlight just a few.  The representatives are anxious that the office of treasurer be retained in law for the purposes of ensuring the timely preparation of accounts and their presentation to the committee.  Other issues include the application of Central Bank-related legislation, dating back 70 years, and the need for a memorandum of understanding between the credit unions and the Central Bank to allow for proportionate and transparent regulation.  A number of other measures are suggested in the communications from a variety of credit unions that I will not highlight now, but I am sure they were forwarded to the Minister who I hope will take them on board.<\/p><p>  While the Credit Union Bill contains many sensible provisions which will help to strengthen the sector and safeguard the many credit unions in communities across the nation, we must listen to the concerns of credit union members, staff and representative organisations.  We must examine their concerns and act proportionately to ensure the Bill achieves its objectives and that it will not cause us to lose sight of the fact that credit unions are volunteer-run, member-owned organisations which provide access to financial services for all in a not-for-profit community-focused way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300042#PP00300","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1352835000,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Education Funding: Motion [Private Members]","time":1352835600,"counter":500,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300043#QQ00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1352835600,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Charlie McConalogue who I understand is sharing time with Deputies Miche\u00e1l Martin, Robert Troy and Barry Cowen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300043#QQ00500","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1352835600,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann:<br \/><br \/>agrees that:- the new Student Universal Support Ireland central on-line system for processing student grants is failing abysmally to meet what is required for over 65,000 applications and this is causing undue hardship for third-level students awaiting payments; and<br \/><br \/>- sufficient extra staffing should be supplied immediately to correct this on-going problem so that student grants can be issued by Christmas;recognises that third-level students are facing year-on-year increases in their registration fees which are unfair and unjust in light of a promised reduction in these fees; and<br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to:- refrain from further cuts to the education budget and increases in third-level registration fees;<br \/><br \/>- ensure that all children who require Special Needs Assistants are provided with them;<br \/><br \/>- reinstate the Career Guidance Teacher provision; and<br \/><br \/>- preserve funding to Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools programme schools.<\/blockquote>This motion aims to ensure that the Government moves immediately to address the growing crisis it has overseen in the administration of student grants.  It also asks that the Government keeps the solemn promises it made to students in return for their votes in the midst of the general election campaign and seeks to get the agreement of the D\u00e1il to protect the resourcing of education in the upcoming budget in recognition of the fact that young people in Ireland are entitled to an education and that education should be a key platform on which we build a successful country.<\/p><p>  Much progress has been made in education in recent years but we must build on that.  In the past decade we witnessed a transformation in the provision of education to children and young people with special needs.  From a very small base at the end of the 1990s steady progress has ensured the employment of 10,000 special needs assistants catering for the care needs of children who require their help.  There are now approximately 9,600 learning support and resource teachers in our primary and post-primary schools providing essential teaching support to pupils with special educational needs.<\/p><p>  We have seen significant strides taken in ensuring our young people complete second level education.  That is evidenced by the publication last week of a report by the Department of Education and Skills showing that 90% of students beginning secondary school in 2005-06 went on to complete their education to leaving certificate level in 2010-11.  That is an increase of 9% compared to 11 years previously.  Much of that progress was greatly assisted by the investment in our DEIS schools where the school retention rate increased significantly from 68% to 80%.<\/p><p>  At third level, Ireland has moved rapidly up the ranks of OECD countries in terms of the higher education attainment levels of its adult population, with one third of adults now qualified to higher education level.  We must ensure that progress continues to be built upon.  That will take strong resolve and clear prioritisation of the education budget and ensuring that we continue to fund education properly.  That will not come easily, but it is something we must do.<\/p><p>  While many of the challenges facing us will take real effort to achieve, something that should have been entirely manageable was ensuring that those students at third level who were eligible for a maintenance grant got paid it on time.  As that was so manageable with the right effort, it is a scandal that we are here tonight discussing this issue with over 45,000 students of the 66,000 who applied still waiting to hear whether they will qualify for a maintenance grant let alone be paid their first instalment.<\/p><p>  This crisis has been growing for many weeks but despite the continuing hardship being experienced by students awaiting their grant, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has inexcusably refused to take control of a project which is his responsibility to deliver.  He had no problem stepping up to the podium in early June to announce the creation of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI.  He said at that time that the process is quick and easy and that many students had to wait lengthy periods for their grants in the past and face undue hardship as a result of those delays.  He said that this new system would erase those delays.  He boasted how 65 staff would now do the work previously carried out by the 66 local authorities, 33 vocational education committees and 33 county councils, and how it was a prime example of real public service reform.<\/p><p>  At the start of June SUSI was definitely and proudly the political baby of the Minister, Deputy Quinn, but how things have changed.  Today, the Minister is scrambling to put the blame for the failure of SUSI on anyone but himself.  Once the initial public relations glow disappeared the Minister, Deputy Quinn, no longer had an interest.  As a result of the way this crisis has grown recently, the Oireachtas education committee invited representatives of SUSI to come before it today to examine the situation and how we can get out of it.  As part of that I put the question to the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee as to the number of times the Minister had met personally with SUSI to discuss this situation but the CEO was not in a position to confirm to me that she had sat down with the Minister on this issue in the months since SUSI was established and this problem has been growing.<\/p><p>  The staff and management of SUSI confirmed to us in committee that as of today, 13 November, only 3,010 students of the 66,000 who have applied for a grant - less than 5% - have been paid their grant.  They also confirmed that only 20,000 of that 66,000 have had their applications processed to final stage whereby a decision has been made, and almost half of those have been refused whereas approximately 10,000 have had an indication that they will be awarded a grant.  Of the remainder, with six weeks to go to Christmas, over 40,000 students who applied to SUSI either have got correspondence from it asking for further documentation or in the case of half of that 40,000 their applications have not even been checked by SUSI to determine if it has all the documentation.<\/p><p>  What did the Minister have to say about that?  This morning on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; he stated that he was not entirely sure why there was a delay.  This is the Minister's project to deliver.  Real reform is not just about standing up on the podium and making a grand announcement.  It is about taking responsibility for it and making sure it happens.  The Minister should have sat down with SUSI, which the Minister appointed to do this job and which was obviously getting it wrong, long ago to examine where things were going wrong and to ensure the thousands of students across the country who are waiting on their grant and who are struggling, along with their families, got paid.  Only 3,010 of the 66,000 have been paid their grant and they are struggling.  They have instalments to meet in regard to their student accommodation.  They have not been able to register properly in college.  In recent weeks many of them had little more than visitor rights in the colleges they attend.  They are still photocopying books because they do not have full loan rights in libraries.  They are now facing into their Christmas examinations without having been able to register fully at college.<\/p><p>  The Minister has washed his hands of that.  Instead of taking control he first tried to avoid the issue until he could avoid it no more and it became such a crisis that he had to comment on it.  What did he then do?  All of a sudden SUSI was no longer the Minister's responsibility; it was somebody else's responsibility.  He pointed the finger at City of Dublin VEC and blamed it entirely, washing his hands of it even to the extent that he stated this morning he was not sure what was going on.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, what we found out in committee today from the SUSI representatives was that despite having taken on additional staff it is almost impossible to work out a strategy or a pathway as to how the students currently waiting on their maintenance grant will be paid.<\/p><p>The Minister and the Taoiseach claim these students will somehow be paid by Christmas.  If the Minister teased out the issue as the education committee did today, he would ask how we can process these claims when half the 40,000 students in question have not had their packs checked while the system is still awaiting documentation from the other half.  We also found out today that since it was established, Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, has handled 175,000 telephone calls for 66,000 applications.  This works out at three calls per application on average.  SUSI has 92 staff, 65 staff of its own and 27 from an outsourced agency responsible for scanning the documents.  The volume of phone calls with that number of staff works out at 2,000 calls per member of staff.  If the Minister had to field that number of calls, how would he manage to do any work at all?<\/p><p> This is the type of crisis that has been under way in SUSI while the Minister has paid it no attention.  I hope in this debate the Minister will finally take responsibility for this.  Has he met SUSI in recent weeks to take control of this issue and examine it the way the education committee did today?  I presume he would have arranged to meet the agency representatives when they were in Leinster House today.  It is long past when that should have happened.  It at least needs to happen now.<\/p><p> How will the Minister ensure those students who need their grant payments will get them between now and Christmas?  From looking in great detail at the way SUSI has operated, it seems it does not have a pathway to ensure these students will be paid by Christmas.  If the Minister also examined it in detail, he would see that too.  Political responsibility needs to be taken and the Minister must ensure additional measures are taken in order that students will be paid.  Up until now targets have not been met.  Why should we believe the aspirations expressed today will be met?  It is the Minister\u2019s responsibility to assess and make a judgment on this.  If he believes payments will not be made between now and Christmas, which I believe is the case, he must ensure additional measures will be taken.<\/p><p> SUSI is only processing first-time applicants while county council and vocational education committee staff process existing students.  The latter are almost finished those applications.  There is a real opportunity to engage those staff on a once-off basis to get assistance in dealing with SUSI\u2019s backlog and ensure students do not have to suffer any longer.  However, the Minister has not yet taken the responsibility or the initiative which would see proper control taken of the situation.  Coming out of this, I hope we will see a plan from the Minister.<\/p><p> It is unfortunate this is the first time the Minister has discussed this matter in the Chamber.  The first and only time I ever heard the Minister comment on it was on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; last week when he could not avoid commenting on it anymore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300043#QQ00600","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352836200,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I commented on it this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300044#RR00200","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1352836200,"counter":505,"content":"<p>That was the Minister\u2019s second comment on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300044#RR00300","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1352836200,"counter":506,"content":"<p>That is nothing of which to be proud.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300044#RR00400","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1352836200,"counter":507,"content":"<p>We do not need the Minister absolving himself of responsibility in this matter.<\/p><p>  Our motion refers to promises made by the Minister to students when in opposition and in the midst of an election campaign.  These are similar promises he made on delivering an efficient grants system.  The Minister promised he would not increase the student registration fee and, instead, would reduce it from \u20ac2,000 to \u20ac1,500.  Since he was elected, the Minister has brazenly done a U-turn on this.  Not even being sorry about it, he then said he feels bad about it but that is the way it is.  He had no such problem two weeks before election day when he put pen to paper to sign a pledge not to introduce fees.  As a former Minister for Finance, he should have been well able to do the figures and know such a pledge was not possible given the economic situation.  It is time we saw a different approach from the Minister, one that is not about grand stunts and big announcements but one about taking responsibility for his decisions, delivering on his commitments and the reforms he was going to introduce.  There are 50,000 students and their families suffering because of the Minister\u2019s approach to this issue and his job.  I hope in this debate he will ensure they can see some light at the end of the tunnel and have their financial worries assuaged in the coming weeks before Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300044#RR00500","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1352836200,"counter":508,"content":"<p>During the 20 months the Government has been in office it has consistently sought to avoid responsibility for its own decisions.  It has put out a never-ending stream of press releases praising its members as visionaries who are setting everything right.  This has been accompanied by a constant effort to diminish, ignore and then deny flat-out the clear evidence of bad decisions and policies.  Over recent months, the growing and avoidable crisis which decisions in the health sector are causing has been obvious to everyone.  Even within the Cabinet trust has broken down to the extent that the T\u00e1naiste is having the work of a Minister checked independently.<\/p><p>  The impact of Government decisions on the education sector has not received anywhere near the same attention but this impact is real and growing all the time.  Last year, the Government announced proudly that education had not only been given priority but all front-line education services had been protected.  The truth was exactly the opposite.  No priority was given to education and cuts were specifically targeted at front-line services.  The result is obvious to anyone who cares to look at what is happening at every level of the education system.  It is not just that belts are being tightened.  Deliberate policy decisions are making the system less fair, more exclusive and building problems which will cause lasting damage if left in place.<\/p><p>  No doubt we will hear shortly from Government speakers about how nothing is their fault and everything has been forced on them by a combination of the troika and their predecessors.  They should be warned these speeches, always empty, are now causing the Government's support to fall every time they are used in place of seriously addressing very real problems.  The public can see through the arguments because it can remember the promises made early last year when every last bit of economic data was available to Fine Gael and Labour.  The public can remember the signed pledges and the ringing commitment in the programme for Government that fairness and front-line services in education would be protected.  The public hears and understands the repeated statements of the troika that individual spending decisions are fully at the discretion of the Government.  These are the Government&#8217;s promises.  No one forced it to make them and no one forced it to break them.<\/p><p>  During the election when the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, attended a photo opportunity outside Trinity College Dublin and gave his and Labour's solemn commitment not to increase charges at third level, he knew the fiscal situation.  The only thing which has changed since then is that the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform say things are actually better than planned.  The Minister&#8217;s election pledge was no solo run by an over-eager campaign manager.  It was reinforced by the T\u00e1naiste himself when he said on 19 February 2011: &quot;Labour is opposed to third level fees by either the front door or back door.&quot;<\/p><p>  In this debate we will clearly not hear anything new from the Minister about his cynically made and quickly abandoned promise.  The nature of that promise, its <i>raison d'\u00eatre<\/i> and the manner in which it was carried out was sickening and a new threshold in cynicism.  It is well past time for the Minister to acknowledge what has been done.  The increases in fees which he has implemented are causing real hardship, especially because of his decision to target cuts on maintenance grants at the same time as increasing fees.<\/p><p>The evidence of a significant increase in student hardship in the past year is overwhelming.  The scale is such that the next step will be a fall-off in third level attendance by the most economically marginalised groups.<\/p><p> As we have heard, during the past two months the situation with regard to late payment of grants for those who qualify has become a full crisis.  Many thousands of students have not received their reduced payment because of administrative chaos and problems under the direct control of the Minister.  The Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, system is failing students and the Government should accept and rectify this.  Despite promises given last week by the T\u00e1naiste about students having full access to all they needed in college, we heard last night from students on &quot;The Frontline&quot; that this is not the case.  Since this problem emerged students and families from all parts of the country have been pressing for urgent action.  However, upon examination not one of the lengthy list of press releases and speeches made by the Minister during this time addresses this crisis.<\/p><p> Deputy Charlie McConalogue persisted with parliamentary questions to get to the bottom of this issue and only subsequently did the full truth come out.  At least the relevant Oireachtas committee met staff from SUSI today.  It is obvious to all - it has been for some time - that 65 staff is not enough to deal with more than 66,000 applications.  This needs urgent attention.  The two fee increases implemented under this Government are part of a larger series.  Currently, it is the Minister's intention to increase student fees by far more than any of his predecessors.  In opposition, the Labour Party promised to cut these fees and during the election it promised never to increase them.  Now it is implementing an unprecedented series of five increases.  What makes this a great deal worse is that cutting funding for access to third level is accompanied by targeted cuts at schemes to help disadvantaged students in first and second level.  The Minister has delivered many speeches in which he has said that he will rescue an under-performing system.<\/p><p> Sometimes the Minister's criticisms of the system are balanced and reasonable but more often they have involved putting the worst possible spin on statistics.  Last week he found himself in something of a quandary because he had to release a report showing that school completion had increased significantly to 90% under his predecessors, a vindication of policies during the past decade.  At the same time the greatest improvements were seen in the most disadvantaged schools, the under-performance of boys was being addressed and there was greater equality between different types of schools.  The Minister launched this report in as low-key a way as he could and he did so without acknowledging the work of teachers, parents, communities and public servants in delivering a fairer, more successful system.  He also failed to acknowledge that the DEIS programme is being targeted for cuts precisely when it is delivering major progress.<\/p><p> Although Government speakers will obviously ignore it in their speeches, the facts show that cuts to disadvantaged schemes were first proposed by the Minister in his review of spending dated 9 September 2011.  The cuts which have been implemented since were not imposed reluctantly; they were proposed by the Department as merely removing anomalies and damaging no one.  The cut of 700 career guidance posts was also suggested by the Department last year.  In the internal documentation the cut was referred to as the &quot;termination&quot; of the dedicated guidance service.  When the backlash occurred, the Taoiseach and many Ministers claimed that nothing was being terminated and that schools were simply getting the flexibility they had asked for, an appalling and disgraceful statement to make and the Minister is continuing in this vein.  I have met career guidance teachers and I invite anyone to meet them in schools throughout the country.  There is much talk about cyberbullying, mental health and suicide among young people.  This was a disgraceful act.  It cut at the heart of the infrastructure in our second level schools, which is in place to deal with vulnerable young people.  Teachers and principals will explain that the volume of the issues with which they are dealing is growing.  It was a mistake and it should be reversed.<\/p><p> It was a shame that the Labour Party made that particular cut.  It refers to fairness and equality but it continues to work against these principles in its education policy.  I believe in a greater diversity of patronage at primary level but it is difficult not to compare the time the Government has spent on that issue to the time spent on real equality issues, including those to which I have referred.  We will be setting out a constructive alternative approach to the budget to be announced next month.  We acknowledge the many areas where tough decisions must be implemented but we do not accept that there is no alternative to every decision taken by every Minister.<\/p><p> Education deserves to receive the priority it was promised before the election and in the programme for Government.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael will be held to account by the people for their broken promises, but they will also be held to account if the people see their decisions doing immense damage but do nothing to reverse them.  I call on the Minister to reverse the career guidance decision.  We saw what occurred in Wexford and in certain schools.  Following these events the Department and the Minister made a belated intervention to return hours to the schools involved but this is a generic system-wide issue and it should be applied across the board.  We should not simply wait for incidents to happen, especially with regard to young people in certain schools, and then move to reverse them.  The Minister should acknowledge that this happened.  We know it happened and I have the details on file of the schools concerned in respect of which, because of the cuts and the absence of guidance, the Minister subsequently intervened.  We must be serious.   There is no point in Oireachtas committees meeting with various groups working in the area of mental health when we neglect the one relevant structure in place, a dedicated, ring-fenced service which was doing a good deal of work in terms of helping young people at a vulnerable stage in their lives.  The Minister decided to unilaterally take it out and leave it up to the schools.  A more honest approach would have involved doing it differently or not doing it at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300044#RR00600","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352836800,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Robert Troy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300045#SS00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1352836800,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I propose to share time with Deputy Cowen.

It is a critical issue and it is timely to debate it.  Tonight, tens of thousands of students are waiting to see whether they are eligible for support and funding to attend third level education.  Those lucky enough to know they are eligible must wait until 2013 before they get their payments.  Tonight, tens of thousands of students are looking at this debate and feel totally betrayed by the Minister.  Despite the infamous pledge he made at the gates of Trinity College, the Minister plans to continue to increase fees.  I call on the Minister to be man enough to stand up and use this debate as an opportunity to apologise to the third level students of Ireland for his blatant use of a cynical electioneering plot three weeks out from the general election in February 2011.  At the least the Minister owes the students of Ireland an apology for blatant lies because the students of Ireland turned out to vote for the Labour Party in the majority.<\/p><p>  Last night I attended a meeting held by the students' union in Athlone Institute of Technology.  It is no laughing matter.  They acknowledged that they voted for the Minister in the majority.  They also came out and canvassed for the Labour Party.  When people were signing up to the supplementary register students were opening advocating voting for the Labour Party because they believed it was the party that would protect student supports.  They took the view that not only would the Labour Party not increase student registration fees but it would reverse the previous increase.  This was the party they then wished to see in government.  However, there were not too many Labour Party people in support of the students at the meeting last night.<\/p><p>  There are serious difficulties facing funding at third level.  I understand in 2011 registration fees contributed approximately &#8364;100 million.  The Higher Education Authority predicts that we will need an additional &#8364;500 million to ensure we maintain a first class education system.  I will not be disingenuous in the way the Minister acted prior to the last election.  I acknowledge that the Minister has a difficult job.  However, when we refer to a knowledge economy we must be mindful that we must continue and maintain the level of investment in our education sector.<\/p><p>  One of the strong points of the Irish economy is that we have the highest <i>per capita<\/i> graduate population, that is, people coming out of universities.<\/p><p>Over 32% of the population have graduated with a third level qualification.<\/p><p> I watched &quot;The Frontline&quot; programme last night and heard a party colleague of the Minister refer to him as being one of the most reforming Ministers for Education of all time.  I wonder how reforming he is when his answer to the funding difficulties at third level is to increase fees year after year.  He predicted they would increase right up to 2015.  Entry to third level education should not depend on one's socioeconomic group, rather it should be based on an student's ability, willingness and eagerness to attain a third level education.  We must look at how we can further cut costs and rationalise services, but is it not cynical given that in the four years prior to becoming Minister Deputy Ruair\u00ed stated year after year that he had an alternative to increasing student fees?  I remind him that he is now 20 months in office.  If he has an alternative, will he bring it forward and maintain the promise he made prior to the last general election?<\/p><p> One of the other big issues raised at the meeting last night was that of SUSI.  What is the Government's opinion?  When its establishment was being announced in June, the Minister welcomed it as a great initiative.  Today, during Leaders' Questions, the Taoiseach said it was brilliant, that it had reduced the number of authorities dealing with applications from 66 to one.  Last night a Government Deputy mentioned that there should be a grants officer on every campus in every county.  Of course, at last night's meeting it was indicated that it was the previous Government's fault because SUSI was its idea.  Would the Minister at least acknowledge that it was his responsibility?  He launched it in June and the shambles that it is today is his responsibility.<\/p><p> Last night I listened to horrific stories.  I do not wish to blame the staff of SUSI because it is clear the office is not adequately staff.  It is extremely disappointing to hear from my colleague that in the debacle the Minister has yet to meet the staff responsible for administering the scheme.  That is worrying as thousands of students wait to receive their grants. Only last week a student contacted my constituency office to tell me he was withdrawing from college because he did not have access to college facilities.  He wished to withdraw from college because he did not have the capacity to pay his rent.  The Taoiseach stated today that the Minister had written to the heads of the universities and third level colleges to ask them to ensure students would retain access to facilities.  As of last night, at Athlone Institute of Technology that was not the case.  I ask the Minister to bring up that matter again.<\/p><p> Last night I spoke to students encountering difficulties in applying for the back-to-education allowance because they did not have proof of registration for the local social welfare office.  Perhaps the Minister might speak to his Cabinet colleague about this.  Also last night there was the unbelievable story of Fr. Shay Casey, the welfare officer at Athlone Institute of Technology, who stated there was no money left in the hardship fund-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300045#SS00500","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352837400,"counter":515,"content":"<p>It is inappropriate to name names in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300046#TT00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1352837400,"counter":516,"content":"<p>-----and that he knew of students whose only source of food on a weekly basis was a bag of pasta and a jar of tomato ketchup as they awaited their grants to come through.<\/p><p>  I hope the Minister will take on board the concerns raised on this side of the House and, no doubt, by his own backbenchers.

As stated, it is causing untoward problems and difficulties, as well as stress and anxiety for students and their families.  This should not be the case.  Students should not face such a brutal distraction from their studies.  They should not fear incurring the wrath of their colleges, as has been explained, rather they should be enjoying the facilities and services on offer within them.<\/p><p>  The body set up to deal with the new applications must be somewhat culpable, but not to the same extent as the Minister with responsibility in this area.  My colleagues and I have received numerous representations from student constituents and our pleas to elicit answers, explanations and solutions are falling on deaf ears, whether by means of correspondence with SUSI or the Minister's office.<\/p><p>  As a party, no more than anyone else, we are in the process of preparing an alternative budget to that which the Government will produce.  We acknowledge the gap between income and expenditure must continue to be closed.  In recent times we have passed budgets which closed that gap by the tune of \u20ac20 billion; in one budget \u20ac8.5 billion was taken out in one swoop.  The decisions on necessary adjustments left the Minister and his colleagues under no illusion about the task that lay ahead of them should they enter into government.  When we propose our alternative budget, we will seek to have adjustments made which are fair and progressive and protect areas such as education, enterprise, disability and mental health.<\/p><p>  Prior to the last general election, the Minister and his colleagues gave the public the distinct impression that there was an easier, softer way.  The Minister also gave the impression that education would be prioritised, protected and cushioned against cuts, but independent observers made the comment after the announcement of the budget that it was neither fair nor progressive and that education had definitely not been prioritised, given the cuts for rural schools?  The cuts affected two, three and four teacher schools, but they also affected DEIS schools.  The numbers of special needs assistance hours and career guidance counsellors were cut.  Foreign language initiatives in primary schools were also cut.  In addition, the Minister reneged on the infamous Trinity College pledge on fees and registration charges.<\/p><p>  It is not too late to act in a damage limitation exercise.  The Minister should now do what he should have done in the first place in June when he announced SUSI, that is, adequately staff the office, adequately train the staff in it and adequately fund the office to do the job it was set up to do.  If he does this, he will be correcting what has been a colossal cock-up and allow students to concentrate on student life, rather than waiting for Santa Claus to deliver a grant come Christmas.<\/p><p>  It is rumoured in great circles around here that the Minister and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, aspire to be a Commissioner in Brussels.  If that is the case - it may not be - the pair of them are going about it in the right way.  The unfortunate part is, however, that it is having an effect on students and home owners, while the most unfortunate part is that the pair of them cannot be appointed.

I believe the establishment of a single grant-awarding body will serve our students better in the long run.  However, it is clear that we have had problems with the first year of the new system.

The intermediary is the Higher Education Authority, to which I have written on a number of occasions asking it to make sure that the colleges under its authority do not penalise students because their grants have not come through yet.  The HEA has written to all higher education institutions to convey this message on two occasions.

There will be plenty of time to learn lessons from the problems and delays that occurred this year and to ensure these never arise again.  For now, however, I want all eligible students to be paid their grants and to get on with their third level education without the worry and distraction of wondering when they will be paid.  <\/p><p>  When the Fianna F\u00e1il Minister for Education and Skills brought in the proposal to merge the 66 different organisations that were responsible for administering and allocating student grants, it seemed to me - and still seems - a no-brainer.  I am hearing nothing from the movers of this motion to indicate that they want to go back to the past.

We invited expressions of interest from all of the grant-awarding public sector agencies in taking the lead role and becoming the sole grant-awarding agency.  The principle of having one agency to do this work was accepted by everybody, both in opposition and in government.  Subsequent to the change of government on 11 March 2011, I advanced what had happened up to that point, but the minute I advanced it, I accepted total responsibility as Minister.  The fact that I agree with the policy initiative of the previous Minister is a bonus, but I am now responsible for it.  We invited expressions of interest, through the Department of Education and Skills, from the grant-awarding organisations.  It was not an open tendering system because they were already in the space.  A number of different groups presented and were interviewed.  Their business cases were evaluated by a specialist group of former and current senior public servants and the responsibility was awarded to the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, CDVEC.  The CDVEC constructed the model that is now known as SUSI.  Any request that SUSI made to my Department for resources and staff was acceded to and was not questioned or second-guessed.  SUSI, in turn, outsourced part of its work.<\/p><p>  Many Deputies who are in the House now, including Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, attended this morning's committee meeting and will be aware of most of this information.

I put my hands up on this: it has not worked as well as expected.  It is probably working a little better than the previous system, but that is no consolation to anybody.  What we set out to do is not working as well as we hoped it would.  I do not want to get involved in the blame game, although I am responsible; Deputies can have a go at me as much as they like and I will accept it.  I am the person to blame at the end of the day, not the people who are trying to administer the grants.  What we are saying to SUSI is this: what can you do to sort out the difficulties that have arisen, both foreseen and unforeseen?

Perhaps it is the democrat in me but I would sooner have a dialogue than allow people to make speeches to each other.  I listened carefully to what Deputy McConalogue had to say on behalf of Fianna F\u00e1il.  I also listened to Deputy Martin, who left a number of hostages to fortune given his record in this area.  However, citing his record will not accelerate a single application or make it easier for the student who is, as Deputy Troy pointed out, living on pasta and tomato sauce.  That is a reality for some students.<\/p><p>  Deputy McConalogue pointed out that six weeks remain until Christmas.  That is the timeframe in which we are trying to deal with the 33,000 applications in the system.  Every student who has a problem should use the online facility to ensure he or she has communicated the information requested by SUSI.  The students who have decided against pursuing their grant applications because they know they do not qualify would facilitate other students if they informed SUSI they are terminating their applications.  At least 8,000 students - I put a question around that figure because I am not entirely sure - are not advancing their applications, as has been the case in the past, because they cannot provide the information requested.  If these students indicated online they are no longer looking for a grant it would be like moving a line of cars out of a traffic jam to allow others to proceed.  I appeal to Deputies and those following the debate in the Visitors Gallery to ask those who are not actively pursuing applications, because they know in their hearts they will not qualify, to communicate that to SUSI in order to reduce the numbers which have to be processed.  I would prefer SUSI staff to be processing live applications from people who really want a grant than to be working on an application from somebody who knows he or she does not qualify.<\/p><p>  I deeply regret this has happened.  We were given to understand that the information technology had been processed and the systems were in place.  There was optimism that the new system would work but it has not worked as well as we wanted.  This is its first year of operation.  The students come first.  My priority is to process the applications  as quickly as possible so that we provide certainty to the vast majority of applicants this side of Christmas.  I hope the figure is 33,000 but I cannot be certain of that.  When it is all over let us learn the lessons from what did not work so that we can remove the obstacles and barriers and ensure the system works much better next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300048#VV01000","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1352838600,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I will speak briefly about the meeting between the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection and SUSI officials which was attended by Deputies McConalogue and O'Brien, among others.  We arranged the meeting because our constituents have raised concerns about the system with individual Deputies and Senators.  Unlike in previous years, we were able to bring in a single grant authority so that we could ask questions and make suggestions.  While the answers may not always have brought satisfaction, it was an informative meeting.  The Oireachtas is now able to hold the new single unit directly accountable and it also has a direct link to the Minister.  While I am generally in favour of local government, we did not have the same relationship with the local authorities, some of which were more reticent at providing information than others.<\/p><p>  The system has encountered a number of hiccups and problems.  The chief executive officer of SUSI, Jacinta Stewart, admitted that mistakes were made and agreed that the scale of the task had been underestimated.  However, the situation is no worse than in previous years.  I dealt with many constituents who did not get their grants on time.  Sometimes students were still waiting for their grants as they prepared for their exams in May.  There were long delays in the past and the current figures are similar.  The problem is that SUSI was established to streamline the system and to provide greater efficiency.  There is much room for improvement, therefore.  When grants were provided by 66 different bodies, they dealt with their own applications and we as representatives raised problems with the local authorities and VECs in our constituencies.  The problems were dispersed, whereas now that they are concentrated in one authority they have become more visible.  People may disagree with me when I say the problem is no worse than before but that is my impression.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300048#VV01100","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1352838600,"counter":543,"content":"<p>The objective was to make it better, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300048#VV01200","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1352838600,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I accept that.  Ms Stewart confirmed that she has the staff she requested.<\/p><p> It is quite clear the scale of the task was underestimated and enough staff were not trained from the outset.  Many of the problems were identified by SUSI officials today as being historic problems.  For example, some 15,000 applicants to SUSI appear not to be proceeding with their applications.  They were probably never even eligible for a grant in the first place.  Apparently, a similar number of ineligible applications were made in previous years.  There is a historic problem of more people applying for grants than are eligible for them.  This contributes to a significant backlog in the system.  These applications remain on the system as grants awaiting processing, which is an issue.  SUSI needs a system - this was suggested by Oireachtas Members at the meeting - that will allow it deal with these 15,000 applications so they can be removed from the application list and we have a better picture of the number of outstanding applications. <\/p><p> There may be particular reasons for there being so many applicants this year.  Some 56,000 students completed their leaving certificate this year, so at most there are 80,000 first year applicants for grants.  We could also take into account the postgraduate students who might have to apply through SUSI, but the number remains around approximately 80,000.  If only half of these are eligible for grants, which would be more than in previous years, we are talking about 40,000 valid applications.  SUSI has suggested it expects to award approximately 40,000 grants.  Therefore, approximately from 20,000 to 50,000 students are not eligible for grants.<\/p><p> One of the issues for SUSI is that students can go online and register without supplying any documentation.  This was not the situation in the past in the case of local authorities and VECs.  While it is not something new, some students try and buy time by applying for a grant, but they do not have the money put together for the registration fee.  This situation is exacerbated in the current economic climate.  People might not qualify for the grant, but are nearly in the range, and they might put in an application but be unable to pursue it because they are just above the threshold.  This could be another factor in the number of applications.<\/p><p> A number of issues were raised apart from this.  The problems with the telephone service were raised with SUSI officials.  This issue has also been raised with us as public representatives.  SUSI hopes to improve the situation next year.  Deputies and Senators at the meeting made a number of good suggestions and I hope not only SUSI, but the Minister too, will take these on board.  A helpline for student union representatives was suggested.  A helpline and an e-mail facility exist to allow Deputies and Senators make contact with SUSI and there are obviously e-mail and helpline facilities for applicants.  A line of communication should be established between SUSI and student union representatives in the various colleges also.<\/p><p> A suggestion was made with regard to using the experience and knowledge of people on the ground in places like Donegal who could go into the colleges and help students with difficulties with their applications.  They could help with communication between SUSI and the students so that students understand fully what they need to do to complete their application.<\/p><p> I already mentioned the suggestion to ensure the 15,000 applications that are not proceeding are removed from the system and processed.  SUSI raised the issue of the need for sharing of information in this regard.  Information should be shared between the Revenue Commissioners and SUSI or the Department of Social Protection or the colleges in order to help speed up the processing of applications.  <\/p><p> Many people raised the issue of the problem students face with regard to access to college facilities.  Something must be done in this regard.  Colleges must treat all students equally.  I agree people should not be permitted to abuse the system and delay the paying of fees they must inevitably pay and still use the system if they have not paid up.  However, there must be some system applied that will allow genuine grant applicants use the facilities.  SUSI needs to communicate with colleges on that.  I understand the HEA has written to the colleges, but the Minister must do something to make the colleges play ball on this.  <\/p><p> Outsourcing some of the processing of applications should be considered.  Has it worked where tried?  There is significant expertise among those who have dealt with the grant system over the years and that knowledge should be tapped.  These people are aware of the problems of getting some applicants to complete their documentation properly.  We know from our experience as Deputies with regard to applications for social welfare that some people are not good at filling out forms, often with reason.  Members might suggest that third level students should be better at this, but that might be a prejudice towards people who are disadvantaged in some way.<\/p><p> Many good ideas came forward at our meeting and the Minister should read the transcript and take these on board.  The reason we had the meeting was because constituents contacted their Deputies.  We are Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la who are elected to represent the concerns of our constituents, although people sometimes downplay this.  We cannot legislate and deal with issues from an ivory tower.  What we do here is very much linked up with our work in our constituencies.  We talk to our constituents about how things work out in practice.  If someone highlights a problem he or she is experiencing with SUSI, it is very important we go back to that person and ask whether he or she wants us to make inquiries on his or her behalf.  That is not clientelism, rather it is holding SUSI to account on behalf of a constituent.  That is what we did at our committee today and is what we are doing now here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300048#VV01300","speaker":"1010","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352839200,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, who is sharing time with Deputy Pearse Doherty<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300049#WW00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1352839200,"counter":547,"content":"<p>Like previous Deputies, today's engagement at the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection was an important step towards trying to resolve this issue.  It is unfortunate it had to come to this, but, nevertheless, the fact we had SUSI officials before the committee today went some way towards explaining some of the issues relating to the backlog.<\/p><p>  I cannot speak on behalf of any other Deputy or Senator who attended the committee meeting, but I found the engagement with the SUSI CEO and the other two officials unsatisfactory.  I felt many of the questions posed went unanswered.  For example, it took almost two hours to get the information from the CEO that all of the resources SUSI asked for from the Minister were put in place.  There was a complete lack of understanding on the part of the SUSI officials of the hardship facing tens of thousands of students.  For example, during the debate one of the SUSI officials, Mr. Tom Prizeman, stated he could guarantee no documentation was being lost.  He stated that SUSI had only received one official complaint of a lost document among all the applicants who had forwarded documentation.  This is incredible.  We have received many e-mails from students who sent in documentation and who were asked to resend their documentation.  Some of the e-mails state the students were told the documentation had been misplaced.  Therefore, I do not accept the comment that documentation has not been lost.<\/p><p>Most of the problem was caused by the decision to outsource to a company in Cork responsibility for scanning the documents into electronic format and sending them on to SUSI.  There is no doubt that documentation has gone missing.  It was suggested at today's committee meeting that Dublin VEC underestimated the size of the task it was undertaking.  I think the Minister is responsible for this area.  Obviously, awarding criteria were used when a decision was made on the operation of SUSI.  Perhaps the initial criteria were flawed, or else they are not being met by Dublin VEC.  Nobody can dispute the contention that this process has ended in disaster.  Students are facing real hardship.<\/p><p> Although I welcome the apology that the Minister extended to students tonight, we need more than an apology now.  The Minister has said he will raise the issue of SUSI's staffing resources when he meets the CEO tomorrow.  Like other Deputies, I do not believe the number of staff currently dealing with this issue within SUSI will be enough to get through all the applications by December, as the Minister hopes.  On the basis of the figures we were given today for the number of packs SUSI can process and the number of SUSI staff dealing with this matter, it is just not credible to suggest it is possible.  When the Minister meets those officials tomorrow, he should ask them to go through how SUSI proposes to get through 30,000 applications between now and the end of December.<\/p><p> The Minister mentioned that he has twice instructed the Higher Education Authority to ensure that colleges do not place students at a disadvantage as a result of these problems.  He said that &quot;the HEA has written to all higher education institutions to convey this message on two occasions&quot;.  Perhaps the letters written by the HEA were not stiff enough, or else they are being ignored by the colleges.  The reality is that students in those colleges are being denied access to vital resources and facilities.  I received an e-mail from a student who could not access the laboratory and as a result was unable to submit an assignment as part of a course.  We have heard about students who have received letters from their colleges warning them that a late penalty charge will be imposed on them if they do not pay the registration charge by a certain date, or if the colleges do not receive confirmation from SUSI that the students in question are eligible for the registration.  This is the stuff our students are facing.<\/p><p> I would like to read extracts from two e-mails I received from students.  It is important for the voices of students to be heard during tonight's debate.  The first e-mail is from a mature student:<blockquote>My college on the 17th of October refused me access to vital resources which I needed for my course.  This left me unable to access any lab assignments and notes that I needed for projects which were due to be handed up.  I struggled on hoping to hear that SUSI had awarded me tuition fees, but then I got a letter asking for further documentation.  Upon receiving this letter and speaking to SUSI on the phone, I knew that I would be at least another month if not longer waiting to hear back from their office.  As I had already been blocked access from my college to vital facilities and resources, there was no other option for me but to leave my course.  I was hoping to start a degree in my chosen discipline.  I was hoping to start a new chapter in my life, hoping to better myself in these tough economic times for the sake of my two children - not only for their future but also for my own.  This dream has now been dashed due to the inadequate system of SUSI.<\/blockquote>That is just one example of a student who has been forced to leave her course because she was denied access to facilities on her campus.  We have been told tonight that the HEA wrote to every third level institution twice to instruct them to ensure that would not happen, but it is happening.  The Minister needs to take that up with the HEA tomorrow.<\/p><p> The other e-mail from which I would like to read is an important one.  We heard tonight about people who have been awarded grants but are facing difficulties because they are being given the wrong rates.  There has been confusion about the adjacent and non-adjacent rates.  A resident of Cork who is doing a nursing course e-mailed me to tell me of being awarded an adjacent grant despite studying in Dundalk.  As a result, the person in question cannot pay rent or put food on the table.  The e-mail states:<blockquote>I received a letter approving me of my maintenance grant, and then I read on.  I was to get the adjacent rate and I am far from adjacent.  I live 100 km from the college.  I phoned SUSI and was told by a nice lady not to worry, that there had obviously been a mistake and do not appeal the decision, that we will review it.<\/blockquote>This particular student was told they would hear back within two or three days.  Five days later, after receiving no phone call back, the student rang SUSI again, only to be told &quot;sorry, we gave you the wrong information, you actually have to appeal the decision&quot;.  The person was initially told not to appeal because it would be sorted out as part of the review.  When they rang back five days later, they were told to appeal.  The principal officer of SUSI told today's committee meeting that there is no need to appeal in cases in which adjacent and non-adjacent grants have been allocated wrongly because a review process is in place.  It is obvious that the officials who are working on the helpline do not know that, however.  One member of the support staff said not to appeal, but when the person in question rang back, a different member of the support staff said to appeal.  I do not think the staff know the procedures with regard to some of the grants that have been awarded.<\/p><p> It is all well and good to say there is a target of getting through all the applications and awarding as many grants as possible to those who are entitled to them.  Some students are going to have to come back to appeal decisions.  Some 1,100 appeals have been submitted to date in respect of grants which have been awarded.  Some 600 of those appeals are still outstanding.  No timeframe has been put in place for when those 600 appeals will be finalised.  There is a bigger problem here.  When the Minister speaks to representatives of SUSI tomorrow, he should go through line-by-line how they propose to get through all of these applications by Christmas.  In addition, he should engage with the Higher Education Authority again to instruct colleges and third level institutes not to penalise students because that is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300049#WW00300","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352839800,"counter":549,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an d\u00edosp\u00f3ireacht seo.

While I welcome the apology the Minister has extended to students, it has to be said this is not the first time this issue has been debated in this House.  Our education spokesman, Deputy O'Brien, has been raising it for many weeks.  It has been the subject of a special debate during Topical Issues.  Deputy O'Brien insisted last week that the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection would bring in representatives of SUSI to answer questions and that happened today.  Why did it take until mid-November for the penny to drop and the Minister to realise there is something horribly wrong with the processing facility known as SUSI?<\/p><p>Why did it take so long for him to take a hands-on approach or acknowledge and issue an apology to students?  The fact the Minister had to be dragged kicking and screaming to that position means it is very difficult to accept the sincerity of his comments.<\/p><p> Other Deputies have referred in the Chamber to the impact this is having on individual students.  I want to pick up on a point made by Deputy O'Brien in terms of the mess and chaos this facility is causing.  Our offices in Donegal town, Ballybofey and Gweedore have been inundated with people who either have not had their grants processed by SUSI, have had grants refused by SUSI in the wrong or have been awarded the wrong level of grant payment.  I point to one example of a person from south Donegal who was awarded the adjacent grant.  We telephoned SUSI to explain that the person is going to college in Galway only for the SUSI staff member to ask where is the town in Donegal.  The lack of understanding of the fact south Donegal is four hours travel from Galway is simply not good enough.<\/p><p> Everybody makes mistakes but the future education of these young people is dependent on this system working.  As we heard earlier from Deputy Adams in regard to the letter he received, this situation is not unique and people drop out of college every year as a result of delays in processing grant applications, which has been verified by students and the USI.  Therefore, this is really a life decision, but one that is being taken away from the students themselves.<\/p><p> It would be different if this was just a glitch.  For example, we cannot blame the Government if it snows tonight, all of us are snowed in and there is not enough salt on the roads - that is, if something unexpected happens.  However, in all the years since I was elected to the Seanad, this has been a complete and utter disaster, including under the Fianna F\u00e1il Administration.  Students were waiting until January and February in some cases for their first payment instalment, and access to services within the universities and colleges was being denied.  This was supposed to sort it out.  There should have been a hands-on approach and an oversight role by the Minister and the Department to ensure this was happening and we should not have had to wait until the middle of November to start taking a hands-on approach.<\/p><p> I want to make one point to the Minister.  The students of Ireland whose grant applications have yet to be processed by SUSI are entitled to this grant money under legislation.  This is not a handout to these students; it is something to which they are entitled.  They have decided to go to college, their income meets the requirement test and they are entitled to it.  What the Minister should do is forgo his payment for the next three months and see how he gets on.  There is a big difference between what students get and what the Minister for Education and Skills gets paid to do his job to make sure young students who want to be the future leaders of this country are able to get their educational attainment.<\/p><p> In my own county, students have been absolutely hammered.  This Government increased the registration fees and one of the last dying kisses from the previous Government, and the then Minister for Education and Skills, Ms Mary Coughlan, was to extend the criteria for the non-adjacent grants.  Some 700 Donegal students saw their student grants reduced by some 60% as a result of the previous Government's action.  Some of them did drop out, and those who have struggled on are now in this system which is still not working.  We and the students of Ireland deserve a better system than the Government has delivered.<\/p><p> I listened with incredulity to the Taoiseach today saying that the institutions should not punish them and it is the students' fault because they have not given the information.  The Minister and the Taoiseach need to stand up and say they got it wrong, have made a mess of it, and are going to fix it.  Waiting until the end of December or the start of next year is simply not good enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300050#XX00200","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352840400,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300051#YY00200","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1352840400,"counter":552,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

There was a perception from some people around the world, unfortunately, that Irish people were stupid.  I do not believe that but there are times when I think successive Governments go out of their way to prove it correct.<\/p><p>  In September 1989 I went to college and - some things never change - I got my grant in the middle of November.  By the time November had come, I was sick and tired of college, something I went into with great enthusiasm, and my family were sick and tired of college because I would be coming home every week with the long face on me, looking for money that was not there.  The purpose of going to college was pretty much put on the back-burner, namely, the purpose of educating myself.<\/p><p>  The best way to educate oneself is in an environment where there is a minimum amount of stress.  For 23 years now, the same thing has been going on.  I actually failed that year.  I found the transition from secondary school to third level quite difficult but this made it even more difficult.  The following year, I went to Sligo RTC, now Sligo IT, and - guess what - the grant came in at the end of November.  Many of my classmates dropped out, although I did not drop out because I had got used to it from the previous year.  Despite the amount of resources put in through the lecturers, who it could be argued are paid too much in the first place, and through building and heating the colleges and all of that investment, the Government cannot get the little bit right it needs to get right, the bit whereby the students have the money when they need it.<\/p><p>  I was at a meeting in Athlone last night where Deputy James Bannon suggested we go back to the old system.  I do not really care what system is used so long as it works.  However, in Ireland we have this habit of claiming things are impossible that are not impossible in other countries.  At this stage, I believe the Government has convinced the public it is impossible to run a health service.  Even though they are run in other countries such as Germany and Holland and all over the world, we have this lame excuse that is very difficult.  How difficult is it?  It was not difficult for the Government to get into our bank accounts all the various different payments it pays me and everyone else in this House.  We are talking about one payment in this case, yet it cannot get it right.<\/p><p>  I heard one of the Deputies suggesting people have a problem filling in forms.  There are two sides to this.  There is a problem in the way forms are designed.  They are designed in a way that suggests the person who designed them never filled in a form in their life.  Just get this right.  There is no point even telling them how to get it right.  It should be obvious.  Just get the money out to these people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300051#YY00400","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1352840400,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak on the motion.

It is another fine mess the Government has got us into.<\/p><p>  I welcome the students in the Visitors Gallery, in particular a student from County Cork, Miss O'Brien.  Why can we not learn anything in this country?  Why do we change everything that is not broken?  It was said there were 66 agencies dealing with this.  In south Tipperary the VEC and the county council always dealt with this humanely and with dignity.  They knew the people and the parents, and there was always compassion.  What did we do?  We dreamt up this lovely SUSI.  I tell the Minister I do not know who SUSI is, or her sister or her mother, or where she was born or bred.  He can tell SUSI to go back to wherever she came from.  Send her back to the people who understand this.  It is no laughing matter.  It is an outrage.<\/p><p>  We did the same thing with PPARS in the HSE.  It cost millions to bring in this new payment system but what happened?  It created a mess.  It was the same with the county council tendering sections, which were all relocated to Kerry, so there is no local contact and contractors are upset and have to tender three or four times a year.  Big is not wonderful.  We centralised the medical cards system to Dublin and that was a fiasco.<\/p><p>  I told the Minister to come in to apologise to the House, which he did, but he is not half contrite enough because it is disgraceful to have students in colleges, sometimes without food or any type of resources and denied access to their rightful place.  I say to the Minister that this is another fine mess he got us into.  The Minister waved a solemn promise to students that there would be no fees.  What he wrote was not worth the paper we have out here in the bathroom.  This is a mess.  The sooner he gets rid of SUSI and brings back Siobh\u00e1n, which I think is the Gaelic for Susie, and bring back the other Siobh\u00e1ns and the ladies I dealt with in Tipperary and other counties, the better.  They dealt with this sensitively and humanely and understood the problems of going to college and the difficulties faced by families.<\/p><p> The Government wants to centralise everything, drive people into penury and put students out of college.

Before we get into the minutiae of the Bill we should look at the background and purpose for which credit unions were founded.  The basis of credit unions was that people\u2019s savings, in the form of shares, would be used to lend money to the same group of people.  In other words, they were mutual societies and mutuality was at the core of everything they did.  One could not get one\u2019s money in the form of a loan unless one bought shares and one had a stake in the society.  Every member of the society had a vote at the AGM.  Credit unions were also based on a common bond, be it a work bond or geographic bond.  That was crucial to their operation.<\/p><p>  The other characteristic was volunteerism.  Credit union committees were manned by volunteers and in many cases in the early years those who ran credit unions were volunteers as well.  The final characteristic of credit unions and why they were so important to people who would not otherwise get access to credit is that credit decisions were based on local knowledge not on a big, complicated form that gave one a credit rating in the conventional way utilised by banks.  That meant people could borrow money from a credit union where the credit union believed the money would be repaid and in the vast majority of cases that trust was honoured.  The same people had to have savings in the credit union because the basic principle on which they operated is that one could not borrow unless one saved.<\/p><p>  Some credit unions have grown to a considerable extent over the years.  Perhaps that is a good thing.  There is room for an alternative banking system based on mutuality, but there is still room for the small credit union based in the community and working on local knowledge.  No matter what could go wrong with such a credit union it could not in any way upset the national finances.  Therefore, when one considers regulation, one cannot compare large credit unions with hundreds of millions of euro at their disposal with the small local credit union that still operates in a valid field on the basis of the original concept of the credit union, namely, the small mutual society that takes in small deposits and gives out small loans.<\/p><p>  The regulation of the sector is focused on the bigger credit union operations.  I will be told that there are criteria governing the regulation but it seems that it is very much focused on the higher end rather than the needs of a small society.  There seems to be big pressure for amalgamations and the corporatisation of credit unions.  It is interesting to note that of the 404 credit unions, 295 have less than \u20ac40 million.   Everyone who has spoken in the debate has placed emphasis on that issue.  It is interesting also to note that more than 100 credit unions have more than \u20ac40 million and some of them are very large.  I have noticed this growth over the years.<\/p><p>  I was involved for many years in a small co-operative. It was not like the big dairy co-operatives but a small community co-operative.  I worked for it, was chairman of it and am still involved in it. I always worried that the credit unions were going the same way as the building societies.  Building societies started as mutual societies.  The idea was that people saved for their housing and that the only thing for which the building society loaned money was housing.  The only people they loaned money to were the people who saved with them.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, remembers the system.  One could ask what went wrong.  Building societies became big as they got more money.  First, they got rid of the rule that one could not get a loan if one did not save.  Then, they got into all sorts of activities that had nothing to do with building houses for ordinary people as their primary purpose.  Following that, they lost a pile of money and had to go to the State to get bailed out.  If they had not been bailed out the consequence for depositors would have been unthinkable.<\/p><p>  Element of the credit union movement are going through the second phase, namely, the big mutual phase.  I have no doubt that as organisations get bigger those that run them get even bigger aspirations.  In time they aspire to become even bigger organisations and eventually the whole idea of any connection between the saver, that is, the member, feeling that it belongs to him or her, will be lost.  If one does not believe that happens then one should look at the co-operatives that turned into plcs the building societies that turned into something that was very different to what building societies were originally about.<\/p><p>  Therefore, before we start talking about the minutiae of the Bill, we must decide what is the role of the credit union.  I accept that in the case of bigger credit unions their role is to act an alternative banking system.  I hope they will remain as mutual societies but I would not have any particular objection if they developed a plastic card system.  However, the bigger they get and the more one amalgamates them, the more one will depart from the original purpose of catering to the needs of the person needing a small loan for a first communion or confirmation or burst pipes in the house or other disasters people face.  What will happen is that just as credit unions replaced building societies to a certain extent with their mutual philosophy, one will get a new growth of small credit societies.  One can call them what one likes.<\/p><p>  Credit unions will grow bigger and become more professional.  They will require longer forms to be filled and they will become more strict on credit controls not based on local knowledge but on objective criteria - whatever that is.  The term &quot;objective criteria&quot; has become such a catch-cry.  However, objective criteria are not objective.  As is the case with the Department of Health, it depends on the criteria one says are the objective criteria.  That is not an objective exercise.  The more one does all of that, the more one will leave a vacuum for the small person who needs a loan that was previously given based on trust and knowledge, not on a credit rating by filling a complicated form.  The biggest tragedy is that with the corporatisation of credit unions making it difficult for a person of limited means to get a loan as they do not have the asset backing because, for example, they are living in a local authority house, there will be nowhere to go for a small amount of money and people will have to resort to moneylenders.  Perhaps we should be discussing an urgent Bill to control interest rates for moneylenders.  I fear that because of what we are doing the small co-operative idea with which I am familiar will be lost, in some cases by big credit unions.  Can people not see the danger of over-regulation, in particular of the lending of small amounts of money by credit unions, through form-filling?<\/p><p>Can the Minister of State not see that this will push people back to the moneylending, both legal and illegal, that credit unions did so much to reduce?<\/p><p> When he replies he might answer the following question.  His senior colleague stated he would have to put about \u20ac1 billion into the credit unions.  In relative terms and compared to what was lost in all the other financial institutions, that is a modest sum.  How much of that sum arises because of the investments made by credit unions, and how much because of their loans?  I understand that only 40% of credit union funds were lent which, even with a bad debt rate of 20%, makes only 8% of the total number of shares.  There will always be bad debts: that sum has always been factored in.  I am very curious to know what would have happened if the credit unions had not lost money on their investments, in other words, if the big financial system had not collapsed and if credit unions had not bought the subordinated bonds for which the Labour Party were so keen to get a good discount.<\/p><p> As with everything else there are unintended consequences.  I attended a meeting of credit unions recently and was told, &quot;You burned the credit unions when you were in government.&quot;  I asked how this was the case and was told that some credit unions had subordinated bonds and were paid some 10 cent in the euro.  I pointed out that it had been amazing how many people had been shouting at us not to pay anything.  Not many people thought there would be collateral damage to credit unions with such a policy.  This is the problem arising from the complexity of the financial system.  When one does not discriminate there are unforeseen problems but if one does discriminate it is not legal.  The Minister of State might give us that figure.  If I am right about the investments providing the big hit, the irony is that if they had lent more to the small people and invested less in the big banks they might not have needed the \u20ac1 billion after all.<\/p><p> There are all kinds of fancy rules being introduced here about membership of boards, connected people and so on.  A person cannot be on the board longer than a certain period.  That is fine with big credit unions that have a turnover of \u20ac20 million, \u20ac40 million, \u20ac60 million or \u20ac100 million.  There is a credit union on the Aran Islands, however.  With what will the Minister amalgamate it?  Why should it be amalgamated?  Can the Minister of State tell me how in God's name that credit union can follow all these rules and have a person who is related to nobody else on the board?  How will the union have a turnover of board members when there is a small population of 1,500 to 1,800 between three islands?  Did anybody think about that?  Are we saying that small places cannot have small things?  If that is the way we are going we are losing the plot.  If one thinks of the real essence of the credit union movement the Aran Islands would surely be a perfect example of a community that would have an intimate knowledge of itself and be able to make very wise lending decisions.  These would be very humane but would also be based on a fantastic knowledge of the local community.<\/p><p> I can think of other credit unions, such as Comhar Creidmheasa Cholmcille, which was founded in Indreabh\u00e1n in south Connemara.  When the bank pulled out of Carraroe it was able to put an office in its place.  There is another small credit union in Cashel and another at Tullycross which has been fantastically successful and a huge driver of development in the area.  If one wished to have the kind of structures the Minister has proposed one would have to take in all of Connemara.  The Minister would probably tell us the area in question should be 60 miles long and 50 miles wide.  How can people base local knowledge in such a way, whether in the Gaeltacht or the Galltacht?  We will be told that is the way to go, the modern thing to do.  It is the same in the city where there are locally based credit unions.  It is very important that we look to have a system of credit unions that allows flexibility for small credit unions to function and for new ones to be founded within small local communities.  That goes back to the heart and soul of what the credit union movement is about.<\/p><p> There is another issue of great concern, namely, the interaction between the Personal Insolvency Bill and credit unions.  The banks, or the secured lenders, have the veto.  When that Bill was being drawn up and the regulatory impact analysis being done, was there any calculation made as to possible financial damage to credit unions?  The banks have effective control over the system of personal insolvency.  It seems unfair and wrong that banks which could not look after their own affairs are now being given a veto over the affairs not only of individuals but over decisions in respect of unsecured creditors of organisations such as credit unions.<\/p><p> There is a need to ensure that our financial systems operate properly.  When something goes wrong the greatest tendency is to over-regulate the small entity which did not cause the problem simply because the big entity made a big mess.  I am not convinced.  Mistakes were made in credit unions but the biggest one they made was when they did not follow their own rules.  I remember dealing with a particular case in which a lady had managed to borrow far too much money from far too many organisations.  The thing that really puzzled and annoyed me was that she had managed to borrow money from four or five different credit unions, this being contrary to their own rules, and on two grounds.  The first was that she did not have any savings in the credit unions and should not have been able to borrow in the first place.  The second was that most of the credit unions were far beyond the common bond, geographically speaking.  She lived in one house only, in one area.  Of course, like everybody else, the credit unions had become slipshod, lazy and easy going.  They broke their own rules.  Rather than making a myriad of rules that in time people will not heed because it is all too complicated, would it not be better to have simpler rules and apply them?  If we went back to the basic tenet of the credit union, whereby a person puts in a deposit or shares and gets loans proportionately, the credit unions would be very secure places to invest.<\/p><p> It is true that the bigger an institution is the more it must be regulated.  There is much in the Bill I have no difficulty with, in respect of big professional financial organisations which need regulation just as banks do.  However, there appears to be total overkill when it comes to small societies that either exist today or those which I suspect will spring up all over to try to help people when bigger financial institutions no longer will.  I believe that in the next five to ten years, if there is a suitable vehicle for so doing, we will once again see a springing up of small mutual societies.  I hope that this time they will stay mutual and be self-supporting community organisations.  People will put their money in and get money out within a small circle.  They will work on the basis that made the credit unions what they were - a place where a person with no credit rating could go because he or she was part of a common bond.<\/p><p> When one considers the difference between those on high incomes and those on low incomes in the context of accessing credit, one of the biggest determining factors relates to the capacity of the former to borrow money much more easily when something unforeseen arises.  The creditworthiness of those on high incomes is generally much better than people on basic incomes.  During the boom times it became far too easy for such individuals to obtain loans of \u20ac5,000 or \u20ac10,000.  To whom will a person on a low income who needs \u20ac600 to pay for a family occasion go in the future?  Such an individual will discover that all of the normal institutions will be so regulated that, on his or her income, he or she will not be able to borrow the money.  What the Government is doing is pushing those to whom I refer into the arms of the moneylenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300052#ZZ00400","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352842200,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Heather Humphreys who, I understand, is sharing time with Deputies McLoughlin and Breen.

I commend the members of the credit union review commission on all their hard work and commitment and I acknowledge the huge effort and time they invested in producing their interim and final reports.  It is on these reports the legislation is based.  I also wish to recognise and pay tribute to the huge work done by and commitment of credit union volunteers who continue to play a crucial role in the credit union movement.  Without those volunteers, credit unions would not exist.  Their voluntary contribution to the movement throughout the country can never be overestimated.<\/p><p>  Credit unions are not immune to the current economic difficulties.  The volunteers and staff continue to work their way through what is a very difficult period.  I commend them on their massive commitment and effort in the context of serving their communities.  I worked as a credit union manager for 12 years and I previously worked with Ulster Bank.  Having experienced these two very different types of financial institutions, I wish to state in very clear terms that I remain a strong advocate for credit unions and the ethical banking values they uphold.  Those values ensure the member or customer comes before profit or gain.  I have seen at first hand the benefits a credit union can bring to a community.  I am committed to the credit union movement and I am of the view that this legislation will support and allow credit unions not only to continue to provide the services they currently offer to their members but also to strengthen and enhance such services.<\/p><p>  The membership of credit unions is vital to their survival in an ever-changing world.  A previous speaker noted that virtually everyone in the country has used his or her credit union at some point.  This can be often the problem.  People use their credit unions when they cannot obtain credit elsewhere.  When their financial position has improved and their credit rating re-established and as their needs become more complex and demanding, they move their business to a bank.  To survive, credit unions need to retain their members and increase their market share.  The Bill will allow them to use synergies within the sector - through co-operation and amalgamation - to provide a broader range of services that will assist them in retaining their members and serving their needs.<\/p><p>  The credit unions are at a crucial juncture in their development.  While it could be stated that they are victims of their success, they are also the victims of their reluctance to move to another stage in their development.  They have been unable to progress and there have been fragmented attempts at offering a wider range of services which have resulted in some credit unions facing serious financial difficulties.  In recent years there has been no clear vision for credit unions.  I am of the view that the Bill will give them the impetus and encouragement they require and will, with the assistance of ReBo, assist them in progressing to another level.  The Bill also takes cognisance of their special place within our society, their mutual nature and their strong voluntary ethos.  The latter has allowed them to expand and grow during the past 50 years and has facilitated them in providing a vital service to the less well off.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister to reconsider the position regarding the time limit of nine years relating to voluntary directors and the three-year term relating to voluntary officers.  If implemented, these restrictions will mean some credit unions will have difficulty in attracting volunteers.  They could also lead to valuable expertise and skills being lost.  Credit unions are being asked to upskill their directors and develop their knowledge base.  It is important, therefore, that the experience which has been gained should not be lost as a result of people being forced to retire.  We do not want some volunteers to feel like conscripts.  It is important, therefore, that every effort be made to attract new volunteers.<\/p><p>  I wish to address a number of issues in respect of the Central Bank.  There is nothing in the legislation which supports the Central Bank putting in place a set of rules and standards for credit unions.  The Bill refers to the Central Bank deciding what is a viable credit union.  However, the criteria that will be used to assess what constitutes such a credit union are not included in the Bill.  A set of prudential rules have not yet been issued.  I urge the Minister to ensure that as much clarity as possible is provided by the Central Bank in this regard.  Credit unions are being asked to take on board these new standards and I am of the view that it is only proper that the Central Bank should clearly outline what is expected of them.  In the recent past, the bank has issued directives and instructions without first carrying out any impact analyses.  Neither did it provide justification for its diktats.  In consultation with the credit unions, the Central Bank should establish a clear plan in respect of how its directives and decisions will impact on their business.<\/p><p>  Having listened to credit union representatives and as a result of my experience of credit union regulation, it is my opinion that the Central Bank does not communicate well.  It appears guidelines can be introduced or altered without prior consultation with the credit unions.  The Central Bank regularly changes the goalposts.  On some occasions, the attitude of its staff towards credit unions has left much to be desired.  Volunteers have been made to feel incompetent, incapable and very vulnerable.  There is a need to introduce a code of conduct for staff of the Central Bank in the context of how they deal with credit unions.  At times, the bank has been erecting artificial and unnecessary barriers.<\/p><p>  If the credit unions embrace the legislation and if the Central Bank improves its delivery of service, we can look forward to a sustainable credit union movement that will continue to be led on a voluntary basis and to meet the needs of those it serves.  I want credit unions to be supported in order that they can continue to serve communities in cities, towns and villages throughout the country.  I also want to ensure no community will be left without a credit union to serve the needs of its people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300054#BBB00300","speaker":"973"},{"type":"speech","time":1352842200,"counter":564,"content":"<p>To fully understand the importance of the credit union movement, it is necessary to remind the House of its history.  The Irish credit union movement was founded as a result of the efforts of three dynamic, pioneering and entrepreneurial people, namely, a teacher, a civil servant and a bakery worker.  In Dublin in the 1950s, these individuals witnessed the effects of high unemployment, such as sickness, malnutrition, moneylending, hunger, poor clothing, poor housing and, inevitably, the emigration of a parent or of entire families.  In addition, State unemployment benefits were low and did not last indefinitely.  This meant many families lived in abject poverty.<\/p><p>  The founders of the credit union movement recognised that the root of the problem lay in the scarce availability and poor management of money and resolved to identify a system which would allow people to gain more control over their finances.  Tomas O'Hogain, another pioneer of the movement, suggested that credit unions would give individuals economic independence and responsibility by taking part in common activities and aims.  In November 1954 the National Co-Operative Council was established to promote non-farming co-ops and a Mr Denis Byrne, a member of the council, wrote a letter to the newspapers to point out &quot;the scandal of the moneylender whereby those who can least afford it are charged the highest rate of interest \u2013 is seldom referred to in learned documents on banking and finance&quot;.  The letter told how credit unions in the US protected American wage earners from loan sharks and suggested that if the idea were taken up in Ireland, it would surely &quot;be an attractive pastime for those who not only believe in the principles of social and economic justice, but are prepared to work a little to foster them&quot;.  Mr. Byrne's comments sum up in essence why credit unions have been so important to Irish society during the past 50 years.  Many people from the poorer sections in our society were saved from the claws of moneylenders.  However, we must recognise that there are those who still engage with these unprincipled individuals.<\/p><p>  in 1957, Mr. Se\u00e1n Lemass, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and a future Taoiseach, set up a special committee to advise on legislative changes which would help to foster co\u00adoperative enterprise in the non-farming sectors.  The deliberations of this committee were an important part in the process which led to the introduction of what became the Credit Union Act 1966.  The latter provides the legal framework under which the credit union movement operates in the Republic of Ireland.  When we, as legislators, reflect on the history of the movement and the involvement with it of many decent and honourable people, we must be mindful of those people's ideals and goals.<\/p><p>The Ireland of the late 1950s was impoverished and, like today, was experiencing an economic downturn.  It is incalculable to judge how much the credit union movement assisted its members with finance to provide, transport, education, heat, light, business, a bed to lie in or perhaps the table on which to put the food.  It is against this background that we must ensure this Bill will mean that the spirit of the original founders lives on and that the 3 million members with their almost \u20ac13.5 billion savings are protected.<\/p><p> Regulation and prudence are two words that were missing within the Irish banking sector from 2002 to 2008.  The blame for the collapse has been well documented by political commentators and economists and now is not the time to debate it again.  It is imperative that any Government engaged in the clean-up of a mess should identify the cause and legislate so that nothing like this can happen again.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has played a significant role over many years in regulating its members and bringing forward best practice procedures for member branches.<\/p><p> Some issues have arisen which are of concern, such as the bad debts that some of the 500 branches have incurred.  The Government has already shown its commitment to the credit union sector by putting aside a figure of \u20ac500 million to address problems in the sector at a time when the Government faces difficult budgetary choices and competing needs for scarce resources.  It has been reported that up to 40 credit unions are in difficulty with some in need of help from the league.  It is further reported that up to \u20ac1 billion of loans are either behind or not performing.  This is an issue which needs prompt Government action.<\/p><p> The Bill sets out the framework for the prudential requirements that are to apply to credit unions in areas such as reserves, liquidity, and lending and risk management.  The policies and principles in respect of each area are set out in the Bill, with scope for Central Bank regulations in relation to standards, procedures and other more detailed matters.  Regulatory requirements will be calibrated according to the nature, scale and complexity of credit unions.  This will allow for the tiered regulatory approach recommended by the Commission on Credit Unions.<\/p><p> Communities have expressed their concern to me about proposals which were agreed by the commission but which are of concern to many individual credit union members.  These include the imposition of term limits, prohibitions on membership of boards and a board oversight committee.  I ask the Minister to re-examine these proposals on Committee Stage against the implications for smaller credit unions which have been managed in an exemplary fashion and which will face significant difficulties looking for the necessary volunteers to serve on their local credit union.  The rule for eligibility of persons to become directors seems to be a little too strict.  Anyone related to a volunteer or employee of a credit union is debarred.  Term limits for directors are provided for, allowing a director to serve nine years on a credit union board in any 15-year period.<\/p><p> Restructuring is recommended for credit unions who are experiencing difficulties.  Approved mergers will be provided with funding where required and subject to conditions to ensure that they have adequate capital and to upgrade systems.  This will not apply to all credit unions.  I am aware of the many credit unions in my own constituency which have a strong and healthy balance sheet due to prudent and competent management over the past 20 years.  I have written to the Minister on behalf of some local credit unions based in rural and low population areas  Small credit unions from low populated areas will be threatened by some of these proposals.  I suggest that some thought be given by the Minister on Committee Stage.  Overall, this is positive legislation and I welcome the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300054#BBB00400","speaker":"1082","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352842800,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I wish to acknowledge the work of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  I compliment him on the priority he has given to securing the future of the credit union sector.  I note that John Hume served as Ireland's youngest ever president of the Irish League of Credit Unions, from 1964 to 1968.  He stated that &quot;[of] all the things I've been doing, it's the thing I'm proudest of, because no movement has done more good for the people of Ireland, north and south, than the credit union.&quot;  I concur with his comments.<\/p><p>  The credit union movement is the bedrock upon which our communities have been built and have survived in every corner of Ireland.  With 399 registered credit unions in Ireland serving 3<i><\/i>million members, the credit union movement is substantial.  Credit unions could be best described as our grass-roots banks because they are the champions of ordinary people in our communities throughout the length and breadth of the country.  They have retained their popularity because they are owned and run by their members who know and understand the needs of their members and customers.  There is also a strong culture of credit unionism throughout Europe and in the United States.  Given the difficult financial situation which has arisen in the banks since 2008, the regulation of credit unions will allow the credit union movement to expand and grow its membership.  International experience supports this view.  When regulation was introduced during President Reagan's presidency in the US in 1992, the membership of credit unions swelled and today, there are in the region of 89 million credit union members in the US.  In my view, the reason credit unions have retained their popularity is because they have a strong customer-friendly ethos and a strong culture of volunteerism.  Unlike the banks, credit unions treat their customers as persons rather than as numbers.  The retention of these attributes presents real opportunities for credit unions to grow particularly during this financial crisis.<\/p><p>  I recently read an article in a financial magazine which cited the experience in the United States over the past month.  Credit unions experienced a surge in membership when one of the bigger banks indicated that it intended to introduce a $5 increase in its fees for debit cards.  I believe that the same opportunities exist here for credit unions.  This is why they must be supported and given every opportunity to develop their business.<\/p><p>  Like many Members of this House, I have been contacted by credit union members.  The credit union movement is very strong in my constituency of Clare.  It plays an integral part in the lives of people in west Clare, Kilrush, in my own parish of Lissycasey, Ennis, Clarecastle, Shannon and Sixmilebridge.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to engage in this debate and consider any good ideas which may be put forward.  I understand from the Minister's comments that the exclusions from board membership and the situation regarding treasurers were recommended in the report on the Commission on Credit Unions and agreed with the credit union stakeholders.  The credit union movement depends on its volunteers but there is concern that the restrictions and limitations on board membership, coupled with the additional responsibilities and the extra committees which are being introduced, will undermine the movement by overstretching the demands of their volunteers, upon which it depends.  We must ensure that volunteers continue to play a very active role in credit unions, that involvement is encouraged and that no obstacles are placed in the way of volunteers continuing to support their local credit union.<\/p><p>  Many credit unions wish to expand the provision of facilities to customers.  They would like to be in a position to offer electronic payment accounts.  This has not been addressed in the Bill.  However, I understand it is not necessary to include a clause in this Bill to facilitate electronic fund transfer, EFT, as only 10% of credit unions affiliated to the Irish League of Credit Unions currently have the ability to provide this service.  I am aware that the Irish League of Credit Unions is working with its members to develop this service.  It is anticipated that EFT services will be available by the end of December.  It is certainly timely given that the issuing of cheques looks likely to be a thing of the past as early as 2016.<\/p><p>I am a strong advocate of the credit union movement.  I welcome the commitment and ability to secure the viability of credit unions, which is what the Bill is all about.  However, I am anxious that volunteerism, which underpins the success of the entire movement, be supported.  This has been reflected in the speeches of all speakers on both sides of the House.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's summation at the end of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300055#CCC00200","speaker":"974","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352843400,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The State is in a difficult position financially, as are many households.  I am thankful that there are institutions such as the credit union movement that are unique to Ireland and of which we can be proud.  An interesting aspect of the movement - along with the GAA, another great organisation rooted in the community - is that it covers the whole island.  It has a branch and cumann in every corner of every county.  The GAA and credit union movement have shown themselves to be very resilient.  All such progressive movements draw their strength from the fact that they are community-owned and people-centred.  They are based in the community.  They are solution-based organisations addressing social need.  It is interesting to note that the credit union movement, with its co-operative ethos, is based on socialist principles.  The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, will share with me his appreciation of that fact.<\/p><p>  The credit union movement was founded because of the efforts of three people, Ms Norah Herlihy, Mr. Sean Forde and Mr. S\u00e9amus P. MacEoin, all of whom were based in Dublin during the very difficult recession of the 1950s, whose effects they witnessed.  I have but a vague memory of the pawnshops that were widespread in Dublin city at the time.  There was considerable unemployment and other problems associated with poverty in that decade.  In the 1950s, unemployment benefit was very low and did not last indefinitely.  Many families were left in poverty.<\/p><p>  Some 60 years later, more than 2.9 million people throughout the island have recognised the value of the credit unions and have savings approaching \u20ac11.9 billion.  Over 9,200 active volunteers are involved in the movement.  We know them in our communities.  There are more than 3,500 people in very good employment in the credit unions.  I have been a credit union member for a long time.  I have been a member of two branches, one of which is near where I live now and another near a former residence.  I acknowledge the benefits of having been a member.  I used the credit union at times of greatest need and was always offered a sympathetic ear when trying to borrow money for essentials.  The credit union was there for me.   I have seen it play an essential role in the lives of people with low incomes.<\/p><p>  Credit unions play an important role in their communities.  Credit is difficult to obtain from banks at present.  This is rehearsed in the House week in, week out.  Where possible, credit unions try to facilitate their members.  I salute the staff and volunteers of the credit unions across the State, including those in my constituency, Laois-Offaly, where there is a strong movement.  It provides a great and very professional service and has been very important for people.  Having spoken to representatives of the credit union movement, I can confirm that they are the first to admit more regulation is needed.  They require a better regulatory context in which to operate and there is a need for reform.  The credit union movement has been the primary advocate of this.  We support the reform of the credit union movement.  In doing so, we believe it must be achieved in a manner that reflects its unique ethos and community-based, not-for-profit and volunteer-based approach.<\/p><p>  While I broadly welcome the Bill, I must highlight a number of concerns I share with the credit union movement.  The first is the proposal to apply to credit unions the historic Central Bank legislation dating from 1942 to 2011.  The legislation is inappropriate and fails to recognise the difference between the banking sector and credit unions.  This was not considered by the Commission on Credit Unions and may have far-reaching and negative consequences for credit unions.  We are also concerned about the application of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 to credit unions.  This view is shared by the credit union movement.<\/p><p>  The commission's report recommended certain enhancements for the credit union movement but none of these is contained in the Bill.  These include service sharing, social finance, micro-finance for small business, co-operative ventures and the introduction of electronic payments.  I urge the Minister to consider my sincerely held views and ensure that the final Bill will be capable of enjoying the support of every Member such that it will be passed successfully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300056#DDD00200","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1352843400,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  I echo the comments of a number of previous speakers, from my own party and others, in commending the credit union movement on its contribution to Irish life and communities right across the island.  As outlined by my party colleague and spokesperson on finance, Deputy Pearse Doherty, in his contribution to this debate last week, Sinn F\u00e9in broadly supports the Bill but will be tabling amendments intended to improve and strengthen it.<\/p><p>  We recognise the vital role local credit unions play in the communities they serve, founded as they are on an ethos of community service, volunteerism and not-for-profit activity.  As ordinary people struggle on a daily basis to pay bills and manage their household budgets in the face of further and seemingly endless cuts by the Government, as with its predecessor, the importance of the local credit union becomes further pronounced.  Credit unions, for as long as I can remember, have helped people by way of neighbours helping neighbours, through short-term loans to help send children back to school or to provide for Christmas.  They stepped in when banks did not want to know.  In doing so, they ensured low- and middle-income families could avoid the clutches of loan sharks and unscrupulous lenders who charge exorbitant interest rates.  Credit unions have provided and continue to provide a vital social service.<\/p><p>  The Bill deals with four broad areas: prudential regulation, governance, restructuring and stabilisation.  We support the demand for good practice, transparency and probity, the implementation of agreed standards and necessary accountability.  It is agreed by all that the regulatory context in which credit unions operate is in need of substantial reform.  The movement itself has been among the leading voices in calling for this reform.<\/p><p>  We support strong, effective and appropriate regulation for the credit union sector.  We want credit unions, their members and the communities in which they are rooted to have the highest levels of protection, probity, and governance.  This is in the best interest of all who provide these services and all who avail of them.  However, we firmly believe this can be achieved in a manner that is consistent with the distinctive ethos and values of the sector.  It should not be the case that that which is applied to the banking sector is automatically extended to credit unions.  It must be recognised that appropriate regulation for one type of financial institution may not be appropriate for another.<\/p><p>  If credit unions are to be able to grow and service the increasingly varied needs of the members and communities they serve, they will need to be able to offer a wider range of services.  I include the ability to undertake transactions and access services above and beyond those that are currently available.  The sharing of services should be facilitated and promoted.  We have the opportunity and responsibility, with this Bill, to address specific restrictions on credit unions that go completely against the spirit and purpose of the organisation.  The decision by the Financial Regulator to cap a family's borrowing at \u20ac25,000 is one such example.<\/p><p>This outrageous restriction has resulted in dire consequences for many families.  It is wholly too limiting and fails to appreciate and understand the demands that present in a household, particularly where there are a number of children, and especially if they are third level college attendees or aspirants.  This diktat by Mr. Elderfield must be revisited and, at the very least, significantly relaxed.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister to note the situation that applies.  No cognisance is taken in regard to the collective income in a household or the number of income earners.  It is literally a blanket restriction applying to the members of a particular household, and that is outrageous.  I repeat that where the banking institutions are failing in their lending responsibilities, despite the fact that we continue to bail them out on an ongoing basis, credit unions are incapable of responding to members' needs because of the diktat of Mr. Elderfield who does not belong to any community on this island and who does not, I suggest, have the same experience and appreciation of what the credit union movement stands for and what it has meant in the lives of its members throughout the length and breadth of this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300056#DDD00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352844000,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I sometimes like to simplify issues.  During the late 1980s and early 1990s when I was younger, a number of other people and I used to think about how north Leitrim might be a better place, the problems it faced and the opportunities available.  I recall listening to people in the community and although we had three banks in the town in which I lived, many people felt the commercial banks were for the guys with plenty of collateral and that any financial support they required would have to be met by moneylenders.  I believe they were legal as well as illegal moneylenders at the time.  I recall thinking that a credit union would make a great difference to the area in which I lived if it could be established, but the group I was working with knew that would not be easy because a number of unsuccessful attempts had been made to establish a credit union.  They were unsuccessful mainly because of the difficulties in recruiting and retaining voluntary people from a rural, sparsely populated area.  That was the main problem.  However, we took on the challenge.  I recall it was difficult to get a sufficient number of people from a low population to meet the credit union board of management and the regulatory requirements set down, but we got them.  We went through six months of intensive study, training and preparation.  It was great that voluntary people would do that.  I often refer to them as ordinary people doing extraordinary things.  I recall the great support we got from the Irish League of Credit Unions and from credit union officers from adjoining chapters.<\/p><p>  It took a while but eventually we founded the credit union in 1996.  Unfortunately, I do not have the opportunity or the time to play an active role in the management of the credit union although I remain an enthusiastic member and I am privileged to have been one of the founding members but from those humble beginnings in 1996 we now have a credit union in our own premises on Main Street, Manorhamilton with approximately 2,500 members which, if I calculate correctly, is about one in every three men, women and children in the catchment area.  We have approximately \u20ac7 million in shares and \u20ac2.5 million out on loans.  We hope, subject to approval, to pay a 1% dividend this year and a 10% interest rebate.  Of the loans this year a total of \u20ac8,900 was written off.  That covered eight loans, just over \u20ac1,100 per loan, and there was a surplus of \u20ac339,514 at the end of September, which is the end of the accounting year.<\/p><p>  The big banks and the investors who are used to talking in billions and trillions of euro would probably chuckle patronisingly at the figures I have mentioned and might call them peanuts, but Manorhamilton and District Credit Union, mainly through the voluntary work of many people, has done more for those 2,500 members than the commercial banks ever did.  The bigger institutions perhaps should stop the chuckling long enough to ponder how an institution such as a credit union, with mainly voluntary workers and a voluntary board of management and its ethos of neighbourliness and community solidarity, has managed to continue in successful operation when they crashed their own businesses, their country and their people.  Big is not necessarily beautiful, nor is it necessarily safe, efficient or effective.<\/p><p>  I disagree slightly with what Deputy O Cu\u00edv said earlier.  I would want a much wider societal role for institutions such as the credit unions.  There is nothing wrong with widening the role provided it is a societal role, not just for the credit unions but for the post office network also.  We should be reducing our over-reliance on for-profit financial institutions.<\/p><p>  On the Credit Union Bill, Sinn F\u00e9in understands that citizens need trust and certainty in their dealings with all financial institutions.  They must be satisfied that their investments are safe and cannot be plundered, pilfered or recklessly managed in an attempt to increase profits for shareholders or for senior officers of the various institutions.  Government had and still has a responsibility to ensure there are adequate systems and checks in place to ensure no more financially disastrous surprises are visited upon the people.  Consequently, we support the broad intent of this Bill and commend the Commission on Credit Unions, the Minister and the Department, and the wider credit union movement on their work because they were involved in bringing this legislation before the D\u00e1il, but I repeat that bigger is not necessarily better or safer.  We must remember that credit unions are generally smaller, community and volunteer-based institutions with a not-for-profit ethos and what is clearly necessary to regulate the banks, given their recent history and their continuing dysfunctionality, could cause irreparable damage to smaller credit unions.<\/p><p>  Most of our specific concerns were laid our earlier.  The proposal to apply 70 years of historic Central Bank legislation to credit unions without consultation is inappropriate and fails to recognise the fundamental difference between credit unions and commercial, for-profit banks.  The new Bill affords sufficiently enhanced powers for credit union regulation.  Likewise, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 should be modified to reflect the different ethos, operations and management of credit unions.  There should be right of appeal to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal in respect of any regulatory directive.<\/p><p>  There is an urgent need for a simple, plain English memorandum of understanding between credit unions and their members and the Central Bank and regulators to ensure that regulation and regulatory practices are proportionate and transparent.<\/p><p>  The width of bands for regulatory tiering of credit unions is too wide.  We would argue that it must be based on a model of risk and business complexity rather than on size alone.  The office of treasurer should be retained for the purpose of ensuring timely preparation and presentation of annual accounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300057#EEE00200","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1352844000,"counter":572,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1352844000,"counter":573,"content":"<p>The D\u00e1il adjourned at 10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 14 November 2012.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
