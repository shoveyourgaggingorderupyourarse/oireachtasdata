Apologies have been received from Deputy Munster.  If attending in the committee room, which everyone is this morning, or from the precincts of Leinster House, attendees are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others against the risk of contracting Covid-19, which I hear is back again.  Members attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is accompanied this morning by Mr. John Crean, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  We engaged last week with the Health Service Executive to examine, in the context of its 2021 financial statements, mental health-related expenditure in community health organisations, CHOs, 4 and 8.  This morning we will examine the HSE's 2021 financial statements in more detail, including expenditure on ambulance services.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the HSE: Mr. Stephen Mulvany, interim chief executive officer; Mr. Damien McCallion, chief operations officer; Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan, chief financial officer; Mr. Robert Morton, director of the National Ambulance Service, NAS; and Professor Cathal O'Donnell, clinical director of the NAS.  We are also joined from the Department of Health by Mr. John O'Grady, principal officer, and Mr. Keith Comiskey, principal officer.  The witnesses are all welcome.  I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, I may direct witnesses to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such directions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, introduced the HSE's 2021 financial statements at last week's meeting.  This is on the record and was circulated to members.  Before we proceed, I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General if he wishes to add to his opening remarks from last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022100600002#A00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665045000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chair.

The Chair has identified the colleagues who are here and introduced them so I will not repeat that.  As requested by the committee, we submitted in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting a briefing note that provides information and a detailed breakdown of HSE expenditure on the NAS.  At last week&rsquo;s session, we provided in the opening statement an overview of the annual financial statements for 2021 and the financial outturn.  I will therefore confine my opening remarks today to the following matters.<\/p> <p>  The NAS operates from over 100 locations throughout Ireland and its services are delivered by over 2,000 staff members.  The NAS operates under the HSE&rsquo;s performance accountability framework, which sets out the means by which the service is held to account for its performance in relation to access to services and the quality and safety of those services.  The clinical governance of NAS is provided by a full-time clinical director who is supported by a number of other senior clinicians.  The NAS received a budget allocation for 2021 of &euro;202.1 million, representing approximately an 8% increase when compared with 2020.  The actual expenditure for 2021 was approximately &euro;202.9 million, which included Covid-related services.<\/p> <p>  This expenditure saw the NAS responding in 2021 to over 366,000 emergency 999 and urgent calls; transporting approximately 24,000 intermediate care patients; more than 1,000 aero-medical and air ambulance calls; 2,047 calls via the NAS critical care retrieval service; and the delivery of mobile swabbing and vaccination services in relation to Covid.  Other key activities progressed in 2021 included implementation of the out-of-hours cardiac arrest strategy; continuing development of alternative care pathways - hear and treat or refer and see and treat or refer; a new service commencing in Connemara; supporting implementation of the strategy, a trauma system for Ireland; and improvements to the NAS critical care and retrieval service for adults, children and neonates.<\/p><p>As of August 2022, NAS expenditure is in the order of &euro;131.7 million against a year-to-date budget of &euro;133 million.  The full year allocation of budget for the NAS is of the order of &euro;202.6 million.<\/p><p> Based on the outputs of a capacity and demand analysis commissioned in July 2021 and new developments set out in the NAS draft strategic plan, the current NAS workforce plan recommends 2,161 additional staff across a broad spectrum of roles that would be required to meet the future needs of the service.  Given the scale of workforce growth required over the coming years, it is expected to take up to ten years to effectively double the workforce.<\/p><p> In 2022, 62 graduate paramedics have commenced work and the NAS expects to recruit up to 180 student paramedics and 90 emergency medical technicians by year end.  For 2023 recruitment planning, a submission has been made to recruit up to a further 192 student paramedics across NAS programmes starting in January and September 2023, as well as growing educational capacity by opening a fourth campus in 2023 in the south of the country.  In addition, in 2023, recruitment competitions are planned for 50 medical emergency controllers and 25 intermediate care operatives.<\/p><p> Last winter, the NAS put in place a capacity action plan which sought to engage with all of the capacity that is available in Ireland, including remobilising all of the community first responder schemes that had unfortunately been stood down in March 2020 due to the Covid pandemic.  The service engaged with voluntary ambulance organisations and the private ambulance sector as part of the contingency plan for winter.<\/p><p> The HSE continues to invest and develop our urgent and emergency care systems.  There was significant investment in capacity and people in the past 18 months.  We are in the process of preparing the national service plan, which will include the NAS plans for 2023.<\/p><p> Despite the challenges of recent years, the continued investment by Government in the HSE in the National Ambulance Service is contributing to progress on the shift to reorient healthcare away from a hospital-centric model.  Recent measures are particularly evident within the NAS in the areas of ehealth, telemedicine, and community-delivered care and service integration, that is, community paramedicine, pathfinder programmes and alternative pre-hospital pathways.  The NAS is currently finalising a strategic plan for the service that will provide a roadmap for the continued development and enhancement of the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022100600002#A00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665045000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Mulvany and his colleagues.

As the Deputy said, it is complex in relation to just being precise about who needs to be contacted following the attack.  As he can imagine, trying to work that through is complex.  That is the piece that is being closed out at the moment.  In addition, there are ongoing discussions with the DPO and others just to make sure that the process is fully robust and when we start that process off, it is clear in how we deal with people who may concerned as a result of it.  It is, as Mr. Mulvany said, getting closer, but there are just a number of final steps around that scoping and making sure we are clear what that contact is.  The teams have been stood up and are ready to move once we need to move.  We utilised some of the resource that we had in the pandemic in terms of contract tracing.

It should be borne in mind that most decisions around purchasing PPE and ventilators, etc., were made in March and April 2020.  As we sit here today behind a wall of vaccines, we all feel somewhat different about things now compared to how we felt then.

On the 19-minute target, there is a growing question mark about the relativity of those targets.<br\/><br\/>Professor O'Donnell is developing the realm of clinical key performance indicators, KPIs - in other words patient outcomes.  I will give a brief example to articulate that point, then hand over to Professor O'Donnell.  For a patient in Dingle who experiences a stroke, the nearest ambulance is Dingle ambulance station but that ambulance might be dropping off a patient or <i>en route <\/i>to Tralee, as the main receiving hospital.  The ambulance will not get there in 19 minutes because it is at the end of a peninsula but, in real terms, that will not change the outcome for that patient.  The target is 19 minutes but the key target for that patient is to get to a hyperacute stroke unit within four and a half hours of the onset of symptoms.  We are moving to a clinical, rather than response-time, way of thinking about it.  That is not just in Ireland, but in a general global setting.  I ask Professor O'Donnell to comment on the development of alternative KPIs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022100600002#E01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Morton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665045000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  It is a good question.  Ambulance response time targets are a blunt instrument for measuring the capability of an ambulance service.  They are easily understood, intuitive and make sense.  If I dial 999, I want an ambulance to come quickly.  That is reasonable, but a 19-minute response time over the breadth of clinical presentations we see often does not impact on patient outcomes.  From a clinical perspective, we are more interested in how we can improve the patient's acute healthcare need there and then.  We send two highly trained clinicians on a call.  If they get there within 19, 20 or 15 minutes of a person having a heart attack or stroke or with a broken leg, that is a blunt instrument in measuring success.<\/p> <p>  We currently measure four clinical KPIs.  There is cardiac arrest, when your heart stops.  We measure the proportion of patients we get to an emergency department where we have restarted the heart prior to arrival.  That is one point on that patient's clinical journey.  We compare favourably internationally on that one.  This year we have introduced three new ones.  Two are related to stroke care, which Mr. Morton mentioned and which are very important.  One is on pain relief.  If you are in pain and we come out to you, how good are we at relieving your pain?

Last week, we extensively considered capital spending in Cork-Kerry CHO and I was assured that the service users who are in 24-hour assisted living at Owenacurra and Garnish House had been fully communicated with regarding the closure of Garnish House and the move out of there.  In the meantime, I have been contacted by families who say that is not the case.  I am not sure whether that is just a breakdown in communication but I would like to get more information on this.  The witnesses do not have to take my word for it; the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>this week published an article on the matter written by Cianan Brennan.  Last week, the HSE stated that &quot;staff and clinicians talk directly to service users at Garnish House on a constant basis about their future plans&quot;.  However, the family of a Garnish House resident stated &quot;The only communication we (my relative and my family) received regarding my relative&rsquo;s move from Millfield House to Garnish House came on the evening of the move in April 2020 via a short phone call from ... Millfield House&quot;.  Another communication I received from a family states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe asked both the Garnish House staff and the clinical team as recently as last week for information.  On pointing out that a recent PQ response ... [to a question I tabled] stated that Garnish would be vacated by the HSE in early 2023, the Garnish House staff and clinical team stated that they have not been informed of this.  The uncertainty of the past two and a half years has led to a deterioration in our relative&rsquo;s mental health. <\/blockquote> <p>My time is running out and I do not want to use it all on this issue but the clear answer to this issue is to find out exactly what the communication has been.<\/p><p>In the email I received from the chief officer in the CHO he states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn this context, there is and has been on-going discussion with residents of this high support service, to ensure that they are aware that the service would be moving at some stage, though we would not have a finalised decision on its location.  This discussion would be more in the context of keeping service users aware of the temporary nature of the service location rather than in any greater detail and not to detract from their own individual plans of moving forward to a more independent living model suitable to their needs.  Once we are clear on the service relocation plan, the clinical team will be engaging with each service user once again in more detail on the specifics. <\/blockquote> <p>I am reading this into the record on purpose.  The email continues:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe commitment is made that the service will transfer from Garnish House by the end of Q 1 2023.  There will be full communication with service users around the details of the service transfer in advance. <\/blockquote> <p>I know we discussed the matter last week but these are incredibly vulnerable people.  We know that Cork-Kerry CHO's idea of lots of time in advance is, at best, three months, because that is what it did in the context of Owenacurra.  These people have been living there for a very long time.  I would love for the HSE to come back to me and explain exactly what the communication has been.  I do not want to say that what we have been provided with is muddy but there is not a huge amount of detail from the CHO on exactly what the communication with these people was.  There should be a log.  If a clinician speaks to a family member, he or she makes a note of that, as is best practice.  If the families are saying one thing but the HSE is saying another, the way to move forward and get rid of that grey area would be for the HSE to simply set out exactly how it has been informing residents and their families.  I acknowledge that the CHO has been careful to state here that it does not wish to discuss individual residents.  I am not asking for anyone's name or PPS number or anything like that; I just want to understand how the testimony of the HSE is so at odds with what the families are telling us.  That is really important in the context of people being moved from their home of more than a decade.

I want to move onto an issue that I raised in the D&aacute;il yesterday, which is in relation to the level of claims against the HSE and where we are with that issue.  The amount paid out for the level of claims in 2021 was &euro;461 million.  That was paid out by the State Claims Agency.  Not all of that figure related to healthcare but, as I understand it, the bulk of it was.  As the figure in the previous year was &euro;372 million, that is an increase of &euro;87 million.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the estimates, it is my understanding that were everything settled in the morning for all claims against the State, the figure would be approximately &euro;4.2 billion.  However, the figure for the healthcare sector is approximately &euro;3.4 billion.  We have dealt with the issue of insurance.  It is in the context of dealing with the insurance Bill yesterday that I raised this issue.  We made major changes to many areas of insurance over the past ten or 15 years but we have not really made any major changes as to how we process and deal with things when incidents do arise.  No matter how careful people are within a hospital setting, errors do happen.  What we try to do is try to reduce them as much as possible.<\/p><p>Has any analysis been carried out on what can be done to reduce the level of errors and hence the level of claims?  Where an error arises, should we be far more proactive in dealing with it than the current system appears to be?  Unfortunately, the HSE is getting caught up by post mortems, inquests and so on.  I am thinking of the idea of having an overall review of how we can deal with this in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022100600002#L00200","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665045000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>There are two parts to this.  The first, which the Deputy raised and is the most important, is trying to make sure we are managing the risk and reducing it for patients and service users.  We are very significantly focused on that.  The State Claims Agency, in fairness, has given us great assistance in that.  We seek to focus on making sure that we log and report incidents and that we investigate them, seek to learn the lessons and respond.  Specifically, in the case of a subset of the incidents that are driving a disproportionately large amount of the annual payment that the State Claims Agency makes and we reimburse - the catastrophic birth cases - we have established under the chief clinical officer a separate central team which works with maternity units when they have these tragic cases to see what can be done differently and what lessons can be learned.  That is despite the fact that the incidence of those catastrophic cases, which are individual personal tragedies for the families involved, is in line with international norms for developed western economies.  We still would like to reduce it and reduce it further.<\/p> <p>  The second part is that the State Claims Agency, under its own legislation, is the indemnifier for the State.  As well as providing risk management support to us, which is excellent, it also has to seek to progress the claims.  We discussed that with Deputy Catherine Murphy.  It does not itself control the legal process in which it operates.  I understand that there are efforts to streamline elements of that legal process.  The evidence to us is that the increasing level of costs appearing in our accounts for reimbursing the State Claims Agency and the increasing noted contingent liability around future costs of claims are not being driven predominantly by the volume of claims increasing or the severity of claims.  They are being driven by the legal process and increases in the cost of processing, completing and paying out claims.

When they are three quarters of the way there they are told that an ambulance has arrived on the scene and told to turn back.  Not only is time lost, but that also leaves parts of the midlands without a service.  I have heard reports of this from different parts of the country.  On the second occasion I raised this with Mr. Reid and pressed him on it, he said that the HSE was looking at the geographical situation, that there may be a case for geographical limits and that there were working groups looking into this along with the unions, which I know about.

The city council's costs are its own costs and they intermingle to some extent.  The service it has, which is a great service, is a fire brigade service with an ambulance component.  Again, let us remember that the key thing to be resolved in all of this is the integration of call-taking and dispatch, because that is a quality and safety issue.

The two things we are doing, which the CEO mentioned in his opening statement, is hear and treat and see and treat.  We are looking at ways to offer services to patients in the community or at the point of contact.  We have developed a clinical hub and I might ask Professor O'Donnell to talk about the clinical aspects of in a moment.  The hub tries to provide a meaningful clinical solution for patients at the point of contact, as distinct from having to send an ambulance, which is not necessarily always the right thing to do.  An obvious example is when somebody dials 999 with a broken toenail.  They may be alternate pathway of care we can offer to that patient in those circumstances.  The out-of-hospital cardiac arrest strategy is based on the sudden task force report from 2007 that has been Government policy since then.  It says every uniformed responder in Ireland should be contributing to a reduction in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest mortality.  That involves the fire services, the Garda, community first response schemes and the Irish Coast Guard.  That strategy is focusing on embracing all those organisations and we have 12 organisations around that table that are actively involved in progressing that strategy, which is funded this year to the tune of about &euro;650,000, and all that money will be expended on that.

We have an aging population and a much more complex healthcare system.  What we are currently doing, and what we are going to build on to do in a much wider fashion, is identify patients who have low-acuity healthcare needs and try to address their healthcare needs in the community close to them so they do not have to go to hospital.

It has been referred to very strongly in contributions by other members but the importance the NAS has across every constituency in the country cannot be understated.  All I can tell the officials about is what is happening in my own area and unfortunately the reports are not good.  Recently, we had an incident in east Cork where a gentlemen who was waiting over 90 minutes for an ambulance died.  I have dealt with other consequences for people who have been waiting well in excess of an hour.  The consequence of course was the person who was waiting for the ambulance is now deceased.  Unfortunately, this seems to be a recurring issue.  Our existing ambulance service staff, especially those in the HSE Cork-Kerry region, are working exceptionally hard.  I know many of them and they are good people but they will say themselves they are under huge stress.<\/p> <p>  Something I find completely unacceptable is that when it comes to arriving at the hospital, staff must remain with patients and this effectively disallows them from leaving places like Cork University Hospital and other emergency rooms to go back on the road and get back out there to help people.  It is a profoundly flawed system.  That is the question I put first and foremost.  From a cost perspective, what is the HSE planning to do to allow a quicker turnaround time for ambulance crews who arrive at a hospital with an extremely sick patient and who want to get the patient into the hospital and leave?  I am hearing many reports of crews who are being left in the hospital caring for patients, which is something they should not be doing, quite frankly.

We must remember the hospital staff themselves are under significant capacity pressures, which we are trying to alleviate.  It is also about working with them so that we are all thinking of the patient who could be at the side of the road needing the ambulance.

Absolutely, it is probably the single biggest clinical risk we face at the moment.  Working closely with all of our colleagues across the acute hospital sector we collectively realise the implications of offload delays and the clinical risk this presents, which is the patient lying on the ground waiting for an ambulance because it is parked at a hospital somewhere.  The solutions are complex.  Some of it is down to capacity in the hospitals and in the ambulance service.  We are focused on working with our acute hospital colleagues to try to streamline the process of handing over patients, and looking at measures we can take <i>in extremis<\/i>.  Part of that is how we prepare for the forthcoming winter period.  For example, Professor O'Donnell is involved in a high-level group along with other clinicians looking at what are some of the process solutions we can put in place.  From our perspective, we are looking at measures around improving the local escalation arrangements between local National Ambulance Service, NAS, managers and local hospital managers.  We are looking at models such as fit to sit, where we must take a deep look at ourselves and ask ourselves whether every patient who attends an emergency department needs to go in on a stretcher or are some patients clinically suitable to sit in a chair, which would release the ambulance to get out back out to another patient.  We are also looking at cohort arrangements whereby we can have one crew looking after more than one patient, to release another ambulance.  These are the kind of <i>in extremis<\/i>measures we need to look at as part of our own contingency planning.  It is very high on our radar but the solution will not lie in the acute hospital or the National Ambulance Service looking at it in isolation.

This issue has not occurred just today or yesterday.  It has been going on for a number of years.  It is starting to seriously worry me now and, while I do not mean to be parochial,  in my area we are seeing a collapse in SouthDoc services.  I am getting repeated calls from people telling me that they can get through to SouthDoc.  This causes issues and knock-on impacts on whether or not ambulances should be called. Then, when ambulances are called the waiting times are far too long.  This is happening as a consequence of the issues outlined, and as I have outlined, in that they are not being released quickly enough from the hospital.<\/p> <p>  Surely it is not that big of an undertaking for the HSE to put in place a task force to look at this over six months, and to get teams in place at hospitals to receive the patients so that the ambulance crews can get back on the road.  That is all it is going to take: a couple of nurses and a couple of doctors.  We are all aware of the recruitment shortages in the HSE at the moment, but I do not believe it would have an adverse knock-on impact on the entire national healthcare system to put those staff into the busiest hospitals in the country.  It all boils down to the fact that ambulance crews should not be sitting in hospitals caring for patients.  They should be out on the road trying to rescue people who are in circumstances where they need the help.  It is unacceptable that this is going on in this day and age.<\/p> <p>  From my knowledge and from what I am hearing in my area it seems to be deteriorating.  That is a serious worry.  Is the provision of funding for a task force something that the HSE would be willing to undertake or look at, and that we would have period of time to look into this issue, with a time limit to come back with some findings to the Government?

Mr. Morton mentioned that there is a group already in place focused on this issue between hospitals and the ambulance service.  The core of the issue with regard to staffing is that we have put extra funding in for safer staffing in our emergency departments and our hospitals.  We also discussed at the committee recently, and the Deputy has mentioned, the challenges around staffing in the context of recruiting nurses and doctors in emergency departments.  As Mr. Morton has said, some of the measures that have been set up with the ambulance service are to try to mitigate those pressures that continue on our emergency departments.  Part of the winter plan is looking at those measures.  It is not just in the ambulance service because, in fairness, the challenge is not just there.  It is in the hospital on the one hand as well as trying to grow the capacity in the ambulance service.<\/p> <p>  We are under pressure.  We spoke to the NHS last night and they are equally under huge pressure on this issue of ambulance turnarounds.  The causal factors are partially down to the current increased demand going into the winter.  This is why that group is in place to look at solutions in the short, medium and longer term, and also looking at crisis solutions, as Mr. Morton has set out.  Mr. Morton might want to respond on that.  I want to be clear to the Deputy that there is a group focused on this.  We see it as a huge issue for our performance, for safety, for the release of ambulances, and for patients.  There is a group focused on this for our hospitals and ambulance services.  A collective solution needs to be found.

I will leave it to the experts to make their assumptions but it is my understanding that perhaps the person could have been helped if they had got to the hospital on time.  This is extremely worrying.  It is just not good enough.  It is wholly unacceptable that ambulances are being pulled from the middle of Leinster down to Munster in east Cork, and particularly when we have hospital only 45 minutes up the road.

What has been done now because I would not like to see the country caught again?  Because of international travel now, the world is a smaller place.  I am not an expert on this but the Spanish flu became an epidemic mainly in Europe.  It did not travel as far and travelled more slowly.  Many of us thought that perhaps Africa would be very badly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic but it turned out that the virus did not reach parts of Africa because, from a development point of view, cars were not as available and people do not move as far.  Many localities in Africa, apparently, remain, thank God, fairly Covid-19-free.

On the issue of costs, and in answer to parliamentary questions I have submitted over the years to which I have often had difficulty in getting a direct answer, where it might take a couple of parliamentary questions, these replies confirm that agency staff cost more to the HSE than directly-employed HSE staff.

Obviously, where relevant, I referred to chapters that were published and that dealt with issues.  I also drew attention in a number of cases to material instances of non-compliant procurement.  This is where the aggregate level of identified non-compliant procurement was in excess of &euro;500,000 each.  In relation to four of the appropriation accounts, I drew attention to specific matters.  For Vote 11, Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I drew attention to a payment of &euro;460,000 to a supplier in settlement of arbitration proceedings.  For Vote 13, Office of Public Works, I drew attention to the continuing operation of a maintenance contract where the expenditure incurred is significantly greater than that envisaged when the contract was put in place.  This places it in the category of non-compliant procurement.  For Vote 34, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, similar to last year, I drew attention to a continuing large EU fine incurred in 2021 in respect of a wind farm constructed in County Galway.  Finally, for Vote 42, Rural and Community Development, I drew attention to the recovery of grant funding of &euro;1.09 million from Mayo County Council following the termination of funding agreements for four projects under the Department-funded outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme due to identified irregularities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022100600002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665045000,"counter":541,"content":"<p>Regarding the OPW contract that is now considerably more expensive than when it was signed, what is this about?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022100600002#DD00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665045000,"counter":542,"content":"<p>If I may, I will look and find the detail for the Chair.

The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is that from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to committee meetings.  <\/p><p>No. R1476B is correspondence from Ms Cathy Bryan, public transport and corporate services division, Department of Transport, dated 22 September 2022, explaining why the financial statements of the National Transport Authority, NTA, were not laid before the Houses within the timelines set down in Circular 24\/21.  To put this in context, Circular 24\/21 included the timelines within which accounts and funds audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The circular states that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIf exceptional or unusual circumstances arise which cause an unavoidable delay beyond these time limits, either for a body or fund in submitting its financial statements\/accounts to the parent Department or for the Department in laying the financial statements or accounts of the body or fund before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the clerk to the Committee of Public Accounts [...] should be informed of this by the relevant Department. <\/blockquote> <p>Due to a widespread failure to comply with this provision, we have a standing agreement to request explanations from State bodies that do not meet the timelines set down in the circular.  As is the case with Nos. R1475B and R1476B, which are also on today&rsquo;s correspondence list, this item of correspondence is proactive notification of a delay to the laying of accounts before the Houses of the Oireachtas and is unusual in that it demonstrates compliance with the circular.  That is welcome, and we should see more of this type of correspondence, as it removes the need for us to monitor compliance and request explanations.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Catherine Murphy flagged this correspondence for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022100600002#DD02600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1665045000,"counter":566,"content":"<p>In 2021, all revenue generated by bus advertising was taken over by the NTA.

It was announced that the budget would be brought forward in July.  That is seven months into the year.  I would have thought that there would have been still sufficient time for accounts to have been prepared beforehand.  The cited circular is exactly one year old.  Within its first incarnation there are a number of bodies that are not providing their accounts on time.  There needs to be an improvement across all bodies in respect of that.  Of course it is better for somebody to proactively let us know that they will be late as opposed to us having to chase accounts up.

This week both the BusConnects and metro projects for my area are being published in tandem.  It would be useful to have the NTA in again.  The area I would like us to focus on is the area of fines for non-delivery of service.  If I am correct, we have seen Go-Ahead, the Luas, and one other operator that I cannot recall here, all being issued fines up to a value of approximately &euro;5 million.  It would be interesting to understand what happens those fines when they are collected, the economic calculation of whether they have any real impact on the service providers, and whether they are pitched at the right level.

It is putting the cart before the horse, so to speak.<\/p> <p>  There is a considerable amount of documentation with that item which members may find useful and wish to refer to again.<\/p> <p>  Crrespondence No. 1494B is from Mr. Michael Fitzgerald, chief officer, HSE community healthcare organisation, 4.  It arises from last week&rsquo;s engagement with the HSE, during which certain information provided by the HSE was subsequently queried.  This item got a fair thrashing out this morning.  I know Deputy Hourigan had a particular interest in it.  If members are okay with that, we will move on.  <\/p> <p>  I want to revert to No. R1492 as it was not addressed.  Correspondence No. 1492, dated 20 October 2022, is from Mr. David Moloney, Accounting Officer and Secretary General, related to our work programme and the engagements we have scheduled with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and concerns on the agenda for the engagement.  This item was only received yesterday and I am not sure if members have had a chance to consider it.  At our meeting last week, we agreed that the agenda is as follows: taken from the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2021, chapter 3, on Vote accounting and budget management; and chapter 4, on the re-allocation of Voted funding; format and content of the appropriation accounts and the associated circular; and value for money and spending reviews, which is an area we have been dealing with recently.  <\/p> <p>  We also agreed to advise the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the closure of the Benefacts database and the Department's correspondence concerning expenditure on the National Maternity Hospital, considered the week before last, in correspondence No. R1426, might also be raised.  The Benefacts database is an area which we have been trying to give attention to and scrutinise.<\/p> <p>  Given the range of material to be covered, and to avoid crowding the agenda, it was decided not to include the appropriation accounts for this meeting and to consider scheduling a further meeting at a later date.  The Secretary General has requested the committee to consider including the relevant appropriation accounts which are: Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; Vote 12 - superannuation and retired allowances; Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement, and Vote 43 - Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  The Secretary General makes the case that this was done at the meeting last May, and that the appropriation accounts provide the basis for discussing some of the other matters that will be raised.<\/p> <p>  Are members happy to proceed with the agenda as agreed last week or is there a preference to examine the relevant appropriation accounts as requested by Mr. Moloney?  <\/p> <p>  It was left off because we felt it was crowding out the meeting but the Secretary General is making the case here that the appropriation accounts would provide the basis for discussing some of the matters that will be raised and that we have highlighted.

It is point 4.  Members might remember that the Corporate Enforcement Authority, CEA, was to be set up on 1 January this year to replace the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.

A memorandum of understanding was signed by the Garda and the new CEA.  I was given the assurance in the D&aacute;il that would be the case.  It says on item 4 that there were to be 16.  I understand there are, according to this, seven members assigned.  This agency cannot function unless the garda&iacute; are assigned.  There are high-profile cases like the one in relation to the FAI and John Delaney, pending a long time, and the one for Independent Newspapers.  People lose confidence in an agency if it cannot do its work in a timely way.

This is Maynooth University but could equally relate to any of the universities where additional resources are sought from students in relation to student services.  I welcome where these are treated separately.  There were referendums in Maynooth to collect an additional amount going back to the 1990s.  The money was to be borrowed from the European Investment Bank and then paid back by the levy.  That levy was increased in 2015 to provide the new building, which had commenced.  Now the project has terminated.<\/p> <p>  There is a big protest outside Maynooth today.  Maynooth started as a college with about 5,000 students.  There are now about 15,000 so it is one of the more rapidly growing universities.  There are people from all parts of the country attending it and there are many positive things to say about it.  However, where there is a dedicated amount of money for particular projects, is it set out in the accounts that it is used for the purpose for which it is collected?  It appears this project has been ended and, instead of that facility being provided, they are told there will be additional spaces in other buildings around the campus, seating and things like that.  It is not what the students voted for.  The issue is about how it is accounted for and holding them to account for delivering things that are collected for.

There is not a restricted reserve in which that money has been accumulating.  Some of it has been spent.  It is all intended to be spent on student services or student-related services, societies and so on.<\/p><p>Obviously, a large part of it was for the infrastructure development and there was an accumulated fund.  Even as far back as 2014, it already had a certain amount in it which was being earmarked for expenditure on the centre.

I may well talk to them, as the Chairman may also do.  A key condition attached to the 1999 levy referendum was that if any of the conditions were broken, the referendum would be deemed null and void, so they were being very clear about what was expected and that was set out.  I completely understand about the hyperinflation and I believe this project has gone something like 50% over what was originally tendered.  We need to understand that.  To go back to the 1990s, there was a &euro;40 per student fee at that time and that went up to &euro;150 in 2015.  That was to be discontinued when the facilities were in place but none of the facilities that were supposed to be in place have been provided.  That is why there is such frustration that the money was collected but the services have not been delivered.  There is a wider issue and I believe we should be looking at this when we are looking at the universities and, in particular, where there are additional charges, how they are handled and what is delivered from them.

It is good to join the committee today.  I was asked to reflect on my experiences leading up to the Good Friday Agreement, GFA, in about five minutes or so.  Given that I was involved in that process for about 11 years, it is a challenge that all politicians resile from.  It is much more difficult to make a short intervention than a long one but I shall do my best.<br\/><br\/>As a teenager I was puzzled by why my community appeared to behave in a self-destructive way.  Political science said that people acted in their own rational best self-interest, but this seemed to be contradicted by the evidence I saw around me.  To better understand harmful, non-rational community attitudes, I trained in psychoanalytical psychiatry and took those ideas into political life, becoming the leader of the Alliance Party in 1987 at the age of 32.  The <i>Belfast Telegraph<\/i>assessment was that I was a decent chap but who would want such an impossible job?  It could have added impossible &quot;unpaid&quot; job.  I set up a group of the brightest of the &quot;young Turks&quot; in the party and in 1988 we published Governing with Consent, a document I have here, which was basically a restatement of policies of power-sharing, North-South co-operation and Northern Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom for as long as the people of the North wanted it.<br\/><br\/>My own commitment was to work to end the violence and the received wisdom was that the violent groups would not negotiate realistically but a compromise between the main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland would marginalise extremists, who could be dealt with by a more united community.  I engaged with the various political and civil society leaders in Northern Ireland and with Margaret Thatcher and successive British Prime Ministers, as well as Charles Haughey and those who succeeded him as Taoiseach.  John Hume was also working to develop a talks process but although we got it under way, it moved very slowly and did not stop the violence.  When we seemed particularly stuck the four Northern Ireland party leaders would meet alone without British or Irish Governments, civil servants, advisers or anyone else.<br\/><br\/>I remember at one such meeting John Hume said to the three of us, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re going to get anywhere without me engaging with the IRA.&quot;.  I will always remember looking at Jim Molyneaux sitting on my right.  The blood drained from his face, and he said, &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s it, there&rsquo;s no hope then.&quot;.  I  went home downhearted that power-sharing had been dealt a mortal blow.  What could I do?  I knew John well enough to realise that he would not easily be persuaded to change his mind, so we would have to test his idea to destruction.  We could continue to argue about it politically, but we were going to have to go along with him and see what happened.  This required a fundamentally different political analysis, which went as follows.  You can have a political process without engaging with the violent groups, but you cannot have a peace process without them since you need to persuade them to give up violence.  They will not abandon their political dreams and so they need to be persuaded that the non-violent democratic political path is a better way of achieving them.  This was the road that led to the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement.<br\/><br\/>There is little in the agreement that had not been prefigured in Governing with Consent or any number of other documents over the years.  The difference was the understanding that the problem was not a failed political system but disturbed historical relationships between the various communities.  We identified the three key sets of relationships as being between unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland, between North and South and between Britain and Ireland.  The peace process required three strands that would involve the political representatives of those three sets of relationships and the outcome was three sets of interlocking institutions, the power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly, the North-South executive bodies and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council.<br\/><br\/>The Good Friday Agreement was however a divergent agreement.  Unionists agreed to it on the basis that it was a settlement through which the IRA would give up violence in return for guaranteed nationalist participation in the government of Northern Ireland at the highest level.  Nationalists saw it as another step in a process that would lead ultimately to a united Ireland.  This divergent understanding did not need to be a problem if there was a continued focus on building the three sets of relationships, but that is not what happened.  In the talks process, I had proposed that the Northern Ireland Executive should be formed by a coalition that was required to reach 67% support in the Assembly.  In Governing with Consent we had actually said 70%.  In the talks our proposal was two thirds.  This was a way of promoting cross-community engagement.  It seemed to me that John Hume&rsquo;s proposal, which was the other main proposal of a majority of unionists, majority of nationalists and majority of the whole was doomed to deepen polarisation.  I also believed that prisoner releases should be predicated on dealing with the weapons, a demonstration of their commitment to democracy.  However, I lost the argument on both issues and both came back to bite us.<br\/><br\/>When the  Good Friday Agreement did not have the mechanisms to ensure the implementation of the latter issue, the British and Irish Governments put the Independent Monitoring Commission in place, and we spent seven years working, with some success, on getting rid of the weapons and the paramilitary organisations.  However, that still left the vulnerability to political polarisation unless there was a constant focus on the three sets of relationships, and that did not happen.  For years the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council did not meet at the highest levels, leading to problems on Northern Ireland, but also contributing to the Brexit problem.  A new generation of Northern Ireland politicians also failed to understand that the unionist-nationalist and North-South relationships needed to be constantly nourished through respect and engagement.  Now all three sets of relationships are in poor shape. <br\/><br\/>Twenty-five years on, the context has also changed.  Instead of joint EU membership facilitating British-Irish relations, the EU now backs Ireland against the post-Brexit UK.<\/p><p>Similarly, the United States, which has long-standing but different relationships with Britain and Ireland, is now siding with one against the other on this issue.  In addition, there are profound post-Brexit changes in political demography and all of this requires a recasting of our understanding of the three sets of relationships.  The peace process, in my view, is long over and we are now in a complex political process which requires a greater degree of commitment, effort and creativity than we have seen for some time.

It is great to see Lord Alderdice again.  I thought he did very well to be so succinct.  I know him well enough to say being succinct would not be his strong point, but he got a lot in within five minutes.<\/p> <p>  At the beginning of his comments, Lord Alderdice mentioned conversations he had with Jim Molyneaux, John Hume and others.  Around that time, Jim Molyneaux described the Good Friday Agreement as the most destabilising thing that had happened in the North.  Lord Alderdice also spoke about cross-community engagement and constantly nourishing those relationships.  I think that is why, some 25 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, there are still big chunks that have not been implemented.  We still do not have a bill of rights, the civic forum or the all-Ireland civic assembly that was discussed.  The brakes have been on all-Ireland co-operation for decades.  Strand one, as Lord Alderdice is aware, is not operating at the moment but strand two has been non-operational for a lot longer, starting when unionists walked away from those arrangements.  To be honest, the only thing that there is any kind of life left in now is strand three.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask about that destabilisation Jim Molyneaux talked about.  Lord Alderdice spoke about looking for cross-community engagement and the 70%-odd.   We have put that to bed; it is 50% plus one.  Does Lord Alderdice recognise now why that is so important?  There has been, to use Lord Alderdice's term, a lack of constant nourishment from unionism.  I have come through this.  I grew up throughout this process.  I sometimes feel despair.  I know we do excellent work and there are many people within civic unionism who are very pragmatic, who understand what it is like to live beside the Border and were not in favour of Brexit and of us coming out of the EU.  Those people recognise the difficulties and challenges around us sharing a landmass with 26 counties that are within the EU and us being outside of that.<\/p> <p>  Political unionism has failed in that constant nourishment role.  I would like to get Lord Alderdice's thoughts on that.  I presume that, 25 years ago, he would have thought, like we did, that we would have had a border poll, that we would have been further down the list of all-Ireland co-operation and we would have been able to engage at a level where it became easier and more natural.  The polarisation that he spoke about seems to have been fed to a certain extent by political unionism.  Brexit has been very damaging for everybody on the island of Ireland, whatever your background is or wherever you come from.  How does Lord Alderdice see the past 25 years?  How have they shaped up?  Would he share the assessment that there could have been a little more generosity of spirit and more working together, had we been able to do with political unionism what we have been able to do with civic unionism?  I have been there.  I have worked on committees.  I have been on the Executive.  I have worked really well with people across the political spectrum but that lack of generosity or willingness to discuss the future seems to be why we are stuck in this particular situation now, where strands one and two are de facto parked.  I hope they are only parked.  How long can we keep breathing life into those institutions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022100600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Gildernew"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665010800,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gildernew.  She has mentioned quite a number of important things.  I may be wrong but my memory of it - and that is getting a bit more faulty as the years go on - is that Jim Molyneaux was describing the IRA ceasefire or cessation as the most destabilising thing, rather than the Good Friday Agreement itself.  I think the reason for that was, whenever the violence was going on, you kind of knew where the enemy was, in his terms.  Once that stopped, I think he realised that once republicanism moved away from depending on physical force and moved towards depending on the mandate, that did to some degree really change and eventually threaten the perspective that he would have held to in those days.<\/p> <p>  After 25 years, things have changed.  I will say a little about what I think has changed.  Ms Gildernew is quite right in that 25 years ago, I certainly believed that we would be a lot further along the road of collaboration with each other.  For some time, it looked pretty good when Ian Paisley of the DUP was leader and Martin McGuinness was deputy First Minister and then, subsequently, with Peter Robinson replacing Ian Paisley.  It was looking reasonably promising at that time.  I would not overstate it; there were still all sorts of problems but there was at least a degree of optimism.  Ms Gildernew, while she continues to look very young, is to some degree part of a previous generation that understood what the violence was like, how it adversely affected all sides of the community, and so on.<\/p> <p>  As the next generation came along and the longer there was a degree of \"peace\", if we use that word, the more people kind of took it for granted and second, the more the relationships diverged.  Ms Gildernew mentioned civic unionism, as distinct from political unionism.  Certainly, within political unionism, there was an increasing fear that ultimately, they were going to lose.  It was not just a question of demography being a problem for them.  I think they began to feel, and frankly, given that I have been over at the House of Lords for 25 years or more, I have seen a change in the relationship between politicians in London, on the British side if you like, and politicians in Northern Ireland.  The sense of attachment to Northern Ireland and its people and institutions is not the same as it was 25 or 30 years ago.  There are all sorts of interesting reasons for that but they are not reversible.  I do not believe that political games being played with the protocol and so on represent a real deep sense of attachment and interest, as far as politicians on this side of the water are concerned, towards Northern Ireland or unionists.  I think unionists realised that things are not going in the right direction.  You might well say, with good reason, that if unionists feel that, surely the thing to do is to make a good relationship with the people they are going to be spending the whole of the future with.  That is a completely rational position to take but one of the things that led me into my own approach to politics was a realisation that people frequently did not behave in their own rational best interests.<\/p> <p>  Even over the Brexit question, many of us were saying to people in the DUP, and indeed the Ulster Unionists, who did change their position, \"for goodness' sake, do not vote for Brexit.  It is not in your best interests at all\".  They did not listen and we know the outcome of that.  There are all sorts of ramifications from it.  The problem is that the three sets of relationships have not been attended to or nourished in the way that they could have been.  It is important also to note that people in Northern Ireland and in other places too have long memories.  They have long memories regarding historic hurts and difficulties.<\/p><p>Horrible things happened on all sides and it is quite difficult to let go of those.  That was one of the things we tried to do and we were making some progress on it at the start but that has stalled, as Ms Gildernew described the institutions having stalled.<\/p><p> It is not impossible to get some of these things back together again.  If the British and Irish Governments can find a way of working together to help, not use it against each other in some kind of political game but genuinely help, that would be most helpful because we must remember the Good Friday Agreement, and the Anglo-Irish Agreement before that, came about because the two Governments were the driving force that held things together.  Insofar as they are not doing that in strand three or in any other context, that is unhelpful and we would both probably agree it is important that the two Governments work together to try to take us forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022100600002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Lord Alderdice","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665010800,"counter":620,"content":"<p>That is very helpful and I agree that much more could be done.

Frankly, that means the political trajectory in the medium to long term is probably more encouraging to nationalists and republicans than to unionists and loyalists.

Many people in Northern Ireland feel increasingly little identification with the current British Government and the kinds of attitudes that are seen there.  An openness to looking for other sets of relationships is evident.  I agree with Ms Gildernew.  The way we finished up in the Good Friday Agreement was that if a border poll was held and people in the North decided they wanted to be part of a united Ireland, there would not be a question of having to apply for membership of the EU.  Northern Ireland would automatically become part of a united Ireland and part of the EU.  As Ms Gildernew said earlier, that is 50% plus one.  It is not any other weighted majority.  There are other cases for weighted majorities in the formation of the executive that did not pass, as I said, but in respect of a border poll or a referendum, it should be 50% plus one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022100600002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Lord Alderdice"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665010800,"counter":624,"content":"<p>Before we move on to the next speaker, does Lord Alderdice have a message or anything he would like to say to either the Irish Government, which is represented here, or indeed to political unionism because it is in a difficult position as regards its future?

All sides have to work pretty hard at that.  I hope political unionism in particular finds a way of addressing that in a more serious way.  It is natural for people to fight against a future they do not want to see, but sometimes that is not in their best interests.  They need to address the reality as it develops.

I am just making an observation that the relationships are different and they are not so evenly balanced.<\/p><p>The British Government has, in a way, made much the greatest contribution to that, although sometimes the EU, understandably, gets frustrated and digs its heels in.  However understandable that is, it is probably not the best way of dealing with the problem.  That is moving.  Some Brussels leaders, and indeed, President Macron from France have been saying things both the content and the nuance of which have been extremely thoughtful and helpful.  I hope we can move forward on that kind of basis.<\/p><p> The Senator mentioned the legacy of the past.  The truth is, although it was mentioned in the talks, it was not as much of a focus as perhaps it ought to have been.  In the Colombian peace agreement, for example, one of the first Bills passed in response to that was about the victims.  That is not to say that it was very good legislation or that it resolved their problems, but at least it showed where it was in their priorities.  In retrospect, the issues of the victims were mentioned, but they did not necessarily have the priority that they might have had.  That is one element of legacy.<\/p><p> It is not just the people who were directly harmed who are part of the legacy; it is the political and cultural remnants of that.  People look at their community, another community or other communities and they remember difficult and unpleasant things that happened for them in the past and they find it difficult to forget them.  They find it very difficult to let go of them.  When we had the Good Friday Agreement, there was at that time a degree of momentum that we felt was going to carry us forward beyond a lot of these bad, difficult feelings, because of these new relationships that were being developed.  In truth, at that time, there was a good prospect of that.  The more the momentum stalled, the more people began to feel that they were not being very well treated by each other at a political or public level and the more people went back to remembering all the difficult things that had happened.  I could even see it in the talks process where, when things were going well, people were a bit more optimistic.  When things got a bit more difficult, you could hear people say, \"I knew it, they were never interested anyway\", or \"they were always agin us\".  Once you get the momentum up again, that ought to take people beyond it.<\/p><p> It is not so much that the legacy of the past is one of the enormous hurdles that has to be overcome.  When you focus too much on it, it makes things worse.  The lack of momentum and progress is a symptom of the problem in the relationships.  I could see in dealing with individual people as a psychiatrist in clinical practice in the old days, or at a community level, that by focusing too much on the past, the hurt and the difficulties, you can get stuck in it.  There is not always a way out that enables you to let go.  It is a very difficult, sensitive issue.  If we make more progress on the political front and provide the kind of counselling and care for individuals they need and deserve, that holds out some possibilities.<\/p><p> The other final warning is one I made many years ago.  Some people say, \"The generation that was damaged as victims will die and that will be it\".  It will not.  One of the things we know in working with trauma is that it is a trans-generational problem.  It gets passed on.  The consequences get passed on, and the consequences that are passed on may become de-linked from what actually happened.  Where somebody shows symptoms or difficulties and they remember what happened and can speak about is one thing.  With the next generation, they sometimes do not realise why they are in the problems they are in, nor do those who are working with them.  That can be even more problematic.  We should remember, at an individual level at least, and at a community level to some extent, that there is a trans-generational component to this, which is not going to go away easily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022100600002#D01100","nonspeaker":"Lord Alderdice","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665010800,"counter":631,"content":"<p>Like the other contributors, I welcome Lord Alderdice to the committee and compliment him on his work over the years in different roles both in Stormont and Westminster.  On the final point that Senator Blaney made and Lord Alderdice responded to regarding legacy issues, the British Government has united all political parties in Northern Ireland, as well as all civic groups and all public opinion in our State as well - on its absolutely deplorable proposals that step back to the worst possible days.  One would expect better from a parliamentary democracy than to come up with a system that would literally give some people the right to grant themselves immunity for horrific deeds, whether they were paramilitaries or state forces.  It is absolutely reprehensible.<\/p> <p>  Lord Alderdice mentioned trauma being trans- or inter-generational.  We had a very good engagement with the WAVE Trauma Centre and that was the point the made to us all regarding the second and third generations where there has been no justice.  For example, the other day Oliver McVeigh commenting on the search under way in Bragan Bog in County Monaghan for his late brother, Columba, made the point that they are not just out for vengeance but they are out to get a body restored and have a Christian burial.  Those types of comments and those people show great grace and dignity in dealing with difficult situations.<\/p> <p>  In every parliamentary democracy, the system has its defects and faults - our own does too.  Since the Brexit debate started, even before the referendum in 2016, both Houses of the Oireachtas and all of the committees devoted enormous time to working on the Brexit issue.  We had engagement every day of the week with parliamentarians from Britain and other countries in Europe who wanted to hear our viewpoints on Brexit and the difficulties it would cause if Britain exited the EU.  Our parliamentary democracy, including the D&aacute;il and Seanad, worked well in that respect in support of the Government.  In that debate, there was never antagonism from the Irish side towards the British side.  We were outlining our concerns very cogently and quite rightly and those concerns have come to pass.  It is very important in that respect.  Of course, many parliamentarians from Westminster shared the same view as us.<\/p> <p>  Ms Gildernew mentioned the lack of a civic forum.  That was within the competence of Stormont, to my recollection.  I recall speaking to some of the people who participated in the short-lived one, from trade unions and other civic bodies, who found the workings of it very beneficial.  It is a shame it has not been re-established in a different format to give civic society additional voices apart from the political representation they have.<\/p> <p>  With regard to winning support for the political institutions and politics in general, is a greater focus needed from both Stormont and Westminster on trying to improve the lot of many people in the disadvantaged communities.  If we are to put an end to all types of violence, we need to ensure that people have the opportunity to get a good education, training and skills and go on to gain full employment.  That is the best way to engage people in a democracy and in the political process.

It is important to realise, as far as engagement with institutions in the United Kingdom, particularly at Westminster, goes, that it is a deeply divided country and it is deeply divided on the issue of Europe.  It has been for years.  When you are engaging with those parliamentarians who wish to engage on this question - there were quite a lot who did not want to engage - you probably find yourself engaging with people who are of a relatively similar disposition.  One of the problems in Northern Ireland over many years is a deeply divided community and getting everybody to engage is really quite challenging and difficult.  In Ireland, as a whole, an overwhelming majority of people want to remain within the EU.  That was not the case in England or Wales.  That was the case in Northern Ireland and Scotland.  The divisions this has opened up are deep, profound, historical, cultural and political.  What has happened is tragic, but it is important to understand that you are dealing with a different thing when you are dealing with the United Kingdom, which is so divided on the issue, than dealing with it in Ireland, where there is, if not unanimity, then overwhelming support for the particular issue the Deputy is describing.<\/p><p>Finding ways of engaging is difficult.<\/p><p> On the question of the importance of socioeconomic benefits and development and so on, of course there is a moral imperative to do this as well as a general socioeconomic and political imperative to do it.  However, that will not solve the problem.  People have deep senses of identity and allegiance that are not resolved or dealt with.  I remember we did some work, for example, with people in the Palestinian authority.  We told them they would not get the right of return but they would get money and asked how they felt about that.  They were very angry.  Then we told them they would not get the right of return but they would get a shedload of money and asked them what they thought.  They expressed even greater anger.  This is because the suggestion is that people's principles, their fundamental identity, allegiance and convictions, are purchasable, and that does not win people around.  It only makes them angry.  The issue was not just to pile loads of money into west Belfast.  That was done by the Thatcher Government.  It did not make any positive difference to the politics at all, nor could it have been expected to because people there had some fundamental identifications and allegiances which they were not going to allow to be bought off.  Sometimes the things that would potentially work in a peaceful, stable society where it was largely based on socioeconomic issues may not necessarily bring the results we want to see on the politically divisive issues of identity and allegiance.  We have to work in other ways to try to achieve this.  Can it be done?  Yes, of course it can be done.  Is it easy?  No, it is not easy at all.<\/p><p> When we come to the question of whether the British Government is more to blame than the Irish Government, there is a danger we get into the sort of blame game I remember listening to in Northern Ireland for a long time and it did not get us terribly far.  We have to say the relationship is not very good, whoever is making whatever contribution to it, and let us find a way of getting beyond that.  I am not too pessimistic about that in the medium term.  We are going through difficult stages but I can begin to see we are moving to a potentially better place.  On whether the new British Prime Minister will achieve that, she has a peace process to engage in within the Conservative Party before she engages in one with everybody else, but that may not be a long-term issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022100600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Lord Alderdice","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665010800,"counter":634,"content":"<p>We cannot comment on that, obviously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022100600002#F00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665010800,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I just have two short questions about the two Rs rather than the three Rs.  The first one relates to reconciliation and building a shared future.  There is a school of thought that says the Good Friday Agreement almost froze the divisions in Northern Ireland regarding conflict management, but at the time the agreement was formulated there were a lot of aspirations and hopes that we would see an evolution in that respect.  Does Lord Alderdice feel it is a glass half-full or half-empty in that regard?<\/p> <p>  The second question relates to reform, probably in a similar light.  A particular set of structures were put in place that perhaps fitted people's world view of how Northern Ireland was constituted back in 1998 but, as Lord Alderdice appreciates, demographics and electoral fortunes have changed quite substantially since then.  To what extent does Lord Alderdice feel the institutions need to be modified to reflect those changes and to take into account some of the experiences of blockages and vetoes over the past 25 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022100600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665010800,"counter":636,"content":"<p>The questions are very much related to each other, as Dr. Farry says.  We have to be a little careful about our expectations of reconciliation because, in truth, that is about how people feel about each other and engage with each other.  I am pretty cautious about the expectations of reconciliation if we understand that in a powerful and fundamental way as distinct from simply accepting we have to live together in a community that may have diverse perspectives in it.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to reform, we are in an easier place to speak about it - maybe not easier to deliver, but an easier place to speak about it.  As Dr. Farry might recall, in the governing with consent document, we took the view that the best way of getting agreement on the formation of the Executive was a weighted majority.  In that document it was 70%.  When it came to the talks process, I pushed very hard to get a weighted majority of 67% because I felt that would ensure you had to get cross-community support.  No one community could get 67%, so cross-community support was necessary. What it would do would be to encourage politicians on one side of the community, as we used to talk about, to try to win the support of people on the other side of the community.<\/p> <p>  The problem I could see with the proposition John Hume was very wedded to of a majority of unionists, a majority of nationalists, and a majority of the whole was that it encouraged party leaders on one side of the community to appeal to the people on their own side and leaders on the other side of the community to appeal to people on their side.  Although John wanted to see things coming together and, frankly, I think, could not foresee a situation where the SDLP was not the largest nationalist party and the Ulster Unionist Party, UUP, was not the largest unionist party, there was in fact a dynamic built into that which was polarising in its nature.  That is why I did not want to go down that particular road.  I well remember, and I do not believe this has been a matter of public record before, a conversation with David Trimble after he had decided to go along with John's proposal where he was somewhat in two minds as to whether it was the best way forward.  I suspect he and John thought theirs would be the two largest parties and they could probably divvy up the Alliance Party vote between them.  What actually happened was something quite radically different.  Given the new situation we are in, a radically different position in terms of support for the Alliance Party, the SDLP and the UUP, returning to the kind of proposition - not every item of it - we had been making for a long time of a weighted majority as the best way of reaching across the community divide in the establishment of an Executive is something people ought to be getting back to looking at again 25 years later.  I do not believe the Good Friday Agreement is the law of the Medes and Persians.  It needs to evolve and change as the situation changes if it is going to remain a worthwhile way forward, not just in terms of reform but in the longer term, we fervently hope, in respect of the reconciliation to which Dr. Farry referred in the first part of his comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022100600002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Lord Alderdice"},{"type":"speech","time":1665010800,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I thank Lord Alderdice for coming in today.

At the time of the Good Friday Agreement, nobody was under any illusions as to what the situation would have been had there been a border poll.  The overwhelming majority of people would have voted to stay in the UK with better relations with the Republic of Ireland institutionalised through the Good Friday Agreement and so on.  It is a very different situation altogether 25 years on.  It is becoming an increasingly difficult and more complicated one for a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  Does a Secretary of State look at opinion polls over a period of time?  Does a Secretary of State look at the support for political parties or for the number of MLAs in a new assembly after an election?  It is not an easy one.<\/p> <p>  I remember talking to a friend a few years ago who was a strong supporter of the SDLP.<\/p><p>We were talking about how the situation was and I joked with her and said, \"Well, you are going to get what you want\".  When she asked what I was talking about, I said, \"You are going to get a united Ireland; I do not know exactly when, but that is the direction things are going in quite clearly\".  When she said she did not want a united Ireland, I asked her to wait a minute because she had always told me that she voted for the SDLP.  She said \"Oh yes, but I don't actually want a united Ireland\", and I replied, \"I'm sorry, but you're going to end up getting it because that's what you voted for\".  I think we have to recognise when we count up the votes that go to political parties that there may not be exactly the same support for some of the parties' leading policies in a referendum that there appears to be if you just count up their votes.  It is a bit of a complicated one.  My view is that the Secretary of State, whoever it happens to be, should not put themselves in a position where they appear to be, as is the case in Scotland at the moment, resisting a border poll.  I think they should make it clear that they are open to it.  As it becomes clearer that that is the trajectory, they should sit down to talk to people about it and try to get a bit of a sense of the situation.  Everybody then will need to be careful that they might get what they asked for, and that they might not necessarily want it.  Rather than a simple formula, I think it is a bit more complex than that.  It is an important decision for the Secretary of State.  The Secretary of State and the British Government should not allow themselves to get into a position where they look as though they are resisting it for any reason other than that manifestly there is no support for it and that is an obvious thing.  <\/p><p> The position on Scotland is a difficult one because there has already been a referendum, and you cannot have a referendum every ten minutes.  The British Government looks as though it is standing in the way of it.  I do not think that is a good place for it to be.

Lord Alderdice made a very important comment earlier when he spoke about the implications of Brexit.  I am not quoting Lord Alderdice verbatim, but he said that there is less of an interest in what happens here in Britain.  He referred to a change in the way they look at the relationships.  That gives those of us who believe in a united Ireland a chance to put our proposition in detail to the unionist community.  As Lord Alderdice has said, people in that community feel that they would less favourably treated and therefore look less favourably on a united Ireland or a new configuration of relationships on this island.  The key point to me is not getting a border poll or a majority of one; it is getting a significant consensus in favour of it based on - this is the key point - the absolute need to reassure the unionist community of all their rights into the future, including the right to remain British always and to choose their Britishness if that is what they want.  Equally, the nationalists will have their right to choose their Irish identity.  That is the key to it.  The point about Britain is that if we can reach a consensus on this island, Britain will not have a problem with that.

It was one of a number of important pieces of political progress that were brought about by John Hume with the language he developed.  The point he repeatedly made in public and in private was that it was not about uniting territory; it was about bringing people together.  It was about uniting people.  In a way, we have sort of slipped back a bit from that into talking about borders, polls, territory, institutions and all those kinds of things.  All of those things are important, but fundamentally it is about how you bring people to have a relationship with each other.  John Hume repeatedly spoke about that, absolutely rightly.  It had a positive influence on how people thought about these things.  It is not about a united Ireland in terms of the territory; it is about how you bring the people who live on the island of Ireland to a place where they can have a shared view of what the future should look like.  That is the key thing.  John Hume emphasised that.  I remember that when he was talking about his talks with the IRA, he said he had asked them what they wanted, and they had said they wanted a united Ireland.  When he told them to look at the map and see that it is one island, they said \"Yes, yes, yes but there is a Border\".  He made the point to them that what the Border tells us is that the people who live on the island cannot agree how to share it, so we have to get agreement on how to share it.  That is what the Good Friday Agreement was about.  That sharing bit - that relationship bit of the people or peoples - is the key thing.  We should not let go of that.  We should not forget about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022100600002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Lord Alderdice"},{"type":"speech","time":1665010800,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I have to say I agree.  I think that is the key issue.  It is up to all of us to put the proposition out there.  The difficulty, obviously, is to get unionists to engage with that, or even to talk in a formal or informal way about it.  One of the points that has been put to me - I think Senator Blaney touched on it - relates to trying to find something we can all agree on.  For example, can we advance a proposition on which unionists and nationalists on the whole island, North and South, can agree and which will improve health services for everybody?  Can we build a new internationally renowned university, a third level institution that everybody can sign up to, in the north west?  Can we improve our transport connectivity?  I suppose it goes back to the shared island concept.  Those of us in government in the South are putting in a significant amount of money to show the good faith we have in this regard, and we would put a lot more in.  To me, that is the way you will get a new island - a new relationship that will not result in the equivalent of an IRA campaign on the extreme unionist side.  If you force people into a united Ireland by a majority of one, or even a majority of 2,000 or 3,000, you are going to face generations of hostility and division.  Notwithstanding the majority of one, there must be a meeting of minds.

In the talks process, one of the challenges I faced was to find a way of talking about North-South collaboration that did not make unionists immediately antagonistic.  It struck me that the Foyle Fisheries Commission was a very interesting model.  It was a very small model but very interesting.  The fish in the Foyle did not respect the Border; they just swam about the place.  That is why, North and South, an executive body had to be established which reported to the Governments North and South.  It went on for a long time.  Because that collaboration happened and because it worked, it was possible to say to unionists that having a North-South body is not a betrayal of your history or your background because previous unionists did that when they had Stormont.  If you couch North-South collaboration in terms of being a way to seduce unionists away from their adherence to Britain, I think you will get a kickback.<\/p><p>However, if you say we are about building good relationships and collaborating together on things that make social and economic sense, there is a much better possibility of collaboration and the future will take care of itself.

By sitting in the Senate Chamber in Stormont and bringing about an approach that was energetic, committed and proactive, it could have survived longer.

What struck me at the time, which pertains to the current cost of living crisis, was that the community I represented in nationalist republican areas would be as badly off as loyalist communities in east Belfast.  At the time that was accepted.  There was a lot of talk about going forward together in dealing with this.  Unfortunately, the flag protest came along very shortly afterwards and skewed the whole thing.  I will continue to make the point that both communities have a lot more in common than is sometimes realised, particularly in terms of day-to-day living.  A single parent with kids is not particularly bothered about the politics of what is happening; they are struggling on a day-to-day basis.  That is now becoming more relevant with the cost-of-living crisis. <\/p><p> I deal with a lot of people from the unionist community on a daily basis in my constituency clinic.  If one is an abstentionist, as I am, one spends a fair amount of time in a constituency dealing with constituents.  I deal with issues around loyalism, unionism and people from our community.  When people sit down to think about it, we are the only ones who want each other.  I am sure the lack of interest in Westminster in the Six Counties is also apparent to others.  We lobby all parties, the Liberal Democrats, Labour and Conservative.  The lack of knowledge they have about and interest in the Six Counties is evident.  They really do not want us.  <\/p><p> At some stage we need to sit down and talk.  There has been a lot of talk about a united Ireland concept.  It is as if we want to be bolted on to the Twenty-six Counties in the morning as things stand, and God forbid as far as I am concerned.  What we need to do is sit down and talk about a new and inclusive Ireland, how it will impact on our loyalist, unionist, nationalist and republican communities and how that affects people in the South.  People want a proper health service which is free at the point of access, an integrated education system and to know how their quality of life will be improved.  We need to get that message across and that is why we need to sit down and talk.<\/p><p> Lord Alderdice is not too keen on a citizens' assembly, but it may be a way to proceed.  Trade unionism in Ireland is an all-Ireland movement.  There are all-Ireland bodies which can sit down and contribute.  What are his views on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022100600002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mickey Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665010800,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brady.  There are parts of the Good Friday Agreement that have not been implemented and parts that were implemented and then abandoned, like the civic forum..  A civic form existed for a while and was effectively abandoned.  There is no reason it should not be brought back at any stage.  There is no law against it; on the contrary.<\/p> <p>  Changes were made, such as in St. Andrews.  I do not think we are very good at change, but changes were made to accommodate short-term political advantages or problems for people.  That is rarely a good way of sorting out constitutional arrangements.  Mr. Brady is correct.  There have been changes that were not very good, a failure to implement parts and parts that were implemented and then abandoned.  Too many people forget that.  It is a complicated history.  The key thing is to use the 25th anniversary to take us forward to something that is better.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Brady made a comment that sparked something in my mind.  I spoke to a colleague from what was, in the old days, East Germany, many years ago when both of us were involved in church youth activities.  He was of a very different political persuasion to me and was quite supportive of the regime in East Germany at that time.  The point he made to me was that when German unification took place, it was the absorption of the east into the west German constitution.  They had no say in the constitution, flag, national anthem or any of those aspects.  East Germany was simply absorbed and told we will do this, this and this.  He said he felt for himself and others there was an abiding resentment caused by that.  <\/p> <p>  There is an interesting question that might come out of Mr. Brady's comments, namely if it became possible to say that we are not talking about absorption of the North into the South but rather the creation of a new Ireland that all of us live with.  As Mr. Brady said, the living with it is not just a question of identity, although I do not think we can understate that and his party would certainly be pretty strong about a sense of identity, as others might be of theirs.  He mentioned many important aspects, such as health, education, transport and agriculture.  Talking about those kind of things could be a very helpful way of moving forward and one which people might well find more agreement on that they might imagine.  <\/p> <p>  I found in the talks process that when we started talking about matters of high principle, we inevitably ended up with division.  When we started talking about matters of practical concern, we often found that there was a greater identity of interest.  There is mileage in what Mr. Brady said.  Exactly how we do it is the issue.  I suppose we have to do it carefully, and not be put off if not everybody signs up for it in the first instance.  There are interesting thoughts in what he said and it merits further conversation.  I know his party and others are currently trying to explore some of these questions, and I would encourage that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022100600002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Lord Alderdice"},{"type":"speech","time":1665010800,"counter":660,"content":"<p>There is some really good content in the debate.  Mr. Brady and Lord Alderdice hit the nail on the head in terms of discussing the issues of the day, such as education and the health service.  That is why the work of the shared island unit, led by the Taoiseach, is critically important.  That is not recognised by all across the political spectrum or given the credence I feel it should be.  What is happening is the necessary preparation if we are going to sit down and talk about our shared future.  We need to know the differences in the education systems and health services North and South.  People in Northern Ireland hold dearly the current concept of their health service in Northern Ireland.  We need to compare outcomes.<\/p> <p>  The economy, farming and agriculture were also mentioned.  The work of the shared island unit is about getting an understanding of the differences, which is vital preparation.  If the protocol is off the table, we hope that one day we will get a UK Government that has a more open approach and will sit down and take an interest in and discuss these issues.<\/p> <p>  The one organisation across these islands that is getting quite a bit of focus at the moment is Ireland's Future.  The organisation has come before the committee and I have been critical of it because I feel the work it is doing could be more fruitful if it merged some of the work with the shared island unit.<\/p><p>The shared dialogue series is the only vehicle that is going into unionist communities.  The more organisations such as Ireland's Future keep talking up a united Ireland, the greater the possibility that we push unionists further away.  That is the fear I have.  I am not sure what people expect the outcome to be when we speak at unionists rather than sit down with them.  I am not just saying this for myself.  I hear strong views when I meet unionist politicians and the community throughout Northern Ireland.  I also hear it from some nationalists.  What is the opinion of Lord Alderdice on the work of the shared island unit and organisations such as Ireland's Future?  Could they play a greater role?  If so, what does he think this role could and should be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022100600002#J00300","speaker":"1633","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665010800,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Blaney for the question and the comment.  The first thing I want to pick up on is the contribution of the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and not just in terms of structures and proposals.  The tone he has taken has been very helpful.  It is a thoughtful nuanced tone and sometimes quite courageously so.  As is the case with many of these things, it does not always get the positive response that it deserves.  He has tried and is trying and I hope he will continue to try to move along the line that he has taken.<br\/><br\/>In terms of collaboration, there is a lot that could be done to address the practical difficulties that exist.  When I was involved as a psychotherapist it was clear that we needed to work together North and South to develop psychotherapy services.  This was because we did not have enough people with the qualifications and experience either in the North or the South on its own.  I set up the Irish Forum for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy which still exists and continues to work.  I did not always find it that easy to get colleagues from the North to come with me to Dublin.  It seemed to be a shorter route from Dublin to Belfast than it was from Belfast to Dublin.  At any rate it was important.<br\/><br\/>I then began to explore co-operation in psychiatry and medicine generally and in areas such as policing.  I wanted to see whether we could arrange for people to do stints in the corresponding organisation on the other side of the Border, such as young doctors doing part of their training in the North or the South and police officers going North and South.  I began to run into all sorts of practical difficulties.  Some of these may have been excuses but I do not think they all were.  There were issues such as pensions.  If people took two years out of their pension scheme in the North, were they disadvantaged?  It was the same <i>vice versa<\/i>for people who went from the South to the North.  If we start to explore these types of practical questions, we might begin to make things happen that would then not be a problem down the line because they would have already been sorted.  This could be the case if we could practically co-operate even more than we do already on healthcare North and South.  Particularly in areas of high specialism we need the population of the entire island to make a service viable and this has happened.<br\/><br\/>If we work on these practical issues people will begin to see it happening, such as when Drew Harris came down to take up a position in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This was a very positive message to unionists in the North that there is an openness to working together North and South on policing.  This has not always been the easiest thing to work on in either direction.  There are practical things that can be done that may well help people to get over some of their anxieties and resolve some very real constitutional, practical and economic issues such as pensions.  We can ask how this could be an issue.  It is because we have different systems North and South.  If we work on these, we might be able to make quite useful progress that would mitigate some of the practical anxieties people have.<br\/><br\/>From speaking to a number of people in the unionist community in recent times, I know a big concern they have is not whether they will be oppressed on whether Protestant churches would be closed, it is about losing the health service.  The health service is anything but ideal.  It is anything but perfect.  It is not as good as it was, frankly, ten or 15 years ago.  Nevertheless people have confidence in it.  This could be a key issue for many people if there were a border poll.  If people want a border poll to go in a particular way, they may need to work on the issue of healthcare North and South to get the answer they want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022100600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Lord Alderdice"},{"type":"speech","time":1665010800,"counter":663,"content":"<p>On that point, very quickly, there is an agreement to have an all-Ireland cancer strategy and a lot of work is being done on this.

On the point made by the Cathaoirleach and Senator Blaney regarding the shared island unit, earlier Lord Alderdice mentioned it would be a helpful way of moving forward a number of issues.  This day last week, I was at an event in Cavan where An Taoiseach announced 25 projects that were being funded through the local authorities to develop further proposals for large-scale infrastructural investment in tourism, climate action and a range of activities.  Significantly, 23 of our local authorities are involved in these projects.  Every local authority in Northern Ireland is involved, as are local authorities down from as far away as Cork and Kerry.  It is great to see it.  There are joint proposals for North-South projects and all-Ireland projects.  There were people attending who hold the position of chair or cathaoirleach of various councils North and South.  Regardless of their political viewpoint, there was an extremely warm welcome for these proposals.  Many of them are projects we have spoken about North and South over the years but they have never been funded or progressed.  From that point of view, it is a practical way of building communities across the Border.<\/p> <p>  The shared island unit has issued invitations to attend a dialogue series next week in Belfast.  There is an event at Queens University Belfast on culture and arts and the challenges and opportunities for all of our island.  There is another event in the Titanic Quarter, with a joint initiative by the shared island unit in the Department of the Taoiseach and the ESRI comparing the education and training systems North and South.  This is doing effective work that can put better systems in place to benefit people of both communities regardless of what viewpoint they hold or what political tradition they come from.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  I heard An Taoiseach say in the D&aacute;il at Question Time on Tuesday that more than 3,000 people have partaken in the dialogue series.  This is really getting civic engagement.  People go along to events on a subject matter in which they have a particular interest.  This is the type of engagement that will take place in Belfast next week at two different events.  That is welcome.  We are speaking about all-Ireland forums.  It would be very beneficial if the civic forum constituted in Stormont many years ago were reconstituted.

The shared island process is welcome but it is at a very different level from where a citizens' assembly would be.

If on the other hand, you want to take things forward, the careful use of language is really important.  I know Ms Gildernew knows that because I listened to what she is saying and she is quite careful about the way she speaks about it because she lives there and works with people and so on.  John Hume and colleagues developed a particular language for the Good Friday Agreement process where we spoke about things in a particular way.  It was not just playing with words.  David Trimble famously said that because people have a past we do not like does not mean there cannot be a different future.  There are ways of speaking about things that can be helpful and ways that can be unhelpful.

This Government and Oireachtas is approximately halfway through its full term, so I believe the time for this matter to be under consideration is coming to a close and we need to know what the timeline is and when this will happen.<\/p><p>This amendment seeks to do that and I will go through some of the reasons I think that is very important, but I believe it would be useful if the Minister of State were able to give us an update.  Is this matter still under consideration or does the Government now have a timeline as to when this referendum is likely to happen and when will we hear more about it?  What are the Ministers of State&rsquo;s thoughts in that regard?  <\/p><p>On the substantive issue of water, its supply and the importance of it being in public ownership, we have seen around the world in the past number of years 235 different places where water went into private ownership and has been brought back into public ownership because the privatisation was so disastrous.  Two of the high profile areas we would be aware of are Berlin and Paris.  <\/p><p>In Paris, for example, over 24 years of privatisation the price of water increased by 174%.  While the profits of the owner soared, the amount of public investment in the infrastructure did not justify that.  That is one of the reasons water was brought back into public ownership.  Bringing water back into public ownership is a very costly exercise because this infrastructure has often been privatised at a low cost and brought back in to public ownership at a very high cost to the Exchequer or to the people.<\/p><p>In Berlin the privatisation of water was nothing short of a disaster.  It led to very significant deficits in investment in water infrastructure, which is something that we could not afford here.  I am aware that the present Government has no intention whatsoever to privatise water.  This is very important, however, where we as a committee are always talking about housing and the infrastructure needed around housing.  While there are very significant deficits in that at present, privatisation would make that even worse again.  As a fundamental issue in respect of people&rsquo;s access to this resource, with the exception of air, there is nothing we need access to more for human life, for business, for farms, for companies, for industry and for everything, than water.  <\/p><p>It is of crucial importance and the reassurance that a referendum on this will be held, putting it into the Constitution, and enshrining that public right and ownership, would be a very positive step.  That is what this amendment is seeking to do in progressing that.

We are talking here about not privatising water yet this transfer has to be done by 2026.  This represents 70 of the local authority workers who are working in the water services who are being told at the moment that they are not being forced but are being asked to change over to Irish Water, and that the county council wants this framework done by 2026.  It appears to me that the Government is looking at privatising our water system completely where it is bringing over local authority workers from their local authority work to Irish Water.  In the absence of a collective agreement or of a rejection of the framework document, some are advocating that the Government would be enabled to implement section 19 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, which provides for compulsory transfer of a number of matters to Irish Water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022100600002#A00900","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1665010800,"counter":683,"content":"<p>Can I ask Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue to please stick to Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s amendment, which relates to a referendum?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022100600002#A01000","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1665010800,"counter":684,"content":"<p>This is part of the privatisation of the water.

I agree with the comments made.  I have seen in other countries where privatisation has been brought in, either through IMF interventions or structural adjustment programmes, that it has been detrimental.  That is not on the cards here.  I give that assurance.  There is also a commitment to a referendum in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p>  The amendment concerns the wording and timeline for a referendum on the public ownership of water infrastructure.  While I welcome and share the support shown by the Deputy for a referendum on ownership, the amendment suggested is outside the scope of this Bill and cannot therefore be accepted.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy will recall, the 2017 report of the Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services supported the holding of a referendum, subject to there being no adverse impact on private and group water services.  In response, and in the context of a Private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced in the previous D&aacute;il, extensive work has been undertaken by the Department and the Office of the Attorney General to consider possible approaches to advancing a referendum proposal.  An approach based on protecting the public ownership of the entity established under law to provide public water services, Irish Water, has been identified as the most appropriate and straightforward approach.  Having consulted his colleagues in Government on the matter, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, has signalled his willingness to support a referendum on public ownership along these lines.<\/p> <p>  An important consideration in planning for a successful referendum is the need to ensure proper public engagement.  Noting that the Commission on Housing has been specifically tasked with advising the Government on a referendum to place the right to housing in the Constitution, it would make sense that the constitutional issues around the rights to housing and the protection for the supply of public water should be considered at the same time.  The Department will therefore bring its proposals on a water referendum to Government in conjunction with any anticipated referendum on housing.<\/p> <p>  It is understood that the Commission on Housing hopes to be in a position to put forward proposed wording for a referendum on housing towards the end of this year or very early in the New Year.  This approach has been outlined to unions on the referendum, on which I note the points made by Deputy O'Donoghue, in the context of the broader engagement on water sector transformation.  The position is set out in a paper entitled Water Sector Transformation: the Wider Policy Context, which the Department shared with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 18 July 2022 and which the Minister has now placed in the Oireachtas Library for the benefit of Members generally.<\/p> <p>  I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  I assure members that it is the Government's intention to proceed with the referendum on water in tandem with the referendum on housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022100600002#B00100","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1665010800,"counter":686,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State said, we had a report in 2017 report and we have a commitment to a referendum in the programme for Government.  It is now five years since the report was published and more than five years since most people felt this matter had been settled and consensus was achieved on the need for a referendum to provide assurance in the Constitution that our water infrastructure would stay in public ownership.  However, we are still left without a referendum.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State made the relevant point that what has happened in some other countries has not always been driven by governments but has sometimes been driven by the IMF or external bodies.  I do not believe and I certainly hope that we will not be in such a situation any time soon but we never know what will happen.  We need protections in the Constitution, as otherwise economic turmoil or spillover from the disastrous situation in the UK at the moment could lead to a Government being told that, whether it likes it or not, privatisation must go ahead.  If we had a provision in the Constitution, that would be off the table.  The IMF or anyone else could say whatever it wanted but the Constitution would provide full protection and we would not have to worry about the issue.  That is one reason that, notwithstanding the fair amount of political consensus on this issue at the moment, having this provided in the Constitution is a good idea.<\/p> <p>  It is positive that the Minister of State reiterated the point about holding a referendum at the same time as a referendum on housing but we do not have a date or timeline for the latter either.  My concern is that we are halfway through this Government and we never know what could happen.  If the Government were to end early due to unforeseen circumstances and these referendums are not held, the matter is then on the plate of the next Government.  The failure of the Government to give a firm time commitment is the reason I am concerned.

One of the concerns that many of us have is that in the second document that emerged from the Workplace Relations Commission discussions, which is directly related to this legislation and to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's Bill, there is no commitment to hold a referendum.  To be clear, we have a commitment from the Minister to consider, at a future date, bringing a proposal to the Government.  Does the Minister of State know if there is consensus among the Government parties that if such a proposition was brought, there would be agreement?  We are waiting for the Commission on Housing to report and we understand it will report in November.  We understand it is highly likely to recommend a referendum on the right to housing in the Constitution.  However, we also know from this committee that while a majority of members are on record as supporting such a measure, Fine Gael members, as is their right, currently do not support such a proposition, although that may change.  I am not asking about Cabinet because it is governed by Cabinet confidentiality, but is the Minister of State aware of any consensus among the three parties in government that a referendum to enshrine in the Constitution the public ownership of our public water system or utility would be a good thing?  I ask because there is considerable concern among water service workers regarding the single utility.  One of the points many of these workers make is that if there was a constitutional protection for the public status of the utility, and this speaks directly to Deputy O'Donoghue's question, the decision of whether they transfer to Irish Water would be a much easier one for them to make.  Therefore, some clarity on where the Government parties stand would be really helpful on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022100600002#B01200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1665010800,"counter":697,"content":"<p>Both this and the issue of the transformation process are outside the scope of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022100600002#B01300","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1665010800,"counter":698,"content":"<p>They are directly related.

This policy change has a consequential impact on another statutory body tasked with an oversight role with respect to Uisce &Eacute;ireann, namely, the Water Advisory Body.  There will be a duplication between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Water Advisory Body as both consider transparency and accountability matters relating to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, considers that it is in the best interests of the Oireachtas and Uisce &Eacute;ireann that there is a clear line of accountability for Uisce &Eacute;ireann, and that the Committee of Public Accounts is the appropriate body that should be solely tasked with this role.

Has its opinion been sought?  If it has not, I urge the Department to seek its opinion before any amendment is brought forward.  If there has been consultation with the Water Advisory Board, I would like the committee to have sight of the view of the board on the matter.  If the Department is not going to do that in advance of any amendment that may be tabled by the Minister, particularly keeping in mind that it might be a late stage amendment on Report Stage and in light of the significant information the Minister of State has just outlined, the Chairman should share that information with the Water Advisory Board and seek its view on the matter for the committee.
