We will proceed to correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first is briefing documents and opening statements.<\/p><p>No. 1271A is correspondence received from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 10 May, providing briefing for the meeting which was scheduled for today but has been postponed until a later date.  We note that.  No. 1288A is from Mr. Kieran Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, enclosing his opening statement for today's meeting.  That is noted.  No. 1290A is from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, enclosing his opening statement for today's meeting.  That is noted.<\/p><p> Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publishing.  No. 1266B is correspondence received from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 1 May 2018, providing a note on non-resident high wealth cases and how the Revenue Commissioners monitor their compliance with residency rules.  We note that.  No. 1268B is from Mr. John O'Sullivan, Commissioner of Valuation, dated 2 May 2018, providing information on the failed tender process to procure external services for the proposed independent review of the Reval 2017 projects.  That is noted.  No. 1272B is from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, dated 3 May 2018, providing additional information as requested at the meeting of 19 April 2018, including an explanatory note on the different models for measuring of national output and income, that is, gross domestic product, GDP, gross national product, GNP, gross national income, GNI and modified gross national interest, GNI*, an update on the Apple escrow fund, Ireland's contribution to the EU budget and components of the national debt figure.  That is noted.  No. 1273 is from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 3 May 2018, providing information on funding and governance models of Benefacts.  It was very interesting and I noted that.<\/p><p> Category C is correspondence from and relating to private individuals and any other correspondence.  Nos. 1265 and 1274C, are correspondence received from an individual regarding allegations against Novartis.  We dealt with this matter last year and wrote to the Department of Health on the matter.  A reply from the Secretary General stated that the information had been forwarded to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Medical Council and the HSE.  I suggest that we write back to the Department for an update.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Nos. 1279C and 1282C are from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director at the HSE, dated 9 May.  In the first item he states that Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE is not in a position to attend today&rsquo;s meeting.  Obviously, this has been superseded so we will move on.  No. 1280C is from Deputy Cullinane in regard to Mr. Tony O'Brien.  Again that has been superseded.<\/p><p> No. 1281C is from Deputy MacSharry, dated 2 May 2018, in regard to a case against Department of Finance on liquidation of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  We discussed this briefly last week and are formally noting it now.  We will discuss it in private later.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> No. 1283C, dated 9 May 2018, is from Ms Geraldine Finn of the National Cancer Registry stating that the director, Professor Kerri Clough-Gorr, is not in a position to attend today&rsquo;s meeting as requested as she is out of the country.  Can we note this item?  It is noted.  I spoke with the National Cancer Registry and was told she was out of the country.  I asked if there was anyone else it could put forward and it said there was no one else and that if we wanted to correspond with it, we could do so.  I explained that being present today would be far more beneficial, given the dynamic of the situation and the topic but the organisation is not in a position to send somebody.  The director general is away, which is noted and is of concern.  I note that we have now made the decision to bring the National Cancer Register in next week, so it has enough notice to send somebody forward.<\/p><p> Item No. 4 is statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  One account and statement has been received from the Irish Film Board and it has a clear audit opinion.  Can we note this?  It is noted.<\/p><p> We will move on to the work programme.  The secretariat circulated a note regard to our upcoming meeting with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and a copy of the committee's draft discussion document on corporation tax.  The committee will have to agree on the report and I propose we meet in private session to finalise the report the week after next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#B01500","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525939200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>On the work programme, we agreed to have a session with Cork Institute of Technology, University College Cork and the Higher Education Authority.

That was a systemic decision taken by the HSE.  Mr. O'Brien is responsible for systemic decisions taken within his organisation.  The real scandal here was the response to that systemic failure and that women were not told.  Mr. O'Brien has heard that Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na was on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning.  It was very harrowing interview.  This is a woman who had to tell her five children that she is going to die.  Obviously she is very emotional.  She told Teachta Mary Lou McDonald, who raised this issue in the D&aacute;il yesterday, that she is more angry than she is worried about her death.  It is a very personal tragedy for her.<\/p> <p>  Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na was told in 2013 that her smear test was normal.  Three years later, following a routine smear test, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The audit of the 2013 result showed that, in Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na's case, the first indications of cancer were already there.  She was never told.  It was the same for Vicky Phelan and Irene Teap.  We also heard from Stephen Teap.  I would imagine it was the same for many more women.

The fact that, even today, Mr. O'Brien does not recognise that there were systemic failures and that he should take responsibility for that rings alarm bells for me.

That is what led to the Minister, myself and colleagues in the Department believing that the audit was about a wider group of patients than it actually was.

Over a number of years, CervicalCheck attempted to ensure these figures were consistent and correlated.  Obviously, it failed.  In what aspect did it fail?

Okay.  Nobody is being held accountable.  This is a problem for me.  I will finish on this thread if I can.  I want to put on the record a communication that was received by Dr. Keith Swanick, who is also a Member of the Oireachtas, from one of his colleagues.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>How can you and your colleagues stand over the cervical controversy.  We are inundated with requests for smears with no formal guidance even how to process them, how to claim remuneration.  We cannot offer any form of reassurance to any patient so all smears need to be repeated.  Can we trust the results of repeat smears? What's the lab they will be sent to? <\/blockquote> <p>I think this captures for me the reality here.  Mr. O'Brien has taken no action against any member of staff.  He has admitted he was not told things when he should have been.  We know there were system failures.  In calling for Mr. O'Brien's resignation, I have to say it may well go to Ministers, taoisigh and the head of the State Claims Agency for further calls of resignation.  Mr. O'Brien and the Ministers are commentators on a national crisis.  We have no leaders.  That is crystal clear.  Mr. O'Brien has admitted that no action has been taken against anybody.  There is nobody accountable.  Three weeks into the crisis, Mr. O'Brien is not even in a position to tell us who was supposed to tell him but did not do so.  There is a policy of sitting back and letting everything take its course.  The people and accountability come last.<\/p><p>The problem is that all of those here, most of the political establishment and it seems the Government served the system, not the people.  That is why I again appeal to Mr. O'Brien, in the interests of the women in Ireland, to show them what their taxes have purchased - accountability on their behalf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#N06900","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525939200,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I will move on to the other questioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#O00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1525939200,"counter":438,"content":"<p>On the memorandum to which Mr. O'Brien referred and which he said would be published or furnished to the committee, was it passed to the Department of Health and, if so, when?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#O00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525939200,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I think it was a copy of something that would have been shared with the Department at the time, although I cannot confirm that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1525939200,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Can the Department of Health confirm it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#O00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525939200,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I can confirm that we are in the process of checking all records.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1525939200,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Therefore, the witnesses do not know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#O00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525939200,"counter":443,"content":"<p>At this stage, I cannot be definitive.

Two separate things are happening in this case.  One is looking at the overall system and the level of error, while the communications strategy was only about communicating with people who would be told something very significant.

Where is the process between the HSE and the States Claims Agency in that regard?  I do not see it.  It is as if there are two parallel universes.

Notwithstanding that, clearly there are lessons to be learned from the way the HSE participated in the process because matters that were in the public domain as a result of the legal process of discovery, had they been analysed more effectively in terms of the issues drawn from them within the HSE, they could have provided an additional route by which alarm bells would have rung and might have been escalated to me.

What is that based on?  Is it based on clinical knowledge?  Without knowing what the actual rate should be, how can he read a memo in his position and make that assumption?<\/p> <p>  In the data reconciliation process, the two-way data does not seem to have been transferred from the National Cancer Registry, in this case to the CervicalCheck people.  It seems that when the audit process started, for the first two years the audit data were used for education and training purposes and they were only used for patient purposes subsequently.  There is a definite swing to a focus on academia, education and data, rather than the patient.  We spoke last week on this.  There is an issue when one does not have clinicians in positions of management.  If a clinician was in charge, I firmly believe patients' needs would have been to the fore.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien talked about there not being a joined-up process when the systems kicked in.  That is a very serious admission to make because it says that the process did not work when it kicked off.  If Mr. O'Brien is admitting that the HSE cannot even communicate in a joined-up way to serve a population the equivalent to that of Manchester, he is admitting that it is not fit for purpose.  Mr. O'Brien also spoke about the corporate knowledge of the team.  I agree that just firing everybody who was in charge would get us nowhere but the way the corporate management team did its business does not seem to be the gold standard.  I am not sure how much value its corporate knowledge is; can Mr. O'Brien elaborate on this?<\/p> <p>  It is extremely strange that it is not as simple as putting a reference number into a sheet and pulling up a memo or a circular.  If the memo is not to hand, it appears as though no one can get it for Mr. O'Brien.  As for Mr. Breslin not knowing whether he got the memo, how does the Department get memos?  Where does it put them?  Does it put them in a box in a corner?  What way is it to run a business when it is not known how to find a memo or who definitively crafted a circular?  Surely, if someone writes a circular there is a reference number showing who did it.  I cannot understand this.<\/p> <p>  One reason for not having a statutory inquiry immediately was to avoid a pause in delving into things but Mr. O'Brien told me on a couple of occasions that a matter was for the scoping inquiry.  That, however, is exactly what this committee, as well as members of Opposition parties who met the Minister, did not want.  We did not want the answer to be that you could not talk about it because there was going to be a scoping inquiry or a statutory inquiry.<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. O'Brien to say how he deemed himself qualified to read a memo and make an assessment that it was reassuring and did not raise alarm bells.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#Q02500","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525939200,"counter":560,"content":"<p>The memo was the product of work that was done in the CervicalCheck programme, which has an external quality assurance, QA, committee, with significant international representation.

In 2007, having previously been director of BreastCheck, I became the first chief executive of the National Cancer Screening Service board.  That board was created to continue with BreastCheck, to seek to roll out what had been a fledgling, regionally-based Irish cervical cancer screening programme from about 1996, which had not rolled out at that point, and to begin the investigative process around the development of BowelScreen.  At the time I was very pleased to be given that opportunity because as early as 1993, when I was chief executive of the Irish Family Planning Association, I had participated in a lobbying exercise to seek to win Government policy.  I hope I played some small part in the development of the pilot programme in Limerick.  That programme in Limerick, 12 years on, had not achieved all that it could.  We were having as many smear tests taken in this country without a cervical programme, probably more than we do now with an organised programme, and it had made absolutely no difference to the incidence of cervical cancer.  Women were waiting up to a year in some instances for results.  One could not roll out a screening programme on that basis.  Some of those tests were being done on kitchen tables at home on overtime in non-quality assured circumstances.<\/p> <p>  The priority was to ensure that this country got a cervical screening programme to minimise the incidence of, and reduce deaths from, cervical cancer.  This programme has brought down the incidence by 7% per year.  There have been 50,000 high grade detections of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN, which is a pre-cancerous abnormality of the cervix, and I am absolutely certain that one of the best day's work I ever did was to ensure that this county had a national cervical screening programme that is currently called CervicalCheck.

I will quote Mr. Breen.  He said: <\/p><blockquote>I personally sat on the medical negligence working group in 2010.  We advocated PPOs, periodic payment orders, legislation.  We advocated pre-action protocol.  If we had the pre-action protocol tomorrow, I know that myself and my colleague [Jenny, who was with Mr. Breen at the time] would say it would transform the behaviour and way we would handle these cases.  It has been in the UK for a very long time and what it does is it stops the adversarial element.  People do not have to issue proceedings, simply a letter of claim.  We then issue a letter in response to that and the idea is that you narrow down the issues to the issues that are real between you and that you mediate them.<\/blockquote> <p>I can tell the Chairman that I have advocated this position for a very long time.  Despite the fact the Legal Services Regulation Act has brought that into place, subject to the making of the regulations, we do not have it even now.  It would be of considerable assistance to us if we had it tomorrow.  We still do not have it because that section of the Act has not been commenced or implemented.

From what I am hearing, some general information would be enormously helpful as to what women should do and what advice doctors should give them.

If that advice is out there, it may not be as prominent as it should be.  Women have asked me who they should talk to and if they should have another smear test.

This is based on our knowledge of what that particular case involves, whether there are issues regarding liability, for example, and what we think is the most likely outcome in the case.  Sometimes in any individual case, it can be an incremental process.  In other words, as we gather more information and we get more expert reports, it then might become clearer to us as to what the injuries and losses are.  One problem we sometimes face is that when we are well developed in a case, on the day before trial we might be furnished with a schedule of special damages in respect of something we did not anticipate.

In response to a parliamentary question, I was advised that over a period of three years &euro;20 million was spent on legal fees, effectively fighting parents in the courts.  Systems were subsequently put in place to make provision in schools for education, whether it was mainstream, special needs or whatever.  At that point, we stopped seeing so many cases going through the courts.  There was some degree of learning, albeit after parents had gone through quite a torrid time.<\/p> <p>  Every week now, we see people coming out of court.  Parents make the point that although the money will look after the child for the rest of his or her life, nothing will repair the damage.

It is a reasonable question.  The policy that was produced in 2013 was based on the pilot in the two hospitals, Cork University Hospital and the Mater.  The idea was that when bringing something new in, there would be some resistance to it.  Potentially, people would have to change their practices.  We want people to openly disclose.  We have evidence that it was not happening.  The pilots were to prove to people that we could do it, that there was no threat in it and that it was something which people involved welcomed once they had done it.<\/p> <p>  We based the policy on that experience.  We then disseminated the policy and guidelines widely, once they were written, in 2013.  So they were then available.  However, because this is such an important policy, we committed, with the State Claims Agency - because we did this work together - to undertake a training programme as extensive as we had the resources to do.  The reason it took so long was because of the initial format of the training.  The training is very high quality and has been assessed by external evaluators and by the participants.  It is very much welcomed and people find it effective.  The people involved - the one or two individuals doing the training - were training everybody.  So, taking into account the basis of the Deputy's question, we moved from training everybody to training trainers who would, in turn, train other people so that we could at least multiply it.  Our next stage now is to develop an e-learning module so that everybody can train on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#GG00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Philip Crowley"},{"type":"speech","time":1525939200,"counter":869,"content":"<p>When can we expect to see training complete and open disclosure fully operational within in the HSE in order that we might see a change in the culture?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#GG00700","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525939200,"counter":870,"content":"<p>That is a very difficult question to answer with exactitude, but I will answer it.

What we do is put policy out there.  We train people on it.  We try to de-stress it.  We try to ensure management supports people in something because one has to support staff when things go wrong as well; otherwise they will not necessarily do the right thing.

Having read it, I am shocked and it is not manufactured shock.  This reads like a letter of containment.  It states that screening &quot;is not 100% accurate&quot; and that CervicalCheck &quot;cannot give a 'yes' or 'no' answer&quot;.  I have a problem with the statement that there is, &quot;always a risk that in communicating individual case reports to clinicians of an individual patient reacting by contacting the media if they feel that 'screening did not diagnose my cancer'.&quot;  The memorandum continues: &quot;Most importantly during the course of the clinical audit to date no systematic quality problem of concern has been identified.&quot;  That is a concern.<\/p><p>The document subsequently states: &quot;One of the cytology laboratory providers has sought legal advice into the right of the programme to communicate audit outcomes.&quot;  The laboratories obviously had an issue with anyone being told the truth.<\/p><p>The memorandum continues:<\/p><blockquote>The programme is liaising with legal team.  This is not an impediment to moving forward with formal communication of audit outcomes.<\/blockquote> <p>It then sets out the next steps - this is frightening stuff - which are as follows: &quot;await advice of solicitors&quot;; &quot;Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks&quot;; and - here we go - &quot;Continue to prepare reactive communications response for a media headline that 'screening did not diagnose my cancer'.&quot;  CervicalCheck was concerned about media reaction rather than individuals who had been falsely informed they were healthy when they could have taken remedial steps such as those we have heard about in recent weeks.  The director general stated earlier he found the memorandum reassuring.  If that is reassuring, it is the clearest indictment the committee and perhaps the House more generally has heard of the culture of containment, bury, suppress and protect ourselves at all costs.<\/p><p>I did not bother to read the two follow-up memorandums but I scanned them.  The memorandum issued in March 2016 and, according to his own testimony, the director general did nothing about it from that date until he heard about it on the news.  The policy of continuing &quot;to prepare reactive communications response for a media headline that 'screening did not diagnose my cancer'&quot; was very successful for two years because everybody, including the media, were kept in the dark for two years until the director general heard it on the news.  Frankly, this is an indictment of the Minister, the Taoiseach, the Secretary General, the HSE director general and everyone else associated with this issue and are taking wages paid by the income tax from the people.  The absence of humanity, compassion and accountability is a disgrace and I hope Mr. O'Brien, wherever he is <i>en route <\/i>to meetings in Limerick today, hears loud and clear that he should resign and allow us to reflect on whether the Minister, the Secretary General, I am afraid to say, and others also have to go.

It strikes me that if I were one of the women reading the memo prepared for the director general and read by him, I would be absolutely livid.  What jumps from the pages is that the authors of the memo were basically saying to the director general that he needed to be concerned about the media reaction; not about patients or the women, but about the media reaction.  Even in terms of the next steps, nowhere does it say all women should be informed, nowhere does it say anything about open disclosure, and nowhere does it express concern for the welfare of women and patients.  Next steps include to pause all letters, await advice from solicitors and decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks.  I imagine, given the next line, that the potential risks are not risks to individuals but risks to the corporate body which is the HSE.  The next step is to continue to prepare a reactive communications response for a media headline that \"screening did not diagnose my cancer\".  It is profoundly shocking that this was the issue which was uppermost in the minds of the people who wrote that memo.

I will not be long.  I appreciate that HSE colleagues here have only just seen this and we do not know if the Department of Health had a copy of this at the time, albeit we will find out in the coming days.  There are three versions.  Without putting words in his mouth, the Secretary General said it was likely it was sent on.  What jumps out most to me from what we have just read is on page 2 of the memo.  It continued on the previous version.  It refers, using inverted commas, to \"a communications protocol\" prepared for consulting clinicians to address their questions.  It says the spokesman on matters related to this audit was Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, clinical director of the CervicalCheck programme, who we know has now moved on.<\/p> <p>  Unless I was chairing a different meeting, I understood earlier from the director general of the HSE that the communications he took to be in the memo and the programme of communications work was obviously with the patients first through the clinicians.  This is not how that reads.  Anybody reading that can see it does not use the word \"patient\" anywhere.  It says a communications protocol has been prepared for consultant clinicians to address their questions.  What about the questions of the women?<\/p> <p>  The spokesperson on matters related to the audit was named as Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, clinical director of the CervicalCheck programme.  I say to all of those here that this should not give comfort that there is a communications process in place with the people that matter the most, namely, the women.  It does not.  It says, more or less, that there will be a protocol in place to ensure the clinicians are being told.<\/p> <p>  This is almost as if within the politics of health, it was intended to ensure that there was a protocol to tell the clinicians what was going on here and to name the spokesperson.  If that is the memo written by John Gleeson on behalf of Stephanie O'Keeffe and sent to the director general, is it any wonder that the women affected were not told for years in some cases?  Is it any wonder?  This memo has nothing to do with communications to the patients.  It only goes down as far as the clinicians.  That is the most devastating part of this.  It actualises what we have all been thinking and talking about for the last week and a half.  That one paragraph is a communications process being put in place from the HSE through the screening programme for clinicians, not the affected women.  It sums up where we are today.  That is at the bedrock of where this issue lies.<\/p> <p>  The women were not being thought of.  Nowhere in this memo does it say it is necessary to put in place a programme to communicate with all of the women and to ensure that they are all communicated with properly and dealt with in a compassionate way.  It does not say that.  It says there is a protocol in place for consulting clinicians and it names the spokesperson.  Does that not say a great deal about the politics of health in Ireland and the way in which the ultimate end users, the patients affected and the women whose lives have been destroyed, were treated?  It is a devastating paragraph in the letter and it is not a paragraph anybody could read to give comfort that the communications process down to the patients was going to happen.<\/p> <p>  On page 1, it states that all international screening programmes will have encountered a media headline that \"screening did not diagnose my cancer\".  It states that the CervicalCheck programme has prepared communications material to ensure transparent, effective and robust communications processes are in place to provide clear information for the media and the public, where appropriate, on the CervicalCheck clinical audit process and results.  A small issue jumps out again; the patient.  It says \"all international screening programmes will have encountered a media headline that \"screening did not diagnose my cancer\".  It says the CervicalCheck programme has prepared communications material to ensure transparent, effective and robust communications processes are in place to provide clear information.  To whom?  Not the women affected, but to the media and the public.  Transparent, effective and robust communications processes are referred to, not for the women affected but for the media and the public.<\/p><p>That says it all and it is quite damning.

This is not what I expected to read.  When Mr. O'Brien was talking to us this morning, he was very much focused on the communications strategy and how it was not carried out.  He went further, however, and said that when he reread it, it did not cause him any serious concern.  He also talked about the requirement to manage the situation when something like this occurs in order to ensure that widespread concerns about something like the cervical screening programme are not exacerbated, which is exactly what has happened.  Given the notice on this matter, which he must have read, it is very difficult to figure out why a different type of action was not taken.<\/p> <p>  The final four bullet points on the last page of the first memo include the phrase \"Pause all letters\", which is the converse of what we have been told in respect of the communications strategy.  Obviously, legal advice was then sought.  Was that legal advice received?  What was that legal advice?  Was that legal advice to the effect that people should not be told?  Can Ms Lennon confirm that?  The memo also includes the phrase \"Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks\".  I presume that refers to the order and volume of the letters that were to be sent to clinicians in respect of making contact with the patients who had received false negatives.  It is, therefore, about who would be told first and in what order people would be told in order to mitigate risk to the organisation and the programme.  On what is termed the \"reactive communications response\", I presume there is correspondence or a body of documentation in respect of that response.  It would be useful for us to see that because clearly it will have been worked through.  The witnesses might tell us what kind of working through would have been done and who it would have been done with.<\/p> <p>  I would particularly like to know what constitutes a patient safety issue?  That kept jumping out at me as it was being said over the past week or so.  People said that it was not a patient safety issue.  I am certain the patients do not feel that reflects their experience.  Will the witnesses tell us how that is defined and where the judgment call is made in that regard?  There are a number of questions there.

I am presuming and I do not want to be presuming.  That is why I am asking the question.  There must have been something said at that meeting between the national screening service and the laboratories in May 2016 which allayed their fears and the laboratory in question then decided not to pursue any further legal correspondence.  That is one question and I do not know whether anyone in this room has the answer to it.  What was said at that meeting?  Were assurances given to the laboratories?

If the HSE is saying we have 209 women who needed to be informed, either through their clinician or directly, where are the figures of 286 and 256 coming from and how did we get from those figures down to 209?

My interpretation on the volume of correspondence is that they were recognising a backlog that had to be cleared in July-August 2016 and that once it was through that it would be in a steady-state of notifying four to six women per month, into the future, as false negative cases would have arisen.  I think that is what explains those figures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#SS00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1525939200,"counter":1323,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.  On the memo that was sent in March, which is the one Mr. Tony O'Brien said he saw, I want to quote what the director general said this morning.  He said that the memo outlined that a communication process was going to be put in place.  When pressed, he said that if the process had been carried through there would be no woman who was not informed.  I do not know how that can be taken from that memo because nowhere in the memo does it say it will inform women.  It says it will inform clinicians.  The memo says the volume of letters increases the risk of an individual reacting to the content if or when shared by the attending clinician.  It is not even clear from this that the attending clinician would share the information as it says \"if\" or \"when\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#SS00300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525939200,"counter":1324,"content":"<p>Can I make some points of general clarification on the numbers and not so much around the precision?  The number that is here is the number that is flagged for review.  The 209 that is circulating at the moment relates to those that have been reviewed in terms of their cytology and what is called a discordance - in other words, the difference in what we say now looking backwards and what was said then has been identified.  That is what that number of 209 relates to and it relates to the cohort of years.  It is not just the eight years but it is all the way up to the end of last year, in effect, because there were effectively two more years worth of the screening programme operating and contributing to that number.  Those numbers get done by starting with all of the incident cases it knows about.  We now know it did not know about the ones the registry had or did not include those.  It worked those down.  The question it is effectively asking is where a person who has cervical cancer, was there some failure in the chain of screening that failed to take the opportunity to prevent this cancer from occurring?  That could be because an appointment was not sent out.  It could be because the person did not respond to an appointment.  It could be the screening.  It could be the GP service not taking an adequate smear.  It could the cytology or colposcopy service after the full chain is looked at.  Only those where there is a reasonable suspicion that it is the smear that needs to be looked at are flagged for review and then a subset of those are identified where there is that discordance or difference between what it said back then in the report and what it now appears to be saying.

Before I do that, I believe I can speak on behalf of all members on this issue.  Today started for me with the \"Morning Ireland\" interview with Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na.  Since then, I have spent hours at this meeting and I have found this to be one of the most depressing exchanges the committee has had because of the absolute lack of information forthcoming.  There is still serious confusion and nobody wants to take responsibility for anything.  This is a source of great irritation to me and I am deeply shocked.<\/p> <p>  I will make a final point on the first briefing note of March 2016 and the statement in that note that there \"is always the risk that in communicating individual case reports to clinicians of an individual patient reacting by contacting the media\".  The concern was that the women might go to the media and that women should not be trusted.  That is the message I get from the briefing note.  This is beyond shocking when one considers how this day started for most of the people in the room.<\/p> <p>  To take up the point made by Teachta MacSharry, it is important that the director general of the HSE appears before the committee again next week.  Dr. Holohan tried to do his best to interpret elements of these briefing notes but we have only an interpretation.  We need to hear from the people who wrote the notes and the HSE director general who is responsible for overseeing all of this.  The correct course of action, therefore, would be to invite Mr. O'Brien to appear again and if he cannot attend, the person who is next in charge, whoever that may be.  Mr. O'Brien should, however, make himself available.  The Department also needs to be represented and I hope Mr. Breslin, when he returns next week, will have found the correspondence he indicated he started to look for today.  It would be great if he had that material next week in order that members could discuss it.  He can send it on to the committee at any time.  If he does not have it, that would indicate to me that it was never sent.  We will find out next week.<\/p> <p>  The other witnesses we hope to have before the committee next week are Mr. John Gleeson, Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, representatives of the National Cancer Registry who, I understand, have confirmed they will attend, the national director of human resources in the HSE and a representative of the Medical Council.

I am an Australian.  I trained in the area of paediatric intensive care and for the past 20 years have been working as an aid worker.  I am proud to be back in Ireland because I spent many years working with Catholic Relief Services here, the American equivalent of Tr&oacute;caire, to establish relationships with Irish aid organisations which are some of the most effective in the world.  The Irish people are also among the most generous in the world.  I am happy to explain to the committee how aid is manipulated and controlled by the Assad regime, as well as highlighting how we must we ensure this multi-billion dollar aid effort does not continue funding President Assad&rsquo;s killing machine.<\/p> <p>  Few of us remember that once upon a time this conflict was a revolution.  The Syrian uprising began on 15 March 2011.  The regime has been in place since illegally seizing power in 1963.  Hafez al-Assad established himself as President in 1971 and his family has exerted control ever since.  It has a policy of civilian oppression and a poor human rights record.  We saw this in 2011 when civilians who had taken to the streets were shot.  Even children who wrote anti-regime graffiti were arrested and tortured.  Doctors were killed for the crime of treating civilians injured in protests.  On 22 March 2011 the first doctor and ambulance driver were killed while trying to save unarmed student protestors who had been shot.  Shortly afterwards, the international community responded with sanctions.  Initially, they were travel bans and asset freezes in respect of key individuals deemed to be responsible for the violence such as the chiefs of the military and intelligence forces.  It was done initially by the United States and the European Union followed rapidly.  By May 2011, sanctions had even been imposed on President Bashar al-Assad himself.<\/p><p>His atrocities continued.  The next year a lot of effort went into a peace process led by Mr. Kofi Annan.  By this stage, not only had the European Union which was Syria's principal trading partner at the time extended it to economic sanctions, many other countries had also imposed bilateral sanctions.  Mr. Annan's six-point peace process failed and a massive humanitarian crisis began to unfold.  Millions were forced from their homes inside Syria and there was a massive exodus of refugees.<\/p><p> In response to the crisis, UN agencies were mobilised.  The primary UN agency involved in this work is the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, which has a mandate based on UN General Assembly Resolution 46-182.  It mandates it to co-ordinate an international response, mobilise funds from governments and implement measures through other UN agencies and partners.  It has to do this work while respecting the principle of sovereignty.  The condition imposed was that everything would operate from Damascus, that all aid would go through it and that the Syrian Government would be fully in charge of aid efforts.  These aspects are the biggest problems and have led to the current situation.  Seven years later we are faced with the worst crisis in modern history.  It is certainly the largest and most expensive with which to deal.  It is a multi-billion dollar effort for Syrian alone.  There are 5.7 million refugees outside the country and an equivalent number inside it.  Sadly, the atrocities continue, as evidenced by the chemical attacks last month in Duoma in the Ghouta region, after which further sanctions were imposed.  There is great concern about whether the sanctions hurt the humanitarian efforts.  I shall explain the matter a little.  Syria not only has a terrible humanitarian crisis, it hasalso suffered a public health catastrophe.  One of President Assad's claims is that the catastrophe has been caused by the sanctions imposed.<\/p><p> Syria has experienced two polio epidemics.  In 2013 polio reappeared in Syria for the first time in 19 years, but the outbreak was covered up by the government.  Unfortunately, the World Health Organization, the primary role of which is to support the efforts of the Syrian Government, has had to toe the line.  It was a task force in northern Syria, operated from Turkey with the permission of the Turkish Government, that took control and successfully administered a vaccination programme.  Last year there was a resurgence of vaccine derived polio and the outbreak is ongoing.  We had never seen it happen in a war before.  The war in Iraq lasted eight years, but polio did not emerge.  I hope I have given a useful example.  Well before the war in Syria broke out, vaccines were withheld from politically unsympathetic areas, leaving people extremely vulnerable.  It was one of reasons people took to the streets to demonstrate in 2011.  After 50 years of brutal repression, they did not take to the streets to discover all of these new ways of dying - being shot at, made to disappear, tortured, arrested, gassed with chemicals, starved to death in a siege and attacked with vacuum bombs and barrel bombs.  They protested because they wanted a better life and, most importantly, for the sake of their children, which is why we all care.  <\/p><p> The terrible consequence of the Syrian conflict is that children have suffered the worst and are most vulnerable.  The Syrian Government fully controls the aid effort.  It exercises control through its partners.  They include the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and the national non-government organisations, NGOs, operated by President Assad's family and friends.  They determine exactly where the aid goes and deliberately ensure it does not reach the regions most in need.  This is entirely consistent with its targeting of civilian homes and schools.  By this time last year the Assad regime had bombed well in excess of 4,000 schools.  There has also been the deliberate destruction of hospitals and doctors have been killed, which weaponises healthcare and turns people's need for it into a weapon against them by violently depriving them of it.<\/p><p> On areas under siege, the regime deliberately withholds humanitarian aid and refuses to allow civilians to leave them, which makes the siege illegal.  The proper way to operate a siege is to allow in humanitarian aid and civilians to leave, especially women and children.  The policy of denying humanitarian aid to anyone who needs it is entirely consistent with a war that the regime has practised consistently.  It is responsible for fuelling this massive refugee crisis.  It does this by using an incredibly effective intelligence and security apparatus, which is how one stays in power.  The Assad regime has been in power for 50 years because it has relied on brute force, a strong military and a very strong intelligence force.<\/p><p> Let us not forget that the people in power in Syria have all been sanctioned.  The first slide shows the head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies with Prime Minister Imad Khamis.  The picture at the bottom of the slide shows President Assad, the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister.  Let us recall that all of them have been sanctioned.  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies must work very closely with the same individuals who are held entirely responsible for the Syrian conflict.  Prime Minister Imad Khamis used to be the Minister for health.  The Minister for Health is also on the sanctions list and has been for years.  Every single government Minister in Syria has been sanctioned for participating in human rights violations - acts of violence, killing, shooting and disappearances - yet these are the same people with whom the aid agencies in Damascus are forced to work under the terms and conditions stipulated by the Syrian Government. <\/p><p> The second slide shows Mr. Bashar Ja'afari, the Syrian representative in the permanent mission to the United Nations.  In the photo one can see him embrace Mother Agnes whose name is designed to provide reassurance and allay fears.  Even though she has her own NGO, aid is withheld from those who need it the most.  She has also denied that chemical attacks ever took place.  She is one of the many people who have been appointed to roles to control the distribution of aid.  Syria is an authoritarian state and the only way one can succeed is through maintaining close proximity to the people in power.<\/p><p> At the bottom of the slide one can see Mr. Faisal Mekdad, former permanent representative of Syria to the United Nations.  Mr. Mekdad and Minister Walid Muallem are the most powerful people in the regime and have a direct relationship with the intelligence forces.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs dictates which agencies can enter Damascus.<\/p><p>Once they have agreed an agency is allowed to come in, the condition is that it must partner with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, SARC, which is a local member of the Red Cross-Red Crescent movement and Syria's largest humanitarian agency.  It is long established and staffed by thousands of dedicated volunteers.  However, it is also controlled by the same intelligence forces and has been for a very long time.  All of the agencies have to work through SARC, the primary aid agency that delivers aid, but they also have to apply for approval before they can recruit any staff.  Through the Ministry and SARC, which is controlled by the intelligence forces, they control who comes in to Syria.  We cannot get our best people to deliver an aid project when they are excluded because they are deemed to be politically unsympathetic.  They control the aid agencies, the people who staff them and the programmes delivered by SARC and through the national NGOs, which is another name for Assad's family's and friends' enterprises.<\/p><p> Faisal Mekdad's wife, Shukria, was hired by the WHO as the consultant for assessment of the mental health needs of internally displaced persons.  In the absence of any qualifications or experience she was put into this leading position by the World Health Organisation.  It is a measure of the influence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that she was put into a position for which she is unqualified.  Her only qualification is that she is his wife.  She is meant to assess the mental health needs for which Faisal himself as one of the chief prosecutors is responsible. <\/p><p> The next slide shows the major general in charge of the blood bank.  As the member can see, it is part of the Ministry of Defence.  Elizabeth Hoff, the country representative of WHO Syria, was awarded a shield by the Minister of Defence for her special efforts in her services.  This is one of the most egregious examples of how the aid is controlled.  Blood is a very important resource in war, of course.  In cases where the Red Cross controls blood, we are able to donate it and receive it when we need it.  In Syria, the blood bank is controlled entirely by the Ministry of Defence.  Since 2013, because Abbott in the US was no longer allowed to supply the transfusion hardware and software or the screenings kits for HIV, hepatitis B and the blood-borne diseases, the Ministry of Defence approached the WHO to procure those items for it.  Since then, the WHO has been buying millions of dollars' worth of transfusion equipment, screening kits, blood bags, and all of the serums and fluids.  None of these is allowed to reach those in need, however.  Not to Darayya five miles away, nor to Ghouta, under siege since 2013.  They are not allowed to receive intravenous fluids, let alone blood.  In full knowledge that the blood products are being withheld from the population that is most in need, and that their supply is controlled by an agency that is responsible for the air strikes, the trauma and barrel bombs that drenched the country in blood, they are subsidising Assad's killing machine, bypassing the sanctions and even profiting.  Because they do not have to do so, they do not reimburse the WHO, of course.<\/p><p> None of us has any problem with a military Ministry overseeing aid.  In Liberia in the ebola crisis the US military helped build the roads and infrastructure that allowed aid to be delivered.  But when it is used, manipulated and controlled to deny those who need it most, that is a problem.  There are other alternatives.  The situation also benefits Abbott.  The spotlight here is on the UN agencies including the WHO but other companies find ways to get over the sanctions and they are equally in need of scrutiny.<\/p><p> I wanted to show the committee the next slide because it represents to me the obscenity of the Syrian regime.  This is Moaz and Nawras, who were conjoined twins born in eastern Ghouta in July 2016.  I am a paediatrician and have worked in many war-torn countries including Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan.  I have also worked in First World countries such as England, Australia and America and although I have seen lots of different things, I had never seen conjoined twins.  The doctors in eastern Ghouta are faced with siege, chemical attacks, outbreaks of infectious disease and trauma in addition to diabetes, cancer, kidney disease and then they were faced with these twins, these tiny little pieces of newborn humanity.  After a lot of effort we managed to get the twins into Damascus and there were many international offers to take them to a centre where they could be safely separated with a multidisciplinary expert team.  They were eventually allowed to be brought into Damascus with their mother who was breastfeeding them.  They were joined at the chest.  They could have lived their entire lives as conjoined; that they were breastfeeding tells us they were well.  Then they suddenly died.  The mother was not allowed to breastfeed them for five days and then they were reported dead and buried.  To the best of our knowledge, this is because the Syrian regime decided to try to separate them itself.  If it had succeeded, it would have been a great PR croup and if it did not succeed, they did not actually care.  They did not want to allow babies that could remind the whole world that there are babies in Syria too.  They could not let that out beyond their control.  If they cannot let these babies survive, there is not much hope for anyone else.<\/p><p> I have provided a lot of resources for the committee to review.  The next slide shows an illustration of the way convoys are controlled.  Convoys are just a drop in the ocean of the aid effort.  The current situation is that aid goes into Damascus.  All agencies have to partner with SARC which is corrupted, as I have said.  One of the leading figures is Tammam Mahriz, a nephew of Assef Shawkat who before his death in 2012 was the head of military intelligence.  It is very sad because there are thousands of volunteers who are brave on the ground, who are doing their best to still get aid to those who need it most but they themselves are shot, executed, arrested and tortured for that same crime of trying to help those who actually need it.  In addition to being already staffed by key people in the intelligence forces, after 2011, many more intelligence agents posed as volunteers from the bottom to be able to observe and inform on their colleagues.  At the top, those who were experienced and qualified were dismissed and replaced by retired military officers who belonged the regime and were known for their loyalty.  SARC is controlled by the agencies.<\/p><p> In an authoritarian regime, there are a lot of different branches of security forces.  I have included an illustration of that in the supporting documents also.  What happened eventually after a couple of years was that in order to exert maximum control over aid, the intelligence forces themselves had to form a co-ordinating agency in order to make sure they were all talking to each other as well as with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Health, which is charged with deleting agencies and deleting the lifesaving supplies from all the convoys.<\/p><p>This is all done by the department of preparedness which I describe as the \"department of deletion\".  The department is run by Dr. Al Hajjaj al-Sharaa who is the individual in the photograph dressed in red.  His agency deletes all life-saving supplies from the lists, which means that instead of a supply of adrenaline or insulin, lice shampoo and empty jerry cans will be received.  Dr. al-Sharaa is one of the owners of the national non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that are approved and accredited by the Syrian Government.  He is, therefore, well positioned to redirect supplies and resources to his agency, Al Cham for Health, one of the major implementing partners for the World Health Organization, the UNHCR and UNICEF to provide mobile health services.  He is also one of the staff at the warehouse who ensures none of the life-saving supplies makes it onto the convoys.  These staff check the list carefully.  It is then sealed with a seal from the intelligence forces before leaving.  One of the most recent convoys towards the end of last year reached the warehouse in Ghouta, but the warehouse was then bombed by the government to make sure nothing was used.  The convoy in question included 50 dialysis sets which would have kept people alive for another week or two, but even it was bombed.<\/p><p> I will explain what the weaponisation of health care means.  Collateral damage is usually the primary reason for the deaths of civilians in war.  However, that is not the case in Syria where civilians are the target.  There are various ways of pursuing a strategy of suppressing and repressing a revolution which started as a protest for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.  One way of doing so is to arrest and torture demonstrators.  Military intelligence, air force security and the ministry of defence have thousands of black sites where they keep hundreds of thousands of disappeared persons, many of whom have been tortured and held for years.<\/p><p> Another way of doing so is to control health care delivery.  As I stated, one week into the protests, the hospitals which were under the control of the ministries of health and higher education were informed that they would not be allowed to provide aid for anyone hurt in demonstrations.  In response field hospitals were established, one of which was located in an ancient mosque in Dera'a.  On 21 March 2011 medical personnel were providing care for more than 50 people in the field hospital when a student protest outside, attended by a few hundred unarmed protestors holding olive branches, was attacked by military forces, including Iranian forces.  The mosque put out a call and one of the doctors responded in an ambulance.  They managed to pick up one patient who had been shot by the security forces.  He was thrown into the ambulance which was then hijacked by the Iranian military on its way back to the field hospital.  The driver was shot and killed; the doors were opened and machine gun fire killed the doctor and critically injured the nurse.  The patient was shot six more times.<\/p><p> The massacre that day was covered up and when one reads reports, they suggest only six people died because that is the number for which we have records.  No one believed Bashar al-Assad, a doctor in training to be an ophthalmologist, would exert this level of brutality.  We have since documented the direct killing of more than 900 doctors for the crime of assisting people injured by the Syrian Government.  This tactic was even legislated for in July 2012 and, as a result, a person who does what my colleagues and I do is designated a criminal and a terrorist and charged as such.  Hundreds of attacks on hospitals across Syria have led to a policy of building underground hospitals to provide protection from bombing.  It is a testimony to a country that has not been allowed to have a civil society and the depths of relationships and networks among Syrians that they have been able to create this informal and decentralised health system which has endeavoured to meet massive needs.  The needs of Syria have gone from primarily being first world needs to encompassing the whole spectrum, including outbreaks of infectious diseases such as polio, cholera, typhoid and tuberculosis to chemical attacks, which we were not trained in medical school to treat. <\/p><p> The map shows that the attacks take place according to area and are directed at any opposition held area or any area that has been politically antipathetic.  It shows the trajectory of the attacks during they years, although it is a little difficult to see this.  The slide features an analysis of attacks on hospitals since 2012.  It shows intentionality and that attacks are continuous and systematic.  The only time they stop is when the hospital has been destroyed and no longer needs to be attacked.<\/p><p> Ghouta was besieged shortly after the chemical massacre of August 2013 which was highly visible to the eyes of the world.  Who can forget the images of the naked, limp bodies of recently killed children?  A siege is invisible.  Irish people are familiar with starvation as a weapon of war and the withholding of food and creation of famine as a political weapon.  This practice was imposed on Ghouta shortly after the chemical massacre.  The second picture which was taken two years ago shows my colleagues in Ghouta.  They were very tired at the time and their message was to stop the killing of civilians.  At the end of last year the co-ordinates of the hospitals were published to show the government where they were located.  That the government subsequently bombed these hospitals shows that the destruction of hospitals in full view has been a deliberate and intentional policy.  The next picture shows a patient who died in a hospital in Ghouta.<\/p><p> Last week the widow of one of my great colleagues called me to say Kafr Zita hospital in Hama was being targeted again.  The hospital has been bombed hundreds of times and forced to move many times.  Unfortunately, when the Russians entered the conflict with much better weapons than the Syrian forces, they were able to destroy hospitals much more quickly and, as members can see, their attacks are highly effective.<\/p><p> Members will recall the Khan Sheikhoun chemical massacre of this time last year.  Khan Sheikhoun is an entirely civilian area.  Government forces first dropped barrel bombs on it.  People's response to barrel bombing is to take cover underground in basements and caves because this offers the best protection.  Shortly afterwards, there was a sarin attack.  Chemicals sink into basements and caves because they are heavier than air.  Government forces first put people in a position of maximum vulnerability in order that they would then suffer horrendously.  People did not want to go to hospital because they knew that they would be targeted.  However, sarin does not wear off and survivors of the attack had to go to hospital.  The Russians were able to track their movements, discover hospitals that had not been destroyed and target them immediately as people arrived.<\/p><p> Last month, in Hamouria and Douma in eastern Ghouta, government forces dropped chemicals to force people who had been living underground for weeks in an effort to protect themselves from the dedicated barrel bombs and missiles to go back on to the streets again.<\/p><p>They dropped chemicals to force them into the streets where they were then gunned down by machine guns in helicopters.  As someone who has worked in many wars, I have never seen such brutality and obscenity.  The egregious manipulation and exploitation of the aid response means that the generosity of the Irish, which is renowned, is contributing towards profiteering by the Syrian Government, the same people who are responsible for the crisis, which must be addressed.  Another example can demonstrate some of the ways in which Syrian aid in the hands of the military is corrupted and misused.  I would also like to provide the opportunity for questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018051000002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Annie Sparrow","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525942800,"counter":1459,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Sparrow.

I thank her for appearing before the committee and making a very powerful presentation.<\/p> <p>  She wanted to highlight some things to us and for us to highlight with our Government, the UN and the EU the withholding or controlling of aid distribution by the Syrian Government for its own purposes and, allied to that, the weaponisation of healthcare, including the targeting of medical personnel, hospitals, clinics and so on.  Above all, she raised the impact on civilians, especially children, that has had during the years of the war.<\/p> <p>  How do we address these issues?  I have read some of Dr. Sparrow's work, in particular her critique of the WHO which she described as having become an apologist for Assad atrocities.  I read a briefing from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which pointed out that Ireland has contributed over &euro;100 million to the Syrian crisis since 2012, our largest ever response to a single crisis.  Clearly, we are stakeholders in this.  Our briefing also tells us that our support inside Syria is mostly channelled through the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, including the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, SARC, which is best placed to respond on the ground, including hard to reach areas.<\/p> <p>  If the view is taken that SARC is the body through which aid can most effectively be distributed, what is the alternative?  If we are seeking to ensure that the aid distribution is not corrupted by the regime, as Dr. Sparrow described, how else can we reach the 5.6 million civilians who are in hard to reach or besieged areas?  We have carried out an extensive review of Irish Aid programmes.  We have heard in other contexts about the difficulty for aid delivery programmes in conflict situations and how quite often aid agencies and Governments have to work with deeply corrupt and brutal regimes in order to be pragmatic in the delivery of aid to the people who need it most.  How else do we address this and deliver aid, other than through co-operation with SARC, in particular, or other bodies that are otherwise compromised by the regime?<\/p> <p>  I have had the privilege of meeting the white helmets, who are superb front line humanitarian workers.  I am conscious that beyond the white helmets, who are working in the most horrific conditions, there is a need for a network for aid distribution at a broader level.  Is that why the WHO and other agencies are working with government-controlled bodies?  Do they see that as the only way to deliver aid?  Does Dr. Sparrow have an alternative?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018051000002#E00300","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1525942800,"counter":1461,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Sparrow for her presentation.

When I was Minister for Defence I visited troops in Lebanon and went to Syria to try to keep in contact with the regime because our troops were under fire from rogues who came from Syria.

I find this a most frustrating problem because nobody seems to know exactly what the likes of us, as politicians in Ireland, can do at a practical level to contribute towards the solution to this problem.  Aid is one thing and, of course, people in distress need help.  Ireland has a tradition of doing its bit in respect of aid, but there seems to be no possibility that an end may come to all of this.  That is the most frustrating thing for me.<\/p> <p>  Can Dr. Sparrow give us some light?  We hear all of the bad stories.  We know who is involved, who is propping up the regime and all of that type of thing, but the reality is from afar.  Given that we have, if I remember correctly, about 500 troops in Lebanon it is very important to Ireland but has never been discussed.  It is possible that there will be spillover from time to time, in particular where our troops are located.

One of the most important is cross-border aid, the bulk of which goes through Turkey.  The Syrian regime was able to assert sovereignty to control aid because it has a seat at the UN and sovereignty is a primary principle of the organisation.  Syria is backed by Russia and China.  Thanks to the persistent work of many governments and other key organisations in July 2014 cross-border resolution 2165 was put in place, which is a binding resolution of the Security Council and carries the most weight.  That provides the legal authority for all cross-border aid.  It is important to renew this because the assistance provided through cross-border aid is not obvious.  More than 2 million people in Idlib can be easily accessed from Turkey still while Dahal in the south is accessible from Jordan.  As the war appears to wind down, now that Ghouta has fallen, although the pattern of extermination or oppression of the civilians left in hospitals continues in Idlib, there has been talk of reconstruction and rehabilitation.  There is a massive need in the country where life expectancy has fallen from 71 years before the war in 2010 to 55 years.  That is a measure of the devastating public health crisis, which was not created by the sanctions, as is claimed by some people.  That is a measure of the pre-existing policies, which were compounded by the weaponisation of healthcare and an inability to do surveillance of these most important global threats.<\/p> <p>  Renewing a cross-border resolution provides the possibility not only for Irish NGOs, such as Tr&oacute;caire, Concern, Goal and Catholic Relief Services, to work from Syria but to provide direct support and funding to the massive health services provided by the Syrians themselves with much greater accountability.  It is important to do that as well because it offers a pragmatic way to do the surveillance of infectious disease, which Turkey is behind because of the potential regional spread of diseases such as polio, TB and cholera.  Ireland can get behind cross-border renewal, which is important, and instead of Damascus asking Russia to put pressure on Turkey to shut it down, it is good governance to keep it open.  If that leverage is lost, more control will be in the hands of Damascus.  When the resolution came into effect, SARC, as an International Red Cross agent, was allowed to dramatically increase the number of cross-line convoys because the government wanted to take back control.  The resolution offers the leverage to make sure the government will give more aid in order that it can maintain control but if the government is permitted to have full control of aid by taking away the cross-border authority, it will not have to do anything.<\/p> <p>  Some of the sanctions were offset by the financial support of Russia, China and Iran.  It is an interesting question.  The US designated Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1978 and it cut off aid.  The EU tried hard to use financial incentives and access to the European market.  By the time the war happened, the Union was Syria's most important trading partner.  Economic sanctions had no impact on curbing Assad's atrocities.  He got through the first couple of years with the aid and support of Iran, China and Russia and then the massive multi-billion infusion of UN aid money was incredibly important.  As well as the legitimacy it gave to a dictator surrounded by war criminals, it converted them into a state and a government.  The fact that the UN has imposed no sanctions because of the Russian veto means the Syrian Government uses the UN to bypass all the sanctions.  Countries or agencies will still work with the government such as ABET in America or companies that partnered with Russia recently.  It is a form of economic prostitution.  Politically, we can still call them out.  These are war crimes committed by war criminals and the UN has agreed a special prosecutor to investigate war crimes.  That was established in December 2016.  Clearly it is a slow effort but the precedent for this is Kosovo where criminals were, ultimately, brought to justice with international endorsement, which we all believe in.  We must still find ways to make the UN stronger.  By endorsing and working with Assad, it brings the level of acceptable behaviour down to the lowest common denominator.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is an important state, which has good governance, is democratic and believes in basic human rights.  The debate this committee is having now is important.  The influence it has to talk about the conflict still is incredibly important.  The country can get behind innovations.  For example, even if the healthcare system is rebuilt, including all the hospitals and clinics, there is no one left to staff it.  More than 15,000 doctors have left Syria with 1,000 killed and hundreds more incarcerated or disappeared.  None of them will return and there are no resources for the system.  Ireland can support an innovative and a pragmatic policy such as the accreditation of healthcare workers because the Syrian Government will not accredit anyone working as a doctor.  There are medical students there who are the equivalent of vascular surgeons because of the experience they have gained but they cannot ever be recognised or paid.  The only way to bring professionals back to Syria is to recognise them, give them status and allow them to be paid as such.  That will require innovative but pragmatic tools.  This also applies to teachers, architects and engineers who are required for the water systems.  Medicine, in particular, is always controlled by the government.<\/p><p>The WHO has the authority, as a body, to get behind that and every country in the world has medical schools.  Last night I was at the Royal College of Surgeons to support a curriculum and an accreditation system that allow people to return.<\/p><p> There are some positive things that can be done.  In a world of pandemics and the threat of infectious disease, germs are frequent flyers and do not respect sovereignty.  The only way we can provide care to people, especially children, and alleviate their misery by controlling their disease, is with resources.  No one has access to health unless they have a doctor.  This is why the weaponisation of healthcare works - no man stays where there is no doctor to safely deliver his wife's baby or no place to educate children.<\/p><p> A radical but effective sanction would be targeted sanctions against the sons and daughters of the regime so that they cannot access the desirable colleges across Europe and Great Britain.  Bashar Jaafari's daughter applied to Columbia University in New York.  People say we do not want to punish the children of the regime but Assad is British educated and his wife is British born, and also highly educated.  They would respond much more quickly to a ban on their children attending prestigious Ivy League colleges.  They would stop their war crimes, bombing schools and hospitals more quickly if we said they had to educate their children in their own country.  It is a controversial suggestion but students at Columbia lobbied hard and said they did not agree with this.<\/p><p> Harnessing the power of solidarity and finding things we all agree on are important.  Health and education are massively important in this and there are partners in Lebanon who provide health and education to Syrians using Syrian teachers.  There are enough teachers in the refugee population to teach the Syrian curriculum, which cannot be done in Lebanon because it wants to teach its own curriculum.  One cannot teach Syrian kids science through French because they do not know the language.<\/p><p> There are many things that can be done but the cross-border resolution allows aid to be provided and for NGOs to be put in directly and to establish innovative programmes like accreditation, which will bring people back as everyone wants.  It also allows the surveillance of infectious disease which is an issue of global governance.  The advent of blockchain can ensure a much greater level of accountability and donors will get the chance to direct their funding with clear knowledge of where their money is going, which will help the UN accommodate these things.  There are pragmatic, political and financial tools we can still use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018051000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Annie Sparrow","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525942800,"counter":1467,"content":"<p>We are under time constraints because we have another session at 11 a.m.  Do members have any issue they wish to raise briefly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018051000002#G00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1525942800,"counter":1468,"content":"<p>I thank those in the Irish Syria solidarity movement, a number of whom are in the Gallery, for their work in continuing to highlight this issue.

I am honoured to address the esteemed parliamentary committee and am grateful for this opportunity to share with members a glimpse of the Palestinian people's existence, resistance and inextinguishable insistence on freedom and self-determination after 70 years of colonial oppression.  Like all Palestinians, I feel more at home in Ireland than in any other western country.  Its heroic struggle against centuries of colonialism has always inspired Palestinians.  This is why I shall speak from the heart.<br\/><br\/>At a time when Israel's regime of military occupation, settler colonialism and apartheid is implementing a shoot-to-kill-or-maim policy against peaceful Palestinian protesters in Gaza marching for freedom and refugee rights, charitable rhetoric is not enough.  It is time for accountability.  The EU still votes as a bloc in support of UN resolutions upholding basic Palestinian rights, including the right of return, and condemning Israel's settlements as illegal, but it has yet to take effective measures of accountability against Israel.  In contrast, significant EU sanctions were imposed on Russia soon after its military takeover of the Crimea.<br\/><br\/>Despite Israel's descent into unmasked, right-wing extremism, particularly with the current escalation of its repression, and notwithstanding the EU's rhetoric, the Union, including Ireland, remains largely complicit in enabling and maintaining Israel's grave violations of Palestinian human rights.  Israel's serious breaches of international law trigger legal obligations for the EU, Israel's largest trade partner, and its member states.  As reiterated in the 2004 ruling by the International Court of Justice, ICJ, states must refrain from any act that would entail recognition of Israel's settlement enterprise and from providing any form of assistance that maintains the illegal situation arising from it.  By trading with Israel's illegal settlements and supporting companies that are involved in the settlement enterprise, as defined by the UN, the EU is violating both obligations of non-recognition and non-assistance.<br\/><br\/>The EU, including Ireland, maintains a web of military relations, weapons research, banking transactions and settlement trade with Israeli companies, banks and institutions that are deeply implicated in violating our rights.  For example, the EU imports goods from the Israeli settlements at an estimated annual value of $300 million.  Through its Horizon 2020 research programme, the EU has approved more than 200 projects with Israeli companies, such as Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries, that are accused of deep complicity in war crimes and possible crimes against humanity.  Another Israeli beneficiary of EU funding is Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, a main hub for developing Israeli weapon systems used to perpetrate crimes against Palestinian civilians.  Merely labelling some of the illegal products of Israeli colonies instead of banning them is considered by Palestinians as yet another EU failure to uphold European and international law.<br\/><br\/>As Israel's regime becomes more overtly associated with the global far right, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic groups in the United States and Europe, and as it becomes the model for Trump's xenophobic policies, its popularity continues to sink.  A recent BBC poll shows that Israel has the fourth lowest popularity rating among many countries.  Crucially, support for holding Israel to account is growing among Jewish Americans and the broader US public.<br\/><br\/>Israel is intensifying its land-grabbing construction of illegal settlements and walls in the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem.  It is tightening its fatal siege of 2 million people in Gaza, denying them basic necessities while counting the <i>per capita<\/i>calories that are allowed in.  The UN predicts that Gaza will be unlivable by 2020.  Israel is entrenching what even the US Department of State once characterised as a system of &quot;Institutional, legal, and societal discrimination&quot; against Palestinian citizens of present day Israel, enforced by more than 65 racist laws.  It also continues to deny the internationally recognised rights of Palestinians in exile, who account for 50% of all Palestinians.<br\/><br\/>In light of this ongoing <i>Nakba<\/i>, and given the failure of the international community to hold Israel to account, the non-violent, Nobel Peace Prize nominated Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, BDS, movement for Palestinian rights was launched in 2005 by the broadest coalition in Palestinian civil society.  It calls for an end to the 1967 occupation, full equality for Palestinian citizens of Israel and the right of return for Palestinian refugees.  Anchored in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, BDS has consistently and categorically opposed all forms of racism and discrimination, including anti-Semitism, anti-black racism and Islamophobia.  We uphold that one's identity should never diminish one's entitlement to rights.  The BDS movement is supported by a near consensus in Palestinian society.  Days ago, the Palestine Liberation Organization, PLO, which is the sole legitimate representative of our people, reiterated its support for BDS.<br\/><br\/>At the most basic level, Palestinians are calling on Ireland, the EU and the world at large to uphold their profound moral and legal responsibility to do no harm to us.  Beyond responsibility, we are asking for solidarity, not charity.  In a show of effective and genuine Irish solidarity with the Palestinian struggle a few weeks ago, Dublin became the first European capital to adopt BDS for Palestinian rights.  Derry was the first Irish city, in 2016, to endorse BDS.  The Irish trade union movement, the student movement, artists and academics across Ireland have adopted BDS in support of Palestinian rights.<br\/><br\/>In response to the impressive growth of support for Palestinian rights, particularly through BDS, and evoking memories of McCarthyism, Israel has waged a global war on the movement since 2014, including extensive propaganda, legal warfare and espionage.  A desperate Israeli Government Minister has established a &quot;tarnishing unit&quot; to smear Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights defenders in the BDS movement while another has publicly threatened us - my name was mentioned in that threat - with &quot;targeted civil assassination&quot;.  Amnesty International has condemned these threats.  Ireland, along with the EU in general, Sweden, the Netherlands and others, has upheld the right to call for BDS against Israel to achieve Palestinian rights as a matter of freedom of expression.<br\/><br\/>To fulfil Ireland's obligations under international law <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the Palestinian people, we appeal to the committee to consider the following concrete measures of accountability: imposing a two-way military embargo on Israel, as was done against apartheid South Africa and as has been called for by Amnesty International; banning the import of products of companies implicated in Israel's illegal settlement enterprise and ensuring that companies involved in grave misconduct, such as HP and G4S, are excluded from State tendering processes in line with the EU directive on this matter; supporting the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement until Israel abides by its human rights clause; halting all financial transactions with Israeli banks that finance Israel's settlement enterprise; and stop considering the import of Israeli natural gas or electric power, given Israel's pillage of Palestinian energy resources.<br\/><br\/>Yeats once wrote: &quot;I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.&quot;  He also wrote: &quot;In dreams begin responsibility&quot;.  Indeed, in presenting my people's dreams and aspirations before the committee, I sincerely hope that members shall not tread on our dreams of dignity, emancipation and a just peace, but will act with responsibility to make them come true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018051000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Omar Barghouti"},{"type":"speech","time":1525942800,"counter":1475,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barghouti for his presentation, which gave a concise and clear outline of his organisation's position and of the issues he wants us to consider and put to the Government.<\/p><p>I understand Senator Bacik has commitments in the Seanad.

Over the last years, Israel has intensified its demolition of Palestinian homes, schools, clinics and just about all infrastructure Palestinians have built, especially in Area C, the 60% of the West Bank that is under Israel's military and security control, where Palestinians cannot do anything without Israeli permission.  Despite these projects being funded by the EU and although the heads of missions of EU states in Jerusalem have always raised the facts very clearly to their capitals, there has been no accountability.  There has just been rhetoric of condemnation, even very light condemnation, without any action on the ground.  There has not been one measure to hold Israel to account or request that it pays back European tax money that has been invested in supporting Palestinian infrastructure.  This really raises the question of why Israel is put on a pedestal above international law.

My party supports BDS.  In Ireland, we are very proud of the Dunnes Stores workers.  Many years ago, they worked for Dunnes Stores here in Ireland and took a stand against apartheid in South Africa.  We celebrate them today because they were absolutely vindicated.  It strikes me that the boycott campaign internationally, against the apartheid regime in South Africa, had a successful impact eventually.  It was a successful campaign.  It was a way of peacefully conveying our opposition to what happened.  The efforts that the Israeli state has gone to with some of its allies, to undermine a peaceful and dignified opportunity for those in the international community to express their opposition to what has happened to the Palestinian people, are remarkable.  There is also their frustration at their own political leaders for their failure to take decisive action on behalf of the Palestinian people.  I believe that the overwhelming majority of the Irish people are in solidarity with the cause of the Palestinian people.  I believe that the overwhelming majority of Irish people believe that we should do what is dignified and peaceful to support the Palestinian people.<\/p> <p>  We hoped to bring legislation through the Upper House, the Seanad, relating to the banning of goods from illegal settlements internationally, which would obviously also include the occupied territories in Palestine.  That legislation has been deferred and will, I believe, come before the Upper House later this year.  I want to get Mr. Barghouti's views on that legislation.  What would that mean to the Palestinian people if it was passed?  On events in Gaza, and the shootings and killings of Palestinian protestors, what is the mood relating to that?  Can we get an update on the imprisonment of Ahed Tamimi and other Palestinian children and on what we can do in Ireland?  On the wider issue of Jerusalem and the recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital by the American Trump Administration, what are the reactions and repercussions in Palestine?  What is the current mood among Palestinians?  I am conscious that BDS is an initiative of the Palestinian grassroots civil society as distinct from the political leadership.  There have not been elections in Palestine for a long time so how can we really assess who the political leaders in Palestine are if there have not been elections in a long time?  I would look at Palestinian civil society as being representative of the Palestinian people.  What are the views of all of these matters among civil society?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018051000002#J00500","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525942800,"counter":1481,"content":"<p>I will try to answer the six questions as succinctly as possible.  I thank the Senator for raising those very important points.  We deeply appreciate Sinn F&eacute;in's support for the BDS movement.  It is important that the Senator has mentioned South Africa in this context because Ireland, in particular, played a leading role in the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against apartheid South Africa.  Although British artists like to think that they were the first, Irish artists were the first to call for a cultural boycott of South Africa.  South Africans and Palestinians know this history quite well.  Regarding some of the issues the Senator has raised, regardless of the BDS movement, Palestinians are asking Ireland and other states to fulfil their legal obligations.<\/p> <p>  This is a key issue connected to the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018, which was deferred, as the Senator mentioned, which would prohibit the entrance into Ireland of products of illegally built settlements in occupied territories, which obviously applies to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem as defined by the United Nations.  We think this would be a basic first step.  It does not fulfil all of Ireland's obligations.  It is the beginning of fulfilling Ireland's obligations under international law.  We do not buy the pseudo-legal argument made by the Government about why it is deferring this, saying that it abides by EU directives and laws.  There is nothing in EU legislation that would prevent Ireland or any European state that is a member of the EU from fulfilling its legal obligations.  Those obligations are triggered because settlements are considered a war crime in international law.  Building settlements is a war crime.  It triggers legal obligations for all countries.  This is basic international law.  Ireland is obligated by it and it became part of domestic Irish law that international law applies in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Another point is military embargo.  One of the main slogans raised by the tens of thousands of unarmed protestors in Gaza, protesting against the siege and for the right of return for refugees, is for a military embargo now.  Amnesty has called for a military embargo.  That is a basic responsibility, to export no weapons to an area of conflict regardless of what one's opinions are on the conflict.  The Irish Government claims that it does not have much of a military trade but some facts we have seen show that millions of euro worth of weapons, weapon parts or technology used for weaponry or military purposes are bought from and sold to Israel.<\/p><p>The Irish Government claims that it does not have much military trade but evidence we have seen shows that there is, indeed, millions of euro worth of weapons, weapon parts or technology used for weaponry and for military purposes being sold to and brought from Israel.  This needs to stop because the highest priority demand of the Palestinians everywhere is to stop arms trade with Israel.<\/p><p> Regarding Ms Ahed Tamimi and the hundreds of other Palestinian children in Israel prisons, this issue has been raised even in the US Congress, where it is really difficult, and several congressmen and women have courageously sponsored a Bill that would withhold US aid to Israel equivalent to the amount used in detaining, interrogating and torturing Palestinian children.  Coming from the US, from the belly of the beast, as it were, this would be an important move, and we hope that Ireland can push the EU to take similar action, not only of condemnation but accountability, on child prisoners in Israeli prisons.<\/p><p> The Trump Administration's Jerusalem embassy move is very dangerous, not only for Palestinians but for the entire region, if not the world.  Trump is undoing decades of US foreign policy and he is isolating US policy from the international consensus.  The United Nations and an absolute majority of nations around the world do not recognise Israeli sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem and all of them recognise East Jerusalem as occupied Palestinian territory.  In fact, Trump is isolating the US from this international consensus.  In a way, he is lighting a powder keg in a dangerous way in a very volatile area to start with.  We think this will enable Israel to build more settlements, to kill more Palestinians, to arrest more children, and to confiscate more Palestinian land and continuing with its ethnic cleansing of indigenous Palestinians, especially in East Jerusalem to colonise the city.<\/p><p> Finally, on civil society and the political leadership, the Chairman is absolutely right that there has not been any election in a number of years for Palestinians.  However, most recently, the PLO, which still symbolises the leadership of the Palestinian people everywhere despite its many problems and despite many demands to democratise the PLO, has adopted BDS.  Even the highest authority among the Palestinians has adopted BDS.  Among civil society, NGOs, trade unions, women's unions, academics and farmers' unions, there is wall-to-wall support for BDS.  Every main entity among Palestinians, in Palestine as well as in exile, has adopted BDS as one of the most effective popular resistance movements and as the most effective movement of solidarity with Palestinian rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018051000002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Omar Barghouti","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525942800,"counter":1483,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barghouti.

Especially with the Trump-Netanyahu far-right alliance and the support of the far right around the world, it has become even less possible than ever before.  In reality, we have one state already, one Apartheid state, with different rights allocated to different groups depending on their ethnicity and religion.  This was seen as extremely racist and frowned upon by the entire world when it was the case in South Africa but it is tolerated by almost all states today around the world while it is happening in Palestine.  We already have one state under Israeli control with Apartheid laws applying to Palestinians.  Even Palestinian citizens of present-day Israel suffer from more than 65 discriminatory laws.  Even if we forget the Occupied West Bank and Gaza, including East Jerusalem, for now, we still have a system of Apartheid within Israel itself.  It is not so feasible.<\/p> <p>  The main point is not theoretically.  It is, what is needed to push for a just peace?

The current discussion about the two-state solution just speaks of fulfilling the Palestinian right to self-determination by establishing an independent state in the Occupied West Bank and Gaza, including East Jerusalem.  That is fine, but what does one do with the rights of refugees?  Fifty per cent of the Palestinians live in exile.  Even among Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, a significant minority are refugees.  What does one do with the Palestinian citizens of Israel?  Without addressing the three rights, no solution will be ethical and no solution will, therefore, be sustainable.  To be sustainable, a solution has to be comprehensive.  It has to fulfil the basic rights of all Palestinians, not only the convenient part - the 38% who live in Gaza and the West Bank.  Those are only 38% of the entire Palestinian people.

At the end of the day, there is no solution to this problem unless we get a reasonable Israeli approach to dealing with the Palestinian problem.  It is one matter condemning Israel.  I believe that within Israel, which I have visited, there is a great deal of sympathy towards the Palestinian situation but that is not probably reflected in the manner in which the present regime goes about its business.  From time to time, the situation has become fluid because of changes of regimes within Israel but in trying to find a solution to the problem, we cannot move with the change of regime.

They were not involved in some husband-and-wife conflict in which a therapist is needed to bring them together to talk about peace.  I am certain that the absolute majority of the Irish people then were seeking justice.  I imagine they expected everyone throughout the world to hold the British accountable for crimes of colonialism committed in Ireland over centuries and to support the Irish quest for freedom and self-determination.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, Palestinians have sought nothing more than our right to freedom, justice, equality and self-determination.  We are asking for people to do no harm.  That is not much of a charitable act.  It is a profound moral obligation to do no harm.  By doing nothing the EU, including Ireland, is doing harm to us.  By continuing to support or to be apathetic towards Israeli crimes, the EU, including Ireland, is doing harm.  Importing settlement goods and products and trading with companies that are complicit in Israel's violations amounts to doing harm.  Doing no harm, which is a profound obligation, is what we are asking for.<\/p> <p>  This should apply regardless of whether the current Israeli regime is the most racist in Israel's history, which it is.  Since 2015, Israel has elected the most far right government ever.  The premise of extraordinary sympathy for Palestinian rights among Israelis is not borne by empirical facts.  Almost all polls, studies and surveys that we have seen in recent years show an absolute majority of Israelis supporting the current government.  They support the racist policies, including those relevant to within Israel and not only in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.  A majority of Jewish Israelis today say they do not want to live next to a Palestinian within present day Israel, let alone the West Bank and Gaza.<\/p> <p>  Again, the point is not to consider this as a conflict of symmetric powers.  It is a colonial situation and a situation of apartheid, settler colonialism and occupation.  That means obligations are triggered.  Accountability is the most important issue.  Of course we need Israelis ultimately to agree on a just peace.  We cannot achieve it alone.  How do we get them there?  Is it by using carrots, carrots and more carrots?  The EU has provided tonnes of carrots during the past decades but to no avail.  Nothing has happened.  The EU has forgotten what a stick looks like when it comes to Israel.  With Russia, China and even the United States, the EU has adopted sanctions.  In recent decades the EU has imposed sanctions on every imaginable power on earth except on Israel.<\/p> <p>  When Palestinians accuse the EU of hypocrisy, double standards and putting Israel on a pedestal, we know what we are taking about.  There is no accountability.  That is the only thing that will entice a majority of Israelis to recognise that this is not sustainable.  They cannot have their cake and eat it too.  They cannot maintain oppression against Palestinians while enjoying free access to the European markets, military trade and so on.  No price is being paid by Israel for its crimes against the Palestinians.  We believe that making Israel pay for its crimes is the most important factor missing in getting a majority formed in Israel for a just peace.  I am not referring to a rhetorical peace that is lacking in justice and Palestinian rights.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about Palestinians in Israel.  In fact, the relevant figure is 3%.  Palestinian citizens of Israel control only 3% of the land under Israel's control.  By law, not only by policy, Israel through some very convoluted laws and policies has kept 93% of the land under its control for Jewish development only.  This means if a person is a citizen of Israel but is not Jewish, that person is not entitled to the same rights as Jewish citizens to buy, lease or live on 93% of the land under the control of Israel.  That is the case even if we ignore the West Bank and Gaza.  In the West Bank, 60% of the most fertile land with water resources is controlled by Israel.  That is where settlements are growing most.<\/p> <p>  The general tendency, as has been rightly mentioned, is towards a shrinking space for Palestinians, shrinking land ownership by Palestinians and growing colonialisation of the entire land.  Oslo has acted as nothing more than a fig leaf for intense colonisation of Palestinian land, usurping Palestinian natural resources and demolishing more and more farms, lands and homes.  This is making it impossible for Palestinians - the indigenous people of the land - to continue living on most of the land of historical Palestine.  It is becoming less and less sustainable.  Gaza is the most extreme case.  We expect the territory to become unliveable in a year and a half.  The West Bank is not unliveable yet but it is becoming extremely difficult for Palestinians to sustain any life with the encroaching settlements taking over the most fertile lands and water resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018051000002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Omar Barghouti"},{"type":"speech","time":1525942800,"counter":1497,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Barghouti.

If something happens in life through no fault of one's own, and which is out of one's control, that is utterly frustrating but when it involves the loss of life, it is unforgivable.  Emma referred to meeting her medical people and I wish her well.  I have no words and as someone with a wife and a young family, the interview brought it home to me.  Ultimately, it is about human beings and there has to be accountability here.  I wish her well.  Words fail me on this occasion.<\/p> <p>  We have to get to the truth of this matter and there has to be accountability.  People need to look into their hearts and do the decent thing.  Emma spoke about feeling safe but she has been failed at a human level.  That is why it is so important that we get to the truth.  On a human level, words fail me in terms of the impact this has had on Emma and her family.<\/p><p>All of our work, such as when we consider legislation, can seem very dry on paper.  When one wants to make a judgment call on big issues then it is good to reflect on Emma, Vicky and the other women because that is the real tragedy.  They are really the fallout of either poor legislation or poor administration, and the situation in which they find themselves should have never arisen.  I hope that the Government takes note of the interview this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#C00600","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector: Quarterly Engagement with the Central Bank of Ireland","time":1525941000,"counter":1517,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#D00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1525941000,"counter":1518,"content":"<p>I wish to advise our guests that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I am joined by Mr. Ed Sibley, deputy governor, prudential regulation, Ms Derville Rowland, director general of our financial conduct function, and Ms Helena Mitchell, head of consumer protection supervision.  I will first briefly give an overview of the current economic environment and then turn to some of the specific issues that the committee raised in its invitation to me, including the tracker examination where we published our most recent report on 25 April.<br\/><br\/>The Central Bank is committed to serving the public by safeguarding stability and protecting consumers.  We operate as one bank, recognising the operational effectiveness of deploying the whole resources of the bank in meeting our goals.  For example, our macro-prudential mortgage measures contribute to both financial stability and consumer protection by guarding against over-lending and over-borrowing.  Equally, our work to ensure that financial firms are prudentially sound is essential if these firms are to meet their obligations to consumers and investors.  In these ways, consumer protection is embedded in all key aspects of our work through close co-operation between our central banking, prudential regulation and financial conduct pillars.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the macroeconomic outlook, we are currently experiencing buoyant domestic activity and a strong international economy, which has lead to a broad-based expansion in employment and an increase in earnings.  Our projections for the labour market indicate that Ireland is heading towards full employment, although some extra capacity is possible through broader participation in the labour market.  While the near-term outlook is positive, Ireland faces substantial tail risks.  These include hard Brexit scenarios, protectionist pressures and any change in the international tax system that would effectively penalise small economies as locations for multinational production activity.  In addition, a sudden shift towards tighter conditions in international financial markets is widely cited as a possible trigger of a contraction in international economic activity.  We think it is important that policymakers are mindful of such vulnerabilities in order to ensure that Ireland is resilient if any of these tail risks are triggered.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In terms of the Irish housing market, the increase in house prices seen in recent years in part reflects the strong increase in employment and the increase in aggregate household incomes, together with a low interest rate environment.  However, a primary influence has been the limited supply response even if there is some evidence of increasing levels of construction activity.  Our research points to house completions of approximately 23,500 units in 2018 and an increase of 28,500 in 2019.  However, these projections remain below the estimated housing demand of between 30,000 and 35,000 units per annum outlined in Project Ireland 2040.<br\/><br\/>On the composition of the housing market, second and subsequent buyers remain the largest single cohort of purchasers accounting for 45% of market activity.  We have seen a significant role played by non-household buyers, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts that mostly operate in urban markets, which accounts for 14.3% of transactions.  We also highlight the fact that non-mortgaged transactions or cash transactions are also quite significant.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the mortgage policies of the Central Bank, this is now an annual process.  Last November, we released our review of mortgage measures.  Our assessment is that the system is important and appropriate in ensuring that the credit market does not lead to unsustainable dynamics in the mortgage market.  We look at credit developments every three months and we stand ready to respond to changes in credit dynamics.  Our assessment feeds into our policies on bank capital policies, both from micro and macro-prudential perspectives.  Behind all of this is the intention to make sure that both those taking out mortgages and those providing mortgages are better equipped to deal with any future shocks.<br\/><br\/>In terms of commercial real estate, we have seen the dynamics here moderate in recent quarters so that Dublin is no longer an outlier in terms of market activity.  However, Dublin remains at the heart of activity with 80% of commercial property transactions last year but transactions outside of Dublin are also rising.  What we have now is a record low in terms of vacancies.  While the stock of office space is visibly increasing throughout the city, it is also the case that Brexit is contributing to additional demand in the near term.<br\/><br\/>We know that a lot of the funding here is international in nature.  Having an international investor base for commercial real estate aids recovery from the lows in the market.  It also provides increased levels of liquidity and provides non-bank sources of credit.  This means that the risks in the commercial real estate market are internationally shared and are not concentrated in the domestic financial system.  At the same time, as part of a global system, it is important to recognise that if these flows go into reverse that this carries some risks here in terms of disorderly market price dynamics.  Having said that, when one considers the amount of debt in the system and the amount of adjustment since the last boom then one will see that the market is a lot more sustainable than it was.  At this point, the Irish banks have commercial real estate lending of just under &euro;19 billion of which 20% is non-performing.  It is important to note that the domestic banks, the capital situations of the banks and their resilience is far different than a decade ago.  It remains the case that this area is the focus of our supervisory approach, and it is part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.<br\/><br\/>The tracker mortgage examination is one of the prime remaining changes in terms of dealing with the legacy of the crisis, both between the tracker examination and our work on addressing the high levels of non-performing loans that remain.  In our most recent report, we have given the latest update in terms of numbers.  We remain committed to the follow-on work to makes sure, through our inspections and challenge, that all cases should be included are included.  We reported that as of the end of March the number of customers who are now included in these schemes stands at 37,100, which is an increase of 3,400 compared with the end of December.<br\/><br\/>  In terms of the scale of what is involved, by the end of March the payout was &euro;459 million - an increase of &euro;162 million since December.<\/p><p>Eighty-eight per cent of identified accounts have received offers of redress and compensation and the vast majority of the remaining cases will be dealt with by the end of June.<\/p><p> Provisions by lenders in respect of the examination now stand at &euro;969 million, of which &euro;626 million relates to redress and compensation and &euro;343 million relates to costs.  The total cost of this to the banks is virtually at the &euro;1 billion mark.<\/p><p> I mentioned that there will be some exceptions to the end of June.  That relates to those customers who we have had included in the scheme in recent weeks.  Essentially, it is down to the fact that we are finding some cases now.  In some of these cases, they can be paid out within the end-of-June timeframe.  In other cases, it will take a bit longer.  I would say, however, the supervisory phase of getting all customers included is reaching its end.<\/p><p> In relation to enforcement, we stated there are enforcement proceedings against six lenders.  We are including all possible angles, including potential individual culpability, in these investigations.<\/p><p> What I have given the committee in my submission is a process answer about all that we are doing but, of course, it remains the case that whatever financial compensation can be delivered will never make up for the personal impact on the families which have been most affected by this scandal, including those who have lost homes and properties.<\/p><p> The other leg of our work here is the issue about the culture of the banks because it is quite important for the future conduct of these banks that they take responsibility for building a consumer-centred culture.  This is a matter for the top level of these organisations, for the boards and the senior management, and we as regulators must have an effective toolkit in pressing for the development of a consumer-focused culture.  We will report on this in mid-year.  This culture report will feed in to our ongoing supervisory work.<\/p><p> Turning to the issue of non-performing loans, non-performing loans cause considerable distress to those who are having to grapple with unsustainable debts.  Of course, it is also a major issue for the banking system.  Ireland has been to the forefront over the past decade in dealing with this.  Much has happened in Ireland, both in terms of our work but also in terms of the legal system, which has been identified in many places as a barrier to resolving non-performing loans.<\/p><p> What we have seen here is a lot of restructuring of loans rather than loss of ownership.  The protection of consumers who have arrears has been a key priority throughout with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, playing a critical role.  According to our data, there have been 120,000 restructured owner-occupied mortgages, 87% of which are meeting the terms of the restructuring arrangement.  This shows restructuring has been possible and has played a big part in managing the non-performing loan problem.<\/p><p> In relation to loss of ownership, which always must be one possibility in a mortgage system, there have been just over 8,000 cases, where 5,500 cases have been from voluntary surrenders and 2,700 through court ordered repossession.  This has to be the last resort.  Restructuring, where possible, is desirable.  Let me emphasise that compared with the international evidence, the Irish system's ability to deliver many restructured loans has meant the numbers of properties lost would have been much higher without these efforts.<\/p><p> We continue to press on this issue because there is a clear risk to the financial system if the number of non-performing loans remain at an elevated level on bank balance sheets.  This creates uncertainty about the financial positions of the banking system.  While in good times that might not be an immediate issue, in any future downturn, if those non-performing loans remain unresolved, that creates a clear sustainability issue in the markets.  Therefore, it is important, here and across Europe, to continue to work to bring down non-performing loan ratios.<\/p><p> In the grand scheme of things, back at the peak of the crisis, commercial real estate and small and medium-sized enterprise loans formed the majority of non-performing loans.  At this point, much of that has been worked through.  Approximately, two thirds of the remaining non-performing loan balances are residential mortgages.  This is why it is important at this point to recall that we have a strong consumer protection framework in place here and all that will happen in resolving these loans is within the context of a strong consumer protection framework.  In terms of how the Irish banks have been handling these loans, there has been a mixed approach.  There has been loan restructuring, voluntary sales, use of the legal system and loan disposals through a sales process.<\/p><p> What we have now is an unusually large amount of loans which are in long-term arrears of over two years.  We continue to encourage anyone in this situation to engage with his or her lender because we have seen evidence that sustainable restructurings are possible in many cases.  Where a restructuring is not possible, I emphasise that the development of the Insolvency Service of Ireland has been an important innovation and this can be an important support to debtors in reaching debt solutions.  However, for those who do not engage either with their banks or with the Insolvency Service of Ireland - I remind all of those in this situation that there is much support for them - the legal system remains the last resort outcome.<\/p><p> Turning to non-bank entities, whether these are retail credit firms or unregulated loan owners, they hold 7% of owner-occupied loans and 11% of buy-to-let mortgage accounts.  Within this category, 2% of owner-occupied mortgages and 5% of buy-to-let mortgages are owned by non-regulated loan owners.  What is clear, however, is that these are not like for like.  The unregulated loan owners hold a disproportionately high share of the long-term arrears cases with half of their owner-occupied mortgages and three quarters of their buy-to-let mortgages in arrears of over 90 days.  In 2017, non-bank entities accounted for 148 or 10% of repossessions of owner-occupied cases.  On those repossessions, half were voluntary and half were by court order.<\/p><p> While it is only one option in the resolution of non-performing loans, loan sales can play an important role in transferring risks from the banks to other types of investors, which reduces the vulnerability of the Irish banking system.  It is important to emphasise that, no matter who owns the loans, all of our codes of conduct are afforded to debtors.  Ireland has been a leader through developing the credit servicing regime in 2015, which means that we have a way to ensure that consumer protection rights are enforced through regulating the credit servicing firms while not adding frictions to the sale process for mortgages.  It bears repeating that customers whose loans are sold continue to have the benefit of the same consumer protection regulations they had before the sale.  As the committee will be aware, we are currently reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the CCMA in the context of the sale of loan books.  This review provides an opportunity to assess whether any revisions to the code are necessary.<\/p><p> I will turn to the EU developments in banking regulation because there is a relevant initiative at present.<\/p><p>In March the Commission published a proposal for a directive on credit servicers, credit purchasers and the recovery of collateral.  The aim is to have a European approach to the sale of non-performing loans.  Across Europe the same imperative is shared more widely - that it is important for the banking system to have a lower ratio of non-performing loans.  It is important that one of these options, the sale of non-performing loans, be taken in a way that protects consumers.  Essentially, the European directive will arrive at a very similar system to what we have in place here where there is a distinction between credit servicing and the ownership of a loan.  The European directive will provide that the credit servicing firm should be regulated, but the loan owner will not require authorisation.  Essentially, the solution we have found in Ireland is being used as a template.  It should be the pan-European approach because regulating credit servicing firms will deliver consumer protection, while allowing the sale of loans to happen, which is important to the overall stability of the banking system.<\/p><p> I will now comment on the European deposit insurance scheme, the final leg in completing banking union.  We think it is important that it move along in the coming weeks and months.  Together with progress on capital markets union, the completion of banking union is important to allow the European Union to deal with future challenges.<\/p><p> On credit unions, we have a clear strategy and our vision for the sector is of strong credit unions in safe hands.  That underpins our statutory responsibility to ensure the protection by each credit union of the funds of its members and the maintenance of the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally.  The past decade has seen many challenges for credit unions in dealing with the financial crisis, increased competition, the challenges to the business model, restructuring and increased regulation.  Considerable progress has been made, but significant challenges remain because of declining investment returns on assets which, in turn, interact with the reduction in the loan-to-asset ratio, low investment yields and rising costs.  People who look at this sector have made the consistent observation that not all credit unions have developed future business models that are robust to deal with these structural changes.  While there has been an increase in governance standards across the sector, this remains a key risk.  It is essential that sound governance and control systems be in place for the credit union sector.<\/p><p> As regulator, we support efforts to undertake the transformation of business model in line with our vision.  In 2018 we are introducing a number of important changes as follows: a refinement of our supervisory approach to strengthen core foundations; a review of lending to accommodate the future lending growth ambitions of the stronger credit unions as part of a balanced loan portfolio; a new chief executive officer forum to support advancement of the development of new business models; and workshops to support credit unions in addressing key risk vulnerabilities.<\/p><p> I hope this overview of some key topics has been helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525941000,"counter":1522,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Lane.

We believe it is a very small amount.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the work involved to give the Deputy a flavour of how it can come about.  We have identified groups of customers that should be included for a particular reason.  However, we are actually doing verification work on the numbers of customers in a group.  We might have an unverified number of, for example, 200 customers affected by a particular issue.  However, we are going back to spot-check and recreate the data to inform us on whether 200 is the correct or incorrect figure.  In that work we have found the figure sometimes adjusts downwards and that it can actually occasionally adjust upwards.  It is with that verification that the number can adjust, as we have found.  Equally, we have closed out the known issues with some of the lenders; therefore, we think there will be no more movement, bar that verification adjustment with these lenders.  However, we are still in dialogue with others on issues that could result in an adjustment.  It is our view that the vast majority affected have been identified and we anticipate very small adjustments in the number.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Derville Rowland"},{"type":"speech","time":1525941000,"counter":1526,"content":"<p>I understand exactly what Ms Rowland has suggested.

During the crisis, many banks had to cut back on investment.  The world is in a situation that is not very good with regard to managing all sorts of IT risks in the financial system.

That remains the case today.  We certainly have a degree of concern around IT resilience and the level of investment that is needed in some, although not all, of the banks.  I am very limited in terms of what I can say about the specific incident but I will probably be able to address the thrust of the Deputy's question.  Our overriding view is that customers of banks have a legitimate and rightful expectation that they can access their funds, execute payments and so on.  This is entirely dependent on the resilience and availability of the banks' IT systems.  Inevitably, over a long period of time, incidents will happen that result in IT outages.  This is part of the nature of IT.  We certainly look to make sure that those incidents are minimised and that when they do occur, they are fixed as quickly as possible and there is clear communication to customers around what is happening, how the quickly the issue will be addressed and that if customers are out of pocket, they will gain redress.  In respect of what we are doing with IT, and to follow on from the Governor's remarks, we recognise that this is a very significant risk for the financial system.  This is why we set up a dedicated IT risk inspection team in late 2014.  We have undertaken 19 inspections across the banking system since then and have issued over 150 findings in terms of requirements for banks to improve how they look at IT to make sure they are resilient in terms of security and the capability of the IT system improves.  We have issued 90 findings relating to the domestic retail banks, about half of which have been closed and about half of which are still open, so there is work to be done and we are making sure it is being done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#G01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speech","time":1525941000,"counter":1547,"content":"<p>When Ulster Bank closed services to its customers in 2012 or so, it went on for six weeks and the fine was &euro;5 million.

The final issue I want to discuss is the economy and the macroeconomic outlook, which I think this committee needs to focus more on.  The Governor did not say that the economy is overheating.  I ask him to inform the committee of the factors which inform the opinion that it is not overheating.  I am glad that he referred in his opening statement to the issue of non-mortgage buyers.  I have been in communication with Professor Lane privately about this.  I have major concerns about this.  The figures presented here today speak volumes.  Some 55% of home purchases are by non-mortgage buyers, with a sizeable section done by real estate investment trusts, REITs, which we facilitate generously through our tax codes.  This is having an impact and pushing ordinary buyers out of the market, people who rely on mortgages.  Has the Central Bank any projection of when demand is likely to meet supply?  We are currently behind on that.  The witnesses mentioned that the tax-efficient structures, the REITs, make up 14.5% of all home purchases during that period.  If we were to just look at the urban regions, such as Dublin, what proportion would they be?  REITs are not buying houses in Donegal, Leitrim or Cavan.  What proportion are these tax-incentivised structures buying up where there is acute pressure on house prices and demand?<\/p> <p>  There are concerns about commercial real estate, the true trigger to our economic collapse, which we do not pay much attention to.  I have written to the witnesses about my concerns with the super-geared business model of some of these businesses.  The statistics stand for themselves.  They are shocking and alarming.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that and also to comment on whether they believe that the increase in stamp duty has had an impact on dampening what we are seeing in the commercial market.  I have said this before at the committee.  I believe that we are in bubble territory with commercial property and, unless we get a handle on it, things could go very wrong very quickly with a change of international direction on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#H00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525941000,"counter":1553,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked a number of interesting questions.

I will come back to overheating first.  Unemployment is currently around 5.9%.  I said in the opening statement that one question is how low unemployment can go.  We think, and many members of the committee have probably thought about this, that Ireland still has a high rate of people who are not in the labour market.  If there were policies of many types that could bring people who do not currently find it possible to make themselves available to work or do not have the support to enter the labour force, that could help.  We as a Central Bank, and equally the political system, need to think about this in advance.  We are not overheating now.  We are seeing wages starting to go up, which is welcome.  It differs across sectors and regions but having some recovery in living standards is important.  We want unemployment to continue to fall.  We see revisions around the world about how low unemployment can go.  In the US, unemployment has gone below 4%.  This was not expected but is maybe evidence that the world has changed a little, that the level that it operated the labour market may be able to push unemployment lower.  This is silent on the quality of jobs.  We also have to ask if these are well paid jobs, the jobs that people want, and so on.  Our message is to think about if that day comes.<\/p> <p>  This is all dependent on the current good conditions continuing.  If Brexit goes badly, if the current trade disputes broaden, or international tax issues disadvantage small open economies, or, on the last point the Deputy made, there is a revision in international financial sentiment, there will be issues.  These are well-known risk factors which could derail this good outlook.  With overheating, the big question, which will be interesting for the Deputy for the rest of this year, is what the appropriate budget balance is when facing the risk of overheating.  I will work more on this in the coming months before I give my pre-budget advice.  I would generally flag that the debate here is maybe a little too narrow.  Trying to target a budget balance of zero will maybe not be enough.  The conversation about significant budget surpluses is not something I hear too much here.  I do not think it is an issue for now but in the next year or two, we may have a situation where, for the stability of the economy, running a significant surplus may be important.  That does not cut across anyone's desires for more public spending.  It is a question of balancing public spending with raising revenue to match it.<\/p> <p>  Turning to financing of both the residential market and the commercial real estate market, what is the alternative?  For the rental market, having large, professional investors can be a positive force.  Having a professional landlord institutional class, where they may not own very large portfolios, may have a better outcome for many people seeking to rent than having to deal with small-time buy-to-let landlords.  We all want a stable rental system where one can expect professional standards from the landlord.  Large-scale professional investors who buy up apartment buildings and complexes to rent them out can be part of what we want.  On leverage of these firms, banks are highly leveraged institutions.  The leverage of a private equity investor or investment fund would be less than a bank.  Banks, while they take on debt, are, through deposits, bank bonds and so on, usually more indebted.  The other issue is the consequence.  We care a lot about banks because we put our money in banks.  We have to keep depositors safe.  If some global professional investor decides to lend money to a big private equity fund and that fund gets into trouble, the losses are not for the general population.  They will be concentrated on those who took that risk.  It is a different type of risk.  It is a real risk, where there is some disruption in the international financial system and some of these companies may get into trouble.  The question is, if they get into trouble, what the systemic consequences are.  It is bad news for their shareholders and their bond investors but it is easier to mop up that type of problem than to mop up a problem where it is bank-funded.  Having diversified funding in the system is important.  I recognise that it increases competition for the individual in the short term, in the Dublin market, for example.  On the other hand, for the wider system, we should be cautiously optimistic about having professional investors who will play an important part in providing apartments and homes to rent.  That can be a positive development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1525941000,"counter":1556,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor Lane and his colleagues.

What we are seeing now is not credit or property driven.  The wider macroeconomic position is being driven by other factors.  We must remember that multinational firms and commercial real estate investors are not relying on the Irish banking system.  It is possible to have a scenario where there is not a significant domestic credit issue but there is still a great deal of activity taking place in the economy that may prove to be unsustainable.  Overheating is a much broader issue than just the housing market.  While the housing market is important, it is not the only issue and we all need to think about that.  When we have broader types of overheating, the Central Bank will do what it can to respond but ultimately it will come down to fiscal policy because that is the tool available, especially for a member of a monetary union.

As I stated, the market is expecting single-digit increases in house prices.  What we have to think about is what if the market is wrong and what if there is a reversal.  I believe a reversal in house prices is a material risk for several reasons.<\/p><p>Number one is time.  I agree that these may be over a two or three year horizon rather than a 2018 risk.  I am not saying this is for 2018.  Over a two or three year horizon, more and more houses are being built.  In the mid-2000s there was a very big house-building response in Ireland and the overhang of so much supply was part of the reason houses prices eventually tumbled so much.  Straightforwardly, more housing of different types becoming available will relieve the pressure on the rental market.  This is not just family homes.  Student accommodation is being built all around Dublin and this will take some students out of the normal rental market, and so on.  This will relieve pressure on the rental market.<\/p><p> With regard to interest rates I do not believe that multi-policy rates will move dramatically in the years to come.  The market does not think these will move dramatically but the rates relevant for mortgage funding are more like the five to eight year rates that banks can raise money at.  There is a risk that these can move.  More basically, we have seen a strong increase in incomes in Ireland from more employment in recent years.  The Irish employment story has been very strong and as we get towards lower levels of unemployment it will slow down.  Add into the natural slowdown the trade risk, the Brexit risk and the end of the cycles in the US and so on, and there are multiple reasons this kind of current positive momentum may go into reverse.  I am not expecting it but it is a material risk and should be planned for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#K03000","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525941000,"counter":1631,"content":"<p>Just to be absolutely clear, because words matter from Professor Lane as he is the Governor of the Central Bank, when he said a \"material risk\" of a reverse in house prices is he talking about a slowdown in the rate of growth in prices or a material risk of house prices actually falling in the next two or three years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#L00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525941000,"counter":1632,"content":"<p>The latter.

When people are trying to flip houses, however, and the kinds of stuff that happened in the boom of 15 years ago it means that they should not count on expected demand and a one-way only momentum.  For all mortgages now and for first-time buyers there is pretty much no lending above 90% so there is already a lot of protection there.  The system is a lot more resilient now.

The definition of a \"first-time buyer\" in the context of the macroprudential rules makes a huge difference, particularly when the Government's help-to-buy scheme is considered.  In the case of a house on sale for &euro;400,000, if I am a non first-time buyer, I need a 20% deposit or &euro;80,000 whereas a first-time buyer requires 10% or &euro;40,000 and can then claim half that back under the help-to-buy scheme, which means the deposit required is &euro;20,000.  That is a dramatic difference.  This is not only because of Central Bank rules because the scheme is a significant factor as well.  What is the Central Bank's rationale for having such a different approach for non first-time buyers?  I am thinking of people who may have bought ten or 15 years ago and who may be coming out of negative equity or who might not have much equity but their homes are unsuitable because their families have grown and they need more bedrooms.  However, they are faced with the prospect of a 20% deposit requirement, even though their repayment capacity may be good and, therefore, they are stuck.

Without that category, which comprises those who were hardest hit by the crisis, I would probably pick a tighter rule.  The fact that we have these allowances to be exceeded is a recognition of that category of homeowner who through no fault of their own were caught by the crisis.  That is why the system of allowances is in place for the second and subsequent buyer population.  It is in recognition of the many cases such as the Deputy outlined.  In some of the other correspondence we have had, it comes back to the same answer.  We recognise that one size does not fit all.

They have a higher target price to achieve and it is harder to save for the deposit.  For somebody who owns a home, there is an offsetting benefit because he or she is building up equity.  When house prices increase, life is more difficult for first-time buyers but there is a build-up of equity for existing owners.  We have seen before - and there is global evidence for this - that there is a risk of procyclicality with a boom being amplified by people with equity in their homes deciding they have significant equity built up their homes and using that to take out a buy-to-let mortgage and adding to the pressure in the market.

It is something at which we have a responsibility to look and explain.  We are playing a big part in the international shadow banking work being done at the Financial Stability Board and so on.

I emphasise that it is mostly a wholesale trade.  The products are not being marketed to retail customers, to whom exposure would require a higher level of oversight.  Just because something is legal does not mean that the State is offering a moral judgment on the activity.  There is a considerable legal framework in place.  There is an anti-money laundering framework in place, as well as a sanctions framework.  The lawyers, accountants and everyone else involved in the industry have responsibilities to respect all of what is legally required in the anti-money laundering, the sanctions regime and so on.  It all takes place within a legal framework.  Investors in these products should have open eyes on what it is they are investing in.  Largely, the cases we have seen here have been high risk investments where the pricing has recognised the risks.  It is something that is located here, but it does not really interact dramatically with the Irish financial system, to which there is not an economic risk.  The reputational damage questions should be placed firmly at the door of the firms that are raising finance.  We are not endorsing any firm which raises money in Dublin.  They must respect the legal framework in place.  If they are raising money through public securities markets, we have a limited role regarding the prospectus, but it is quite a narrow function.  However, it is a significant issue globally.  We are to the forefront in being active participants in examining this area, at which we are looking carefully.  However, it is important to separate the financial risks from the wider issues of what it means politically and the global money trail.  Collectively, the world needs to do more in knowing about the global money trail.  The phrase \"shadow banking\" is very acute.  As far as I am concerned, everything should come out of the shadows; we should know what is going on.  Ireland has taken a lot of steps forward in that regard.  We do more than many other places, but, globally, there is a long way to go in ensuring what is in the shadows will come out of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1525941000,"counter":1674,"content":"<p>We should never facilitate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#O00800","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1525941000,"counter":1675,"content":"<p>Professor Lane and his colleagues are welcome.  I was not going to ask about the housing market, but I feel as if I must based on what he has said.  I do not think his analysis that the market may decline or lose ground in two or three years' time is earth shattering.  It will be reported as being quite a statement, but my view is that it is in no way earth shattering.  He has given the reasons he thinks it might occur, which is fair.  He has also said it is a consequential decision for any individual to buy a house.  We know that housing markets are invariably volatile.  Professor Lane has mentioned things that he thinks have improved the position or that will protect house owners that were not in place, even in the recent past, such as large down payments and levels of exposure to household debt, things the Central Bank can determine.  In Professor Lane's opinion there have been improvements in all of these factors.<\/p><p>However, when Professor Lane talks about managing risk versus learning hard lessons from the past, are there more things which we should be doing now based on his commentary that this may occur in three years' time?  Are there further policy measures that need to be taken to counteract what may be coming down the tracks?  What does Professor Lane mean by managing risk?  What steps is he taking or have all the steps been taken?  Surely this is the question.  From my experience, and I was here in 2008, commentary from governors of the Central Bank is important, but in the past it has fallen on deaf ears.  It makes for a newspaper headline and then the market quickly forgets it.  In the past Professor Lane's organisation has not taken concrete steps to make sure that people are not badly affected, so when he makes that statement I have to ask what exactly he is saying.  With that in mind, what prescriptive steps need to be taken by legislators and policymakers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#O00900","speaker":"1352","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525941000,"counter":1677,"content":"<p>That is a great question.  I completely agree with the Deputy that talk is cheap.  Historically, not just here but in many places, central banks come out with reports and after the fact governors will mention that they mentioned that such a risk existed on page 57 of some report.  For that to be credible in terms of our own policies if we think there is a material risk - and the Deputy used the term \"material risk\" earlier on - it should feed into our policies.  One thing that happened on a pan-European basis after the crisis is that every country now has what is called a macroprudential policy.  In Ireland we, as the Central Bank, have the lead role.  In some other systems that lead role might be allocated to the finance ministry, but here it is allocated to us.  One manifestation of that policy is the mortgage rules which we have talked about.  If I believed the risk was zero, I would not be looking for deposits on houses or loan-to-income ceilings.  That is one example.  If the risks got more intense, we could recalibrate those measures.<\/p> <p>  Let me emphasise that every three months we also have to decide on what is called a countercyclical capital buffer.  Much of the global effort says that as cyclical risk goes up, national central banks and national regulators should raise the capital requirement on banks.  That is an option open to us and we can do it every three months.  If one goes back to 2004, 2005 and 2006, there was a paralysis not just here but everywhere.  People were recognising that something was going on but were saying that they would think about it and that they would perhaps delay acting.  We now have a mechanism that allows us to move more quickly.  This is something which we review every three months.  Every three months we publish our assessment on our website.  We decide whether we need to start raising this buffer, which will raise the amount of protection in the system.  We can be held to account because we now have an extra policy instrument and we are committed to using it when we think it is necessary.<\/p> <p>  That covers our own policy.  Let me come back to the situation more broadly.  I have now told the Deputy that a lot of what is going on is not coming out of the domestic credit system, so it is outside of our direct regulatory control.  For broader types of overheating, the responsibility will be on fiscal policy.  I broadly believe that where the spring statement signalled the 2019 budget should be in terms of the overall balance may be okay for 2019 but, if these pressures continue to build up, seeking to run a significant surplus will be part of risk management.  The risk management will partly be on us, but there is a heavy responsibility on fiscal policy for it to run on a prudential basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525941000,"counter":1678,"content":"<p>If will come in and add something from a microprudential aspect, which is also important.  In the context that it is certainly plausible that we are closer to the next downturn, which we certainly hope is not as severe as the last one, than we are to the start of the financial crisis, it is really important that we recognise that as a risk.  That is important context when we are talking about non-performing loans and the need for continued repair in the system to address that particular risk.  If we go into the next downturn with a significant number of non-performing loans in the system it will be a problem from a prudential perspective.  We also need to make sure that consumers are protected to the maximum in addressing that issue.<\/p> <p>  The other aspects we think about from a risk management perspective include looking differently at the business models of financial services providers today than we have done in the past.  We are looking at them through the cycle.  Are they sustainable over the long term?  We have done a huge amount of work but there is more to be done in terms of resolution planning.  How do we deal with failing firms in the system, perhaps not with the systemic issue but with individual firms?

A systemic risk buffer is where we think that there is some particular type of risk facing the economy, which is not cyclical, so we tell banks that they need to hold extra capital if they are lending to a particular sector because we think that sector is especially risky.

Given the role of non-banks in funding commercial real estate, what other measures should be looked at at a European level in that regard?

There were concerns back in the worst of the crisis that maybe not enough was being done in terms of investment for the future.  Clearly, in terms of the overall austerity, public investment took a big hit during the crisis.  One of the lessons for the future is at what level of austerity does one cause long-term damage.<\/p> <p>  In terms of learning from how the crisis was handled, it was important for Ireland to do a lot of fiscal consolidation.

We have ended up in a situation where there is a supply deficit and although housing and construction are moving more needs to happen.  There is some supply response now but it is an ongoing challenge.  The instruments for dealing with that remain with the other arms of the State and not with the Central Bank.

We cannot have a situation where the construction industry is overly reliant on bank debt.  That causes a problem especially when the retained earnings of many construction firms have been wiped out by the crisis.  There is a financial problem but the answer is not for the banks to lend more money without equity.  The answer is that we need more sources of equity funding for construction and we have seen that through the entry of large construction firms, which raise money on the stock market.  It is welcome to have more equity funding coming in.  This is the genuine reason the housing supply response has been slower than in the past.  The answer is not to make bank debt financing easier.

Customers are complaining to us about the treatment they receive at the hand of credit servicing firms, which are being dictated to by vulture funds.  In his opening statement, the Governor referred to how effective the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is in the context of the sale of loan books.  I want to bring to his attention again the fact the vulture funds or credit servicing firms seem not to give a damn about the code of conduct.  I have received numerous complaints from customers.  For example, a credit servicing firm was asked for information on the make-up of a portfolio and the amount that was originally paid into the bank before it was sold to be managed by a vulture fund and, in turn, the firm.  To this day, it has not responded to that client.  There is nothing in the portfolio bar properties and the client has no information.  The firm wanted to sell all the properties and the client said that was okay.  The firm came back to him last week and said it wanted &euro;175,000 from him.  He does not have a penny.<\/p><p> In another case, the client has been harassed so much that he had to pledge his sister's pension fund to them.  I have been present at some of the interactions and it is anything but pleasant.  Dealing with banks is not pleasant but dealing with these servicing agents is the worst that I have witnessed.  Professor Lane referred to EU developments in banking regulation and said that Ireland is an example for other countries to follow.  It is not and I appeal to him to examine this issue.  When he drills down into the detail, he will find the greatest blackguards ever in those firms, and they are acting on behalf of vulture funds.  What additional powers can be inserted into the code of conduct?  What insistence can the Central Bank put in place that the funds deliver on the code because that is not happening?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#U01900","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525941000,"counter":1777,"content":"<p>I will turn to Ms Rowland on this but we are mindful of the fact we have this new credit servicing firm regime.

All the protections of the CPC and the requirements to treat people fairly embedded in it travel with the loans and they are required to be adhered to.  The protections of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears also travel with the loan and because this is an area about which there is considerable concern and because we are also concerned about the risks, we have conducted on-site inspections in the credit servicing firms, particularly focusing on the issue of people's homes and how they are being treated in compliance with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Given our careful scrutiny of that, I am interested in the Chairman providing us, as he said he would, with any information about requirements to pledge people's pension funds or otherwise because we will take that into account.  One of the key parts of the framework is that no implementation of an instruction from an unregulated loan owner that is in breach of the regulatory requirements is permitted.  If anyone acts in that way, we will take that seriously.  I want to be clear that we are carefully looking at inspecting compliance with the code.  One of the key foundation stones of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears relates to people's family homes - if one only owns one property, that is probably covered as well - and that requires sympathetic, speedy but respectful resolution, where possible.  We do not tolerate harassing behaviours and the code provides for that.  Where the Chairman has information in this regard, we would welcome it because it is something we take seriously.<\/p> <p>  We have also separately been asked to conduct a review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears to ascertain if it is optimally effective as the problem moves on, and we are committed to this.

We are also speaking to the Insolvency Service of Ireland to gain its insights into what is happening in its sphere and to the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, because it is important that we examine this from a number of points of view to see if anything else can be done and if the problem has moved on.

Anything that consumer protection can deliver on that question can also be delivered through the regulation of credit servicing firms.  We have been carrying out inspections and we have not seen these problems in terms of consumer issues.  Investors were mentioned earlier, for example, someone who might have an investment portfolio who may not fall under the consumer code.  It is still relevant in terms of correct conduct, but we believe that this distinction is important, and that, for consumer protection purposes, the credit servicing firms are the appropriate venue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#AA00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1525941000,"counter":1789,"content":"<p>Can the witness address the question on the role of the receiver?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#AA00500","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525941000,"counter":1790,"content":"<p>I did not catch what the question was.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#AA00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1525941000,"counter":1791,"content":"<p>Receivers are in the middle of the mix from time to time.

It is about the insolvency service.  It is about the support the advisory services make available to people in deep distress.  It is not a code of conduct issue.

We all acknowledge how worrying it is for people who are in distress or worried about paying their mortgage or who may be in arrears.  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the consumer protection code apply equally, whether one's loan is owned by a bank that is regulated or sold to an unregulated loan owner.  The protections of the code travel with the sale of the loan.  People are entitled to expect the full adherence to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the consumer protection code whether they are dealing with a regulated bank or whether their loan has been sold to an unregulated loan owner.  It is important that people realise that and engage to the maximum extent because the code of conduct represents the Central Bank of Ireland working to the maximum it can within the framework of the State as it is currently structured.  The example that was given was a proposal coming from a personal insolvency practitioner which means that the case has sadly reached the stage where it is in the phase of the insolvency service trying to support somebody to come to a sustainable solution.  It is important to know there are a number of actors in the system of the State to deal with that.  People have the support of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and I know the insolvency service is concerned with being as active as it can in that.

This is also the conclusion across Europe and that is why this European directive is there.  That is important.  It would put us in an unusual position where the State would be saying it is deviating from this emerging European norm by not only regulating credit servicing but regulating the owners.  We will live with any legislation that is passed.

We have a responsibility in terms of fair process through codes.

To follow up on the regulation of both the service agents in the country and the funds, from my perspective, the name &quot;funds&quot; is a bit of a misnomer for many of these funds.  They borrow from funds in American and they then invest in the Irish market.  They are not funds; they are basically loan sharks, which are 100% geared.  They come into the Irish market.  Some of them are funds, and some of them are based here and some of them are based abroad.<\/p><p>In the opening statement provided to the committee, the Governor made reference to: <\/p><blockquote>foreign capital flows into the commercial property market that are the result of the global search for yield in the current low interest rate environment are vulnerable to a sudden stop or even a sharp reversal should there be an adverse shift in global financing conditions.  In turn, this could generate disorderly property market price reversals. <\/blockquote> <p>I have two questions on that.  I understand the type of regulation the Central Bank does of these service providers is effectively desktop based.  I would have thought these service providers should be required to make returns to the Central Bank.  It regulates them, therefore, I assume they deal with most of the restructuring.  They should be making returns to the Central Bank like any other institution regarding what they are putting in place.  I would have thought the Central Bank should have had people physically out conducting audits, as would happen with any other normal institution.  I understand the Central Bank does not regard them as material in terms of their individual size relative to larger institutions when in fact they could be quite significant.  <\/p><p>From my perspective, their current footprint is quite astounding.  I am based in Limerick city and these funds are involved in most of the developments, ranging from housing estates, commercial developments to apartments, taking place there.  Does the Governor have a concern about stability in terms of that property creep?  We are talking about regulating these entities.  I would have thought there is sufficient provision in terms of the powers the Central Bank has over the service providers to get that level of information, and to heavily regulate them in the same way that it regulates the other financial institutions or even more so because of the threat they may pose to the stability of property market.  <\/p><p>Another issue I have found is that many of these funds are appointing receivers.  They may have typically bought a fund from someone else, a bank or from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and then they suddenly appoint a receiver.  What powers does the Central Bank have over the receiver?  Could a fund, which is in some way regulated through the service provider, suddenly appoint a receiver to call in the loans it has in order to sell a large amount of property, and by doing that, would they be bypassing any form of regulation?<\/p><p>There is a looseness in the regulation of such service providers that is within the power of the Central Bank to address in a more prudential-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#DD01500","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525941000,"counter":1867,"content":"<p>I understand what the Senator means.

If Members informed us that Abhaile was not providing sufficient help or that the insolvency system was not working in the way the Oireachtas had intended in legislation, all of this should come under continuous review, given the change in the market and the likelihood of more sales.

The proposals tend to lack some depth and really well thought through plans on what it means for the overall business model of a particular credit union or the credit union sector as a whole.  It is very much focused on individual product development rather than considering what it means for the credit unions.  In the discussion on longer term lending and investment, it is critical that the credit unions think about both sides of the balance sheet.  They are talking about very long term products, in excess of 20 to 25 years in some cases, where their funding is on a demand, instantaneous basis.  There is a need really to think through how the product development fits in with an overall mix of business and how it works on both sides of the balance sheet.  It is also important that the sector as a whole coalesces around this common vision because it is very difficult for an individual credit union to be particularly innovative or to offer some of these services that require a great deal of infrastructure by which to operate and offer in a competitive way, and that brings us into more of a shared services model.  We have not seen the vision from the sector as a whole.  We see some very good managers who try to move their individual credit unions forward and some high level proposals come from the centre, but there is not enough thinking through as to how this will work overall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#KK00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speech","time":1525941000,"counter":1975,"content":"<p>Is it not the case that the very nature of credit unions means that the one-size regulations will not fit all?

There is a proportionate approach to the regulation of credit unions.  There is both explicit and implicit proportionality.  Our work in the credit union sector is to focus on those areas of highest impact and highest risk.  With the exception of those which are in trouble from the sustainability perspective, we are essentially looking at the smaller credit unions on an off-site basis.  We get their returns and engage with them through seminars and speeches.  We have a minimum expectation in what we expect from them.  The intensity of our supervision is much lower.  Connected to that is the expectation that they are not doing things that are particularly exotic or innovative.  Typically, they will not have deposits that go beyond the deposit guarantee scheme and we would not expect them to engage in significant longer-term lending and so on, because they are small, very local and should be ensuring that they are protecting their members' funds and delivering on their purposes.  As the credit unions get bigger or they look to do more, such as longer term lending, invest or hold higher numbers of deposits, then our expectation grows both in some of the requirements we put upon them and also in the level of our intensity of our supervision.  There is a natural tiering and proportionality of our supervision.  We absolutely expect that they will serve local members' needs - that is the purpose of the sector and we are very supportive of it - but it is different where they are discussing getting into more sophisticated products that are very costly and complex.  There was a lot of discussion about mortgages today.  In some respects, people think they are simple but they are complex products that have many costs associated with them.<\/p><p>If a credit union wants to start lending longer term and doing mortgage lending then it needs to have a degree of scale or access to scale, so either it is large enough to do it itself or it has access to some kind of shared services model.  We are working really hard with the sector.  There is a business model development team and we are meeting the CEOs.  Individually the registrar meets them through the seminars.  The level of engagement we have, not just because we are supervising them but in all manners of ways to try to support credit unions' development and growth, does not compare to any other sector in which we are engaged.

Many of the people involved are volunteers.  They serve the local community.  Over the years they have done a fantastic job.  I want to see a structure in place that allows them to respond to the new marketplace that is developing, and to capitalise on the fact that greedy banks are retreating and there will be nothing left in the parish now only a credit union.

It is very substantial at approximately &euro;1.5 billion across approximately 126,000 PCP arrangements.  The report we have contains good recommendations.  The stand-out point is the fact that affordability checks currently do not have to be done, therefore, background checks on the consumer are not done, and there is no assessment whatsoever of the affordability of the product.

We have studied this, and the CCPC has studied it.  A range of issues arises, one of which is that this is a new form of finance.  When we have a new form of finance which is superficially attractive to many people, we must ask if there are hidden risk factors.  This is more developed in the United Kingdom.  Some of the concerns are not intensive here.  The funding of the PCPs is not, by and large, coming from the main Irish banks so the concern that this poses a financial splitting risk is not really present here.  For many individuals, we have looked at the question of financial gain going through a PCP versus a car loan and so on.  It depends on individual circumstances.  On average, it is quite finely balanced.<\/p> <p>  We then come to the consumer protection issue, which is people who may not run through the calculation an accountant like Deputy McGrath might make in terms of calculating the financial pros and cons and the protections available to them.  I will hand over to Ms Rowland shortly but I want to say that this is not a simple because buying a car is partly non-financial.  We also want to have consumer protection in terms of whether the person is being sold the car they were promised, whether all of that is in order and assessments about wear and tear.  All of those are non-financial issues which, typically, would not be a Central Bank issue.  On the other hand, there is a financial component to this, as the Deputy mentioned.<\/p> <p>  There are no easy answers to this.

What we have here is a position where the credit is usually sold on the garage forecourt in the car dealerships.  The credit intermediary is currently regulated by the CCPC.  It is also responsible for the sale of goods in terms of consumer provision of goods.  That is where we find that the provision of the good - the car - is fairly intermingled with the financial service because some of the terms and conditions of that hire purchase agreement can be to do with servicing, the mileage etc.<\/p><p>The worry in this regard is that one could end up with a patchwork quilt of regulation which might not deliver an optimal outcome for the consumer.  One might find providers saying that the issue is the condition of the good, not the way in which the financial product was sold.  We would see a big risk in unpacking that and putting it into separate areas.  The key observation for us it that we have a very limited role under the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  We have some hire purchase responsibilities relating to what should be in the contract, but we do not actually authorise any of the regulated entities in the area of hire purchase because anybody can provide that service.  The question the Deputy asked at the beginning was about the consumer protection code.  It is mentioned as one of the solutions in the report.  It cannot actually be extended to this area under the current legal frameworks because the code travels with authorisation from the Central Bank and we do not authorise hire purchase providers.  There are a couple of things to think about with regard to any solution which some might desire be put in place.  Responsibilities for the sale of the car, which in inextricably linked with the condition of that car, and for the seller of the finance sit with another agency at the moment.  Of course, we are happy to take part in any fact-finding, solutions or discussions that would be of benefit.  That is why, at the moment, it would not even be legally possible to put the consumer protection code into use in this area.  It is because we do not authorise those entities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#MM03000","nonspeaker":"Ms Derville Rowland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525941000,"counter":2027,"content":"<p>There can be a step forward on affordability.

The pension has &euro;1.3 billion in assets and has &euro;240 million accumulated in savings.  It is a well-funded pension.  They feel that, if their defined benefit pension comes to an end, this will escalate to other defined benefit pension schemes and that will leave people with just the State pension if that happens.  It would be a shock to the system.  It is extraordinary, when one thinks that Irish Life's business is selling pensions to people, that it will bring to an end its own staff's defined benefit pension.  How does the Central Bank feel about it?  Is there anything that the Central Bank can do about this?  Have the witnesses any thoughts on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018051000002#OO00600","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525941000,"counter":2053,"content":"<p>Without commenting on that company, this is a huge issue for everyone.  The one area of the financial system that we do not regulate is pension funds.  There is a different regulator for pension funds.  As part of a new European system, we are starting to gather more information from pension funds.  In general, this issue will be important for Ireland.  The Government has been developing it for years.  There have been many reviews about how to build a sustainable occupational pension system so that people do not just have to rely on the State pension system.  There are huge political issues there with the balance between individuals versus their employer and the appropriate rate of contribution, whether compulsory or opt-in.  There is a huge range of issues which I would hope that the political system finalises sooner rather than later.  Pre-crisis, we had a partial answer for some of this in the State system, with the National Pensions Reserve Fund, but that was blown away by the crisis.  We have to rebuild.  Post-crisis, this is a case of focusing on these issues which do not manifest themselves in a crisis or year by year.  This is one of the biggest financial issues facing the country.  It is not just about one employer and its workers.  It is very broad.  It is a fundamental inter-generational issue here and elsewhere.  It is not a good system if workers rely on their employer to provide a pension.  We saw with Waterford Crystal a number of years ago, and so on, that it is not a good system to have what we have here, which is a very fragmented pensions industry where there are many specific pension funds.

I remind members to ensure their mobile phones are turned off or set to airplane or safe mode for the duration of the meeting.  This will avoid any interference with the sound system, which is particularly desirable given that this meeting is being broadcast live on Oireachtas TV.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Taoiseach to his first engagement with the Working Group of Committee Chairmen.  We are delighted to have him here.  His attendance at this morning's meeting is part of a programme of reforms arising from recommendations made by the Constitutional Convention, which was the predecessor of the current Citizens' Assembly.  In its seventh report, the convention recommended three significant changes in D&aacute;il procedure, all of which have been implemented in the current D&aacute;il.  It is widely recognised that the first of these innovations - the election of the Ceann Comhairle by means of a secret ballot - has enhanced the status and independence of the office of the Ceann Comhairle.  The other two innovations - the proportionate allocation of Oireachtas committee Chairs among all parties and groups using the d'Hondt system and the introduction of a biannual engagement between the Taoiseach and the committee Chairs for the purposes of discussing matters of public policy - relate to the committee system.  These welcome initiatives have further strengthened the role of the committees within the Oireachtas.  The valuable work of committees allows us to explore policy in more depth by engaging with a wider sector.  We engage not only with those who are accountable for implementing policies, but also and more importantly with the people who are affected by those policies, whom we have the privilege of representing.<\/p> <p>  As all the committee Chairs in this room are aware, committee work is intensive and committee remits are broad.  In 2017, there were 655 committee meetings involving 2,179 witnesses.  We are all aware of the enormous work that goes on in Oireachtas committees.  I hope this engagement will provide a useful forum for the Taoiseach and the Chairs of the various committees to discuss the policy matters that are priorities for the committees and the legislative processes with which we are contending.  I remind members again to turn off their mobile phones.  I propose to proceed directly to the substantive business of the meeting.  I ask the Taoiseach to make his opening statement, which will be followed by questions from the committee Chairs, whom I will call in groups of three according to the d'Hondt system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WGC2018051000002#A00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":2062,"content":"<p>I am grateful for this opportunity to reflect on our work to legislate effectively and apply the best thinking to public policy.<\/p><p>I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General.  As part of the programme for Government and the commitment to strengthening Cabinet accountability, it was agreed that all Ministers would appear before their relevant Oireachtas committees and that the Taoiseach would appear before this working group to discuss matters of public policy.  This meeting serves as a useful purpose because it is an opportunity to hear about what committees are working on, the issues of concern to chairpersons and, also, it is an occasion for me to comment on what Government is doing.<\/p><p> I want to acknowledge the role committees play in scrutinising the work of Government and its agencies, in examining legislation and in advising on policy issues.  During the 2011 election, which we all remember so well, which was during the time of the financial crisis, there was a huge demand for political reform in Ireland, a sense that the political system had let people down and was part of the reason for that crisis, and calls for a democratic revolution.  Since then, a lot has been done to reform our politics, much of which is unrecognised, but there is more yet to be done.  Among the changes that have been made which I think are of significance, is the use of pre-legislative scrutiny by committees in giving Oireachtas members much more input into significant policy matters and legislation before it is drafted by Departments.<\/p><p> There has also been the introduction of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, albeit still in its early days, which gives the Oireachtas a stronger role in budgetary matters and provision of specialist resources, such as staffing for the new parliamentary budget office, which provides financial and budgetary expertise for Oireachtas members.  There has been a major reduction in the use of the guillotine.  The Seanad reform implementation group is up and running.  We now have scrutiny of the appointments of chairmen of State bodies by committees.  Also, the fact that we have a minority Government means more Private Members' Bills have been accepted, five of which have now become law, and we have had to take on the views of Opposition more frequently than perhaps was done in the past.  It is also fair to say that there is now greater communication between Ministers and their Departments and Opposition spokespeople and Oireachtas committee chairpersons and members, although I appreciate this is still not always satisfactory.  <\/p><p> When the current minority coalition of Fine Gael, the Independent Alliance and Independents was formed in May 2016, expectations were limited.  Few thought it would last but the record of the past two years tells a different tale.  Facilitated by the confidence and supply agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il it has proven possible for the minority Government to do more than just survive or muddle through.  We have been able to refresh ourselves, act decisively and govern and deal with major issues not dealt within the past by majority Governments.  In total, 65 Bills have been enacted, five of which were originally published as Private Members' Bills.  A further 18 Government Bills are currently before the D&aacute;il and seven Government Bills are currently before the Seanad, which means 30 to 35 pieces of legislation each year become law, which under a majority Government, was approximately 40.  This shows that minority Governments can get legislation enacted. <\/p><p> The past two years have seen the benefits of the country's economic recovery spread across the country.  In every county, employment is up and incomes and living standards have risen.  The Government's books have been brought into balance.  Last year, for the first time in ten years, we had a small budget surplus, although it was flattered by the sale shares in AIB.  Our debt, although falling as a percentage of GDP, remains high at &euro;45,000 per person.  When we entered the financial crisis ten years ago it was &euro;15,000 per person, such that our debt burden presents a major vulnerability into the future.  <\/p><p> The last decade has been a lost decade for many of our citizens.  We cannot risk returning to those days.  Therefore, management of public finances will be based on what is right for the economy.  We will not adopt pro-cyclical policies that jeopardise our public finances and our future living standards.  Instead, we will aim for sustainable progress both economic and social.  Unlike previous Governments in our position, we will not place greater priority on the electoral cycle than the long-term interests of the Irish people.  We have plenty of problems and the country faces enormous challenges but overall we are on the right track.  This morning, I want to reflect on some of the work done by Government since the election of the 32nd D&aacute;il, touching on important work by the committees.  This is not an opportunity to list successes, nor is that my intention in being here.  Rather, it is an opportunity to look at what we need to do better into the future.<\/p><p> On housing, we all acknowledge that homelessness is a stain on our society.  The Government is determined to reduce the number of people, particularly children, who are living in emergency accommodation.  The causes of homelessness are complex and include issues that are related to issues other than housing, including health, mental health and justice.  However, the increase in homelessness is linked to the collapse in our house building sector and the severe shortage of supply associated with it.  Last year, 4,000 families exited homelessness into secure tenancies.  Unfortunately, the number of people who entered emergency accommodation is greater than the number who left it.  We are working hard to better understand the factors that are driving this increase and responding appropriately.  We have introduced measures such as the special homeless housing assistance payment and the homeless housing assistance payment place finder service, which are available across the country.  We have also significantly extended legal protections for tenants, among a suite of broader measures.  This work will continue.  However, the housing crisis we face can only be understood by reference to the lost decade and the collapse in housing supply.  With a growing population we need at least 25,000 new homes each year in normal circumstances.  The crash of a decade ago destroyed our home building sector and it has not yet recovered.  Approximately 18,000 new homes commenced construction in the past 12 months, which is more than were constructed in any year in the last seven years, but we are still in deficit.  We need to get to approximately 25,000 new homes next year and higher again in 2020.  <\/p><p> Social housing provision is also recovering in tandem with the overall improvements in housing supply.  In 2017, through various mechanisms, over 7,000 homes were added to the social housing stock while a further 40,000 will be added over the next three years.  Project Ireland 2040 provides for 110,000 homes to be added to the social housing stock over the next ten years.  The question of affordability is increasingly pressing.  The average age of a person buying their first home has risen from 28-29 to 35, which means people, particularly couples, are paying rent for six or seven years more than would have been the case in the past or are living with their parents for a prolonged period, neither of which is desirable.  As a Government, it is our desire to make home ownership a realistic objective again for people in their 20s.  Most people do not want or qualify for social housing.  They want to be able to save for and buy their own home.  We need to assist them in doing so.  <\/p><p> The price of zoned, appropriately located land rather than construction costs is the major obstacle to affordability.  We propose to establish a new land development agency, a major part of Project Ireland 2040.  This will be the most decisive intervention by the State in land management since the introduction of land zoning decades ago.  It will ensure that we have a sustainable supply of serviced land for housing at prices that are affordable and in places where housing is needed.  We have learned the lessons of the property boom and crash of the 2000s and we need to ensure it does not happen again.  As a Government, we will not shy away from other actions required to ensure that the aspiration of home ownership is a real one. <\/p><p> I also very much welcome the views of committees on health care.  The priority attached to health by this Government can be seen in the level of expenditure committed.  Over &euro;15 billion is provided for health expenditure in 2018, representing the highest ever level of expenditure and one of the highest per head anywhere in the world.  Currently, Irish health spend is above the OECD average, as has been the case in the past 20 years, including during the recession.  It is obvious that we do not have the health service that this level of spend should provide.  There are too many people waiting too long to see a specialist or for the treatment they need.  While we can, and are, making incremental improvements across the health service - there are many examples of this - the fundamental changes required are beyond the lifetime of any one government.  This is recognised in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which presents a broad framework for the future development of Irish health services.  Shortly, the Government will publish its implementation programme.  This will be complemented by the &euro;10.9 billion infrastructure investment in health care set out in Project Ireland 2040.  This is much needed investment in buildings, equipment and IT, adding to the 114 primary care centres already operating, the three hospitals now under construction, with a fourth to go to tender later this year.<\/p><p>I cannot talk about health without referring to the debate that has dominated recent days and weeks.  Serious questions have been raised about the governance, communications and performance of our health service, and the HSE in particular.  Confidence has once again been severely damaged.  The scoping inquiry into CervicalCheck screening, set up by the Government, will examine the specific issues that arose with respect to CervicalCheck, as well as other screening programmes.  It will specifically examine the issue of non-disclosure.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, has brought plans to Cabinet for mandatory open disclosure.  That will build on reforms we have already made in respect of open voluntary disclosure.  We will shortly bring forward legislation to provide for the appointment of a new HSE board to enhance accountability.<\/p><p> There are many good aspects of our health service and it has achieved many successes in respect of prevention, patient experience and approved outcomes.  That is often lost in the midst of a crisis, such as the one we are now experiencing.  We should find some space to acknowledge that more than 85% of patients say their experience of our health service is good or very good.  Life expectancy is continuing to rise and cancer survival rates are continuing to improve.  We have also had major improvements in areas, such as stroke and cystic fibrosis, CF, as well as reduced charges and increased access to things like free general practitioner, GP, care and prescription charges.<\/p><p> We are also making considerable investment in education.  It is central to our ambitions as a nation.  It breaks down cycles of disadvantage and supports the development of a strong growing economy.  The Government has set the ambitious target of making the Irish education and training service the best in Europe by 2026.  To that end, we have increased the overall education budget to more than &euro;10 billion - the highest ever.  This is only made possible by our prudent economic management.  The investment allowed us to recruit 5,000 extra teachers and 2,000 more special needs assistants over the past two years.  In September 2018, the primary school pupil-teacher ratio will be at its lowest point ever.  We will continue this investment in education in the years ahead.<\/p><p> For the first time in our country's history, we have a long-term plan for the country's future development.  Project Ireland 2040 sets out a vision for how our country can grow in a way that will accommodate expected population growth of 1 million people over the next 20 years.  The Government has set out a long term ambitious planning framework and has backed it up with a ten year national development plan.  The money follows the plan.  We want to achieve balanced regional development by targeting population growth of least 50% in Cork, Limerick and Galway and also population growth centres in Athlone, Letterkenny and Dundalk-Drogheda.<\/p><p> Project Ireland 2040 also sets out how rural Ireland can grow and prosper over the next 20 years with provision for an extra 200,000 people to live in our small towns and villages in rural areas by 2040.  We are also focused as a Government on supporting sustainable rural communities, job creation, culture and tourism, facilitating rural connectivity, access to services and making rural Ireland a good place to live, work, raise a family and set up a business.  We want to ensure that the recovery and growth that Ireland is experiencing is felt evenly throughout the country.  Employment outside of the Dublin region increased by 56,000 and accounted for 84% of the overall national increase in employment between the second quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2017.  Real, on the ground, investment is being delivered locally through a range of schemes and programmes.  Hundreds of communities are benefitting from these investments.  I believe the &euro;1 billion rural development and regeneration fund under Project Ireland 2040 will ensure that Government delivers on its commitment of further strengthening rural economies and communities.<\/p><p> The most decisive intervention the Government will make for rural Ireland is the delivery of our national broadband plan.  It will ensure high speed broadband access to all premises in Ireland regardless of location.  Since this Government came to office, almost 400,000 additional premises have gained access to high speed broadband.  By the end of this year, nearly eight out of ten premises will have access.  The Government is now in a formal procurement process to select a company that will roll out a new high speed broadband network in areas which will not get high speed broadband service from the private sector.  Procurement is now in its final stages and its conclusion and delivery is a Government priority.<\/p><p> Brexit is one issue that I am sure all of the committees have considered because it has the potential to touch on so many aspects of Government policy and the lives of our citizens.  For us, of course, the situation in Northern Ireland is inextricably linked to any discussion on Brexit.  European Council guidelines say that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.  That includes the UK's commitments on the backstop.  We share Prime Minister May's preference to resolve all of these issues through a wider agreement on the EU's future relationship with the UK.  The Government has consistently affirmed its unwavering agreement to the Good Friday Agreement and our determination, as co-guarantor of that Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  We will continue to engage with the British Government to give full effect to that commitment.<\/p><p> I could say much more about the work of each of the committees but I appreciate that I am over time.  I will finish up, hear the thoughts and concerns of the Chairs for the remainder of the meeting and engage with them on those specific issues.  I look forward to continuing the dialogue in this session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WGC2018051000002#A00300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":2065,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.

It is very easy and tempting to assume that the economy is now fixed and that we do not need to be concerned with it any longer and that we should move on to other problems.  I do not know how many times in our history we have made that mistake only for the economy to become unstuck again and fall back into the cycle of cutbacks and tax increases.  We do not want that to happen ever again.  There are risks out there.  I have already mentioned our high public debt, which is among the highest in the western world when it is divided per person.  We need to use this opportunity, while the economy is growing, to balance the budget, perhaps even run small surpluses, and get the debt down so that we are ready for the next downturn, whenever it comes.  It might be ten or 20 years away, but it will come inevitably.  We have to make sure we have the capacity to provide for borrowing when the next recession comes.<\/p> <p>  Brexit is another factor.  It could be soft and slow or hard and chaotic.  It is a big potential risk for our economy.  Other risk factors include rising interest rates.  Huge numbers of people in Ireland have quite expensive mortgages, in terms of the business of loans.  We have had a cycle of unusually low interest rates for quite some time now.  It is inevitable that at some point in the next number of years the ECB will increase interest rates, which will increase the cost of borrowing for businesses and the cost of mortgages.  It will have an impact on how much money is available to spend in the economy.  We have to be wise to all of those things and make sure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.  We cannot engage in pro-cyclical economic policies or adopt the attitude of \"when I have it I spend it\", because when that attitude is adopted one quickly does not have money to spend.  Anything we do in terms of tax cuts, spending increases, pay increases or increases in spending for public expenditure should be sustainable.  There is no point in providing pay increases or tax cuts, or increasing funding for services, only to take that money back in two or three years.  I believe most people would prefer a steady, reliable trajectory than the alternative, which we have experienced a great deal of in recent years.<\/p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare report is very good.  I read it again a couple of weeks ago, alongside the draft of the implementation plan, which exists and which the Government is discussing.  We anticipate that it will be published within the next two months, well before the summer recess.  I do not believe it is correct to see it as a comprehensive action plan to transform our health services.  It certainly has its limitations.  It is more like a blueprint, a plan for a plan rather than a plan in itself.  A number of things have been done towards its implementation already.  The de Buitl&eacute;ir group has been set up to examine the issue of separating public and private practice, how much it would cost and how it could be done.  Again, the report does not provide any solutions.  It just tells us that we should examine it, and that is exactly what we are doing.<\/p> <p>  We have also established the implementation office.  We are in the process of appointing the executive director for the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office.  This is likely to be concluded within weeks, and we will publish the implementation plan around the same time so that the executive director will have a plan to implement.  That plan of action makes sense to me.  The recommendation of Sl&aacute;intecare is to more or less retain the HSE but to slim it down and restore its board.  The Minister has accepted those recommendations and will bring forward that legislation in the next couple of months.  We have also taken steps to reduce prescription charges and increase the number of people with access to free GP care, which are recommendations in the report.  Although we have not published the implementation plan as yet we have taken some measures toward implementing the report.  Another is the allocation of over &euro;10 billion over the next ten years towards investment in ICT, equipment and buildings.  That is part of the transformation fund that the Sl&aacute;intecare report advocates.  <\/p> <p>  There are some things we have to be very careful about doing.  One of the recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare report is that we front-load reducing the cost of access before increasing capacity, that we prioritise making things free before increasing the capacity to deal with patients.  I am not sure that is the correct approach.  I would be concerned that, if we made everything free in the first instance, the health system might be overwhelmed.  Sl&aacute;intecare recommends that the number of people availing of free GP care should be increased by 250,000 a year.  That would mean 250,000 this year, 500,000 next year, and 750,000 within three years.  Do we really believe our GPs could cope with another 750,000 people with free GP care?  We are aware of the increase in attendances that came about with the removal of fees for children under six.  We have to be sensible about how we phase the implementation, and we also have to work out the costings, which has been a real dilemma.  We know, because our health service is inefficient at the moment, that it is costing us almost 7% extra a year just to stand still.  That amounts to &euro;700 million a year just so that we can stand still.  If we go above that it will mean enormous costs.  <\/p> <p>  One of the great advantages of the all-party committees is that they give us all-party reports.  We had reports on housing, water and in healthcare.  However, one of the downsides is that issues are looked at in isolation.  Housing reports would have the Government invest all the State resources in housing and leave nothing for health.  Health reports would have the Government invest all of the resource of the State in health and leave nothing for housing, never mind disability, education or anything else.  We have to look at the bigger picture and consider all the different reports, and try to sequence them in a way that is affordable and deliverable.  The all-party approach only looks at issues in isolation and does not understand the impact of implementing those decisions on every other matter of concern and public policy.<\/p> <p>  On the non-performing loans, whatever happens, the Government, in both its capacity as the Government and as a shareholder, has to be on the side of people who are making an honest effort to pay their mortgages, including split mortgages.  All of those with a split mortgage are making a serious effort to pay their mortgage.  Where people are not making genuine efforts to pay what they owe that is a different matter.  We have vacant houses owned by people who are not paying the mortgage any more, some of who no longer live in the country.  Those houses should be brought back into use.  In some cases repossession will be necessary.  We need to make a real distinction between those who are making a genuine effort to pay the mortgages, the money they owe, and those who are not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WGC2018051000002#D00100","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":2070,"content":"<p>The Committee on Budgetary Oversight is a new committee.

There are a couple of reasons for asking.  We have a significant digital presence in Ireland and there will be a significant gap in EU finances as a result of the UK's departure and the EU may be looking for ways to generate more revenue.  The Taoiseach might address our reliance on it.  It is not necessarily an over-reliance but we are vulnerable to the amount of corporation tax we get from a small number of people.  Approximately 80% of total corporation tax comes from foreign direct investment, FDI.  Approximately 70% of that is from the USA.  It is all welcome.  Approximately half of the FDI generated tax is paid by ten companies.  Google did not exist 20 years ago and we hope it will be here in 20 years.  Industries and companies come and go.

It is early days with this committee but it could have a role to play in the future.  It will never be at the level of the budgetary committee that exists in US Congress, for example.  That is a different system but the committee can have an enhanced role in helping us to form budgets and examine them afterwards.<\/p><p>There are mixed views as to whether we should stick with the annual budget but we will for now.  I often wonder if it is maybe too dramatic to only make major financial decisions once a year.  However, we make adjustments to different extents throughout the year.  Next year, an additional &euro;2.6 billion has been built in because of the announcement we made in Project Ireland 2040 that there would be a 25% increase in capital spending next year on housing, health, transport and so on.  Some &euro;1.5 billion has been announced.  We announced that when we announced Project Ireland 2040.  When the public sector pay deal was done, spending was announced for future years.  Some &euro;400 million is built in for pay restoration next year because of the deal that was done with trade unions.  Some other changes will be announced during the year.  The recalculation of the State contributory pension will have a cost next year.  We introduce an annual budget and we make adjustments during the year.  Perhaps they should be made quarterly in a more structured way.  The upside of the annual budget cycle is that it focuses minds.  When adjustments are done quarterly, it is easy to put them off for another quarter.  When there is only one bite of the cherry, particularly with tax and welfare, it focuses minds.  I have been through seven or eight budget cycles as a Minister.  I have seen how it forces people to compromise and make decisions because there is a deadline.  They may be put off if it was done quarterly.  I have an open mind on that.  I know other countries do not do the annual budget the way we do.<\/p><p>On the health service, Deputy Harty is right that we spend &euro;16 billion a year on healthcare, which is among the highest in the world per head.  That is on top of 20 years in which we spent more per head than the average country in the western world.  Even during the recession, we spent more than average per head and now we are spending way more than average per head.  The constant demand for more staff, resources and new buildings certainly cannot be the solution.  It might be part of the solution but it is not the solution on its own.  If that was the solution, it would have worked by now.  The health budget is &euro;3 billion a year higher than it was three years ago.  There has been a huge increase in the budget.  I recall a headline in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>in the run in to the last general election which I took grave offence at.  It is interesting in the context of what we have been talking about over the past few weeks.  The headline was &quot;No plan, no money and no vision&quot;.  Two or three years later, there is a huge amount of money.  We have a vision with Sl&aacute;intecare and we have any number of plans, including national cancer strategies, national maternity strategies, clinical programmes and models of care.  The failure has been to implement them efficiently.  We need to do that now because the worst thing we can do is buy into this idea that we will solve all our problems by continuing to add more money and more staff.  That has not worked.  It might be part of a solution but it is not the solution on its own.<\/p><p>On the HSE board and why we have not done it up until now, we wanted to decide what sort of board it would be.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report says that we should bring back a board but it does not say any more than that - what sort of board it should be, if it should have a non-executive chairman or executive chairman, how it should be constituted and what role it should have.  That is the kind of discussion that has been happening in government over the past few weeks.  We should not go back to the HSE board as it was before it was abolished.  I am not sure that worked well either.  That is the gap.  Sl&aacute;intecare sets out that a HSE board should be set up but does not go any further into what the board should look like, how we should constitute it or what its role should be.  That is what we have been deliberating on for the past while.<\/p><p>It will have to be different to a usual State board.  I see how State boards work.  For small organisations, a board that meets once a month, gets board papers and has an executive trot in in front of it can work.  This is a different type of body.  It has a massive budget of &euro;16 billion with 110,000 staff.  It cannot have the same board as a small agency.  It needs to have more than a meeting once a month with some board papers in front of an executive.  I know what executives are like.  They just get through that meeting and come back next month.  It needs to be something different and will need people who will give it significant time.  It will have to be more than attending a board meeting every month.  We should also not make the mistake of thinking that boards are panaceas to all our problems.  The hepatitis C scandal was the worst in the history of the State, where healthy women and men were infected with hepatitis C or HIV by a State agency.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board oversaw that.  The Portlaoise breast cancer misdiagnosis scandal happened under the Midland Health Board.  We should have a board but let us not make the mistake of thinking it will be the game-changer that some people are making it out to be.<\/p><p>On digital tax and the CCCTB, it is something that the Government just does not support.  It is not in our interest.  Our strong view is that national budgets should be paid for by national taxation and it is the role of member states to set their own taxes in that regard.  Senator Horkan is correct to identify corporation tax as a potential risk.  The European Commission, in its various country-specific reports about Ireland, recognises that as a risk.  In the 2000s, a huge amount of our revenue came from stamp duty.  When the property bubble burst, there was a huge hole in public finances.  A potential risk now is the large amount of corporation tax that we receive from a relatively small number of companies.  If they were to go into loss or fail for some reason, it would result in a serious hit to our revenue.  That is not to say that we should not collect the taxes.  It is still better that those companies are here in Ireland, paying tax, than not here at all, but we need to be wise to that risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WGC2018051000002#E00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":2075,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach and thank members for sticking to their time.

I share the Taoiseach's ambition to have the best education system by 2026 but we have a long way to go.  I am looking for the Taoiseach's views on some of the areas we particularly need to look at.  He mentioned teachers.  We have a crisis in recruiting and retaining teachers at every level, including at the preschool level.  Part of that is down to the pay parity issue.

With Google's decision yesterday, many people feel that the rules relating to this issue have been changed mid-flow.  For this generation, one of the most important pathways for the flow of information regarding any issue is the Internet.  This has been a decision by an international monopoly to a certain extent.

I have a portrait of Se&aacute;n Lemass in my office.  It has returned to the Taoiseach's office.  I think John Bruton had it, and certainly former Fianna F&aacute;il taoisigh had the portrait there as well.  I have it there to remind me of two things.  The first is that it reminds me every day that I am part of a confidence and supply agreement, and to make sure that there is a Fianna F&aacute;il image in my office.  Michael Collins is there too of course.  It also reminds me that Lemass was an enormously progressive Taoiseach.  After an era that was characterised by autarchy, economic war, and very old-fashioned economic ideas like putting tariffs on the import of shoes because we should make our own, he really opened up Ireland to modern industry and investment.  He also had a commitment to education.  We are investing a huge amount of money in education now.  The education budget is &euro;10 billion this year.  For the first time ever, it has exceeded &euro;10 billion.  However, even the richest countries have to make choices.  Even with the education budget increasing every years, it is impossible to do in any one year everything we would like to do.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned pay parity.  I imagine she would also like extra staff, as would we.  She mentioned capitation, and also mentioned investment in school buildings.  Much as we would like to be able to everything in one year, doing all of those things in one year is impractical.  We can either focus on one of those four things, or we can try to spread our resources very thinly and do a little bit in each of those areas every year.  I would be very open to the views of the committee on this.  If members had &euro;10, would they split it into &euro;2.50 towards each of those four areas?  Would they prioritise pay over capitation or buildings over pay?  It would be an interesting challenge for an Oireachtas committee to advise on that because that is the kind of decision the Government actually makes.  The easiest thing in politics is to call for more of everything now.   The hardest thing in politics is to do what the Government has to do, namely, slice up that pie.  It can be sliced in so many different ways.<\/p> <p>  I think we have done relatively well in recruitment.  There are 5,000 more teachers working in our schools than was the case two years ago.  That has been a big increase in numbers.  We have been able to recruit them.  In some subjects there are particular difficulties.  There are also difficulties with substitution.  Overall, however, the fact that we have recruited 5,000 teachers in two years speaks for itself.  The starting salary for teachers, if they can get a full-time job, is &euro;37,000 a year now.  That is a pretty competitive salary for somebody who is just out of college and starting work for the first time.  Some will have had careers before that but most will not.  In the private and the public sector, a starting salary of &euro;37,000 is pretty competitive.<\/p> <p>  I know that what offends teachers the most is that over the course of their careers, because of the two different pay scales, they stand to lose a lot of money.  We have already managed to narrow that gap by about 75%, and we are willing to narrow it more.  I can certainly understand why two teachers sitting beside each other in the staff room on two different pay scales would have a problem with that.  I would probably have a problem with it too.  We would have a problem with it here in the D&aacute;il if we told Deputies elected next time that they should be on a different pay scale.  It is something that we want to negotiate with the unions on.  Some &euro;400 million is provided for pay increases in the public service next year.  That is a lot of money.  That is just for pay increases.  It is not going to get us anything in extra staff or hours worked.  It is just going into pay.  Perhaps we can, by agreement, recalibrate that in some way in order that more of it goes to the new entrant public servants who were recruited after 2011.<\/p> <p>  Last year, for example, a lot of public servants, if not most, got three pay increases; two small 1% pay increases and an increment.  Maybe instead of three pay increases a year for everyone, it might just be one or two.  We could give the extra money to the new entrants, to allow them to equalise sooner.  What I would not like to do is take the money out of services.  I think the right approach would be to try to negotiate some way to use that &euro;400 million differently to benefit the newer entrants.  <\/p> <p>  On the MFF and the EU budget, these come into effect in 2021 so there is going to be a long negotiation between now and then.  There are also a number of variables, particularly concerning the UK and whether it ends up paying in any way into the EU budget for the various programmes it is going to access and so on.  There are couple of ideas as to how we can increase income for the European Union.  The view of the Government - I have articulated this on a number of occasions - is that we would be willing to increase our contribution to the EU budget provided the areas that we believe are important are protected.  That includes the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the single farm payments in particular.  It includes things such as research and development, Horizon 2020 and INTERREG.  It also includes a lot of different programmes that we think are hugely valuable and Structural Funds.  Those negotiations will go on for a couple of years, but certainly for one.  Our opening position is that member states should be willing to contribute a bit more so that we can protect those well-functioning programmes like CAP.  That is our opening position.  However, if there are going to be cuts in CAP at all, I think it is the single farm payment and the payments to farmers that we should protect.  We can make up for the rural development side, the second pillar, with national resources if we need to.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's question, Facebook's decision to no longer allow advertising in respect of the referendum that is paid for from outside this country is welcome.  There is a general principle that foreign money should not be used to influence our elections and referendums, and I welcome the fact that Facebook has made this decision.  Google's decision went further than I thought it would.  I was a little surprised that the company decided not to host any ads at all from either side, or from anywhere, on the referendum.  However, that is ultimately their decision.  Google is a private company, and like any private company, whether it is a newspaper or a website, it can refuse ads if it wants to.  Nobody is forced to accept advertising through their radio station, TV station, cinema or publication.  That is the right they have.  There has not been any contact between the Government and Google or Facebook on this.  The decisions have been made of their own volition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WGC2018051000002#F00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":2081,"content":"<p>I welcome the news that Se&aacute;n Lemass is featuring in the Taoiseach's' office.

One of the ironic things about Brexit is that in leaving the European Union the United Kingdom will walk out of all of these really good trade deals and have to negotiate deals on its own from a position of weakness because it is only an economy of 60 million people and will have much less negotiating power when negotiating with China or any other part of the world.<\/p> <p>  The Mercosur countries are big growing economies and Ireland, particularly the services sector, would really benefit from a free trade agreement.  We have particular sensitivity in the case of beef, on which I have focused extensively in my conversations with the Commissioner and the Commission President.  It is a sensitivity France also shares.  We have a strong ally in France and are insisting on there being no diminution in standards.  Standards need to be up to ours and a limited quota of beef should be allowed in.  In recent months very little progress has been made on this issue and it may well be the case that no deal will be concluded.  We are heading into electoral cycles in South America also.  There was pressure on us a few months ago to relax our position in order that a deal could be made before the South American electoral cycle started.  Ireland and France held the line and made it very clear that while we wanted a free trade agreement, we needed to ensure the beef sector, a very sensitive sector for Ireland and France, would be protected.  We will hold to that position.  I know the impact throughout the country.  As Deputy Pat Deering knows better than I do, it affects much more than beef farmers.  The beef industry flows from it.  It is a really important part of the rural economy in many parts of the country.<\/p> <p>  The Standards in Public Office Commission has its remit and statutory role and I would not presume to tell it what to do.  I am sure it will follow its statutory remit.  If it comes to setting rules, the question I would ask is what rules would we set.  The Internet and social media are new, but it is just a new medium.  Why would the rules be fundamentally different?  A radio or television station or a newspaper that is privately owned can decide whether it wants to accept advertisements.  Why would we have a different rule for Internet companies?  If we were to apply a rule across the board - it would have to apply across the board - the Oireachtas or the Government would be stating to newspapers, television stations, radio stations, cinemas, billboard companies and Internet companies that they would have to accept advertisements.  I do not think I would do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WGC2018051000002#G00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":2088,"content":"<p>The next three speakers are Deputy Mary Butler, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation; Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport; and Deputy John Curran, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WGC2018051000002#G00500","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":2089,"content":"<p>In recent months the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation has been carrying out an extensive engagement with stakeholders on the cost of doing business.

The rising cost of business crops up frequently when I meet business people.  Obviously costs are passed on to customers and insurance is a significant cost.  The approach we took with car insurance and health insurance has largely worked.  The cost of health insurance stabilised following a significant increase and is starting to fall again.  The same applies to car insurance.  The Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, is heading up the group that is trying to take a similar approach to public liability insurance and insurance for businesses.  Using the same approach, we can get good results.<\/p> <p>  I have not seen the report on community banking yet, although I know it is pending.  I cannot give an insight into the report as I have not seen it.  We have heard all of the pros but not all the cons yet.  I look forward to seeing the report as soon as possible.  Community banking is an attractive model but, not having seen the report, I would not like to comment on it too much.<\/p> <p>  On commuter delays, I explained this morning that I did not travel in the direction we discussed but traffic was definitely heavy.  Accidents sometimes have an impact on the entire city.  Deputy O'Dowd is correct that if we dealt with accidents and collisions more quickly we would relieve congestion.  Delays are often the result of rubbernecking, which is not to diminish the seriousness of some accidents.  Often, when one has sat in traffic for a long time, one suddenly realises that the delay has been caused by people slowing down to take a look and see what was going on.  I wonder if there are examples in other countries of how to remove the distraction more quickly to avoid congestion.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the bigger picture, investment in public transport will be necessary, in the cities in any case.  There is no room for more roads and more roads would just mean more cars.  What is required is a combination of better planning, higher density developments near public transport and major investment in public transport.  Without the economic crisis, we would have been much further along with Transport 2021.  We have revived half of the programme and we can get complete that in the period ahead. <\/p> <p>  Defined benefit pensions are a difficult issue.  I do not believe there are any new defined benefit pension schemes, most of which were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s when assumptions made about retirement, life expectancy and work were different.  Generally, in the 1960s and 1970s, people had one employer for their entire life.  Even as recently as the 1970s, life expectancy was 68 years for men 72 years for women.  All of these defined benefit schemes were largely built on the premise that members would work for the same company for 30 or 40 years and would be retired for two, three or four years.  This false premise is fundamentally at the heart of the problem with defined benefit pension schemes.  As those assumptions were wrong, not enough was paid in down the years either by the employer or the employees.  This has given rise to a large deficit in a many pension funds, although I am aware that some are still in surplus and well funded.<\/p> <p>  We are struggling with the legislation at the moment and we have had drafts.  We are trying to change the law to make it much harder for companies or employers to suddenly and unilaterally act by deciding to close down a pension fund.  That includes trustees having to give greater notice to employees and members that they intend making changes to the pension fund, and also giving enhanced powers to the Pensions Authority to intervene and settle disputes.  We are struggling with the whole concept of a debt on an employer, under which an obligation to close the gap would be imposed on the employer.  While that could be of benefit to people who are about to retire, it could have serious consequences for people who are in their 30s, 40s and 50s and still working for the company in question because some companies would be crippled if they were required to close this gap.  Some would close and, as a consequence, people would lose their jobs.  Others would have such a large debt added to their balance sheet that they would have to abandon their plans for expansion or development.  They would be totally hobbled in their activities and would no longer be able to compete against their competitors.  Striking the right balance is proving to be a struggle.  While we want to ensure people's pensions are protected, we do not want to do so at the expense of doing what has happened so often in the past when the ladder was pulled up on those who were not just about to retire.  They could lose their jobs, their employers could go bust or the companies could be unable to invest further because their balance sheet would be destroyed.  We are struggling to strike the right balance.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WGC2018051000002#H00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":2094,"content":"<p>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Business, Employment and Innovation is keeping a watchful eye on Brexit, particularly the response by enterprise agencies.

Last Friday afternoon, I visited the Port of Waterford, which only ships goods to mainland Europe.  It does not ship to the United Kingdom.

It is not often one hears about advantages but the Port of Waterford Company believes its business may grow as a result of Brexit and there may be no negative impact from Brexit because the port does not ship directly to the UK.

The average speed on the M1 ranges between 90 km\/h and 100 km\/h, regardless of the time of day, which is a significant issue that we must address.

Once the Government published the heads of the scheme and we completed Second Stage of the Bill, a vacuum was generated.  In other words, the Government has shown its hand and shown us what it plans for the future yet there is no delivery or protection.  That happened in the summer of last year.  At the start of this year, I specifically mentioned Irish Life because the company is in surplus, yet there is no protection for all of the people concerned.  Had the legislation been dealt with effectively, the issue facing the employees in question on 30 June next could have been addressed.  The Taoiseach was correct that a diminishing number of people are members of a defined benefit pension scheme but that does not mean we should not look after them.

There are a lot of supports available, including access to low-cost finance for small businesses.  When I met businesses representatives some weeks ago, they asked us to stop giving out so much about SMEs not preparing for Brexit.  That was something I had not expected them to say.  They were not giving out about the committees but about the Government.  They asked that we stop telling them to prepare for Brexit.  They asked how they could prepare for it when they did not yet really know what it would mean.  I have some sympathy for them because it is very hard to prepare until we know the shape Brexit will take and what the new trading relationship will be.  If a small business trades with the United Kingdom, it can map out on paper some contingencies such as looking at other markets, but it is very hard to prepare for a new set of rules until one knows what they will be.  That is why it is so important first to agree the terms of the transition agreement in order that business will know that there will be no changes until 1 January 2021.  We are working hard to try to develop a new relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union that will involve as few changes as possible, in which case businesses will not need to do much at all by way of preparation.  I have, however, a lot of sympathy for SMEs because we are always telling them to \"get prepared\".  They ask for what exactly they are to prepare and how can they prepare until they see what the new rules will be.<\/p><p> I did not know that Port of Waterford traffic only moves to and from continental Europe.  I have been to the port and Belview on a few occasions, with reference to my previous role in the area of transport.

I am open to the idea, but I imagine that Deputy Hildegarde Naughton's committee would be able to do that work.  I am, however, open to the suggestion of establising a special committee if Members believe there should be a discrete committee.  As the Deputy's committee covers the issue of climate change, I imagine that it could do just as well.  I have looked at the report of the Citizens' Assembly on climate change and it is a good one.  I am also conscious that the assembly very much followed its terms of reference.  It was asked how we could make Ireland a leader in tackling the issue of climate change.  As I said, like all-party committees, when one looks at something in isolation, one comes up with a particular set of solutions.  The Citizens' Assembly absolutely set out how we could become a leader in tackling the issue of climate change.  If the terms of reference had been different - for example, if the Citizens' Assembly had been asked to consider how Ireland could become a leader in tackling the issueof climate change without impacting negatively on employment in rural areas - we might have had a different set of recommendations.  All of the recommendations made by the assembly would improve our response to climate change, but some of them would also have negative consequences.  For example, increasing the carbon tax would certainly increase the level of poverty.  We know this because that is what all of the studies show.  Taxing farmland would have an impact on the rural economy and so on.  There is always a down side to these things.  However, the Citizens' Assembly has produced a really good report which shows how Ireland could become a leader in tackling climate change, but it did not look at other stuff such as how to avoid increasing the level of poverty and impacting negatively on the rural economy, including employment and trade.  The role of the Government and the Oireachtas is to look at things in the round, not in isolation.  Project Ireland 2040 includes some very important statements on what we intend to do about climate change to meet our 2030-50 targets.  Members will be aware that from next year new buses added to the fleet will be low emission vehicles.  From 2025 coal will be removed from the grid and the Moneypoint power station will move to using a cleaner fuel.  Peat will also be removed from the grid.  In 2030 there will be a ban on the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles.  Subsequent to that report, the Government has indicated very strongly where it intends to go in the next couple of years.  However, we always need to be mindful of the other consequences of any policy change.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Ireland's overseas development aid contribution, the Government understands Ireland will increase the figure to 0.7% of GNP by 2030.  We have a long way to go in that regard.  We were almost there before the financial crisis when we were at a figure of nearly 0.5% or 0.6%.  It is now just below 0.3%.  A lot of it has to do with Ireland's GNP going up, even though we have been increasing the overseas development aid budget, in cash terms, in the past few years.<\/p><p>We will do so again next year because our GNP is increasing even faster.  We are falling behind slightly, as we have worked out that if we did want to get to 0.7% of GNP by 2030 we would need to increase the budget by approximately &euro;150 million a year every year between now and 2030, and &euro;150 million is a lot of money given the various demands that are on us from all sorts of other sectors, not least health, housing and disability.  That is something we will have in the mix for the next budget.  It is something I really want to do.  It is part of what we should do as a small country as good global citizens.  If we are ever going to deal with some of the major security problems we face around the world, or problems linked to issues such as mass migration, we have to reduce the push factors.  It is the right thing to do but being able to find the money will be a real challenge.  If Britain, Norway and the Netherlands can do it surely we can do it too.<\/p><p> On childhood obesity, it is a while since I updated myself on what we are doing, but there are things people are aware of already.  There is the sugar tax which has just come into play and the Healthy Ireland programme, which is designed to encourage people, not least children, to have healthier lifestyles.  Expanding PE in schools is very important.  It has been brought in as a proper subject for the leaving certificate for the first time.  There is ongoing investment not just in sports capital but also in sports facilities in communities and in participation.  When we fund the sporting bodies we always make sure that we ring-fence some money for participation so it does not all go into the high-performance programmes and the elite athletes.  It is also for participation.<\/p><p> Another piece of legislation I know is on the way is on calorie posting, which is putting on menus what the calorie content of food is.  It is remarkable when we see this in action.  I have seen it in action in some places throughout the world.  The meal one thinks has a lot of calories in it often does not.  I often tell the story of the restaurant in Miami and the day I decided to order the burger instead of the Caesar salad.  I did not realise there were so many calories in Caesar salad but there are.  These days salads are largely sauce delivery systems rather than salads at all.  It will help people a lot.<\/p><p> I also think we need to be wise to the issue of parental responsibility.  I know there are enormous social determinants and social risk factors, but we should not entirely let parents off the hook.  Parents do have responsibility for their children and exercise can be free.  Although it is difficult, even on a relatively low income one can eat healthily, and people did for centuries on much lower incomes than we have now.  It has to be a combination of Government measures but we should not allow parents to avoid responsibility either.<\/p><p> On the cybersafety report, I have to confess I have not read it yet.  I do have it because Deputy Farrell gave it to me, but I have not had a chance to read it yet with a lot of other things going on over the past couple of weeks, but I will definitely read it.

I presume the Taoiseach does not have any particular legislation in mind for the moment with regard to the 0.7% of gross national income.<\/p> <p>  Another suggestion that we put forward in our report was in the area of improving policy coherence.  We have asked the Government to develop a cross-departmental plan of action as recommended by the OECD.  That would help to ensure better co-ordination and better coherence of development policy across Government.  There is good work going on in the transfer of knowledge in food production, animal husbandry and crop husbandry.  More Departments, agencies and sectors can contribute to overseas development aid in different ways.  I saw the transfer of knowledge in Mozambique and Malawi with regard to the growing of potatoes and dealing with crop difficulties.

It is very much a cross-departmental report, which I feel deserves consideration at the appropriate time.<\/p> <p>  With regard to childhood obesity, I welcome the Taoiseach's response.  There are a number of approaches that will have to be taken in the coming years.  We have had incredible drop-offs in sport participation as the Taoiseach knows as a former Minister in that field not to mention as a medical doctor.  He knows there are significant issues at play in terms of young people participating in sport and-or eating healthily.  It is something that whether we deal with it now or plan to increase budgets in the Department of Health in future we will have to deal with it.  It is something that deserves our attention at the appropriate time.

I know a sports monitor is produced every year and at least for a while it had been increasing by approximately 1% a year, but perhaps young people drop off from it as they hit teenage years, which is definitely a big problem particularly among girls who have relatively high participation rates when they are young but in their teenage years very often drop out of sport.  This is part of what the whole women in sport participation programme is about.<\/p> <p>  On overseas development aid, I think the UK only brought in legislation after it had met the target.  I could be wrong about this, but I think I am correct in saying it met the target and then brought in legislation to make sure it did not fall below it.  I am reluctant to bring in legislation that would require meeting a target.  We would be tying our hands on budgetary decisions and it would have a precedent effect.  I imagine there are other areas of spending where people would also like the same.  Then it would be a case of what we leave out and what is so unimportant that it does not deserve similar legislation.  That would be difficult to do.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely agree with the point on capacity building.  I have had some experience as I had a short placement with Voluntary Service Overseas, VSO, in Mongolia a couple of years ago.  So much of what can be best achieved when it comes to development is not the traditional aid and humanitarian relief, which is necessary, but capacity building.  I know that particular organisation took the view that the best thing that could be done is not send young people off in their gap year to spend a year in Africa, Asia or a poor part of a country but send somebody who has 30 years experience as a teacher or in running a business.  The best people to be sent overseas to add and build capacity in developing countries are those who have a life of experience and not those who are just out of college.  I am sure there is room for both but that makes sense, as does having people stay for a prolonged period and not just short visits.<\/p><p> On Deputy Naughton's question on scrutiny, I admit that I do not think it is committees that are holding up legislation.  I may be wrong about that because line Ministers are dealing with legislation every day rather than me.  If there are delays in legislation, it is more on the Government side, namely, between Departments and the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  We have been a bit slow to get legislation drafted.  It seems to take a long time to get heads written up even though they are very simple and it then takes a long time again between heads and the publication of a Bill.  I have asked the Secretary General to examine whether there are ways to speed up the process given the significant delays in getting legislation to the point where it is published as a Bill.

We have a substantial problem in relation to money messages for Private Members' Bills.  We have highlighted this repeatedly and, through the office of the Ceann Comhairle, directly with the Taoiseach.  It is creating an inordinate delay and difficulty in scheduling the business of the committee.  We have even had a situation where we had been advised a money message was not required, scheduled a Bill for address and, on almost the eve of the debate, been notified that it had been re-evaluated and that a money message was required.

I am doing my best although I have a long way to go.  It is fine when one is prepared, knows what the questions will be and what one will say.  I find it very hard to speak on the hoof however and as yet lack the confidence to do a dynamic interview in Irish without knowing the questions in advance.  Certainly, I will have to check up on the action plan on which I am not up-to-date.  I will get back to the Deputy on that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Carey asked about the rural fund, which we hope to be able to approve tomorrow at the Cabinet meeting in Monaghan along with the urban regeneration fund so that they can be opened to applications this summer to allow us to allocate money by the end of the year for drawdown next year.  When people hear of Ireland 2040 and the ten-year capital plan, they can think it means it is for ten or 20 years' time.  That is not the case.  It will be finished but it starts right away.  We want to be able to open applications this summer and start to make allocations before the end of the year to allow people to draw down the funds next year.  Those funds will be front-loaded rather than back-loaded and we are keen to have it up and running as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  There are two issues when it comes to money messages and Private Members' Bills.  Sometimes, there is a dispute about whether a money message is required, but very often there is no dispute and money is required.  I cannot issue a money message unless the money has been budgeted.  Where money has not been budgeted, it is impossible to issue a money message.  There is also the matter of the quality of the legislation coming through.  I have mentioned before that Senator Nash, I think, pointed out that some of the legislation coming through could have been written on the back of a menu.  Before Government legislation gets to Second Stage, it goes through a very convoluted process.  It requires heads and the drafting of a Bill in consultation with the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It must then be published and there will probably be a two week delay before it is on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Private Members' Bills of both Government and Opposition Members can be published literally on a Friday and have the D&aacute;il take it on Second Stage the next week.  That is not right either.  That is why it gets stuck at committees; it is because the due diligence was not done before it even got to the D&aacute;il to determine whether it was quality legislation, constitutional or in conflict with European law.<\/p> <p>  There is a discussion under way, led by the Ceann Comhairle, to find a solution, but it will have to involve a greater role for the Oireachtas, his office or committees in ensuring that legislation does not get to Committee Stage until it is fit to be there.  A report was carried out by Aidan Dunning, a former Secretary General, who made a large number of recommendations but unfortunately they were not accepted by the Business Committee.  If they had been, we would have solved the problem.  In the absence of that being acceptable to the Business Committee, we are looking for an alternative solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WGC2018051000002#L00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":2117,"content":"<p>I had no reluctance in praising the Taoiseach's efforts with the Irish language and no intention of embarrassing him.  He has done wonderfully.  While his personal effort is an example to everyone, my question is on the need for urgent action on the Irish language.

Indeed, I had the privilege to award more than 40 certificates recently to members of various Departments who made a great effort on the Irish language.  However, we need from Government an action plan for the 20-year strategy and confirmation that money is available for the implementation of the language plans in preparation on a voluntary basis all over the Gaeltacht and in different cities and towns.  There is a crisis.  As Chairman of the Irish language committee, I note that we were in the position of having the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before us, none of whose representatives could speak Irish.  The way we had to conduct that process was surreal.  I ask the Taoiseach to provide leadership from Government on a practical level.  That can be done very easily.

I usually see drafts a couple of weeks or months before a document is published or goes to Cabinet.  I will raise the matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, when I see him tomorrow.<\/p> <p>  I am encouraged by the growth of Irish language education, including the increasing numbers of Gaelscoileanna and also Gaelchol&aacute;iste.  My constituency will soon have its first ever Gaelchol&aacute;iste, which is now under construction.  This is a positive development.  We also have Bliain na Gaeilge.  Overall, the number of people speaking Irish daily outside education is not increasing and is probably falling, which is a matter of real concern.<\/p> <p>  What struck me recently during my visit to the Choctaw Indians as part of my visit to America during St. Patrick's day is that their language is almost gone now.  There are only 50 or 60 native speakers left.  I met an older woman who will probably be one of the last native speakers of Choctaw.  We all know the phrase, \"T&iacute;r gan teanga, t&iacute;r gan anam\" or \"A country without a language is a country without a soul.\"  It hit me during my visit how important it is to hold on to the unique aspects of one's culture and identify.  I visited Louisiana recently on my second trip to New Orleans.  I visited the state as a student and made a return trip briefly over Easter.  I remember 20 years ago that people spoke French parts of Louisiana.  That is not really the case any longer because they have been overwhelmed by English.  I am sure French is spoken in certain parts but not in the way it was, even in my lifetime.  What really strikes a person is how important it is not to allow that to happen to our language.  I will follow up on the action plan.<\/p> <p>  I only heard this morning about the decision by Apple not to proceed with a data centre in Athenry.  While it is a highly regrettable decision, it is not surprising given the inordinate delays in the process and the fact that the company has since built data centres in Denmark instead.  I guess Apple does not need the Athenry project any longer.  However, that does not mean another company will not use the site.  We will certainly have discussions with Apple about the possibility of selling the site to another company that might use it as a data centre in future.  The decision is a major blow to Athenry and the west in general.  The biggest single public investment in the west in recent years was the Gort to Tuam motorway, which cost the best part of &euro;500 million.  The proposed data centre was to be the biggest private sector investment and it is highly regrettable that the project will not proceed.<\/p> <p>  I would not like anyone to think the delays in Athenry are typical.  There are data centres all over the country.  Google and Amazon have data centres in Clare, west Dublin and south Dublin and those projects did not get stuck in inordinate planning delays.  It would not be correct for us or people outside the country to believe that what happened in Athenry is typical as it is not.  There are definitely steps we can take to ensure this does not happen again.  We have already made the decision to make data centres part of strategic infrastructure to enable them to go through fast-track planning and straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As Galway County Council rightly pointed out to me, it was not the cause of delays.  The proposal moved through the council planning process and An Bord Plean&aacute;la quite quickly but got stuck in the courts.  It seem to be too easy to commence a judicial review.  I am not sure if Senator McDowell will agree with me but it seems to be terribly easy to secure a judicial review and subsequently follow up with further appeals.  Mr. Justice Peter Kelly is heading up a working group to determine whether we can find solutions to that.  We have a solution on the planning side and we are seeking a solution on the court side.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's comments on committee reports, I will follow up after the meeting if Minister's are not producing, within three months, reasoned line-by-line responses to recommendations made in committee reports rather than letters thanking the relevant Chairman and committee members for producing their report.  I would be disturbed if that was not happening.  The Minister must indicate what the Department is doing, what it will do and what recommendations it has accepted or not accepted.  He or she must set out the reasons in each case and if it is not happening, it should be happening.  I will definitely follow up on this matter if such responses are not issuing.  That is what is supposed to happen and was happening for a while.  It is not that hard to do.  A response cannot be expected overnight but is reasonable to expect a reasoned response within three months.<\/p> <p>  We can also follow up on the issue of agencies replying to correspondence.  Again, while an agency may not be able to reply to a committee Chairman or members immediately, particularly if the issue is complicated, one would expect an agency to issue a proper response within six weeks.

One of the things that is positive when it comes to mental health is that the stigma about talking about it has largely gone away.  People are willing to talk about mental health in a way that was not the case ten or 20 years ago.  I think that is down to the work the committee has done and the work that so many other people have done in this space, which really has made a huge difference.<\/p> <p>  The funding that goes into mental health has gone up by &euro;200 million a year since 2011.  There is nearly &euro;1 billion a year going into mental health and that is going to continue.  We have a commitment to continue to increase funding for mental health.  I believe &euro;55 million has been allocated for next year.  Like a lot of things, we need to ensure that additional resources turn into better services and better outcomes.  If we cannot follow where the money is going, then, quite frankly, we have a very serious problem.  That is part of a wider range of reforms we are going to need to see in the health area over the next couple of years.<\/p> <p>  Long ago when we were in opposition, we used to talk about how we needed to have a health service where money followed the patient.  I quickly learned as Minister for Health that we could not follow the money, never mind following the patient.  Some of that is, sadly, down to software.  One needs proper financial systems and ICT, and there has been under-investment in recent years.  A good chunk of the &euro;10 billion investment we have announced under Project Ireland 2040 over the next ten years is for investment in ICT, and this will be really important because it will allow us to follow the patient and the money through the system and bring about real changes.  It is expensive but it is an investment that I believe will be worth it.<\/p> <p>  The health service was very badly burned by the whole personnel, payroll and related systems, PPARS, debacle, and did not invest in ICT for a very long time.  It is extraordinary the extent to which so much of what goes on in our health service is still paper-based.  If I ring Domino's pizza, it can tell from my phone number who I am, what my last order was and what my preferences are.  However, in our health service we are still operating largely on the basis of paper for financial records and patient records and there are consequences as a result of that.  The commitment is there to invest in ICT and there is a very good HSE information plan as to how it is going to do that over the next couple of years.<\/p> <p>  As regards Senator Richmond's comment on bilateral engagements with other Heads of Government and Heads of State and other Ministers, I would say that there have been thousands, if not tens of thousands, of such engagements.  I certainly made it my business to meet one-to-one with every one of my counterparts.  We meet regularly in Brussels and have quick bilaterals but the best ones are when one goes to their capitals or when they come to ours and we spend some time together.  I am slightly more than half-way through doing this.  The same goes for Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, and Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy McEntee.  It is taking up a huge amount of time.  I would say 20% to 25% of the Government's time is taken up with Brexit and Brexit-related issues.  This is necessary because it is such a big issue which will impact on our society and economy in so many different ways.  It is also a huge opportunity cost.  If it was not for that decision of the British people to leave the European Union, all that time could be spent on the many other many pressing problems the country faces.  That is just the way it has to be for the next little while.<\/p> <p>  I certainly appreciate the engagement that happens beyond Government.  The different party leaders are plugged into their parliamentary groups - Deputy Howlin through the socialist group; Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin through the liberal group; and Deputy Eamonn Ryan through the Greens.  They have been very useful and helpful in talking to their counterparts, some of whom are either Prime Ministers or opposition leaders, about Brexit.  The engagement by the parliamentarians and by the different committees has been really useful as well and needs to continue.<\/p> <p>  Brexit, while being a huge issue and a really big deal for a small number of countries in the European Union, for the vast majority of countries in the European Union, it does not affect them very much.  For the Baltic countries, Hungary or Greece, it is not on page 20 of the papers, never mind the front pages.  We have to sensitise our counterparts in all those countries as to how big an issue this is for them.  When I speak to counterparts in the Baltic countries, for example, they come to the conclusion that this is as big an issue for us as Russia is for them.  When they begin to understand it on that level, they get it because they understand how important that solidarity is.  This is the one thing that we really need them to have our backs on and we will have their backs on other issues.  When one arrives at that level of understanding, I believe it puts one in a strong position.<\/p> <p>  The data centres use a lot of electricity.  That will obviously have an impact on meeting our commitments on climate change.  I would hope that a lot of that electricity could be provided by renewable sources, but I am told it is not as simple as that.  What I definitely know is that there is going to be more data in the world, and data centres have to be somewhere.  Does it not make sense that they be in Ireland, or at least in a place where the energy use is less than might be the case in a country where they might need to be cooled down or heated up?  We seem to have the right climate for them.  Similar arguments would apply in areas like beef, for example.  Senator Horkan talked about the risk of relying so much on a number of big companies for tax receipts and for employment, whether it is Google, Facebook, Twitter or one of those technology companies.  The fact that they have their data here is important too.  Modern technology companies are pretty footloose, but when they keep their data in a particular country, it anchors them more to it.  I believe that strategically, for those reasons, it is something that should be welcome.<\/p> <p>  We have finished, or we are about to finish, a cross-Government policy.

We spoke earlier about how Se&aacute;n Lemass was progressive.  I really believe the Taoiseach is progressive too.  He needs to ask hard questions and take a hard look at broken and cancerous systems.  The lack of urgency being shown by the HSE in looking at mental health services for children is very worrying.  Such services are not on the cliff - they have actually fallen over it.  The HSE's lack of urgency has resulted in the chronic and sometimes fatal neglect of children.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider forming a task force to identify the needs of each of the child and adolescent mental health services and to implement the solutions that are required.  If things keep going as they are at the moment, nothing will get resolved.  If the Taoiseach does not do something serious now, HSE mental health services for children will lurch from election to election without being changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WGC2018051000002#O00200","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":2145,"content":"<p>I hear what the Senator is saying.

If I knew that it would work, of course I would want to do it.
