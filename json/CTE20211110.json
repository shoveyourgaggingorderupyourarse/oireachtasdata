In line with exceptional circumstances, we have to take measures to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  You are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and you will notice that every second seat has been removed in order to facilitate social distancing.  I urge you not to move any chair from its current position.  You should always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should always be worn during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for full co-operation on this.  Any member participating in the meeting remotely is required to participate from within the Leinster House complex only.  We have received no apologies.<\/p> <p>  We will start by looking at the sick leave Bill.  At present there is no statutory obligation on an employer to pay for a medically certified absence of employee do to illness.  While many employers provide such sick pay, employees who do not receive such sick pay are disadvantaged.  We know this may encourage such employees to attend for work even though they are ill.  In the context of the current public health situation in particular, this very undesirable.  The proposed Bill will provide for the creation of an entirely new right to sick pay, and this will be legally enforceable through the Workplace Relations Commission and the courts.<\/p> <p>  Today we commence our pre-legislative scrutiny of the sick leave Bill 2021.  In referring the Bill to the committee, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment stressed the urgency of the proposal and has asked that we prioritise consideration of it.  I anticipate the committee will need to devote a number of meetings to the matter to properly consider it, and I am happy we can facilitate that now.  We only received this Bill last week and we have prioritised it.  We are happy to start the pre-legislative scrutiny today.<\/p> <p>  To assist the committee in its consideration of the sick leave Bill, I would like to welcome from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment Ms Clare Dunne, Ms Wendy Gray and Mr. Paul Norris.  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  <\/p> <p>  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that you should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if your statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, you will be directed to discontinue your remarks.  It is imperative you comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  As members are aware, the opening statement from the Department has been circulated to all members.  To commence our consideration of this matter today, I invite Ms Dunne to make opening remarks on behalf of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members for their invitation to attend the committee today to discuss the sick leave Bill 2021.  I welcome the opportunity to do so and thank the committee for facilitating pre-legislative scrutiny on this important matter.  As the Chair said, my name is Clare Dunne, and joining me today are Ms Wendy Gray and Mr. Paul Norris from the employment rights policy unit in the Department.<\/p> <p>  In June of this year, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, obtained Cabinet approval for the priority drafting of the sick leave Bill 2021.  Ireland is currently one of the few advanced countries in Europe and beyond to not provide for a mandatory employer sick pay scheme, although many employers provide sick pay through company or sectoral level agreements.<\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste said many times recently that he believes one of the legacies of the pandemic must be better terms and conditions for all employees.  This Bill will ensure that every worker, especially lower paid workers in the private sector, have the security and peace of mind of knowing that if he or she falls ill and misses work, he or she will not lose out on a day&rsquo;s pay.<\/p> <p>  The Government introduced an enhanced illness benefit of &euro;350 a week for anyone who was off sick as a consequence of Covid-19, but the T&aacute;naiste is determined now to make sure all workers have a safety net, regardless of the illness in question, once it is certified by a medical doctor. <\/p> <p>  Prior to seeking cabinet approval to draft the Bill, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment undertook a full public consultation that sought the views of relevant stakeholders and members of the public on key policy questions around the design of the scheme.  In total, 118 submissions were received with a good mix of views from business and employee representative bodies and from individual workers and employers.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the public consultation the Department undertook an international review to get a better understanding of how sick leave schemes operate elsewhere.  What we learned from that is there is no one-size-fits-all model, and there are significant variations in the models in use across the world.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the key parameters, the sick leave Bill 2021 will introduce a right, initially, to three paid sick leave days per annum for all employees.  The scheme will increase incrementally over time so that all employees will eventually be entitled to ten days, or two weeks, of sick pay per year.  The operation of the plan will be reviewed at regular intervals, beginning after the first 12 months of operation.  The initial plan is as follows: in year one, three days will be covered; in year two, five days will be covered; in year three, seven days will be covered; and in year four, ten days will be covered.  This will be in addition to any other leave such as annual leave, parental leave, or maternity or paternity leave.  It will be for both full-time and part-time employees and no waiting days will apply.<\/p> <p>  While the entitlement of three days per annum is relatively modest, it is important to recognise the cost that this scheme will place on employers, particularly small employers with very few staff members.  It is being phased in to help employers, particularly small businesses, to plan ahead and manage the additional cost.<\/p> <p>  Some businesses in the service sectors will have to cover not only the cost of sick pay but may have also have the cost of paying for a replacement while the person is out sick.  Many businesses are struggling to get back on their feet at the moment and we need to get the balance right and make sure that we do not go too far too fast and cause companies to reduce staff or cut hours to help with costs.<\/p><p>We have taken a balanced approach to support both workers and employers.<\/p><p> Setting the number at three days has been chosen as a starting point to plug the existing gap in coverage due to the current waiting days not covered by the State&rsquo;s existing illness benefit scheme.  As it stands, an eligible employee cannot claim illness benefit from the State until he or she has completed three waiting days.  By providing for three statutory sick pay days, we will address the issue of people going to work while sick because of financial concerns.<\/p><p>  In terms of the amount of pay, statutory sick pay will initially be paid at 70% of regular earnings up to &euro;110 per day from the first day of illness, and this can be varied by ministerial order.  This cap of &euro;110 has been designed to give employers certainty around the costs involved at the outset, while also being fair to employees and ensuring that they receive an appropriate level of compensation if unable to work due to illness or injury.  For businesses which genuinely cannot afford to pay, we have included an \"inability to pay\" provision which provides for an exemption to be given to a business by the Labour Court.<\/p><p> In relation to entitlement to a payment, any day taken as sick leave under the Act will require a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner.  While this may impose an additional cost on some employees, many low-paid workers, particularly those with children, are entitled to a medical card or GP visit card and will not have to pay to see their doctor.  More than 2 million people have access to a GP without fees in Ireland.<\/p><p> Regarding eligibility, an employee will be required to have worked for his or her employer for a period of three months before he or she is eligible to avail of paid sick leave under the Bill.  This is to allow time for an employment relationship to develop between the employer and employee and is a common requirement in other forms of statutory leave, such as carers or parental leave and in existing company level sick pay agreements.  It is also a common requirement in other jurisdictions that have statutory sick pay in place. <\/p><p> Many companies already offer their own sick pay schemes as part of their terms and conditions and this Bill is not intended to undermine those existing sick pay agreements that may offer more favourable terms overall.  It is primarily intended to act as a floor level protection and ensure that all employees, particularly those employees who currently have no access to a company level scheme, will have an entitlement to paid sick leave when unable to work due to genuine illness or injury. <\/p><p> As with other statutory employment rights, if an individual believes they are being deprived of rights to which he or she is entitled under the sick leave Bill, he or she will be able to refer a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  There the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court.  WRC inspectors may also be asked to investigate certain breaches of the provisions of the Bill once enacted. <\/p><p> The Government has taken a balanced approach in bringing forward the sick leave Bill 2021.  The introduction of a statutory entitlement to paid sick leave with no waiting days is a progressive measure that will bring Ireland in line with its European and other developed country peers.  We have given a lot of consideration to the pressures on business at the current time, and the design parameters and the incremental approach to be taken over four years are in recognition of this.  <\/p><p> The scheme design achieves a good balance through a cost sharing model, where workers receive 70% pay for the three days, which is a relatively low cost for employers.  It should also provide for a seamless transition to State-supported illness benefit, when appropriate, when the worker applies for it on day four. <\/p><p> While the initial period of three days that an employer is asked to cover is modest, this has been done to close the existing gap in coverage brought about by illness benefit waiting days and in recognition of the unique economic challenges that many employers, particularly microenterprises and small businesses, have faced in the last 18 months and continue to face as we move out of the pandemic.<\/p><p> I must emphasise that the scheme is a first step in the development of a model which can be built on and refined over time as it is rolled out.  The draft legislation has been designed with flexibility in mind.  I thank the Chair and members for their attention and we would be happy to answer any questions they might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dunne.

Any step in the direction of a statutory sick scheme is very welcome, but I have some questions.  How was the decision to require certification arrived at?  I note the reference to people who have access to a GP without cost.  As a State, we do not offer free GP care to many people who have to pay for it.  I have a concern that it will act a disincentive.  I said at the start of the pandemic, and it remains true, that sick pay is an instrument of public health.  Therefore, I am concerned by idea that there would be a financial barrier to accessing it, which does not exist in other states because they have access to free GP care.<\/p> <p>  Would Ms Dunne explain the thinking behind that?  Was consideration given to whether or not this could potentially act as a disincentive?  The purpose of this has to be that when someone feels sick he or she does not go into work.  That protects the person, everybody in the person's workplace and everybody on the bus or the train as the person travels to work.  I am interested to know how that was arrived at and whether consideration was given to bypassing the need for certification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#B00300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  We considered very carefully the need for certified illness, a doctor's certificate.  Following the extensive consultation we undertook, we believe that this is a necessary provision.  It probably would not be reasonable to ask employers to cover uncertified sick leave days.  Down the road there may be company arrangements or local arrangements that will cater for casual sick days or uncertified sick days.  However, what we are trying to do here is to strike a balance and to bring fairness to bear.  The scheme is designed to ensure that workers do not lose out on pay due to genuine certified illness.  When somebody is genuinely sick over a period of several days and he or she is going to be paid by his or her employer, we believe that it is reasonable that the employer has an assurance that it is a genuine illness that has been certified by a medical doctor.  It is also a current requirement in order to be able access the State's illness benefit, and it is also a requirement in many of the sectoral and company level arrangements that exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I understand that barriers still exist for workers on a low income.  Where you are talking about places where statutory sick or where an entitlement to sick leave already exists, you are in general talking about unionised employment where there are collective agreements.  As a general rule, we all know the wages there are going to be higher.  Those of us who are members of trade unions will have benefited from this.  The likelihood is you will earn more money, be better paid and have better conditions.  Therefore we are not really comparing like with like if we are talking about low-income workers.<\/p> <p>  I have a genuine concern about this acting as a disincentive.  The employer needs to be assured it is a genuine illness, but what happens if you are genuinely broke?  You are going into work, which defeats the entire purpose of this.  The purpose of this has to be that if you are sick, you stay at home, you protect yourself, you protect all the people on the bus and you protect all the people in your workplace.  I have a concern about that.  In the case of low-income workers I think it will act as a disincentive to them availing of provisions of this scheme if they do not have access to &euro;60 to go to the doctor, which is what it costs.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the service requirement for three months.  Again, I fully understand the requirement for service and the fact that it exists in other employment, but three months seems like a long time.  I am concerned that if you were using a succession of three-month contracts, you could end up in a situation whereby somebody would not be able to avail of the scheme for a good chunk of the year.  Is there is a protection against an employer issuing contracts to ensure they will not have to meet this requirement?  I obviously read this but I did not see such protection there.<\/p><p>I understand that legislation on fixed-term contracts exists and that, eventually, workers will end up with more permanent contracts.  Nevertheless, in the event that they do not and are working in the hospitality sector or somewhere similar, they could end up on a series of two or three rolling contracts. Is there a provision in the legislation, outside of what already exists in law, to deal with the potential abuse of short-term contracts and using them to evade the requirement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#B00500","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The three-month requirement seeks to strike a balance and is designed to ensure that the employer and the employee build a working relationship.  Rolling short-term contracts will probably be the exception rather than the rule.  There is no specific provision in the legislation to deal with that.  We have been informed, as we have with all the design parameters of the scheme, by the extensive consultation and bilateral engagements we have had along the way.  As I said earlier, the scheme is a starting point and we have tried to achieve a balance.  It is very much pro-employee.  We are trying to improve the terms and conditions of all employees, with due regard to not imposing excessive costs on businesses and to giving them reasonable assurance they are paying for illnesses that are genuine and certified.<\/p> <p>  The three-month provision is something we will examine over the first 12 months as the scheme is rolled out.  For the moment, however, we believe it strikes a reasonable balance between protecting employees and not overburdening employers at the get-go.  Those employees who do not qualify in the first three months may well quality for illness benefit.  The key aspect of the proposed Bill is that no matter what way you look at it, it will improve the lot of employees to date, who currently have to wait a few days before they can access illness benefit, for which they require a medical certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I am not disputing that there are some improvements in the proposed Bill, but our guests have mentioned the issue of genuine illness a few times.  I am not sure there is evidence of widespread abuse of sick leave schemes where they exist.  In general, in my experience at least, people do not ring in sick unless they are sick.  It is the same as all of us here.  I do not ring in to say I am sick if I am not sick, and I am sure our guests do not either.  I do not understand, therefore, the constant references to genuine illness because people will not ring in sick if they do not have a genuine illness.  Clearly, people do not earn as much money on a sick day as they would do if they came to work.<\/p> <p>  Protections exist within the legislation for workers who already avail of an in-company sick pay scheme, but are there similar protections for new entrants to the workplace?  Protections are in place for workers who avail of a scheme already, but is there protection for new entrants to ensure they will have the opportunity to join such a scheme?  I ask because there are schemes, generally in unionised employment, that will be of a higher standard than the scheme in the proposed Bill.  In those cases, is there protection to ensure a new entrant will be able to avail of the same benefits, such as in the case of a collective agreement.  Will they be able to avail of the same benefits and have that entitlement?  My concern is that where employers have terms that are more favourable, they might put employees and workers on the statutory scheme rather than the more favourable scheme.

Otherwise, after three months of service with the employer, the employee will be entitled to the statutory sick pay scheme.  Quite limited data are available on employees with regard to sick days, sick pay and so on; it is something we need as a system to examine.  As a general rule, from what we can gather, not many employees fall sick in the first three months.

These provisions are extremely welcome.  We saw during Covid the exposure we had of people staying on in work because they needed to, which was putting people at risk.  This is a very welcome scheme.  How did the Department reach the figure of &euro;110 per week?  Over a five-day week the figure coincides with the working family payment, and maybe that was the thinking.  I would be interested to know how the officials reached that threshold.<\/p> <p>  This is structured in such a way that employers of lower paid workers, in those sectors that tend to be a bit weaker, not as well organised and not as prosperous, are committing to a higher percentage of the payroll than higher wage employers.

Why do employers of very high-paid workers not have the same percentage commitment to support them during illness? <\/p> <p>  One of the things we hear, and I would like to know how the officials have assessed it in terms of regulatory impact, is that different sectors have far greater exposure to risk from this scheme.  Some sectors have a small number of staff who must be on 24-7.  When there is an absence they have to pay an alternative as well as paying the person who is sick.  Other sectors work in teams and can quite easily accommodate an absence.  There seems to be a view that there are very different types of situations in different sectors.  Have the officials considered any way of trying to accommodate those differences?  They are probably not insurable and the employers involved probably could not insure themselves against a spate of sickness.  How was that assessed?

In answer to his first question as to how we arrived at the figure of &euro;110 per day, we arrived at it based on the 2019 mean weekly earnings of &euro;786.33.  That equates to an annual salary of &euro;40,889.16.  We felt that imposing a cap at this level ensures &euro;110 is the maximum cost for any employer per day.  That is based on a weekly salary of &euro;786.33 divided by five and multiplied by 70%.  The daily threshold has been set at that level to prevent excessive costs being imposed on employers for very high earners and to provide certainty around costs for employers.  The current highest personal rate of illness benefit is &euro;33.83 per day.  We used 2019 data because we were advised by research within our Department that the Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on 2020 data, which was skewed slightly by payment of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and so on.  We were advised to initially base this on 2019 data.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the ceiling on higher earners and higher paid people.  What are setting here is a floor.  We are saying an employer is required to pay 70% of his or her wage to each employee but we have capped it at &euro;110.  The legislation is very clear that many private or company-level schemes have much more advantageous sick pay schemes in place.  Therefore there is no impediment to any employer offering a higher ceiling and paying more than the statutory amount.  This is a first step in introducing statutory sick pay.  We thought it was a reasonable level at which to set the payment.  We did it in consultation with various bodies.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's third question as I understand it is about the fact that different sectors operate differently and there are different risks in terms of illness.  The Deputy is right about that.  For this exercise we have not gone into looking at the different sectors.  For the time being this is an across-the-board scheme that will cover all sectors and all employees.  We did consider looking at sectors differently but we felt that for the time being it was better to proceed with this general scheme.  We will look in greater depth at some of these issues across sectors as the scheme is rolled out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I think it is an issue we will need to tease out as we go along.

We will probably get a better handle on the admin costs at that stage.  As the Deputy can see, we are starting fairly modestly and will build on the model.  We will definitely keep an eye on costs because clearly we are trying to minimise any additional costs on business, whether sickness benefit payments or admin costs, but there will be some admin costs.<\/p> <p>  As for appeals, there is a provision in the legislation relating to employers who believe they genuinely cannot afford to pay illness benefit or sick pay to their employees.  It is the same provision that exists in the National Minimum Wage Act and in the Industrial Relations Act that provides for sectoral employment orders.  There is a provision in the legislation whereby a company can appeal to the Labour Court and the Labour Court can take a decision in favour of that company such that it can be absolved of paying illness benefit for a prescribed period of not less than three months, I think, and not more than six months.

It is fairly clear to me what the proposals are and how the days can be spread out and so on.  The one thing I wonder about is that the scheme is not intended to impose significant new costs on employers.  I am thinking in particular about small businesses, which seem to be my obsession.  A small employer with an employee out for three days either has to get the rest of the staff to do the work to cover for that employee or has to employ somebody else to cover for him or her.  If that is the case, is there any way we hope to try to assist that employer or give it some kind of tax refund or whatever else?  If it is paying out &euro;330 in wages for somebody who is not coming in, how does it afford to employ somebody else as well?  For small businesses with tight budgets, that is tricky.<\/p><p>If a person is getting &euro;330 for being sick on three days, and let us say that the &euro;60 charge for a sick certificate is &euro;20 per day, then the person is getting &euro;270.  I can see how &euro;60 might not be in the pocket because overall the person is getting &euro;330 for the three days.  It is prohibitive, but one would hope that they would find a way knowing they are getting the &euro;330.  I do not see how we could do it without it being certified in some way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#E01600","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  We are very conscious of imposing excessive costs on small and micro businesses.  As I said earlier, if an employee is out sick in many of these businesses, for example in the services sector, many of them are required to pay somebody to come in to take their place.  They are doing that already.  This will be an additional cost on those businesses.  We are introducing it at this level and incrementally to give businesses a chance to adjust to it.  There will be a cost.  If it is three days, it will be &euro;330 per employee, which we believe is fairly modest.<\/p> <p>  The international evidence points to huge benefits for employers when they have to take some level of responsibility for their employees, including reducing presenteeism and managing absenteeism, a reduced turnover of employees, a safer work environment and so on.  Over time, many employers have realised the benefits they reap from having such a scheme in place.<\/p> <p>  On the certified or non-certified sick days, many employers expressed to us their concern that employees would simply be inclined to take casual days at the drop of a hat without the need for a doctor's certificate.  This is why we believe that a certified illness is the way to go.  It is a requirement for illness benefit.  I believe the point was made earlier that most employees do not just take one or two casual days.  Most employees only stay out of work sick when they are genuinely sick.  Some of the limited data we have show that people taking one and two days are a small percentage overall of employees.  The payment of &euro;60 for a medical certificate is a reasonable ask of an employee by the employer.  Many people in very low-paid occupations do have access to medical cards or GP visit cards so they would be covered for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>That is interesting.

I am relieved and frustrated in equal measure that we have this pre-legislative scrutiny today.  I am relieved that finally we are discussing sick-pay legislation.  The Labour Party introduced a Bill on this September 12 months ago, following on from a campaign by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and my own union, SIPTU, which highlighted the sheer lack of sick pay among low-paid workers and, in particular, in the meat, childcare and other sectors.  I am relieved it is before us today but I am frustrated at some of the detail not contained in the Bill.  I am concerned that the detail of the entitlements is effectively being delegated to regulations as opposed to being hardwired into the Bill itself.  For the avoidance of confusion, and to give us confidence to know that the three days will go to the ten days, we need to have that written into the Bill.<\/p> <p>  On the detail, my first query relates to the amount.  I am aware that the Department will say that the worker should not lose out on a day's pay, but by setting it at 70% of earnings raises a series of questions.  Is it 70% of gross or net pay?  The &euro;110 is a ceiling, not a floor and, therefore, if a person is a low-paid worker, then 70% of earnings could be very low.  If a worker on the national minimum wage earning &euro;80 as a full-time worker, then 70% of that daily wage is approximately &euro;56, which is less than what it would cost to go to the doctor.  We need to seriously consider introducing a floor for all workers but which would impact low-paid workers to ensure their sick pay would not fall below a particular threshold.  There is also a concern about how we define daily pay.  Is it one fifth of a working week or is there a different type of calculation?  This needs to be written into the legislation.  If there was a 100% replacement rate, we would not have these issues.  If the Department is insisting on going with the lower rate, which we are not happy with, then we need to see it comprehensively prescribed in the legislation.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the selection of three days and then moving to the ten days, how is this identified?  How do the officials believe that this compares with other EU member states?  Ms Dunne started her contribution by highlighting that Ireland is one of the few countries that does not have paid sick leave.  According to the research from Eurofound and the European Trade Union Institute, ETUI, the maximum number of days in the UK, France and the Netherlands is in excess of 200 days, but that the average days is well over double what is being proposed in the legislation.  I want to understand how the Department arrived at three days. <\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of medical certification.  We need precise wording that allows for it to be retrospectively provided.  I share the concerns that have been articulated by everybody else with regard to having access to a GP.  There is a difficulty in registering with a GP at the moment, and certainly where I am based in Dublin central there are massive issues for people trying to secure an appointment  Out-of-hours doctor services will not provide a sick certificate.  People have come to me in recent days about this.  Again, we need to ensure that if we are going down the road of medical certification we provide as much flexibility to workers in the provision of those certificates.<\/p> <p>  I must express a little bit of annoyance at what I consider to be the throwaway remark that more than 2 million people have access to a GP card or medical card in this country.  If we consider the working age population within that 2 million, it is a much smaller figure.  The number who are working and who have access to a GP card or a medical card is much smaller again.  One fifth of those 95,000 people who have access to a GP card are of working age, and we know that a large share of those people are not working.  We are engaging with the Department in good faith but I ask that the Department also engages with us in good faith with regard to the figures it provides to us in its contributions.<\/p><p>With regard to the issue of having to get replacement staff in, over recent weeks we have been talking about employers being unable to get staff such are the shortages in some sectors.  Today, we hear about many employers having to get replacement staff in to cover for workers who are sick.  We need to be clear on what exactly the issue is.  I have previously asked representatives of small employers' bodies to survey their members to establish precisely who needs to get in replacement staff.  We need clarity on that issue.  I would also like an answer to the question regarding the three days, if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#F00400","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

The technology is not working very well at all today.  With regard to the three days, the initial thought was to plug the gap with regard to the required waiting period of three days before employees can access illness benefit.  That was where the three days came from.  We will then work up to what we believe is reasonable, that is, ten days.  As I said at the outset, there is a wide range of sickness benefit schemes in operation across Europe and the world.  Quite a few involve a period of ten days to two weeks.  Looking at these examples and at the inputs we got during our public consultation, we felt that ten days was a good initial landing point for Ireland.  Some countries offer as little as two days.  Some pay the first three days.  One country pays between four and eight days.  The examples go on and on.  In the Netherlands, the duration is at the other end of the scale, 104 weeks, but different terms and conditions apply.  There is a very wide range.  All of this information is available in the international review we published in January of this year.  That is available on our website and would give the Senator a very good flavour of what is on offer.  To the question of how we arrived at the three days, this was initially to plug the gap relating to the waiting period for illness benefit.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is right and makes a very valid point about those on very low wages and the fact that we will need to look at setting a floor.  We accept that and are currently working on that issue.  That will form part of the legislation.  We are just working that out at the moment to see how we can articulate it in legislation.  That point is being taken on board so that we can provide a real floor for the very low-paid.<\/p> <p>  With regard to daily pay, we are looking at gross pay.

Something that struck me when reading the Department's regulatory impact assessment was the fact that workers with paid sick leave are 28% less likely than workers without access to paid sick leave to be injured at work.  That raises a question as to how many workers, for example, meat factory workers, have suffered significant injuries as a result of working while sick.  Moving to a sick pay scheme is therefore welcome, although this scheme is far from what we need.<\/p> <p>  I will go into that.  The opening statement claims that this will bring Ireland in line with its peers among European and other developed countries.  With regard to having a statutory sick pay scheme at all, that is the case, but in its content the scheme, including the replacement rate and the time period covered, seems to be significantly weaker than those in our developed country peers, for example, in other EU countries.  In Austria, for example, employers pay ten to 16 weeks at 100%.  In Germany, employers pay for the first six to 12 weeks and must pay a sick worker's full wage for up to six weeks.  In France, employers pay between 60 and 90 days.  This is paid at 90% for the first 30 days.  In the Netherlands, they must pay 70% of the wage for up to two years, with supports for small businesses.  In Norway, workers get a year on full pay with the company paying the first 16 days.  In Belgium, employers pay a month's sick leave and in the UK employers must pay a flat rate of &pound;96 for up to six months.

On the one hand, we want to protect employees and that is why we are starting with three days to bridge the gap that currently exists with regard to waiting days.  However, we also need to be mindful that many employers including small and micro businesses do not currently provide any sort of sick pay for their employees.  We are now requiring them to do so, but in an incremental and balanced way.  The Deputy will know only too well, as do we all, that many of these companies have suffered very badly during the pandemic.  We are still just coming out of that.  We are very mindful that we do not want to impose any significant additional costs on business.<\/p> <p>  We believe this is a fair and balanced first step in providing statutory sick pay for all employees.  We are planning an increase from three days to ten over four years.  One of the cornerstones of what we are doing is that this will be reviewed, starting early on in the roll-out of the scheme.  We will be keeping a very close eye on it to see how it is working and whether it can or should be refined.  I am sure that, as the scheme is rolled out, we will find things that we did not think of or that we should have done differently.  We will then move to change those aspects.  It is a starting point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dunne.  May I further explore the issue of the plan to move from three days to ten?  I note that, in response to Deputy O'Reilly, Ms Dunne said the process will be basically automatic.  She also set out that we will reach ten days by 2025.  However, it is a bit concerning that the draft Bill only legislates for the initial three days, with the others to be brought in by ministerial order.  Section 6 of the draft Bill says that, in considering whether and by how much to increase the number of days, the Minister has to have regard to the state of the economy, the potential impact on employers, data on earnings and labour costs and other matters he or she considers relevant.  Is it therefore not the case that the Government and the Minister can decide that, due to the economic environment or whatever, we will not go to ten days by 2025?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#G01000","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>In theory, the answer is \"Yes\".

We believe that this is the most prudent way to proceed.  We have found in the past that putting the operational details of a scheme into primary legislation can tie the hands of the policymakers who may want to move faster than the legislation allows and we find then that we have to go back to the drawing board and amend primary legislation to move more quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dunne.

There is a wide range of schemes available out there.  Some are less favourable than what we are introducing and some are more favourable, which I accept.  Our intention and ambition is to be among the best in class in the developed world in protecting employees.  We are starting modestly, but I reiterate very firmly and very clearly, with a path set out moving relatively quickly to ten days.  It is a first step and is a model that can be built upon and refined over time.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, we have to have due regard to the plight of small and micro businesses at this particular point in time, many of whom were not very pleased that the Government is introducing this measure.

The inability-to-pay provision is where an employer can go to the Labour Court and seek a derogation from paying illness benefit to their employees for very specific reasons that they can prove to the court.  We do not envisage that this provision should or will be needed very much in the first year of operation because we are setting the sick pay entitlement at three days and we are capping it at 70% and &euro;110 per day.  That means that the maximum that an employer could be liable to pay for an employee who was out on certified sick leave in year one is &euro;330.  <\/p> <p>  I have spent many years on the enterprise side of the Department and I appreciate that many businesses operate at very low margins, but at &euro;330 in a calendar year, this should be manageable for most businesses.

I think everybody accepts that this legislation is very timely, the scheme is long overdue and people need these supports.  As a number of other Deputies have expressed, I have a concern about the smaller businesses and how they will support the costs involved.  As has been pointed out many times, the small business owners have to look to other resources on the day to help fill the gaps that sick leave creates.  Has the Department engaged with the Department of Finance on looking at the idea of introducing either a tax credit or some kind of a tax supplement for small businesses?  For example, let us say that there is a business owner who runs a small carriage company and the forklift driver is out for the day.  The business owner will have to get one of the other staff members to cover for the driver on top of doing their other work late into the evening, which will involve overtime payments.  Could the business owner make a claim against the tax for that expenditure based on the fact that a vital employee was out and that they incurred that additional cost to run their business that day?  Many small businesses are not in a position to go to the WRC or to pay this money without significant difficulty.  Ultimately, it is going to impinge on them, as the proposed number of days increases.  I think there should be some ability for small threshold businesses to make a claim against this cost and to have it recognised under some financial instrument.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#J00300","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>The answer is that yes, we have considered this.

The intention of the legislative framework governing SEOs is to establish minimum rates of pay, sick leave provisions and pension provisions for particular sectors.

I am joined today by Tara Coogan, principal officer in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to present to the committee a draft sectoral employment order for the construction sector.  The draft order before the committee today proposes to amend the sectoral employment order made in 2019 by confirming new minimum rates of pay, pension and sick pay entitlements for workers in the construction sector.  This order, if approved, is the third of this kind to be made.  The first sectoral employment order for the construction sector was issued in 2017 and the second in 2019.<\/p> <p>  Before I introduce the specific draft order before you, I wish to say a few words to ensure that all committee members are fully cognisant of our respective roles - that of the Minister and that of Members of the Houses of Oireachtas - in this process.<\/p> <p>  A sectoral employment order is a statutory minimum wage-setting mechanism in a given economic sector.  Essentially, an SEO is a collective bargaining mechanism which, once the statutory thresholds have been met, gives the Labour Court as a neutral decision maker, the power to examine an application for an SEO in a given economic sector.  As part of this examination, the Labour Court must explore all the policy considerations set out in the Industrial Relations Act 2015 by affording all interested parties an opportunity to engage with the proposals and have an opportunity to be heard.<\/p> <p>  Once the Labour Court has complied with this statutory process set out in the 2015 Act, it has the power to make a recommendation for an SEO to the Minister.  This recommendation must be accompanied by a report which sets out the process and matters that the Labour Court considered in reaching its recommendation.  The purpose of this report is to assist the Minister in ensuring that the Labour Court has complied with its statutory functions as required by the Act.<\/p> <p>  The role of the Minister in this process is limited.  Pursuant to the 2015 Act, the Minister has the power to either accept or reject the recommendation as presented.  In this regard, the Minister is compelled to accept the recommendation if he or she agrees, based on the statutory report the Labour Court has prepared, that the court has complied with the statutory process.  If the Minister is not satisfied that the Labour Court has complied with its duties as set out in the Act, he or she must return the proposal to the court setting out his or her reasons for not accepting the recommendation.  The Minister does not have any power to engage with the substantive recommendation itself.<\/p> <p>  Accordingly, I can confirm to the committee that the Minister of State, Deputy English, has considered this draft recommendation in line with the terms of the 2015 Act, relying on the statutory report outlining the Labour Courts deliberative process.  Having done so, he is satisfied that the Labour Court has complied with its statutory role.  I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy English, notified the Labour Court on 20 October 2021 that he has accepted the recommendation; and that he would be referring the matter to the Houses of Oireachtas for their consideration, as required by the Act.  Furthermore, as required, the Minister laid a draft order before the Houses on 20 October 2021.<\/p> <p>  The 2015 Act also sets out that the Houses of the Oireachtas may only accept or reject the draft order as it is.  The Act does not permit any alterations or amendments from the committee to the draft order.  If the Houses accept the recommendation, the Minister of State, Deputy English, will sign a statutory instrument giving effect to this decision.  Should the Houses reject or fail to approve the draft order, the proposal for the SEO falls.<\/p> <p>  I will now outline some details of the proposal before the committee.  The application for an examination came before the Labour Court by way of application by the Building and Allied Trades Union, Connect Trade Union, OPATSI trade union, SIPTU trade union and UNITE the union pursuant to section 14 of Chapter 3 of Part 2 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015.  The five unions requested that the Labour Court examine the terms and conditions relating to the remuneration and any sick pay scheme or pension scheme, of all persons employed in the construction sector as craftspersons, construction operatives and apprentices.<\/p> <p>  Having examined the submissions and the accompanying supporting materials, the Labour Court reports that it was satisfied that the applicants were substantially representative of the workers of the particular class, type or group in the economic sector in respect of which the request is expressed to apply.  This gave the court the jurisdiction to proceed with the examination.<\/p> <p>  The court then, as it is required to do, published its intention to undertake an examination of the unions&rsquo; request and invited submissions from interested persons.  Written submissions were received from three interested parties, the construction industry committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Construction Industry Federation and the Construction Workers Pension Scheme.  No parties objected to the making of a SEO although there were different opinions on the issue of increases in remuneration, travel time and so on.  These submissions are available for anyone to examine on the Labour Court&rsquo;s website.  A public hearing was held on 2 September 2021.  All interested parties were given an opportunity to be heard and to engage with the various policy considerations that the process requires.<\/p> <p>  Having considered the matter fully within the statutory time limits, the Labour Court made this recommendation to the Minister.  According to its report, the Labour Court has considered the factors set out in section 16(2) of the Act.<\/p><p>This includes the potential impact of the making of an order on levels of employment and unemployment in the identified economic sector, the potential impact on competitiveness in the economic sector concerned and that the SEO would be binding on all workers and employers in the sector.  I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy English, has shared the Labour Court&rsquo;s report with the members of this committee so they have had the opportunity to examine it in greater detail.<\/p><p> I anticipate that the committee will recognise the importance of ensuring industrial relations stability in the construction sector and I hope it will accept the draft order.  I trust that the committee recognises that Ireland needs a competitive, productive, and sustainable construction sector for the delivery of high-quality and affordable residential and commercial properties alongside its national physical infrastructure.<\/p><p> I believe this SEO will play a significant role in supporting this sector by maintaining harmonious industrial relations.  The terms of the SEO refer merely to the minimum rates of pay and terms and conditions.  At times, when the sector is buoyant, it is to be expected that some employers will exceed these minimum rates.  The importance of an SEO is to ensure that in times of downturns, workers are properly protected and the sector maintains its attractiveness as a profession for apprentices.<\/p><p> It has been a long-standing practice of the trade unions and the employers in the construction sector to enter into collective agreements that govern the terms and conditions of employment.  These arrangements have been in place for many decades and have provided the industry with cost certainty and stability.  The SEO provides for a dispute resolution mechanism, which does help in preventing industrial unrest.<\/p><p> Should this SEO be approved by the committee, the Minister of State, Deputy English, will sign an order giving it legal effect.  Its terms will be binding across the entire economic sector.  The new order will become effective on 1 February 2022.  It will remain in place for two years and includes a second minimum remuneration increase in 2023.  It is now in the committee's hands for consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#N00300","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I have a couple of questions, the first of which relates to the timeframe.  It is my understanding that with the SEO, when the Labour Court issues the report it is similar to the Labour Court recommendations, so there are 42 days and those expire tomorrow.  Maybe in an ideal world we would have a little bit more time to consider this.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding that, this is obviously an improvement which some of the trade unions had looked for.  I will take this opportunity to put onto the Minister of State's radar that while this SEO and all of these wage-setting mechanisms are very good in theory, in practice we know that through the mechanism of subcontracting and bogus self-employment, there are wholescale breaches of these employment regulation mechanisms because the workers concerned are being put at arms-length from the employer.<\/p> <p>  In any discussion relating to an SEO, we really must look at effective mechanisms for ensuring that it is adhered to.  The SEO sets the floor and in many cases that floor turns into a target for employers.  We will put that to one side, but the mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that these rules are being adhered to.  I have spoken to representatives about this.  I will not name the organisation now.  The Minister of State is here on behalf of Minister of State, Deputy English, who will know of the company and the representative body involved.  They have reached out to him several times.  There is evidence of these SEOs being undercut, and there is evidence that this is being done by using the mechanisms of bogus self-employment and subcontracting.  It would be remiss of me not to mention that this is happening.  While there is an accepted minimum, it is not accepted in every employment.  I would like to convey to the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, that this is a serious matter.  The State is involved in several of these contracts where subcontractors are involved.<\/p> <p>  A number of cases were brought to my attention in the recent past in respect of State agencies or people who are providing services on behalf of the State that are not adhering to Labour Court or Workplace Relations Commission recommendations or national mechanisms.  That is a concern.  It is one thing to have the SEO but it is quite another to have a mechanism to ensure that it has been implemented.  The Minister of State has made it very clear that the option here is not to renegotiate what is in the SEO or to change it in any way shape or form.  It is a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" on the basis that it is overdue at this stage.  I welcome the fact that we have it before us but I am concerned about how the mechanism is actually going to be implemented.  If we have accepted that this is the floor rather than the ceiling, I am very concerned that mechanisms exist outside of this to undercut the SEO before it has even been signed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#O00300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>The Deputy is right, from a statutory perspective, regarding what our respective roles are in this area.

Thankfully, the sector is rebounding strongly following the Covid pandemic disruption, but there is concern around the significant increases in the cost of materials.  This is happening for a variety of reasons we are all familiar with, including supply chain disruption and Brexit.  These increases are obviously being passed on to the client, who is the consumer, whether it be those buying homes or commercial clients.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that this issue is not within the scope of this morning's agenda but as the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, is here, I wanted to take the opportunity to raise it with him.

This is critically important.<\/p> <p>  On the supply chain issue, the Department is aware of this and is working through it, but it is not unique to Ireland.<\/p><p>This is a global issue in regard to both Brexit and Covid-19 which have had a very disruptive impact on the supply chain.

On pay and conditions for apprentices, in the last number of years one fifth of apprentices who took up apprenticeship roles left.  There were labour shortages in the construction sector which was a big factor.  I want to bring this to the attention of the Minister of State.  The pay of apprentices is also taken into account and is part of this.  Are there other reasons apprentices are leaving in such huge numbers particularly on the construction side?  Maybe they picked the wrong job initially or when they started their expectations were different.  Maybe it is the way the training is organised and they arrive on building sites without any experience or knowledge of what they are doing and find it a more challenging environment than they expected.  Maybe they found something else with better pay and conditions and easier work, I do not know.  It is a concern and something I have raised in the D&aacute;il on a few occasions, as have other colleagues.  While it is not directly his responsibility, the Minister of State might take a look at this as it impacts on employment.

The agreemenf of this sectoral employment order, SEO, is an example of collective bargaining working well.  There are a few short points I want to make.  In the Labour Court recommendation a number of the key issues articulated by the trade unions involved related to travel time, the increasing of the allowance, the wet week and the grievance procedures ultimately did not find their way into the final recommendation.  That is a source of disappointment.  However we have an SEO and a proposal for a pay increase in February 2022 and also in February 2023.  To echo comments made earlier by Deputy O'Reilly about this deal already being undercut or about to be undercut, that is a concern.  Ultimately we must ensure that these SEOs are enforced.<\/p> <p>  My final point, which I ask the Minister of State to relay to his colleague, Deputy English, is that while this comes to us the day before the deadline, we have had an issue with regard to the signing and giving of legal effect to employment regulation orders, ERO, in contract cleaning and security.  Last year an issue arose where contract cleaners were due to start their new rate on 1 December, and the Department eventually got around to signing that ERO after that date, giving it legal effect.  This year the security sector was waiting three months beyond the date when its pay increase should have taken effect.  These are low-paid workers and the pay increases are small; they may not be much for those of us here in the Oireachtas, or to a Minister, but they mean a great deal to those working as contract cleaners or in security.  I would urge the Minister of State to bring back the message that when an ERO comes before the Minister it should be given legal effect as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#P00500","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

It is good to see progress being made in what was quite a grey area for many people in the sector.  No doubt this will not answer all of the problems, but it is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope the Labour Court process works out.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State hit the nail on the head on the apprenticeships issue as it was something I was hoping to raise, that is, to get younger people into the construction sector and bolstering activity in this area.  This legislation will help to give additional security to people working within it.<\/p><p>To add to the point the Minister of State made in response to Deputy Shanahan, from his Department's point of view, the German model would be very beneficial in respect of the dual system for apprenticeships, giving a greater degree of qualification to what is already an outstanding system.  This area causes issues when trying to attract younger people to do apprenticeship courses.  Some people go into other aspects of the higher education system, through university and our wonderful institutes of technology, when apprenticeships would be sufficient and, indeed, in many areas perhaps more beneficial to them than going through the traditional higher education system.<\/p><p> I am looking at the information on the weekly pay rates that came back in the briefing.  It is interesting to see the difference between the wet and the dry week in the building sector.  The effect that has is quite unique.  We can see that the pay rates are significantly higher than what the median take-home pay would be for many people on a weekly basis but, unfortunately, as many colleagues have correctly identified, including, I think, Deputy Paul Murphy and Deputy O'Reilly, weather conditions can have an adverse effect on people's take-home pay.  It is very important - and I know that the Minister of State knows this - that we continue to ensure that people working in the construction industry have sufficient take-home pay because we are tackling an enormous housing crisis and trying to keep up with other demands that have been placed on construction workers.  We are very lucky to have a robust and strong economy through the hard work of many people in Ireland, particularly within the Department in which the Minister of State works, and outstanding work has been done on that area.  However, serious pressure is being put on people involved in building and construction to ensure they can get project deadlines met and attract in new people.  Another aspect of this, in terms of additional legislation that will need to be brought in to complement the work the Minister of State is doing in this area, is that we need to see further work done on work permits.  I welcome the work the Minister of State has done on it, but that is a message I am getting loud and clear from my constituency, Cork East, about getting more people to come in and work in this sector.<\/p><p> I will allow the Minister of State to respond to those couple of points.  He may have something to say about attracting in additional people, including through work permits, and on the points I have raised regarding the legislation, pay and the difference between the dry and the wet weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#Q01400","speaker":"1516","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Yes, we do need to look at international best practice in respect of apprenticeships.

I acknowledge the work that has been done in that regard, but it is a point that is being raised repeatedly with me by many different people across a lot of industries, particularly construction.  We desperately need to get people in from outside of the European Union and to try to get additional workers into this sector if we are going to be on track to meet our housing targets and on track to get key infrastructure projects constructed right around the State.  I would nearly label this area as an emergency because of the requirements the industry as a whole faces.  In addition, I applaud the work we are doing for workers already in the sector, but this is a crucial point I wanted to relay to the Minister of State while he is before the committee.  I know we will have other opportunities to discuss this, but it is something that has come up repeatedly.  I was with Deputy Stanton yesterday at industry events in our constituency and with the Minister of State, Deputy English, talking to people in the private sector.  They are trying to meet targets.

He has alluded to it and will be aware that the permits regime was reviewed and enhanced and that there was an increased quota for permits in the construction industry.  That is continuously reviewed and monitored to ensure that the number of permits keeps pace with the demand out there.  It is also a balancing act as to when that review takes place to acknowledge that, at the same time, we have quite a high unemployment rate in our country, and we want to ensure that there are opportunities for people who are unemployed to get employment while at the same time ensuring that the need that is there in a particular sector is met.  The one point I will make - it was made earlier - is that the rates that have been set by this SEO are the minimum rates.  In a buoyant economy, which is what we have currently in the construction sector, that is the reason we are looking for permits.  We cannot get workers here and people are now able to demand much higher salaries than what is currently prescribed in the SEO and are coming in internationally to avail of that.

I thank him for coming in and giving of his time.  Yes, I think this is an emergency.  We have a crisis.  We are so committed as a Government to get houses built and retrofitted that having the tradespeople we need is an emergency.  I welcome the Minister of State's work on this to date, and he has outlined an important piece of work to us today.  As he himself said of the minimum, I do not know any tradesman paying that little to any apprentice taken on.  Tradesmen value apprentices too much to pay them that little.  It is good to have a low bar set, but I do not know anybody paying that little to their apprentices.<\/p> <p>  On the thought of bringing people in from other countries, I did a call-out in the Seanad yesterday.  We should reach out to our diaspora of fine tradespeople we have seen leave the country to Canada, Australia, England and other countries.  We lost many in the 1980s.  Some of them came back, but we lost many of them again after the last boom-bust cycle.  It would be really good if we worked on doing a call-out.  I have been reaching out to Senators in America and to Irish media abroad asking them to put a call out to tradespeople.  All the tradespeople I know - I went to school with and live near many - say that the wages are so high for tradesmen now that that is an attraction itself to come home without anything else.  The wages have increased more than in any other sector in Ireland.  That is an important thing we should look at.<\/p> <p>  While I have the Minister of State's attention, I wish to raise a couple of issues surrounding the syllabus for some of the tradespeople.  The syllabuses for plumbers and electricians, for example, have not really been upgraded in about 30 years, and many of them are not up to date with the new systems we need to get into houses.  That needs to be looked at.  We also still cannot do the safe pass online, which is an issue for tradespeople and their apprentices.  It is done online in England and everywhere else.  For some reason, Solas does not seem to be able to get it online.  It did not do it earlier during Covid and still has not done it.  I have been asked about that for ages.  These are challenges I hear from tradespeople.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is committed to meeting the guidance counsellors of Ireland in order to get them to realise the importance of tradespeople.  None of us would have a home without them.  We have looked down on them for many years, and that narrative has to change completely.<\/p> <p>  There are also issues with safety on sites.  We need better inspections because many people are going up on roofs and doing work without harnesses and just trusting their own balance, and that has led to many casualties and deaths.<\/p><p>We have a huge issue regarding what are called grey sites.  The latter is the case because nobody without grey hair is working on the housing sites.  We have a lot of work to do, and I would happily help in any way I can.  It is a big challenge and an emergency.  I thank the Minister of State for his work on this but we have a lot more to do if we want to get these houses built, which we do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#R00700","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I agree and made the point earlier that we need a cultural change in terms of supporting people making a decision at leaving cert level that a trade is a respectable job with good career prospects.  I welcome the initiative taken by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to engage with career guidance counsellors.  Anecdotally, one hears that there is a focus on getting people to do a degree.  The latter is not for everybody, however.  That is acknowledged and a number of contributors made that point.<\/p> <p>  The syllabus for tradespeople and the Safe Pass course online are not areas under our remit, but I will refer what the Senator said to the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins.<\/p> <p>  On encouraging members of the diaspora to come home, I compliment the Senator on what she is doing in that regard but, having been on two international trade missions in the past six weeks, I know it is not unique to Ireland that there are difficulties in attracting the right staff with the right skill sets.  There is a problem across the world in terms of a shortage of supply for people in construction.  Because of that, the rates of pay are high across the globe and people are not always willing to return home.  It is an initiative the Senator has embarked on and if it encourages some people back home and helps us with our recruitment process, I wish her well with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#S00200","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I think the Minister of State is doing work on fast-tracking mechanical engineers or others in order that, instead of having to go back to day one of the apprenticeship, they could skip on a few years and we could get them qualified sooner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021111000002#S00300","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Again, that matter does not under my remit.

They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending the meeting.  They should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  I ask for everyone's full co-operation in this.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or of those who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, as the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  <\/p> <p>  Committee members are reminded once again of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  <\/p> <p>  On behalf of the committee I welcome Dr. Ella Kavanagh from the department of economics in University College Cork, UCC, and Professor Karl Whelan from the economics department in University College Dublin, UCD, and thank them for attending.

I will extract some key points from the brief that I submitted to the committee and will begin by giving some background to the current situation.<\/p> <p>  The current global inflation issue is the outcome of a perfect storm.  On the demand side, the pandemic resulted in a change in consumer expenditure patterns from services to goods.  The current easing of Covid restrictions and accumulated savings have unleashed pent-up demand.  At a macro level, unlike in previous recessions there has been a co-ordinated monetary and fiscal policy response to the pandemic.  On the supply side, disruptions to supply chains, difficulties in the labour market due to Covid, geopolitical factors and importantly, climate change consequences and responses, have affected the global commodities market, including the energy market and the supply and availability of raw materials, inputs and products.  We are seeing the effect of this and during this year we have entered into a period of rising prices and higher inflation rates.  <\/p> <p>  In July 2021, average prices of goods and services in Ireland measured by the consumer price index, CPI, were 2.2% higher than the average a year ago.  This rose to 2.8% in August and, more recently, 3.7% in September.  This followed a period of deflation during the height of the restrictions.  It is also important to note that over the last decade low inflation of less than 1% has been the norm.  The categories in the CPI that have experienced the most significant price increases between September 2020 and September 2021 were transport, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, alcohol, beverages and tobacco, restaurants and hotels, and communications.  With the exception of the latter, these categories all made the greatest contribution to the rise in inflation.  The figures I just quoted refer to headline inflation but core inflation, where we remove both unprocessed food and energy prices, has also risen although by less.  It increased by 1.4% in July, 2.1% in August and 2.7% in September.  Increases in price inflation across categories seem to suggest more broad-based inflation but I would suggest that we need more observations.  On building costs, the wholesale price index for buildings and construction has been consistently increasing year on year since last March.  Materials prices have increased from 2.3% in March 2021 to almost 13% in September.  <\/p> <p>  The general consensus is that the current increase in inflation is temporary and that inflation will fall back towards the European Central Bank, ECB, target of 2% or below over the medium term.  The Central Bank of Ireland is forecasting headline price inflation for Ireland of 2.1% in 2021 rising to 2.9% in 2022, which is above the ECB inflation target of 2%, but moving back to below that target at 1.9% in 2023.  Recently the US Federal Reserve, the ECB and the Bank of England all projected a temporary effect although there are differences between them.  The reasons for this temporary effect are various.  First, energy prices are expected to stabilise or fall next year.  Second, supply is expected to recover as supply disruptions ease and demand is expected to normalise.  Third, base effects will drop out of the inflation figures.  Underlying this is the view that long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.  <\/p> <p>  However, there are risks around these projections and the risk are mainly on the upside, that price inflation could be more persistent and therefore, higher than projected for next year and into the medium term.  These centre around the restoration of global supply chains, global energy and commodity prices and wages.  The recent supply chain disruptions are global in nature and have been directly or indirectly related to Covid.  Companies are attempting to offset the effect of increased costs on their margins by increasing prices and generating efficiencies.  The key uncertainty here is how long supply chains remain disrupted but even if they remain disrupted for longer, it is expected that impacts will still be transitory as companies and businesses move to re-establish reliable operations and cut costs in the chain, as they have done in the past.<\/p><p>The point is made that the pandemic has led to a series of regional supply and transportation disruptions, linked to the spread of Covid and the vaccination programmes, which may have had a more persistent impact than a single large shock.  Even if disruptions continue, another uncertainty is to what degree companies will be willing to continue to pass these higher costs on to their customers.<\/p><p> On global energy costs, the projections are that prices for crude oil, gas and solid fuels will reverse in 2022, reducing headline price inflation.  However, it is argued that uncertainty remains high and that imbalances could lead to spikes in prices.  Oil prices, although high relative to pre-pandemic levels, are still well below their all-time high of 2008 and the subsequent peak in 2013 so they could move higher.  Energy prices are also wrapped up in geopolitical issues.  In addition, climate change targets are increasing the global demand for the bridging fuel, namely, natural gas.  Turning to headline price inflation in Ireland, short-term increases arising from electricity price rises, effective from late October into November 2021, are still in the pipeline.<\/p><p> Another major uncertainty relates to wages and the level of slack in the labour market.  On the one hand, we might expect upward pressure on wages if consumers reorient their spending back towards services, if there is a reduction in the size of the labour force or, indeed, in particular sectors and if higher inflation features in wage negotiations or causes an upward revision of inflation expectations.  On the other hand, the ending of the pandemic supports could result in some loosening of the labour market which would put downward pressure on wages.  There is significant uncertainty around this.<\/p><p> There are also questions regarding demand in 2022.  It is expected demand pressures will subside as the pent-up demand unwinds but this will also depend on policy responses.<\/p><p> On policy responses, the appropriate response of a central bank to supply-side shocks is not as straightforward.  Supply-side shocks such as energy prices rises may be temporary or transitory.  Therefore, if the central bank increases interest rates today in response to this, by the time the impact of the policy change comes over the medium term energy prices may no longer be increasing or indeed may have reversed.  By leaving well alone and not stepping on the brake the central bank does not aggravate the problem.  Central banks will be concerned about whether these supply-side shocks will persist and will have persistent effects on the economy through second-round effects and then of course whether to act.  The situation today is very complex.  On the one hand, there has been a significant rebound in demand causing demand-pull inflation where demand has outstripped supply.  On the other hand, there are major supply-side shocks around which there is major uncertainty.  However, it is important to note that prior to the pandemic, price inflation has been persistently below its inflation target and that returning inflation to its target is the desired aim of central banks.<\/p><p> On fiscal policy, the situation, as stated earlier, is more complicated when supply-side shocks and as we are seeing today, supply chain and labour market disruptions, are the cause of costs and price increases.  What governments can do is ensure they are not adding to the disruption.  At the same time, governments may be able to reduce the impact of these supply shocks and increase efficiencies through infrastructure investment, for example.  They may also be able to reduce labour mismatch through the provision of education and training, reducing both frictional and structural unemployment; in other words, by focusing on supply-side policies.  The volatility introduced through dependence on fossil fuels also provides a further reason, in addition to climate change, for governments to focus on investment and incentives to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.<\/p><p> As a final point, it would appear the current increase in inflation is temporary, although there are caveats around this.  This raises the question of whether inflation will revert to the inflation rates that existed prior to the pandemic, or to a higher rate of price inflation.  The change in the ECB's monetary policy strategy with the restatement of the ECB's target for inflation of 2% may increase expectations of price inflation which will in turn affect actual inflation.  Another possibility is the consequence of the recent price increases is price inflation may now re-enter people and workers' decision making processes.  Other factors which may also affect the trend inflation rate, that is, the dynamics of inflation and volatility, are of course demographic considerations, globalisation and climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ella Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Kavanagh and ask Professor Whelan to give his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111000002#B00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

I am going to repeat quite a number of the things Dr. Kavanagh said and want to get on with it and not waste too much of the committee's time.<\/p> <p>  After many years out of the news, inflation has come to the fore again in recent months.  We have seen that with a spike in inflation all across Europe.  In Ireland, consumer price inflation as measured by year-over-year percentage change in prices in September was 3.7%.  That is the highest reading since the period before the global financial crisis.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has not yet published its figure for the October CPI, but EUROSTAT has a flash release for the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, which gives an estimate of what it thinks this number is going to be, or what inflation is going to do, in October.  That showed a further of 1.3% rise in inflation in Ireland in October so we appear to be on track for an inflation reading of about 5% for year-over-year inflation to be published by the CSO very soon.  This would be strikingly high relative to what we have seen in recent years.<\/p> <p>  The largest single contributor to the rise in inflation has been the jump in energy prices.  The story on this has been relatively simple.  The onset of the pandemic saw a collapse in energy prices.  Most notably, oil prices fell because lockdowns meant people were not travelling in their cars, on aeroplanes and so on.  As the global economy has recovered those initial price declines started to be reversed and with strong global demand for manufacturing we have seen those energy prices go back above the levels they were at prior to the pandemic.  Even excluding energy, CPI inflation in Ireland was running at 2.5% as of September.  That is very moderate.  We know the ECB's target rate of inflation is 2% so there is nothing too scary about 2.5% but that is much higher than we had seen in the years running up to the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of forces contributing to the rise in non-energy inflation.  One element is we are seeing year-over-year price rises for services that were restricted in their activities for much of 2020.  With the September CPI inflation reading, of that 2.5% for non-energy inflation, about 0.5% of it was things like air fares, hotels and restaurants, which were barely open a year ago.  If they were open, they were offering cheap prices.  Beyond that, we are seeing rising prices for industrial goods also contributing to inflation.  This is basically a global phenomenon.  The pandemic produced some quite unusual combinations of supply and demand for various products.  On the supply side, we saw factory shutdowns in various parts of the world due to Covid outbreaks and we are still seeing elements of Covid outbreaks causing difficulties for manufacturing in various parts of the world.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic also produced unexpected changes in global spending patterns.  With many service providers closed and limited opportunities for in-person shopping during lockdowns, households in advanced economies switched to purchasing goods online, most notably gadgets of various sorts.  Much of that stuff is produced in Asia and especially China.  That surge in demand for those products took those manufacturers by surprise and took transportation firms by surprise.  If we take shipping for instance, prior to the pandemic there was the outbreak of a trade war between the US and China and that convinced many people global long-distance trade was actually going to decline during these years.  We saw the supply of container shipping capacity was not able to cope with this surge in demand.  Thus we have seen a big increase in shipping costs around the world and that has added to the cost of the goods we are buying.  We are also seeing shortages of parts.<\/p> <p>  The other element influencing global inflation is surprisingly strong global demand.<\/p><p>Some farms and households have been badly affected by losing income because of shutdowns but, on average, the aggressive response from governments has meant that the average household balance sheet is stronger than it was 20 months ago.  Consumers have spent less and active fiscal policies like wage subsidy schemes and the pandemic unemployment programme have meant that the direct impact on the average person's disposable income has largely been shielded.  In addition, we have seen house prices continue to rise around the world and global stock markets are at an all-time high so people's ability and capacity to spend money on goods is strong.<br\/><br\/>What will inflation do next?  One can provide an optimistic case and a pessimistic one.  I will give members both cases and then we can discuss the arguments over questions.  The positive case rests on observing that the recent high inflation rates are partly a function of what economists call &quot;base effects&quot;.  What do we mean by that?  We had this period after the pandemic started in which prices were falling fast.  Once it was clear that vaccines were going to come into place and that there would be an element of economic recovery, those price drops reversed.<br\/><br\/>The overall amount of inflation we have seen going back to the start of the pandemic is relatively modest.  Prices in Ireland in September were exactly what they would have been if they had grown at an annual rate of 2% from the start of the pandemic, which is the ECB's target.  On the path of how they have reached that level, we see there is an issue of sharp decline and now, when we are looking at figures for October 2020 versus October 2021, for which figures will be released next week, we will see that October 2020 was the bottom of the decline.  That is the base that goes into the calculation of the inflation rate for that period.  The idea is that as we proceed through the following months and into next year, we will not be comparing current prices with that particular artificial lull of the price level.  That is the underlying assumption.<br\/><br\/>That is not to say that October has to be the peak.  As Dr. Kavanagh pointed out, there is a process of the pass-through from wholesale to retail energy prices.  That will go on over the coming months and continue to add to CPI inflation.  It is unclear when the peak will be according to this scenario.  The optimistic scenario is that these are just temporary numbers and base effects and we will largely see them go away.  That is the scenario one can see in the economic projections accompanying the budget.  The Government expects all prices to fall back a bit from their current levels and total and core inflation to be equal to the magic number of 2% in 2022 and beyond.<br\/><br\/>What are the risks on the high side?  One obvious source of risk is that wholesale energy prices do not behave themselves.  There are a lot of stories about the natural gas market, in Europe in particular, showing that it is under a lot of strain.  What will happen with gas price developments in the coming months is likely to depend on factors such as the severity of the winter weather in Europe.  It may depend on Russia's willingness to supply more gas to Europe in the absence of the complex issue of the Nord Stream 2 tunnel and whether it will get approval for quick usage or not.  We also do not have a good handle on when the kind of global bottlenecks and mismatches between supply and demand that we are seeing will be resolved.  We hope they get resolved quickly.  To give one concrete example, we know it takes about three years from ordering a container ship to getting it delivered.  There is a shortage and tightness in the shipping market, which will be in place for some time to come.<br\/><br\/>The argument that it is just base effects and that everything will normalise in the coming months is undermined by the fact that the core CPI, as Dr. Kavanagh has pointed out, has grown at quite a fast pace in recent months.  Going beyond the coming months, we then start to get into the risk that in Ireland and beyond, these high inflation rates will start to fuel the public's expectations of what inflation will be.  We might start to see trade unions looking for higher wages.  Inflation could then get into the system in the way it did in the 1970s and 1980s and we would have a high inflationary wage-price spiral.  Neither professional economists nor people in financial markets who have real money at stake are anticipating this high inflation scenario but it is worth pointing out the risks.<br\/><br\/>Since this is the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, I will talk a little about the budget and possible policy reactions.  It is important to stress that Ireland imports a high fraction of the items that consumers purchase and in general Irish Governments have traditionally not had much control over inflation.  There were not many tools available to the Government in the most recent budget that could offset this kind of largely externally driven inflation that we are seeing.  What we saw in the budget were a number of measures such as adjustment of tax bands and increases in fuel allowances that at least partially offset the impact of the higher inflation on people.<br\/><br\/>The most obvious fiscal policy response is for the Government to consider temporary reductions in VAT rates on certain types of goods and services.  That is a way to reduce the headline inflation rate.  On balance, I would argue against that because it is politically difficult.  We have seen examples of temporary low tax rates being introduced and they generally remain in place beyond the supposedly temporary period for which they were intended.  It is a good thing that the budget did not proceed with various proposals that have been knocking around such as vouchers for the hospitality sector or other measures that would boost domestic demand and fan the flames of what is already an uncomfortably high level of inflation.  In the longer term, in managing the demand and supply mix in the economy the Government has an ambitious capital spending plan.  However, it will have to think about what the capacity of the economy is to deliver on that.  If inflation has already moved up because of various global factors, overheating the domestic economy could just end up making a bad situation considerably worse.<br\/><br\/>It is easy to think of the negatives of a period of higher inflation on the budgetary position.  It places upward pressure on Government spending on wage increases for the public sector and to adjust welfare rates upwards.  It also generally brings in extra revenue and the Government will see extra VAT and corporate tax revenue.  It will also see extra income tax revenue if people are getting wage increases to compensate them.  On balance, the overall effect on the budget and the deficit as a share of GDP depends on decisions the Government takes but is likely to wash out in a neutral way.<br\/><br\/>A greater risk stems from the potential responses of central banks.  A sustained increase in inflation, where it goes above 2% and stays there for a reasonable period of time, would likely see the end of the ECB's accommodative monetary policy and it would be likely to start to raise interest rates.  That would have a fiscal effect because it would increase the costs of Ireland's government debt, which is still high when measured in <i>per capita<\/i>terms.  That said, the public debt has largely been financed via long-term and fixed-rate bonds and loans.  The majority of the public debt does not mature until 2030 and has been locked down at low interest rates.  It would take quite a while for those higher interest rates to have a big fiscal effect.  More worrying is the possibility that the interest rate hikes that a sustained period of high inflation could produce from the ECB, the US Federal Reserve and possibly the Bank of England could lead to another global recession of the style we saw in the 1980s, 1990s and so on when central banks intervened and deliberately restrained the economy to bring inflation down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Karl Whelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>With the kind permission of Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, I will allow Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, who has strong views on this matter, to contribute at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111000002#C00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I will be brief because I respect being given this opportunity.<\/p><p>I thank Dr. Kavanagh and Professor Whelan for their very informed, intelligent and thoughtful contribution.  Their experience and knowledge are most appreciated by all of us.<\/p><p> We can watch world markets and the global price of oil, as I do because I have been the holder of a high-carbon licence for 32 years.  In blunt terms, that means I sell and dispense oil, oil products, diesel and petrol, so I have been closely tuned into the price of a barrel of oil for my entire adult life.  I have not seen before what I have seen happen in the past 12 or 18 months.  It is unprecedented.  The witnesses stated they believed things will start to turn globally next year, but they will not.  We have not discussed the attack on \"mom's purse\" being undertaken by politicians in the Houses of the Oireachtas through the climate budget.  I am not a climate change denier.  I respect very much every person who has strongly held views on climate action or inaction, as I do personally.<\/p><p> I own land so I am the custodian of land.  When I say I own it, I am not carrying it anywhere.  When I die, I will not take it any place with me.  I have never seen any person taking a field into the ground.  People have to leave their land to somebody else.  I hope I will give the land I leave after me to other people in better shape than I got it and I hope they will do the same.  I am the same as every other farmer in Ireland.  Land is not a possession; it is something we use to try to make a couple of pounds of a living or part-time living.<\/p><p> My point is that mom's purse is my economic guide.  It is my financial indicator or barometer of how things are going in the country.  If mom's purse in Ballymullen or Ballybunion is all right, then it is all right around the rest of the world, in my humble opinion.  If it is not, then things are not good.  Mom's purse is under attack.  The reason is that it seems to be socially acceptable to tax the living daylights out of everything at the moment, all in the name of climate action and preventing people from emitting more carbon.<\/p><p> It is totally insane, crazy, bonkers and bananas for someone with a well maintained diesel car that runs well and which is paid for or on which payments are being made to dispose of that good diesel engine and buy an electric car.  First, the electric car is very expensive to buy.  To produce that electric car is expensive and harmful to the environment, as has been proven.  Then there is the energy to charge that electric car.  The Government is telling everyone to go electric and install electric heat pumps in their houses, yet at the same time it is shutting down power stations.  The Government is also talking about trying to bring in gas-powered generators and buying fuel next winter from France and England.  These countries are talking about conserving the energy they have because it is a finite resource.  If it does not suit them, they will not sell it to us and we will potentially have blackouts.<\/p><p> When we talk about budgetary oversight, one of the first things we should do is overseeing ourselves and checking on ourselves and the way we are voting inside in the D&aacute;il when it comes to imposing more taxes on the hard-pressed taxpayers of Ireland and on mom's purse.  Mom's purse is a seriously attacked personal possession.  We should be taking a more considered view on taxation.  I am not someone who will blindly continue to vote for and support increased taxes because someone has to pay for them at the end of the day.  What is happening is wrong.  We should be like France and Italy.  The Government should decide to reduce taxes on fuel because it is taking an awful lot of money away from people in taxes.  It should reduce the tax take it is getting from energy costs because people simply cannot afford it any more.<\/p><p> I will keep to my promise.  I just wanted to make those points.  It would be neglectful for us to have an engagement on budgetary oversight without talking about the elephant in the room, and that elephant is us.  Whether we are Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Independents or Sinn F&eacute;in, we are responsible to the people who elected.  There is an onus of responsibility on us.  At the moment, all we seem to be doing is attacking, hurting and crippling them with inflation that we are causing.  Globally, we can say there are other contributing factors but it is we, the politicians, who are one of the biggest things hitting people at the moment.  Every one of us has look in the mirror and ask what way we will vote tonight.  What did people say today when they stood up and made lovely speeches?  Will they support the motion brought forward by the Rural Independent Group or will they pay us lip service today and vote against us tonight?

Let us be honest that there is much uncertainty out there at present about what could happen.<\/p> <p>  My worry would be that the way we view inflation now is quite different.  There is so much talk about inflation now whereas before, prior to the pandemic, it hardly entered any of our thinking.  That has definitely changed.  I wonder, therefore, if it will become much more a consideration for people in terms of, as Professor Whelan said as well, negotiating wages to ensure that they are able to cover this higher-price inflation they expect will be there in the future.  Unfortunately, the danger is that it will lead, as wages go up, to prices going up.  That would be a concern for me.  It is so much in the news at present and people are so aware of it that I suppose my worry for the future would be that it becomes embedded in people's thinking and, therefore, affects the decisions which they will be making in the future.

That statement is much stronger than those being made by central bankers in the UK or at the Federal Reserve.  Professor Lane's argument is basically that there is a set of circumstances that have been in place in Europe dating back to 2008-2009 which have together meant systematically low inflation and the ECB has put in place historically unprecedented levels of stimulus from the central bank and still not seen inflation rise that much.  They look at the pandemic and they say that after the pandemic, all the forces that were in place that were leading to there being not much pricing power for firms, and perhaps demographic factors that mean that lots of people in Europe are saving rather than spending, are still all in place.  The pandemic did not make any of those go away.  I think that is their ultimate argument for why it is that these forces will recede and we will end up sometime next year looking around and the economy will look much like it did before the pandemic, and in that era the economy was structurally almost incapable of delivering high inflation.  I think that is their argument.<br\/><br\/>I will give one argument as to why they are somewhat on shaky ground and give the inside baseball on this topic in the profession.  Neither the central banking community nor the academic economics community is currently feeling that it has a very good theory of the determinants of inflation.  The Federal Reserve for years relied on what we call the &quot;Phillips curve&quot;, which is, basically, if the unemployment rate gets low and the economy gets hot, you will see inflation.  The Federal Reserve, Fed, more or less walked away from the Phillips curve as a framework in the period prior to the pandemic.  Mr. Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, oversaw a review of the monetary policy and their previous cycle where they had raised interest rates was not because they had seen high inflation but only because unemployment was low.  Within that framework, you have to come out and say &quot;We actively want to raise unemployment&quot;, which, if you think about, means there are people in jobs now when we actively want them to not be in jobs because we think their being in jobs is a threat to inflation.  When they went through that, the inflation never appeared.  Therefore, even prior to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve had been cutting inflation.  A prominent member of the Federal Reserve board, on quitting his seven-year position a couple of years go, Professor Daniel Tarullo, stated it was his assessment that the Federal Reserve did not have a working model of inflation that was useful.  There was a recent paper by a very senior Federal Reserve economist, who is an old friend of mine and somebody I wrote a number of academic papers with, Dr. Jerome Rudd, who has been a bit of a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre<\/i>in the central banking and macroeconomic world where he said that lots of these theories that we have, that everything is driven by inflation expectations and central banks are able to anchor inflation expectations by going out and giving speeches, are all nonsense and nobody listens to central banks.<br\/><br\/>Dr. Rudd's concern, I guess, is that when people - to follow up on the final point Dr. Kavanagh made - get concerned about inflation it starts to influence their decision-making, and then it really matters.  It does not matter until they wake up and it is 5% and then it does matter.  The concern is the ECB's confidence and the Government's confidence that when the tides roll out we are just back in the same economy that we were and there just may be a day we wake up and realise that is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111000002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Karl Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Whelan.

It has introduced an uncertainty, as Professor Whelan mentioned, into the supply chain, which we have not been familiar with.  Whether companies react to that by building more security and ensuring they have the component parts closer to them and more readily available is a major consideration.  That might affect their investment decisions as to where they locate, etc.  That would be important.<\/p> <p>  If costs increase for businesses, one would expect that competition means they would look at the supply chain again and try to minimise costs.

If their natural inclination is to try to increase efficiencies as much as possible, we might expect them to return to old patterns of behaviour.  For example, we have seen that, since the financial crisis, banks now hold a larger buffer of capital.

Having lots of the supply chain in China and far-flung parts is cheap but not necessarily secure.  There is a trade-off there.  Different businesses will settle on different ways of coping with that but it seems likely some businesses will decide to source parts in Ireland or Europe rather than China because the security of their supply to those they supply and sell to is foremost for them.  That means it will not be as cheap and those costs will ultimately get passed on.  There is a lot of evidence that supply chains were about as stretched as we could let them be in terms of operating safely.  That is another element that is likely to show up in increased costs and possibly higher inflation than we saw in the past.  One of the many stories about low inflation over the past decade was sourcing things really cheaply in China.

There was another conversation earlier about the carbon tax.  What proportion is external and what proportion is internal?  Would it be a 60:40 split or is the split closer to 80:20?  What level of influence do domestic factors such as the carbon tax, the stay and spend scheme and the capital programme have?  We are seeing an ambitious capital programme which will be far bigger than any carbon tax or stay and spend scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111000002#F00700","speaker":"1455"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I would describe as external almost all of what we have seen in Ireland until now.  It is external either in the sense of coming from abroad, as in the case of higher energy prices which are a global issue, or higher goods prices, which applies to almost all goods we export, or else it is external in the sense of being beyond the control of the Government, such as some of what we are seeing with the pandemic.  Part of this base effect was, for instance, that one could buy an airline ticket in August, September or October last year, but people did not feel it was safe to travel and the right conditions were not in place.  Airlines were flying half empty and practically giving tickets away.  Now there are more people flying so tickets are more expensive.  It is the same with restaurants and hotels.  That is a contributing factor.  It is completely outside the control of governments in that they have to do what they do with restrictions and do what is best for public health.  The inflation we are seeing is largely a result of external developments and the pandemic recovery.<\/p> <p>  Across the world, there are places which have generated their own internally and policy driven inflation.  The most recent number hot off the presses today is that the US consumer price index, CPI, for October is over 6.3% year on year.  In addition to the global factors we are talking about, that is clearly driven by a very aggressive fiscal response, which includes multiple rounds of stimulus cheques mailed to people that are burning a hole in their pockets.  We have not done anything like that here.<\/p> <p>  The capital spending programme is something I would flag for the next couple of years.  I am not referring to any individual item but if we add it all up, we seen that the Government wants to make public transport infrastructure investment, build roads and make lots of investment in public housing and climate-related energy areas.  When one starts adding it up, one wonders where all the builders for this will come from.  Once the economy starts to recover, we have to think about whether it could overheat.  We can see domestic overheating.  I refer to the first figure I provided in my briefing and the wording I used.  I indicated inflation was higher than we have seen since prior to 2008.  In Ireland, in the couple of years prior to 2008, inflation was running at 5%.  It was a bit funny to go back and look at it because I do not remember people talking about it.  The times were so good and everybody's wage increases were so far ahead of inflation that I do not remember much talk about it.  That was internally driven inflation.  It was driven by an overheated economy and, in particular, an overheated construction sector.

The ECB will not move quickly.  Professor Lane's strongly worded interventions over the past few days can be taken as indicative of the stance of the ECB's president, Ms Christine Lagarde, and the majority of its governing council.  The ECB will not start raising interest rates immediately as the first policy reaction.  Currently, it is still pursuing its quantitative easing programmes, its purchasing of government and corporate bonds and other measures.  All of this is contributing to lower interest rates for government borrowing and so on.  The first step the ECB will take is winding those programmes down.  It will not shut them down immediately.  Rather, it will announce a schedule by which it will slow the pace of purchases and then stop them.  After that, it will think about raising interest rates.  I suggest that next summer would be the very earliest that we would see an actual interest rate increase in the wild.  If I knew, though, then I would run my own bond fund and collect lots of money.<\/p> <p>  Suffice it to say that for many people who are on variable rate mortgages or relying on the very cheap finance conditions of recent years, an interest rate increase could be a shock.  If it comes to pass, we will probably find that many financial institutions that have taken positions that are dependent on interest rates being very low for a long time will be caught on the hop.  Relative to what people have expected the ECB to do, it would be a fast turnaround if it was raising interest rates by next summer.  Perhaps it can do that and avoid engineering a recession.  There are plenty of historical examples of central banks raising interest rates to squeeze inflation out of the system and recession being a by-product.  When I was an economist in short pants, that was the stereotypical recession.  It was a boom-bust cycle.  There was inflation during the boom, a central bank stepped in to take away the punch bowl and then there was a recession.  As such, there would be a number of concerns.  Knowing that a relatively fast changing of pace in monetary policy could be damaging is one reason the ECB is so reluctant to talk now about doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Karl Whelan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":178,"content":"<p>To add to that, this would be the first increase in interest rates in a long time.

I am a little bit of a pessimist in this regard.  I raised this question numerous times in the run up to the financial collapse.  Our guests might not have read the Official Report, but I raised this question time and again.  We were cautioned not to raise it lest it cause a run on the currency, on investment or on confidence.  I felt that we were heading towards a disaster, so I asked whether the fundamentals of the economy were on a safe footing.  That was the only way I could get around the scares.  I got one good answer that told me \"No\", and then the whole thing fell down.  Everything was denied afterwards and we know what happened.<\/p> <p>  House prices are a major contributor to inflation and have been for some considerable time.  They will ultimately be a contributor to demands for higher wages, at which point the spiral will take off.  I am willing to be convinced that current inflation will only last for a short duration and we will see a reduction during the second quarter of 2022, but if it does not happen that way, we could be in for a shock.  Some means will have to be found to arrest the trend in inflation.<\/p> <p>  Professor J. K. Galbraith used to say that, if we stimulated the economy, we would inevitably need to introduce price controls in order not to contribute to inflation.  That is laughable to everyone nowadays, but we had price controls in the 1970s and 1980s because we needed to.  There was no other mechanism available and inflation took off along a serious tangent.  Our guests will remember how bank interest rates eventually increased to 17% or 18%.  I remember dealing with people who were charged 25% penalty rates and so forth.  At that stage, nothing could happen and the economy was in a downward spiral.  I hope that does not happen again.<\/p> <p>  I will pose a question, but never mind \"on the one hand and on the other hand\".

Ours is a small, open economy and most of the goods we buy are coming in from the rest of the world.  We do not set those prices.  The Government has no magic formula for getting low gas or oil prices.  Being part of the euro means some of the tools we had in the past whereby we could have focused on domestic inflation are gone.  We do not set our own monetary policy, we cannot set interest rates high because inflation is high in Ireland and we do not have an exchange rate that we can adjust.  There are price and wage controls but, historically, they do not really work, and there is lots of evidence from the 1970s of price and wage controls being introduced and not working.   We have a micro-study of our own going on right now with regard to rent controls, which seem to be a bit of a leaky sieve in that rent inflation seems to be proceeding apace, even with the various controls that are in place.  That is relatively consistent with what has happened with price and wage controls in the past.<\/p> <p>  We are left with a sort of boring answer, which is prudent management of fiscal policy and to try to avoid using fiscal policy to have the economy get over-stimulated.  When we look back at the period of 2008-09 or prior to that, perhaps a lot of the public expenditure and capital expenditure that was done during that period - all of the motorways that were built and so on - could have been done at a slower pace and we might have had more money left later to smooth things out.  That is a major instrument that we have but we are a bit like a golfer with one club.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the housing market more generally, we have macroprudential policies in place to try to prevent a collapse.  Borrowers are not given 100% mortgages anymore and they have much more equity in their homes than they did, so we are less likely to get into a negative equity situation.  We are not quite on the verge.

It is when there are a number of competing elements, all of which contribute to inflation, that I would get worried, and I mentioned house prices for starters, although there are other issues.  However, there are some areas where we could control our own destiny to some extent, for instance, in regard to energy.  We could have produced more energy, particularly wind energy, over the last number of years, and while there are those who would say that is linked to international energy prices, that is not necessarily the case.  If we are able to buy it from ourselves at a lower rate, it has to make some beneficial contribution in the context of inflation.  That is the kind of thing we need to be looking at now because energy is a critical issue.  If we do what has to be done in that area and produce energy at a competitive rate, at least it will be of benefit to our own market.  If the time comes when we can sell it to others, that will be of benefit to our economy as well.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to delay the meeting and I have to attend another meeting where I have to ask questions also.  I will finish by saying that I believe we need to watch it very carefully.  All possibilities need to be examined with the objective in mind of arresting the trend in inflation.  If the trend continues for too long, it will create problems and reversing it will be that much harder.  We could curtail credit and we could increase taxes, and all of these things have been done before, but all of them will also slow down the economy, of course, so that remains to be seen.

Would the witnesses say some of our energy costs are related to the fact we have not put in place bridging measures when trying to get rid of fossil fuels, turf burning and so on?  There has been a rush of blood to stop all of that bad stuff without actually having the transitional arrangements in place, so we have left ourselves with a gap and we are now at the mercy of Russia and other places to supply us with gas.  The Corrib gas field off the coast of Mayo has been in decline for a number of years yet there has been a reluctance and we have frightened away gas and oil exploration, when I think we have time to run on that yet.  It seems that we have had a rush of blood to the head and we have got rid of stuff.  By the same token, if someone is buying a new car, whether electric or diesel, as was mentioned earlier, they will not sell their car until the new car is on the forecourt and they can go and collect it.  We have created a gap which has created a shortage of energy, and this is also the case internationally, I believe.  Now, we are relying on people who hold the strings and who may not be very adept at sharing what they have, or who see potential in it.

We have seen that in terms of the increasing demand for gas as it is considered to be the bridging fuel between the heavy fossil fuels and more renewable energy.  China&rsquo;s and India's move towards gas has certainly increased the demand for gas on global markets and has put pressure upwards on the price of gas.  That is on the one hand.  On the other, what it suggests is that, if prices are increasing like that and if that increases dependency on particular sources of gas, it is all the more important that one begins to move towards removing the dependence on these energy fuels.  The argument one could make is that it is really important to start reorienting away from those and to focus in on more renewable energies, and that is a matter of some importance and some urgency if the energy market continues to behave as it is currently.<\/p> <p>  That is a particular view.  I can understand why one would like to temper that move but it is almost giving us a reason or an incentive, to put it that way.  The prices are rising as there is increasing demand for gas and other fossil fuels, and that is acting as an incentive to move away from those sources.  Unfortunately, what we are seeing is a move back towards fossil fuels and the reopening of stations that use fossil fuels.  It suggests to me a greater impetus towards renewables and moving in that direction, and moving away from dependence on fossil fuels and carbon fuels, given these very volatile movements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111000002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ella Kavanagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>To be fair, it was always so.<\/p><p>We are a small, open economy and as long as I have lived, we have been dependent on external energy supplies and were affected by the first and second OPEC shocks and so on.

We have the potential to be self-sufficient and an international net supplier.  We have the potential on the west coast of Ireland, but we are only now developing our national maritime planning legislation to work out a system by which we do it, which seems should have been done 20 years ago.  We did not do it and all of sudden, in a rush of blood to the head to get rid of stuff, two power stations have been closed down and probably rightly so.  However, our current shortage of energy does not give us the impetus to do something about it because we are punishing the people as we do that and turning them against the idea of climate action by penalising them.  I am not talking about carbon tax, but increasing costs.<\/p> <p>  The other area I have concern about with inflation is farming.  The cost of farmers' inputs is rising.  Fertiliser has gone up from &euro;425 per tonne, to more than &euro;800 per tonne.  The farming community is not a price giver.  It has to take whatever price is there and, therefore, it cannot add the price of fertiliser to the price of the bullock, sheep or pig going to the market.  It has to take whatever price the market will give it on the day.  That is a significant problem.  We will have a reduction in output because people will not buy as much fertiliser as they will not be able to afford it.  Consequently, there will be a reduction in food supply and more inflation when the consumer wants to buy over the counter.  The farmer will not be dictating the price.  It will be dictated in other areas.  I have an issue with that.<\/p> <p>  We have the cost of construction materials and labour, which is going up, but also the cost of our regulation in terms of the way we want our houses built now.  The cost of building passive homes, planning permission and connecting to utilities is driving up the costs further and further.  Regardless of what we do, people cannot afford a mortgage because of the rules on the mortgage one can have, affordability and one's ability to pay back.  We are creating a perfect storm in the construction industry.  With construction inflation, public works contracts have been signed as fixed-price contracts for the next three years, which will drive people out of business and drive good people to the UK to seek business, rather than try to do business here, where we have such a system at play.<\/p> <p>  When one increases wages in line with inflation, everything goes up in price, but so does Government tax take.  It comes back to the Government through VAT, PAYE, PRSI and USC.  We should not worry too much about inflation, except when it goes at a pace faster than which we can keep pace and we are running to stand still or end up further back in the chain a year later.  The idea of increasing interest rates is fine, but people who have mortgages and are meeting them fairly well will find themselves under pressure.  There is a positivity.  Businesses do not have the same debt levels as they did during the bust of 2007 to 2008.  Companies are stronger, but there are many unknowns.

I will echo some of what the Deputy has said.  Economists sometimes underplay inflation as a problem.  They say inflation is 4% to 5%, but if people are, on average, getting wage increases of 4% to 5%, then everybody comes out of it not really worse off and it is an annoyance prices are going up.  People get annoyed prices are going up, but think they deserve that 4% wage increase.  The problem is no individual or business is the average person or business.  As the Deputy pointed out with farming, when one sees inflationary pressures and increased costs, businesses that can pass those costs on will cope fine and those that cannot, will not cope fine.<\/p> <p>  However, there are analogies beyond business.  People on fixed incomes which will not go up with inflation will do badly.  Somebody who has an investment portfolio on the stock market will do better because the firms charging these higher prices will end up getting higher profits.  The higher levels of inflation we have seen over the past few years unleash a set of distributional questions.  Distributional and sectoral questions are not easily dealt with.  If the high inflation of the coming years is tough on the farming sector, there may be a European approach with the CAP, farming subsidies and so on.

I did not hear their earlier contributions because I was at another committee next door.  It was a bit frustrating.  I apologise in advance if I repeat questions.  What do the witnesses think of what I would favour to deal with energy price rises, rent and house price increases and other forms of inflation which will adversely impact on our economy and society?  I favour controls.  Controls, in and of themselves, do not solve all the problems.  If there is a genuine lack of supply in an area, the controls do not solve the problem because of either genuine shortages or as I expect it is much of the time, bad planning, whether it is a failure to plan or allowing market cycles to determine the supply of certain things.<\/p><p>Having said all that, and if we take housing inflation as an example, while I do not think rent controls solve all the problems, as a stopgap until we get planning right on housing and we can deliver the supply that would at least deal with the shortage, it is a legitimate thing to do.  The other aspect is if we need to subsidise certain things because they are just too important to allow them get out of the reach of ordinary people then we must subsidise them.  We accept that logic in some areas but we often reject it in others.  I would argue we must subsidise certain things because we just have to have them.  Thus if public transport costs are getting too expensive, one cannot keep letting them get more expensive, especially if one wants to get people out of their cars.  One must say we are going to subsidise to make it cheap and affordable and that we are going to do the same with housing.  Of course, energy becomes more controversial because there is a climate imperative but also an imperative to ensure ordinary people can heat their homes.  I would be interested in the economists' views but I certainly think controlling energy prices at this point is a legitimate thing to do, however it is done.  That might be holding off on carbon taxes or just controlling the prices.  I would like to hear the economists' thoughts on using price controls, essentially, to deal with these problems.  They would not be a silver bullet but a mechanism, until we get the planning side right, to deliver things that can ensure shortages are not generating inflation or bottlenecks, for that matter, in particular areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111000002#J00400","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>One of the issues with controls is they can actually have the effect of reducing supply.  If one has a rent control in place, economists would argue this could have the effect of reducing the amount of accommodation actually supplied on to the market, even as is, even at this moment.  That would be one of the arguments against using rent controls.  At the same time, by having a lower rent one could have, dare I see it, a much greater demand.  I personally believe the issue really comes down to increasing the supply, focusing in on that and trying as much as possible to increase the supply of housing accommodation because it clearly is one of the major issues behind this and behind what we are seeing with rents.  To reiterate the point about rental costs, in the CPI information is given about rental increases.  What we have seen is although rental prices came down somewhat at the start of the pandemic, we now see them accelerating once again.  Even if there are controls in place or some measure controlling them, there might be ways of bypassing that.  We are definitely seeing rental rates increasing again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111000002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ella Kavanagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":195,"content":"<p>To that I add price controls are a natural response when one sees high inflation.  Inflation is prices going up so let us go straight for the target and stop the prices going up.  I am sure the Deputy and I could have a great debate about the role of prices in the market system and we could talk about Hayek versus Marx and so on, and all that good stuff.  Beyond the philosophical issues, the practical point is in general the evidence shows price controls do not work and that people get around them.  Businesses get around them and people are willing to pay more for things to get reasonable supplies.  Almost every place around the world where one has seen high rates of inflation, eventually they go and implement price controls of some sort and they never really seem to work.  I also point out that in this country, some of the background discussion that has been had on the current rent controls concerns the legal limits on the State's ability to intervene with people's businesses and their property rights in terms of what they can actually do, how they run their business and how they use their assets.  On widespread price controls, even if one did think there was a man in the Department of Finance who knew the right price for everything - and even the Department would not claim there is such a man or woman - then even if that is something we thought was desirable it is unlikely to be legal.<\/p> <p>  However, we have to take things like higher energy prices.  On energy prices, we cannot on the one hand send people off to COP26 and talk the talk about global climate and then say now is not the time to continue with the carbon tax and that it should now be suspended and so on.  Given how poor our performance has been on climate change targets it is the wrong policy approach to roll back carbon taxes at this point and for this reason.  That is not to say we do not look at the distributional implications or the effect on people and the cost of people heating their homes.  That is why we have fuel allowance.  We should keep a very close look at what happens with energy prices in the next couple of months.  If the fuel allowance that was provided for in the budget is not big enough then it should be changed and increased.  We should always accompany any analysis of carbon taxes or energy-related policies with a distributional analysis of how it affects the poorest and what we can do with the money that has been raised by these taxes to offset that.  There are other cases and clear cases where governments should set prices below market level and I fully endorse Deputy Boyd Barrett's call for subsidised public transport.  Of course if we want people to use public transport more then it should be an awful lot cheaper than it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Karl Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Yes.  I am glad I agree with Professor Whelan on something there, namely, the last point.  I respectfully disagree with the economists on the issue of rents, house prices and so on.  I will make the obvious point.  I made it to the Taoiseach and have made it several times in this debate as supply, supply, supply is always the answer.  Forget about the debate between Marx and Hayek, as interesting as that is.  I point to our own recent experience.  When we had the greatest supply of housing in the history of the State by a long chalk, that is, during the Celtic tiger period, when between 70,000 and 90,000 houses and apartments were being built every year, prices did not go down at any point.  They consistently rose.  That is because the market and the people who were providing had no interest whatsoever in prices falling.  None.  To my mind, they will not, of their own volition, increase supply to the point at which prices drop.  Why would they?  They would be mad to do that, from their point of view.  However, from society's point of view the control they have over something as absolutely critical as housing is just not acceptable.  I agree with the economists that controls, in and of themselves, are not the silver bullet.  However, where the market has clearly failed, as it has in housing, one must do something to get something as basic as housing to a level that is affordable.  At the moment it is simply is not and if one says wait for the supply to come on stream one will be waiting a very long time.  I would like to hear the economists' answer to how they riddle that one but it seems to me one has to intervene.  To an extent, I take Professor Whelan's point about the constitutional provisions around private property.  It is interesting how that defence suddenly collapsed when rent pressure zones, RPZs, were brought in and so on.<\/p><p> I would like to see all this legal advice from the Attorney General.  I am less than convinced about that excuse.  The Government has promised a referendum on housing.  Let us get on with it and have a referendum in which private property rights could be diluted in order to vindicate something as basic as the right to housing.<\/p><p> Regarding energy, it is not an opinion but a fact that the rich are the greatest producers of carbon emissions, so whether geographically or socially, the poor are being punished for the crimes of the rich in destroying our planet.  However, we are saying that we should keep loading a self-evidently regressive measure onto the shoulders of the poor.  The rich who cause the problems will not be particularly bothered by the carbon tax increases, so there is a real problem with regard to justice, which I believe is central.  The climate objectives cannot be delivered if justice is not at the heart of it.  It will turn most people off the climate agenda.  We cannot afford to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111000002#K00400","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>One reason for the increase in house prices prior to the crash was the expansion in credit.  We would expect today that in light of the sort of regulations that have been put in place by the Central Bank, there should be more control over the expansion of credit.

The situation is quite different today compared with before the crisis.<\/p> <p>  Professor Whelan highlighted fuel prices and their impact on people on fixed incomes, and the associated distribution issues.  They are key.  Consequently, the fuel allowance should be looked at again in light of the increase in energy prices if they continue to increase.  If they continue to be volatile, they might come back down again, and there would therefore not be a long-term effect on individuals.  However, if they continue to increase, that would suggest a review of those fuel allowances is necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111000002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ella Kavanagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I want to say a word about house prices.  They contribute to inflation because expensive housing leads to people having to look for higher wages to be able to afford where they live.  That affects costs throughout the economy in many ways.  Regarding Government intervention, we clearly have a housing market that is dysfunctional in many ways and many different things could be done.  Regarding supply capacity, I note today's Daft.ie report on the number of rental properties available across the country.  It is extremely low.  There are very few places for people to rent.  I see this as an academic.  Our students struggle to find places to rent.  Colleagues coming from other countries to work with us struggle to find places to live.  Availability is not a heap of laughs for people looking to buy their own properties either.  We need to start by noting that there is clearly a scarcity of housing in the country relative to what we need.  We have not repealed the law of economics which states that when something is scarce, it will be more expensive.  One reason that rents are so high is because it is so difficult to get rental properties as a result of their being so scarce.  The same applies to house purchase costs.  There is a talking point that, although we built many houses in the 2000s and somehow the prices went up, that is somehow irrelevant and the scarcity that we see has nothing to do with the high prices.  I strongly disagree with that.  It would be great if we had more supply, with much affordable public housing.  The only issue that I have with that is that it is expensive.<\/p> <p>  One should look at the Government's capacity within the dreaded EU fiscal rules.  I suspect that in the past, the Deputy might have heard me complaining about the fiscal rules, but they exist.  The ESRI gives a figure of 33,000 housing units being needed a year.  That is probably an underestimate.  The reality is that we will need the private sector to produce units as well as public housing being built.  It is not a case of and-or, but rather, as with the girl from the meme emoji, \"Why not both?\"  That is what we need to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111000002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Karl Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

Everybody ends up being sent a cheque.  It looks much like a tax cut or tax refund, so the ECB feels that it is a fiscal policy, when it is supposed to be dealing with monetary policy.  I do not think that we will ever see it.  The ECB has created low financing conditions over the past decade.  It has made it not just free for Governments to borrow but instead Governments, including our own, have been able to borrow at negative interest rates.  The ECB has created those conditions.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the pandemic response, we did not need the helicopters because the Government could source money at will.  In a sense, the ECB has created almost helicopter money-like conditions by the back door, by making it cheap to borrow.

I expect sovereign debt borrowing costs to be low, which raises questions about whether we can borrow more.

In the European context, what it has always meant is that when inflation is above 2%, the European Central Bank, ECB, has had its hair on fire, so to speak, to try to get inflation down and when it is below 2% it has not always been as worried.  The ECB has been more concerned in recent years following many years of being below target to at least be seen to be pursuing expansionary policy to meet its target.  That is one of the issues.  If people are thinking about what will happen to prices in the next number of years, if the inflation target is 2%, one would think prices will go up by 2% per year and in five years time, they will be up 10% effectively.  With the way the ECB has implemented inflation targeting, it has not worked like that.  Prices are up less than 10% and then it is hard to forecast how much of a shortfall there will be in that respect.<\/p> <p>  What we have seen recently with the Federal Reserve is that it has moved to what is called average inflation targeting, which is basically a commitment that if inflation is below its target of 2% for some period of time, it will then accept a period of inflation above 2% so that when it is averaged over, one gets 2%.  That is closer to what economists would call price level targeting, making the price level predictable over time.  I have always felt that is a better policy.  <\/p> <p>  I would note the ECB's monetary policy strategy review.  It spent 18 months reviewing its monetary policy strategy and announced with great fanfare the new strategy during the summer.  It explicitly said that it is not its policy.

We discussed to some extent the expectation that inflation will be a relatively short-run thing, that it will not last for a long period.  I am mindful the European Commission has just relaunched its review of EU economic governance.

Is it simply from Government or do experts like our guests get involved in the fiscal rules discussion at that level?   The other question I have is that if this level of inflation is not a short-run thing, if it is still with us when the fiscal rules may click back into place in 2023, what mechanisms would they expect to see, or could we see, within it to address issues of continuing inflation?

I play a role with the European Parliament engaging with monetary policy in the ECB and making advice and recommendations there.  I do that on a more formal level.  That is to what I tend to largely restrict myself.<\/p> <p>  On the issues of what will happen with inflation and what will happen with the debate on the fiscal rules, they will not be totally separate.  The ECB sees price stability as its goal but the mood music around the discussion over the next year on the reintroduction of the fiscal rules will be affected by inflation.  Clearly, some countries would like to reintroduce the fiscal rules as they have existed previously and to have a quick and fast reintroduction versus quite a number of countries that would like to see a milder version of the rules.  If it looks as though inflation is possibly getting out of control European-wide, then, to use economic parlance, the hawks will have a better argument than the doves that fiscal policy needs to be playing its role in constraining the economy.  <\/p> <p>  The greater problem with the fiscal rules is that they are very badly designed.  They have those two numbers, the 60% debt-to-GDP ratio and the 3% deficit.  Somebody plucked them out of the air in the late 1980s or early 1990s.  They might have been appropriate then but they are not now and that is the problem.  Ideally, what we would need is some form of treaty change but a treaty change in any controversial area is extremely difficult to executive.  In practice, we are seeing proposals around, for example, while the 60% ratio is formally in the treaty the Commission would really only focus on encouraging countries whose debt ratios are above 100% debt-to-GDB ratio.

On behalf of the committees, I welcome from the House of Lords Sub-committee on the Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland, Lord Jay of Ewelme, Chair; Lord Empey; Baroness Goudie; Baroness O&rsquo;Loan; Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick; Lord Thomas of Gresford; and Lord Hain.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege.  However, before we do that, perhaps the other Co-Chairmen, Deputy Lawless and Senator Chambers, can introduce themselves.  I know that Deputy Lawless wants to say a few words on the sad passing of former Deputy Austin Currie, who many members met and knew over the years.  We are all thinking of Austin Currie's family.  His daughter, Senator Emer Currie, is a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  I invite Deputy Lawless to say a few words.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021111000002#B00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I thank the Co-Chairman.  At the outset, I wish to state that I look forward to today's engagement.  It is a timely and constructive engagement.  It is a privilege to have the three committees together and to be joined by Members of the House of Lords sub-committee today.  I look forward to the engagement.  As alluded to by Lord Hain, events are moving quickly, so the engagement is timely.  I look forward to constructive engagement.  This is exactly how it should be done.  Politics is the art of the possible.  Connecting, as we are doing today, can only advance that.<\/p> <p>  As the Co-Chairman said, I wish to mention former Deputy Austin Currie, who sadly passed away overnight.  He epitomised much of what the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the other committees represented here today are about.  He straddled both sides of the island and, indeed, the two islands, in the sense that he served as a Member of the D&aacute;il, a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly and a Member of Parliament at Westminster.  He was one of the few individuals who had that experience and contributed across the island and the islands.  He brought that spirit of collegiality and peaceful progress.  He was an advocate for civil rights in the early days and progressed through the political spectrum.  He made a huge contribution across the island and to politics in general.  Sadly, he passed away at his home in County Kildare, which is the constituency I happen to represent.  He will be greatly missed.  Above all, I extend my sympathies to his family.  He is survived by his children and grandchildren.  In particular, I extend my sympathies to his daughter, Senator Emer Currie, who is a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and has made a very strong contribution in her short time here.

I thank them very much for the invitation to be with them today.  We are really glad to be here.  First, on behalf of the committee, as a whole, I share the sadness which has already been expressed at the death of Austin Currie.  I would like to say that right at the very beginning.<br\/><br\/>For those members whom I have not met before, my name is Michael Jay.  I chair the House of Lords Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland Sub-Committee.  I have been pleased, in the context of the House of Lords's scrutiny of the impact of Brexit on Ireland and Northern Ireland, to visit the Oireachtas on a number of occasions, and to have met many members, and it is a pleasure to see them again.<br\/><br\/>The protocol committee includes a wide range of views and expertise both on Northern Ireland and the protocol itself.  Our membership includes senior representatives of political parties in Northern Ireland from both unionist and nationalist perspectives, and draws from wider expertise in Northern Ireland affairs in the House of Lords.  A range of these voices is represented in our delegation today, and my colleagues will introduce themselves the first time they speak.  I should add that Jonathan Caine, Lord Caine, would have been with us today but over the weekend he was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office and, therefore, has left the committee with immediate effect.<br\/><br\/>Many members were present when a delegation of our committee participated in a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in June.  At that stage our committee was in its infancy, having been set up in April.  Much has happened since then and it may be helpful for me to summarise our work over the past five months.<br\/><br\/>On 29 July, the committee published its introductory report.  The chapters of the report set out in turn: the committee&rsquo;s role; the development of the protocol; the economic impact of the protocol, including both the challenges and the potential opportunities it presents; the political and social impact of the protocol; and potential mitigations and solutions.  The report acknowledged the difficulties in seeking to uphold seemingly contradictory principles underlying the protocol, namely, avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland while at the same time maintaining Northern Ireland&rsquo;s place within the UK internal market.  It acknowledged mistakes both by the UK and EU which had led to a mutual breakdown in trust.<br\/><br\/>At around the same time as the report was published, the UK Government published its command paper: Northern Ireland protocol, the next steps.  This was followed by the publication last month of the four Commission non-papers on the operation of the protocol.  Our work during the autumn has primarily focused on scrutinising the issues highlighted in these papers.  In September we heard evidence from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland on the operation of Article 2 on rights of individuals, a vital issue that is often in our view overlooked amidst the political focus on trade issues.  We wrote a detailed letter to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland last month on those issues.  In October, we held an evidence session with representatives of the pharmaceuticals industry on the impact of the protocol on the provision of medicines in Northern Ireland.  This is an issue of universal concern to all citizens, regardless of community or political affiliation.  We will shortly write to Lord Frost summarising our concerns.<br\/><br\/>Meanwhile our key work in scrutinising EU law applying to Northern Ireland under the protocol continues.  We have now written more than 50 letters to UK Government Ministers on the various regulations, directives and delegated Acts brought forward over recent months that will apply to Northern Ireland.  Last week, we held a seminar on perceptions of a democratic deficit under the protocol, whereby EU law applies to Northern Ireland without its consent, and on ways to enhance Northern Ireland&rsquo;s voice and influence in relation to the protocol.  We heard from a wide range of business representatives, academics and parliamentarians from across the political spectrum, sharing perspectives from Westminster, Stormont, Brussels and Dublin, and we were delighted that Oireachtas colleagues were able to join us at that meeting.  That engagement was a demonstration of our firm commitment to continued interparliamentary dialogue with all those with an interest in the protocol and in Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Today&rsquo;s meeting is another welcome opportunity to strengthen engagement between the Oireachtas and Westminster, and between our committees.  I very much hope that we will be able to build on this engagement in the coming months, including, as the public health situation improves, by meeting in person, both in Dublin and in London.  We look forward to answering members' questions about our work, but before we do so, let me finish my opening remarks by quoting the final conclusion from our introductory report: <\/p> <blockquote> \tAddressing the issues of conflicting identity that first Brexit, and then the Protocol, have brought to the fore seems an insoluble problem.  That was also true of the political situation in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.  But through a slow and painstaking process led by political leaders in Northern Ireland and successive governments in London and Dublin, the peace process took root and flourished, leading to the Belfast Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent steps towards a powersharing arrangement.  This process took time, patience, dialogue, and most of all trust.  The same is true in addressing the problems that Brexit and the protocol present for Northern Ireland.  There is therefore an urgent imperative for all sides to make concerted efforts to build trust by recommitting themselves to that process of dialogue, repairing the damage caused to relations across these islands during the past five years, in the interests, as the protocol rightly acknowledges, of communities in both Ireland and Northern Ireland. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021111000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Lord Jay of Ewelme"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I thank Lord Jay for that presentation.

It is nice to see them again.  I join with the other speakers in conveying my sympathy to the family of Austin Currie.  I was listening to Colm Eastwood on the radio this morning.  He outlined how Austin Currie and the SDLP adopted peaceful protest to bring about change, they adopted dialogue, and that is a lesson that all of us have taken on board, having regard to the peace process.<\/p> <p>  I thank the House of Lords sub-committee for the work it has done.  It undertook painstaking work and consulted widely.  Its report is diplomatic.  It stated the UK approach has had shortcomings in transparency, clarity and readiness while the EU approach has had shortcomings in balance, understanding and flexibility.  That is very diplomatic indeed.<\/p> <p>  As we speak, all the talk in the Irish political system is about the possibility of the UK triggering Article 16.  I would plead with the House of Lords sub-committee to use its influence to ensure that does not happen.  I hope it is a negotiating tactic.  The Taoiseach informed the D&aacute;il last week that such a move would be irresponsible, unwise and reckless and would certainly damage EU-UK relations and British-Irish relations as well.  The consequences of that would lead to some sort of retaliation by the EU whereby the whole Trade and Cooperation Agreement could be under threat and a trade war would result.<\/p><p>That is in nobody's interests.  In 2022 we would be back to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.  That is the worst case scenario.  I ask the Members of the House of Lords sub-committee to please do everything they can to ensure that Article 16 is not triggered on the UK side and to try to ensure that the UK side, in particular, would use the mechanisms and structures in place in the withdrawal agreement to deal with the issues which have arisen and which are well documented.  That is my plea.<\/p><p> I will conclude with a question on the European Court of Justice.  That seems to have come in from the sidelines.  Nobody was expecting that this was an issue for the UK side and, indeed, for the DUP.  In the sub-committee's conversations and discussions, was the European Court of Justice and the role it plays in interpreting and dealing with the Single Market an issue?  Is that an issue now?  From an Irish point of view we do not believe it is an issue, but we believe it is an academic concept.  It has nothing to do with the practicalities that businesses in Northern Ireland are facing.  Vice-President &Scaron;efovi has come forward with constructive proposals, practical solutions, and the mechanisms are there to deal with the problems outlined.  Does the House of Lords sub-committee see the European Court of Justice as an issue?  Lord Jay's conclusion was fantastic.  It was very positive and constructive.  We have dealt with big issues before in regard to Northern Ireland and we can do so again on this occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021111000002#C00400","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I thought by saying I would be ruthless, I would get compliance.

I do not think there is any conclusion one can reach other than that it is now a major issue for the British Government.  Exactly how it will be resolved, I cannot say.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Haughey very much on what he said about the risks of Article 16 being triggered, and the response to Article 16 by the European Union potentially leading to rather complicated negotiations with the prospect of a no-deal at the last stage.  That is one end of the spectrum.  The other end of the spectrum, which we cannot rule out, and I certainly would not want to rule out although I must say the prospects are not looking brilliant at the moment, is for a negotiated settlement to be reached between now and Christmas or over Christmas.  I do not think we can rule that out, but as Lord Hain said earlier, we have just heard that Lord Frost will be making a statement in the House of Lords at about 11.45 a.m., so we have to wait and see what he says then.<\/p> <p>  Would any of the House of Lords sub-committee like to add anything to what I have just said?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021111000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Lord Jay of Ewelme"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I greet colleagues in Dublin.

We are going to need to work together with parliamentarians across the Irish Sea to try to cope with the fall-out because it will be significant.  I do not know what he is going to say but it seems to me that his negotiating stance under the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has pointed to triggering Article 16 and a confrontation which is not designed to solve the problem, but to appeal to the Conservative Party's Brexit base, which is a total and radical departure, if it proves to be the case, from the close relationship of trust that was painstakingly built over decades between Dublin and London.  Given the tangled history of the two countries and the two centres, to destroy that trust is very serious indeed.  That trust is already badly damaged.  If this transpires, we must do our best to rebuild trust and strengthen it between ourselves in parallel with what is going on from London.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021111000002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Lord Hain"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I thank Lords Hain and Jay for their contributions.

The House of Lords sub-committee has proven to be a very important, and probably now an increasingly urgent, line of communication and of sanity between the two Parliaments.  I hope we can deepen those lines of communication.  Echoing what Lord Hain just said, I am deeply concerned about the triggering of Article 16 of the protocol, which was meant to be a safeguard clause in the event of something unforeseen happening and that there would be time to fix it.  Obviously the issues have already been addressed over the last number of weeks and months by the &Scaron;efovi team, so the strategy behind triggering it is something that is baffling for us.  If Article 16, as is widely rumoured now, is to be triggered possibly today or, if not, within the next day or two, what is the strategy?  What do our colleagues in the House of Lords believe the next move will be?  Things will move backwards rather than forwards once that happens.  More saliently, what can we do in the event of that happening to seek to stop the backward movement in relationships and the consequences of such a move, and to restore what Lord Hain so property underlined, namely, the basis of 20 years of discussion that brought peace to the island of Ireland and an acceptance of one another's good faith?

It strikes me that the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, constantly talks about wanting to create political stability, but its encouragement to Lord Frost and Boris Johnson will create political instability.  It is interesting that last week we took evidence at our committee from Professor Peter Shirlow of the University of Liverpool and he, along with others, produced a report which showed quite clearly that triggering Article 16 will cause that political and economic instability in the North.  We all know, and Lord Hain referred to this, that according to the Good Friday Agreement, both the British and Irish Governments are co-guarantors and are supposed to act impartially in the execution and implementation of the agreement.  That applies to whichever party is in power in the UK.  It is important that our sub-committee holds Lord Frost to account.  I agree with Lord Hain that our House of Lords protocol sub-committee and all the Oireachtas committees represented here today need to work very closely together to build a bulwark against this.

I thank Lord Jay.  As others said, this meeting is timely.  At the outset, I want to extend condolences to our committee colleague, Emer Currie, on the passing of her father.  This morning I listened intently to Manufacturing NI when it spoke about the protocol and how the protocol was serving it and serving to mitigate the harshness and negativities of Brexit.  It is baffling to us in that nobody across the island, except for a few unionist voices, is calling for the protocol to be abolished.  We know there is no alternative to the protocol.  Trying to abolish to protocol at this stage is reckless and at odds with widespread public opinion.  We welcome what the EU has done in terms of dealing with some of the problems that were becoming transparent with the protocol in relation to sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, medicines and all of that.  We believe that there were workable solutions and that there is an openness there to find other working solutions.<\/p> <p>  We want the joint committee, the mechanism there to be able to solve these problems, to be reconvened.  As Lord Hain said, we await the announcement that will be made by Lord Frost this morning.  It is absolutely reckless and, if this is not sorted out, we are under no illusion as to the chaos this will cause across the island, between the islands, to the relationship between the islands and in terms of the US and the trade agreements with Britain.  Nobody wants that.  I concur with the words Lord Hain used in calling the move of triggering Article 16 aggressive and bombastic.  It is not designed to find a solution.  At this stage, we just wonder what is wanted and what the end game is.  Are we solution focused?  I am glad everybody at this meeting is solution focused.

I hope Lord Frost will listen to the people across this island and acknowledge the good work that has been done over the years, both with the Good Friday Agreement and with successive agreements.<\/p> <p>  I will leave it at that.

I ask the members of the House of Lords subcommittee what they think we can do as parliamentarians to help to rebuild trust on both sides.<\/p> <p>  My second question is slightly removed from the protocol.  At present, the UK Government is reviewing the data regime that operates.  As the House of Lords subcommittee will be aware, the European Commission has granted an adequacy judgment with regard to the data regime in the UK.  Concerns have been expressed to the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union that if the UK interferes in some way with what would be seen as data privacy rights, that data adequacy judgment at EU level will be either suspended or terminated.  That would have a direct impact on all sorts of organisations and businesses.  The Data Protection Commissioner here, for instance, indicated that there could be up to &euro;1 billion more in costs for Irish business if that adequacy judgment is dead.  I am conscious that 19 November is the closing date for submissions on the UK Government's review and I am curious as to whether the House of Lords subcommittee has considered that issue, which, on top of any decisions around the protocol, could have quite serious impacts on business.

Let us assume that today is about triggering Article 16.  Let us assume that is what will happen but let also hope that it is not.  Maybe there will be some sabre-rattling and something short of triggering Article 16.  Assuming it is triggered, however, do they think a proper cost-benefit analysis has been done on the subsequent implications for the UK in a trade war, a breakdown of the trade agreements and possibly tariffs, etc.?  Could this escalate into something that would dreadfully, and potentially in a horrendous way, affect our respective peoples?  That is basically my question.

I do not think a cost-benefit analysis was ever done on Brexit by those advocating it let alone on the protocol.  It was very revealing that, in direct language, Lord Frost talked about the protocol having been signed under duress.  Boris Johnson in his own way said something rather similar.  He has indicated that when he signed it, he did not really mean it and always intended to abandon it.  That is what we are facing.  This is about political-identity politics rather than trade, and Brexit has always been about that.<\/p> <p>  On what could be done at your end, the European Union Commission statement about mitigation measures and how changes could lighten the impact of the protocol, was very important.  It was, in a sense, an opening negotiating stance.  It is important to keep going down that road.  If there has been a criticism of Brussels and maybe Dublin, although that would not be as fair, it is to constantly communicate in person with businesses and the unionist community, especially, in Northern Ireland, to make it clear that nobody wants a fight over this, that there are solutions to it.  However, if one looks at the strategy and policy of London, it is divergence from the European Union in almost every respect.  That means Northern Ireland will diverge from the rest of the UK, insofar as the Single Market and customs union matters are concerned.  Otherwise, London would have signed up in the first place to a closer degree of alignment which would have permitted much freer trade of the kind that we had prior to Brexit.<\/p> <p>  We are here as a result of a distinct decision taken by Boris Johnson, Lord Frost and the Conservative Government.  It is about divergence from the European Union and that means Northern Ireland, by definition, remaining in the Single Market and customs union.  Unless London attempts to revisit that issue - I do not think it can be revisited - there will be increasing divergence and increasing convergence to the Republic.  That is the British Government's trade policy on Northern Ireland.  That is the context in which we should encourage the most active engagement from Dublin and Brussels with citizens in Northern Ireland.  It should be explained that nobody wants a fight from that direction even if a fight is picked from London and practical measures can be taken to ease some of the undoubted difficulties, obstacles and bureaucratic problems that came with the protocol because it was rushed in at the last minute in order to \"get Brexit done\".  The more constrictive, more open to dialogue and engagement Brussels and Dublin can be, the better, frankly, and I would encourage that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021111000002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Lord Hain"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>We will move to the next couple, Deputy Richmond followed by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021111000002#G00500","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":266,"content":"<p>It is the first time that Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and I have been identified as a couple, a new adventure for both of us.

From the outset, I would like to associate with the condolences to the family of Austin Currie, particularly our colleague, Senator Emer Currie.<\/p> <p>  I would like to raise a few issues that can be teased from the points raised by our guests.  The first one, on which a couple of them have given their opinion, is whether they believe invoking Article 16 at this point is justified.  That is one point that is often lost: just because the British Government potentially believes it is justified, does not mean the European Union will agree with it, and there will, no doubt, be legal challenges and arbitrations in that area.  Second, I wish to elaborate on some of the points Lord Jay referred to on whether Article 16 is to be invoked.  The manner and reasons for why it might be invoked will be extremely important.  Given that Lord Frost is due to speak in a couple of hours' time, do we have any indication as to the areas that have already been identified that this is the problem?  It has been mentioned that the European Commission presented a very generous and comprehensive set of proposals.  Hopefully, Lord Thomas will be able to intervene in relation to the issues raised on the European Court of Justice, ECJ.  From a practical point of view, as alluded to by other colleagues, this is something that is not coming up in discussions on the ground.  A lot of us have individual and collective engagements with the business, civic and, indeed, political communities across this island.  The ECJ never comes up.  I believe it is a non-issue.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Lord Hain's point on North-South engagement.  My question is not for him to answer.  Perhaps, if Lord Caine was still on the committee he would have been the person to answer.  What, if any, engagement is the British Government having on the ground formally with the business community and the trade associations in Northern Ireland?  In his opening remarks, Lord Jay referred to the democratic deficit in the European context.  That is acknowledged and members from all three Oireachtas committees have identified potential solutions.  From a British point of view, throughout the Brexit negotiations, there was many issues raised by the devolved administrations and the lack of engagement they were receiving from Whitehall.

What the British Government has said about that is that it is not going to have an arbiter that is within the scope of one side of the problem but not of the other.  My idea of a separate chamber in the CJEU would give that overarching feeling so that the decision of that arbitration body or specialised court would be, essentially, one of the CJEU, while - according to my plan - also having equal representation for judges from both sides.  A new structure would be needed and that would require much negotiation.  What is the alternative?  It would be the setting up of an <i>ad hoc<\/i>arbitration panel to resolve disputes, a panel sitting somewhere it can find that is suitable, be that in London, Brussels or wherever.

I also add my voice to those expressing condolences to the family of Austin Currie, and particularly to Senator Emer Currie.  Austin Currie made a long contribution to political life.  I would not always have agreed with him, but that is for another day.  In fairness, though, when we consider his involvement in the Caledon housing protest, that showed up housing inequality and the sectarian nature of the Northern State.  We should recognise all of that.<\/p> <p>  To a degree, we are repeating ourselves.  In fairness, I could not necessarily disagree with what Deputy Richmond said.  We are all assuming that at 11.45 a.m. we may get this indication from David Frost of the triggering Article 16.  We all know that the article is sometimes sold as more than it is, but it is an integral part of the protocol.  The protocol itself was necessary to mitigate Brexit.  It would also be hard to disagree as well with Peter Hain in the sense that none of this was costed or about logical and sensible moves.  To a degree, then, we are where we are and we should always look for solutions.  That is fine.  I refer also to the European Commission and Commissioner Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi's direct engagements with businesses in the North.  In that regard, I welcome having been able to speak in last week's meeting on the democratic deficit.  As Margaret Ritchie has pointed out, Professor Peter Shirlow said that business interests even across unionism are just interested in getting on with the job and significant moves have been taken to mitigate some of the difficulties in respect of the protocol.<\/p> <p>  The major problem we have now is not just the issue of the ECJ being thrown in, but that Lord Frost has also said that the former Prime Minister, Theresa May, should never have agreed to a backstop in 2017 and that the EU Withdrawal (No.2) Act, also known as the Benn Act, hamstrung the British Government.  In other words, he is stating that the British Government signed up to something it had no intention of adhering to.  We are all second-guessing now what the actual strategy of the British Government is.  I am not sure that anyone could give me an answer regarding the strategy of David Frost or Boris Johnson.  I half hope that Dominic Cummins is correct and that Boris Johnson changes his mind ten times a day.  He has shown that tendency at times.<\/p> <p>  We are in a serious situation.  To an extent, the British Government  is playing the orange card.  An element of political unionism has always had difficulties in this regard and they see many things as the rocky road to unity.  Sometimes that concerned cross-Border initiatives on just simple things like roads and other necessities.  I am just putting that observation out there.  We are not in the 1980s now, and we do not have that element of unionism which has a difficulty with the political trajectory.  As I said, businesses are interested in business being done and in finding solutions.  We must work together, and I am all into positive solutions.  We are working with a British Government, however, that is basically promising to do something which will prove that it is not possible to trust it.<\/p> <p>  From a republican perspective, we would say that the British Government sometimes agrees with every intention of rowing back on the agreement.  Even if it intends to get us to point B, it will take us there via the most circuitous route possible.  Everything I have seen to date has shown this.  It is therefore incredibly difficult to see what the solution in this context is.  Let us be absolutely clear, though.  David Frost has also thrown back out old arguments about there being no reason to worry about the Border on the island of Ireland and that, at the end of the day, technological solutions were possible.

To respond to the question from Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, I would be the last person to understand or appreciate the strategy of the British Government.  I imagine, though, that it is making a political calculation that is all to do with trade policy between the UK, the EU and further afield in regard to making trade deals.  The island of Ireland comes further down their Richter scale, so to speak.  That is deeply unfortunate, because, from a personal perspective, I believe, and the committee has taken umpteen pieces of evidence about this aspect, that the actions of the British Government will cause untold damage on the island of Ireland.  That will especially be the case after we were all able to collectively negotiate the Good Friday Agreement that brought about peace, prosperity and a sound economic base.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the ECJ is undoubtedly another red herring.  Lord Thomas, in fact, has given evidence of alternative ways of dealing with this aspect.  While I was on the way to the airport on Monday, I think I heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, saying quite clearly on \"Morning Ireland\" that there has been little or no engagement between the British Government and the EU, and that the British Government has not responded to those proposals in the four non-papers that dealt with the mitigation measures.<\/p> <p>  Having talked to people in the North, I would have to say that the business community is quite pragmatic about the protocol.  They have said that, in fact, and it can be heard if one listens to Seamus Leheny of Logistics UK or Aodh&aacute;n Connolly of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, NIRC, both of whom gave evidence to us last week, or any others.  They are very pragmatic.<\/p><p>They want to get on and do business and they want everything to work out successfully because the majority of people in the North did not want Brexit.<\/p><p> However, it is interesting to note that the protocol offers real benefits to the North.  There has been full and free access to both the Single Market for goods and to the rest of the UK internal market.  If anything, the British Government should be trying to work with the EU to utilise those benefits for all of us to try to mitigate the many problems that may have arisen and try to create all the possible trade opportunities.  That relates also to a question asked by Senator Joe O'Reilly as well.  There are benefits there.  They are quite well-documented.  I can think of one relating to Dale Farm.  It won a contract to supply whey concentrate to Arla Foods, a major European dairy company.  This has been attributed, at least in part, to the protocol.  Dale Farm said it would have been a challenge without the protocol.  Thus the evidence is there within the business community, which is particularly pragmatic and just wants to get on with it.<\/p><p> As to any threats from Lord Frost, I would think he will not say he is triggering Article 16 today.  I do not want to be a commentator on what he might say but that, apparently, is the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021111000002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I think Baroness Ritchie is wise to hold fire on what Lord Frost will say until we have heard what he says in an hour or so's time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021111000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Lord Jay of Ewelme"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank Lord Jay.

That is not right and we must get beyond a stage where we are in suspense over the whims of a British Government.  It is infuriating to see history repeating time and time again.  My question to the members of the House of Lords sub-committee, who are very well-respected, is how can they work for citizens on this island.  There are international agreements which have been agreed to by this island, the EU and indeed by the members of the House of Lords' own government.  We must have those agreements upheld.  The protocol was there for a reason.  It was negotiated by the UK Government.  The majority of the citizens in the North and this island support that.  The protocol is working for businesses.<\/p> <p>  Another question is whether the British Government is actually that serious about Brexit after all.  Brexit is not done.  The UK Government says it wants it done.  Apparently, it is not going to trigger Article 16 today and that is good news.  However, we are again kicking the can down the road.

I have no doubt she would be very much part of the conversation this morning had she been around.  Austin Currie certainly left his mark on Irish politics.  He was a giant of Irish politics and someone who never took intimidation seriously and never lost his political will to see progress in Northern Ireland.  May he rest in piece.<\/p> <p>  I very much welcome the openness of Lord Jay's opening statement but there are some elements of it I would like to bring attention to, especially towards the end when he talked about the lead -up to the Good Friday Agreements and the subsequent steps towards power-sharing arrangements.  He talked about this process taking \"time, ... dialogue, and most of all trust\".  If the negotiations for the Good Friday Agreement had been in the era of Boris Johnson and Lord Frost, I fear we would still be sitting round the table negotiating and renegotiating.  That is how I feel this protocol is taking shape.  The efforts to negotiate and renegotiate are demonstrating serious incompetence on the side of the UK Government.  I think it was Baroness Ritchie who made reference to the fact we are somewhat a pawn in UK efforts to get trade deals across the world.  The protocol is being used as that pawn in efforts to get better deals.  However, because the element of trust is being eroded, specifically by the UK Government on deals that have previously been negotiated between itself and the EU and which are now being renegotiated, it is now undermining its own trustworthiness in the eyes of all the other countries we have yet to negotiate trade deals with.  I would like to get the views of members of the House of Lords sub-committee on that.  Is it something they concur with?  The art of negotiation is compromise but trust is an awfully big part of it.  The UK Government needs to take that element of it seriously as well as the fact that the Irish economy has prospered since Brexit and that the North-South relationship has prospered from a trade perspective.<\/p><p>Until we get back to that element of trust, we are not going very far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021111000002#J00900","speaker":"1633","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I agree very much with what has been said about trust.

I am not surprised that the EU and its member states feel that they cannot go along with anything that he says.  I await to see, with horror, whether Lord Frost will use Article 16 in some cack-handed way.  I do not believe they have ever understood their own protocol.  That is the problem.  They negotiated it but they did not understand it, and it leaves so many strands.  Although we may not agree with the unionists, they have a point when they say that the protocol leaves a democratic deficit whereby laws are being made that affect the people of Northern Ireland and they have no voice at all in the formulation of those laws.  I have been thinking about that since our discussions at our seminar last week.  At some point during this meeting, I would like to pose a possible solution to that, which was never thought of in the context of the protocol, whereby there should be a form of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Northern Ireland Assembly of European Union directives in Northern Ireland.  One of the contributors took this point last week and suggested that we have something along the lines of a consent motion that has to go to the Northern Ireland Assembly committee.  I looked up the way in which Northern Ireland deals with consent motions in respect of UK legislation and I wondered how it could be adapted.  It seems that if there were a committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly that considered directives before they were made and gave advice to the assembly as to whether to consent to it, one would thereby have brought in a democratic element to the passing of legislation that will affect people in Northern Ireland people.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, not only does this Government not understand the protocol, there are measures within the protocol to resolve disputes that they stubbornly refuse to follow.  There is arbitration with the European Union but nobody has followed it and nobody has tried it.  Until this Government gets a grip on itself and actually works out the protocol, we are going to have these continuous problems.  That is one issue.  I would like throw out the idea of some form of consent motion or scrutiny of directives from the European Union that affect Northern Ireland before they are made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021111000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Lord Thomas of Gresford"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I thank Lord Thomas.

I certainly agree with the remarks of Lord Thomas.  Coming back to my earlier point on building trust, this issue has come right through all of our discussions.  When the UK was in the EU one of the advantages was that it allowed for opportunities for meetings between Ireland and the UK on fringes of other meetings.  We must look at more ways of doing that.  Lord Jay said that it is important for us, as parliamentarians.  We also need to look at ways we can support that among civic society to a far greater extent.  With building trust into the future, I am particularly keen on opportunities among young people and particularly young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not necessarily understand the protocol but who are being led to believe that this in some way is impacting on their identity.  At some stage, I would like us to explore more ways for east-west and North-South co-operation and exchange, especially among young people.<\/p> <p>   We also need to look at the areas of education and research.  In my view, it is an enormous pity that the UK chose to withdraw from the Erasmus programme.  I am conscious that the Turing scheme will be up and running.  We need to look at ways by means of which we can encourage, to start with, at least as much east-west exchange under the Turing scheme and other programmes, and equally that we encourage greater research co-operation, which is always been in place between the universities on these islands.

It is very hard to get responses from the Northern Ireland Assembly because of the processes under which it operates.  There is not a single voice that comes out of it, nor would one expect that, but a lot of the time we do not get a voice when we look for evidence from the political parties.  I was wondering about a meeting of this type, with members of the Northern Ireland Assembly present so that the two Governments are represented, and the area where the democratic deficit exists also represented. That would be helpful because it would provide a public platform on which things could be said in a sense of co-operation and constructive dialogue.<\/p> <p>  Our committee has a very important role to play in providing accurate information to address some of the misinformation that surrounds the existence of the protocol and the working of the protocol.  We did that in the first report, but I believe it is an ongoing necessity because once there is understanding and one has facts that can be demonstrated to be reliable, then one can begin to grow trust with people again.  With regard to the community that is disenfranchised - for example, there have been buses burned in the past weeks with the suggestion that this relates to the protocol - there is a huge job to do there around engaging and enabling a dialogue that is constructive rather than bringing young people onto the streets.  It is profoundly important that the language used in Northern Ireland particularly, and in Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, is not a language that inflames the kind of behaviour we have seen.

Many of the issues have been covered.  RT&Eacute; broadcast some interesting reports by its northern editor, Vincent Kearney, this morning.  He spoke to Manufacturing NI, which represents most of the manufacturing businesses in Northern Ireland.  Crucially, the voice of business was not as strong as it could have been in the run-up to the Brexit referendum and, potentially, in the negotiations that followed.  Manufacturing NI's chief executive, Stephen Kelly, had strong words to say on behalf of its members.  He stated that they want the protocol to work, recognise there are opportunities in the protocol, want to get on with business and need the mitigations and simplifications we are all aiming to achieve.  He described the protocol as the best of both worlds and said that having unfettered access for sales from Northern Ireland into Great Britain and access to the EU market makes it critical for businesses in the North to grasp the opportunity they have.  Is the voice of the business community being heard?  At the end of the day, there appears to be a significant opportunity for Northern Ireland and that view is not being adequately represented.<\/p> <p>  Lord Thomas spoke about the arbitration process and he is right that it has not been properly utilised.  The panel has been established and is there to be used.  It provides for a process that can take up to 12 months to adjudicate on issues regarding the withdrawal agreement and the protocol but that has not kicked into action yet.  The worst case scenario is that it all falls apart and we end up in a full-blown trade war, which nobody wants.  I expect and hope the UK Government does not want that either.

People want to move on with their lives.<\/p><p>The strong message coming from today's meeting is that we have a strong duty and sense we have to stand up to the challenge and deal with whatever is coming down the track.  Certainly, if triggering Article 16 will be the position and happen, we will be faced with a difficult conundrum.<\/p><p> To answer Lord Jay's question on how constituents on the ground feel about this, sometimes or maybe all the time, our constituents are way ahead of us legislators.  However, the sense I have from my constituency is that once Brexit became a reality, the reality is that with it comes trade difficulties.  However, the work and effort that went into the protocol was a way of facilitating a real opportunity and it is hoped sense will prevail.  I will hand over to Senator Chambers and then Lord Jay can open it up to his colleagues for questions from our side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021111000002#L00900","speaker":"1548","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Deputy McHugh has well articulated the position.

With regard to Lord Jay's question, I had to leave the meeting for ten minutes to do a local radio interview on South East Radio, which Senator Byrne will know is extremely important, representing the constituency of Wexford.  I was on the programme to explain what Article 16 was to the good citizens of my constituency and there is a real interest in these matters.  A point of concern was the impact of the withdrawal agreement and Brexit on trade patterns between these islands.<\/p> <p>  The most important one, from a Wexford perspective, was the continued use of the land bridge.  The vast bulk of Irish goods going to continental markets have traditionally transited the United Kingdom.  It is the simplest way.  Short ferry journeys go from my own constituency to Wales.  My home in Wexford is closer to Wales than it is to Dublin.  Wexford has been affected.  Direct sailings from Rosslare to continental ports have more than quadrupled since Brexit.  There are a number of new companies, DFDS being one of them, with four ships now going from Rosslare to new ports that had not been served directly from the island of Ireland pre-Brexit.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant diversion to traffic from the land bridge, because of the uncertainty and difficulties that arose, to direct continental routes.  We looked at whether that could be a temporary or a long-term matter.  It seems to be very much a long-term settled issue now, because larger ships are being deployed on those routes and dedicated berths have been secured on a long-term basis in places such as Dunkirk, to bring us closer to French, German and Belgian markets, so there has been an impact.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the concern there would be displacement of goods purchased in Great Britain in Northern Ireland for goods purchased in the Republic, that has happened to some degree.  An all-island market has developed, because of the ease of transport throughout the island of Ireland.  Part of that is also a consequence of our growing awareness - COP26 is on - of acquiring goods as close to markets as possible.<\/p> <p>  There are evolutions, but the principal point, made by Lord Thomas and Baroness O'Loan, is there is an incredible opportunity for Northern Ireland, with access to both markets, to serve both markets.  That has not been grasped by the political representatives in Northern Ireland, but certainly has been by the business interests, who repeatedly tell us so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021111000002#M00600","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I will have to leave shortly, as I am in the Chamber for 11.30 a.m.  However, Lord Frost is correct.  There has been a significant change in trade between Ireland and Great Britain and between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, was before our committee just last week.  It said there has been a 90% increase in imports from Northern Ireland into Ireland, which is a significant change in trading patterns.  Is it a bad thing?  I do not think it is, but I can see how that might concern some communities in Northern Ireland, because it looks like a significant change and a more unified approach on the island in terms of trade.  I can understand why that would worry some, but many people would see it as good.

As others have said, Austin was part of that great founding generation of the SDLP who, among other things, created the framework we have for ending what was the centuries-old conflict within these islands.  They also created the strands and the framework through which we can manage and improve those relationships both within Northern Ireland, between the North and South, and between Britain and Ireland in allowing them to operate as equals and friends.  This is such an important part of what we are doing in general and what we are doing today.  That is why it is concerning there is a minority of what I would call the Brexit community who are trying to make that agreement the fall guy of Brexit and who are trying to undermine this agreement to throw the baby out with the bathwater because it is something they have never embraced.  Like the European Union, it has a more modern understanding of interdependence and sovereignty which does not fit with the Brexit world view.<\/p> <p>  As my colleague Baroness Ritchie has said, one of the rule of law departures we have seen in recent years is that agreement commits the Government to rigorous impartiality, and unfortunately I do not think that any fair observer could suggest that is how this process has been conducted.<\/p> <p>  I wish to reiterate briefly that from the SDLP&rsquo;s perspective, the concerns and the upset of unionism about the protocol are understandable.  We argued for many years that borders have a significant symbolic value, which is why we advocated relentlessly for solutions that would not create barriers in any direction.  It is a matter of regret the UK Government did not pursue any of those forms of Brexit.  We would say, particularly because, unfortunately, political representatives have abstained from this committee, that it is also unfortunate the sectarianising of that decision and its projection onto the EU, the Irish Government and nationalism is not where the fault essentially lies.  We understand that feeling of dislocation but it is important to reiterate that decision was made by the UK Government and it was not about picking a winner or loser and deciding on which of them should triumph but rather it is about the realities of the movement of goods and trades.<\/p> <p>  I will finish with a question.  There have been many astute observers of politics from all political traditions in this island and none of us are really able to discern a rational or reasonable strategy from the UK Government.  People have articulated well the desire of the business community to try to make the best of the situation.  I ask the Lords what forms of accountability or restraint they think can be applied to the UK Government over the course it is currently on.  We know from the Owen Paterson affair that this is not a Government that especially relishes any checks or balances on its very significant power.  What influence do our committee members believe the Lords may be able to bring to bear as this strategy plays out or unravels over the coming weeks and months.?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021111000002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hanna"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":316,"content":"<p>We are a little tied on time and are due to close our proceedings shortly as I know members have to get back to their respective assemblies.

To follow up on what has been said earlier by Senator Byrne, Deputy Howlin and others, some of the difficulties and some of the changes in trade scenarios have arisen out of necessity and business has made the calls that it was always going to make.  There has been a lack of clarity which has continued on with the madness we are dealing with now, and there is an element in which we are in a limbo period as we wait on what David Frost actually says at 11.45 p.m.<\/p> <p>  It is fair to say when one looks at the entire Northern state when we are talking about trade, it is a tiny entity.  It has been shown that it is a failed economic entity.  I offer the argument, and the Brexiteers and others have added to this argument, that along with changed demographics, which is the logic of Irish unity, if we have a continuity of actions and threats like this from the British Government, more people, particularly on the island of Ireland, will find themselves in the united Ireland bracket who were not necessarily there before.  We are at that point now of reaching sufficient amount of momentum.  The conversation is well started, there is a requirement for planning, and that is the point we are going to reach.  That is the only way that we can deal with this absolute madness we are facing.  Everybody has commented that nobody knows exactly what Boris Johnson and David Frost&rsquo;s strategy is other than playing high-stakes poker and using Ireland and the North as pawns in that.<\/p> <p>  On trade, everything will change on the basis of necessity.  It is vital we continue these conversations, and whatever happens, we need calm heads.  If you are part of the European Commission at this time, it is very difficult to deal with someone who has shown no signs of trustworthiness in negotiations.  Other than that fact, you have to deal with the players that are in there.<\/p><p>We are in a very serious situation, and it can only lead to one place.  Obviously, we ask for calm heads.

I apologise to the committee for being a few moments late.  I had to move some financial resolutions and Supplementary Estimates in the House.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here.  From their outset in 2013, Ireland has constructively engaged with the global tax discussions and we have already significantly reformed our tax system to be in line with emerging international norms.  Last month, Ireland joined 135 other countries in reaching a global two pillar agreement on addressing the tax challenges arising from digitalisation of the global economy.<\/p> <p>  Ireland did not join the interim agreement in July, primarily because it did not provide sufficient certainty with regard to what any globally agreed rate would be.  My priority in recent months was to secure the necessary changes in the October agreement and to ensure our strategic interests would be protected.<\/p> <p>  There are two pillars to the agreement.  Pillar 1 will see a reallocation of a proportion of profits to the jurisdiction of the consumer.  This means a proportion of corporate tax revenue streams that now flow to the Irish Exchequer will flow to the exchequers of other countries when implemented.  Pillar 2 will see the adoption of a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% applying to multinational companies with global revenues in excess of &euro;750 million.<\/p> <p>  It is important to set out why I believe Ireland should be in the agreement.  First, Ireland is one of the most highly globalised countries in the world.  We have clearly benefited from the investment and good jobs that have accompanied the decision of many multinationals to make Ireland their home.  It is vital we adapt and evolve in line with new international rules so that we can continue to be a world-class destination for inward investment.  Second, while the agreement introduces a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% for companies that have a turnover greater than &euro;750 million, my intervention was instrumental in ensuring the rate is moderate and will continue to permit tax competition within guardrails, recognising that other countries advocated for higher rates.  In addition, removing a proposal for \"at least\" helps deliver the predictability that is a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s offering.  Third, we will retain the 12.5% corporation tax rate for the 95% of companies in Ireland that are out of scope of the agreement.  Discussions with the European Commission confirmed a forthcoming directive on pillar 2 will be faithful to the agreement.  Further, we can continue to allow our tax system to support innovation and growth, including through the use of research and development tax credits.<\/p> <p>  I have long signalled there will be a cost to Ireland signing up to this agreement.  My Department and Revenue have estimated the cost in terms of tax receipts forgone could be up to &euro;2 billion in the medium term.  This costing will be kept under review as the critical technical discussions proceed.<\/p> <p>  It is important, however, to consider the very real risks associated with staying outside the process.  As a small, open economy within the EU, we have strong ties to the US and many of the other G20 countries.  This makes it essential we stay in line with key international accords.  Further, if Ireland was not in the agreement, we would lose influence in respect of the critical and ongoing technical discussions.  The design of the global minimum tax means that if Ireland were outside the agreement, other jurisdictions could apply a top-up tax to the subsidiary of a multinational if it were taxed below the global minimum effective rate.<\/p> <p>  I believe the upsides of being in such a historic international agreement far outweigh the downsides of staying out.

At the moment, I anticipate that it will be the second quarter of next year before we are in a position to revise the forecast we have, if at all.

That is obviously going to boost the coffers of our Exchequer.  There is no doubt about that.  The only danger to the Exchequer revenues would be a future pipeline of investment or companies deciding to move jurisdictions, which is thankfully not on the cards.  While the technical assessment may not be done, and I appreciate that there is quite a bit of detail to be worked out, surely that &euro;2 billion figure is going to come down.  It could come down quite substantially given that the companies that will come under the scope of pillar 2 make up nearly 50% of our corporation tax rate in this State.

A key issue that I have always been focused on is whether we can we get a dynamic evaluation of where we are with any revenue loss, which I expect to happen, from the reallocation of taxing rights.

For the first time, this would allow the EU the right to set the effective rate of tax by taking this agreement and transposing it in the form of a directive.  I do not think that should happen.

For the first time, the European Union will bring forward a directive that directly impacts on our tax issues.  I am concerned we have not teased that out to any great extent.

We will have to consider that directive carefully when it is published and I anticipate it will be published at the end of December.  I am well aware of the precedent and consequences of that approach, which is why the engagement I had on this agreement was not only with the OECD but with the European Commission regarding my confidence the directive would look to implement the OECD agreement, and that is it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy was right to say that, as it moves forward, it will move forward in ECOFIN and operate on the basis of unanimity.

I remember talking to the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Michael Noonan, about the BEPS process ten years ago and the reluctance the then Government had initially in regard to that.  Ireland has suffered significant damage historically from the international reputation that exists around the tax haven status Ireland has had in the past.  Bargain basement corporation taxes have a number of negative effects.  Obviously, they are one of the key tools of tax injustice, which funnels money from the many to the very few.  One of the biggest crisis in the world is the concentration of wealth in the hands of so few individuals in terms of the number of billionaires in the world, and tax injustice is one of those tools.<\/p> <p>  It is important we discuss the fact low corporation tax is considered in economic terms a strategy to allow for Third World countries, typically, to improve their economies in a short period of time.  It is very seldom that low corporation tax is seen as an end strategy.  Usually by the time foreign direct investment comes into a country and helps it develop, that country can develop more of an indigenous sector which is stronger.  That is not to say foreign direct investment is not important, attractive and needs to come to this country and we need tools to attract it, but foreign direct investment, like any investments, is also based on issues such as goods, value, inputs, access to markets, good skills, good communications technology and good transportation infrastructure.  Investment in those allow for Ireland to remain an attractive place to do business in future despite the increase in the corporation tax.  There will be a need for Government to focus on making sure those other competitive advantages are worked on significantly in the next while.<\/p> <p>  I do not know how the &euro;2 billion cost is quantified by the Department.  How does the Department come to the understanding of a &euro;2 billion cost?  Is it because of taxes that would be paid in jurisdictions in which the income is earned rather than in the states in which the company is located?  I know the Minister approached that question slightly in the last engagement.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the previous speaker that it is a significant break with the policy this country has had that it would be 100% sovereign when it comes taxation issues.  Transposing a European directive on taxation is a significant break.

We will see a shift in taxable rights because a share of those taxable rights will now be determined by where the consumption of a service or good happens.

A number of different things could trigger it.  It depends on larger economies and their tax treatment of these issues.  It will depend on the detail of how the OECD agreement is confirmed across next year.

A hybrid is a single entity that is taxed in different ways because the appearance of that entity in national tax codes varies.

That is one of the reasons the whole issue of taxation with regard to hybrids received a lot of attention, for example, in last year's Finance Bill, if not the one before.  These issues are best dealt with through the OECD because the best hope for consistency of treatment is through an organisation comprising as many countries as possible.

What are the countries that will benefit from this?  It would tend to be economies that have a low number of companies headquartered in them, that have large markets in which a lot of consumption would occur and that would have a rate that is higher than 15%.  In those circumstances, they will benefit from the reallocation of taxing rights into their economies because one will see a movement of taxing rights into where the consumption happens as opposed to where the value is registered.  The other countries that will benefit from this are developing economies.  They will benefit from a combination of both the rate changing and the reallocation of taxing rights.  Developing economies have been among the largest champions of this process so far.<\/p> <p>  With regard to those who are associated with tax justice and making the case for that agenda, the reaction has split into two different camps.  One camp is willing to recognise that an agreement that covers so much of the world's economy and that gains agreement to a minimum effective tax rate is very significant.  Even if they are disappointed with some elements of the agreement, some of those who have been calling for progress in tax justice have recognised the fact that a global agreement has been reached.  There are others, however, and I will not name them, who have been disappointed by this outcome.  They believe that this process should have yielded a higher minimum effective tax rate for the world.<\/p> <p>  Regarding companies that are below &euro;750 million annual turnover, as long as they are below that threshold here in Ireland they will continue to pay the 12.5% and will not be subject to those parts of this agreement.  As to whether people will be pressing for more, I expect they will.  There will be those who, because they are disappointed with the outcome of this process, will be championing another process to take its place.  However, I expect that we will spend so long actually implementing the agreement we have and then allowing it to be consistently implemented across the world that I believe there is a low possibility of another global process on corporate tax happening at present.  We have a generation of work ahead of us to implement this agreement.  Efforts in respect of international tax co-operation are more likely to happen elsewhere, particularly with regard to climate.<\/p> <p>  As regards those who are pressing the case of aid for trade, I expect that many of them are reasonably satisfied with this agreement because they will expect that their countries will be able to benefit in revenue from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021111000002#F01100","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":377,"content":"<p>That is all the contributions from members.

This Bill seeks to ensure greater levels of accountability, leading to better outcomes across the financial sector, and to provide financial institutions with the tools to address meaningful cultural change.  The Bill provides for four main aspects along with the necessary technical changes to the existing legal process.  All of these make up the individual accountability framework.<\/p> <p>  First, a key element of the legislation is the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR.  SEAR will place obligations on firms and senior individuals within them to set out clearly where responsibility in decision-making lies, prescribe mandatory responsibility for firms which must be allocated to individuals carrying out senior roles to ensure accountability for all key conduct and prudential risk, and impose a duty of responsibility on each person in a senior role to take reasonable steps to avoid the firm committing or continuing to commit a prescribed contravention in respect of the area of the business for which he or she is individually responsible.  Absolute clarity about who is responsible for what should foster a greater culture of personal responsibility.  The Bill will set three sets of conduct standards: common conduct standards to apply to all staff in controlled function roles, junior and senior; additional conduct standards to apply to those in senior roles; and standards for businesses to apply to all firms.<\/p><p>These standards will require those to whom they apply to act with honesty, integrity and due skill, co-operate with the Central Bank, and pay due regard to the interests of customers and treat them fairly.<\/p><p> The legislation will also provide enhancements to the fitness and probity regime to improve the processes by which individuals are assessed for their suitability for financial services roles and investigated where there are reasons to doubt their suitability.  The provisions in the Bill for breaking of the participation link will ensure an individual can be held accountable for his or her actions without the need to prove a contravention by a firm in which that individual participated.  The introduction of individual accountability does not mean firms will no longer be held accountable for their actions with all responsibility shifted onto individuals.  Instead, the responsibilities of firms and of individuals will operate side by side and complement each other.  This is to avoid the danger of scapegoating individuals and to ensure that responsibility and accountability are properly and fairly apportioned.<\/p><p> The conduct standards for business underline the expectation that firms operate honestly and ethically in the best interests of their customers.  However, participation in wrongdoing by a firm will continue to be a prescribed contravention.  For example, where a firm engages in wrongdoing, the firm will be held accountable and the individuals who participate in that wrongdoing by the firm will also be held accountable.  The duty of responsibility that will apply to senior executives under SEAR is a duty to ensure that in those areas of the business for which they are responsible, their firm complies with financial services legislation.  Failure to keep their firm honest will be something for which senior executives can be held accountable alongside any wrongdoing for which they are personally responsible.<\/p><p> The harm done by reckless and dishonest behaviour in the financial services industry earlier this century has been enormous.  Many people suffered terribly as a result and still live with the consequences.  I am mindful, in particular, of those who lost their homes in the tracker mortgage scandal.  Against that background, it is understandable that people would be angry and focused on the need to punish those responsible.  This legislation will ensure that should similar wrongdoing occur in the future, it can and will be punished appropriately.<\/p><p> The objective of this legislation, however, goes far beyond this.  This legislation is intended to underpin a thorough transformation of the culture in the financial services industry.  With individual accountability, those working in the financial sector are likely to consider the implications of taking actions for which they can be found personally responsible with all the consequences that this involves.  This should engender a shift to more responsible practices.  Clearly, if a matter such as the tracker mortgage scandal were to occur in the future, it would be essential to ensure that those responsible could be held accountable but it would be far better to ensure that it does not happen again.<\/p><p> In conclusion, this legislation seeks to engender individual accountability to improve practices and culture within financial institutions while at the same time extending the sanctioning process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021111000002#F01300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  We are finally scrutinising legislation that we have been calling on the Government and its predecessor to bring forward for years.  In July 2018, the Central Bank asked for individual accountability for those in the financial sector and here we are at the end of 2021 with the heads of Bill.  It is not even the full legislation, and the Minister tells us that will not be operational until January 2023.  Those dates sum up the lack of urgency in the Government's response to the matter.  Why has it taken so long for it to act on this matter?  Why has it not been a priority for the Government?  I am sure the Minister will tell us it has been a priority but the dates do not lie.  It is not as if this has happened in a vacuum as the biggest ever swindle by a bank was uncovered in the past number of years.  Hundreds of millions of euro have been wrongfully taken from people's accounts in the tracker mortgage scandal.  It is more than the euro.  There are the houses and homes that were lost.  Young people were robbed of their opportunity to have a normal family life because people were put under serious financial restrictions.  In all that time, there has been a delay in bringing forward this legislation.<\/p> <p>  Today is a big day because for the first time an individual - a senior executive in Permanent TSB -  is under investigation with regard to the tracker mortgage scandal.  That is to be welcomed.  Nevertheless we need the proper legislation that the Central Bank has been seeking.  Why has this taken so long and why has it not been a priority for the Government?  If it has been a priority, why will it take from July 2018, when the Central Bank called for this, up to its proposed commencement in January 2023?

It is not the right way of handling it.  I accept it has taken time to get to this point.  The Deputy stated he does not believe the reason I offer for why it has taken this long but perhaps he can outline why he believes it has taken so long to do this if he does not accept my explanation.  All I can outline to the committee is the truth, which is that I have been very committed to bringing forward this legislation.  It has taken longer than I anticipated to try to resolve the different matters raised with me and my Department from a legal perspective.  It has taken time to do that.  I am nevertheless here with the legislation and I look forward to co-operating with the Deputy and this committee to try to make progress in bringing it forward.

I was trying to offer him the rationale behind my point.  He said he did not understand why I mention the nationalisation of a bank overnight and I was trying to explain the reason.  I will take a minute to further explain why I used that example.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to trying to rescue banks or bail out bankers, it can happen overnight.  It has happened that way.  I am not saying it was right or wrong but that the system can do that.<\/p><p>However, consider those same individuals, namely, the bankers, people who stole family homes from people, people who took hundreds of millions of euro out of bank accounts and people in financial institutions that have been involved in rogue deals and insider trading.  When it comes to holding them to account, it is not done overnight, in a month, in a year or in two, three or four years.  It took the Minister four and a half years after the Central Bank publicly requested these powers to bring forward heads of a Bill.  He asked me to explain why I do not believe it is because of the legal difficulties.  What is the reason?  I believe it is that the Minister did not give this enough priority.  This was not top of his agenda.  Holding these individuals to account is not top of his agenda.  That is the problem.  If he, as Minister for Finance, said this must happen then it would not have taken four and a half years to get whatever legal clarity was required on this legislation which, in the main, is a mirror image of what is already in place in Britain.  That is the problem here.  That is my view.  That is my consideration in relation to it.<\/p><p> I welcome this.  We have been calling for years for this type of legislation.  I wish to make a point on holding individuals to account.  We see it in the inquiry under way by the Central Bank in relation to the former senior executive, I understand, in Permanent TSB.  The issue here is if a person is found to be in breach then the maximum penalty is a &euro;1 million.  That is the current legislation.  This Bill does not do anything to increase that sanction.  Under the heads of this Bill, it might be head 5, it deals with that issue again.  Does the Minister believe that is an appropriate monetary sanction for an individual?  Let me give him an example.  I mentioned insider trading and the finding made against Davy by the Central Bank.  A number of those who were found against in Davy were shareholders of the company itself; indeed the 16 owned 33%.  The sale of Davy benefited five individuals, a number of whom were involved in this transaction, to the tune of &euro;185 million.  What detriment is there if you are playing for those type of stakes and that type of reward?  How is a sanction of &euro;1 million sufficient?  The question my colleague asked last week was: what provisions are in this Bill to ensure this will be personally sanctioned against the individual, as opposed to the company paying the bill for the individual or individuals concerned?  We ask this because the individual who could be found against could be a senior shareholder or indeed the CEO.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021111000002#G01300","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I reiterate that today but acknowledge legislation and powers which have been used in dealing with the tracker mortgage issue.<\/p> <p>  On whether &euro;1 million is of sufficient magnitude for sanctioning of individual behaviour, I believe that for the vast majority of people &euro;1 million is an exceptionally large fine.  However, as we take this legislation through the Houses I am willing to listen to and consider the views of Members on this.  It is also something the Central Bank could consider but for the vast majority of people &euro;1 million is a gigantic amount of money.  As to whether this legislation deals with whether that individual can have the fine paid for by his or her company, as far as I am aware at the moment it is not possible to legislate with regard to that issue.  However, again I am happy to hear the views of colleagues on that point too, as we take this Bill through the Houses.

Everybody knows there were fines levied against the banks for the tracker mortgages scandal.  That is not the point but it is a good diversion from the Minister.  The point is the Central Bank publicly told us all, but more importantly it told the Minister, and he is not a commentator but the Minister for Finance.  He is the only person who can bring forward this type of legislation.  He is the only person who can do it and the bank asked him for these powers to hold individuals to account and it has taken four and a half years.  The Minister must account for that and he will say there are legal issues and whatnot.  I just do not buy that.  That is the reality of it.  The Minister has form in stalling legislation, putting back legislation, nine months' delay in this and a year's delay in that, whether it is to do with insurance or other areas.  We have another piece of legislation, which is incorporated into this, about providing misinformation to the Central Bank and making that an offence.<\/p> <p>  To get into the bowels of this, the issue of a company actually paying this fine needs to be dealt with in this legislation because the Minister is 100% right that &euro;1 million is beyond the wildest dreams of most people.  However, in the case of the people who are, in the main, carrying out these types of activities or sanctions, &euro;1 million is what some of them got as bonuses in financial institutions.

I was one of the first people to raise the issue of tracker mortgages in this committee many years ago and to call it out.  The reason I became aware of the issue is an extended family member of mine was one of the first people to take a case to the ombudsman against Permanent TSB, a bank in which the State owns the majority.  I sat in this person's kitchen and I know what that person went through.  Unfortunately 40,000 other people have gone through the same situation.  To call out my motivations about holding individual bankers or those in the financial sector to account is wrong of the Minister and it is beneath him.<\/p><p>The Minister answered a question that I never asked.  I have repeatedly made the point that four and a half years ago the Central Bank looked for these powers to hold individuals to account.  They cannot be used retrospectively for tracker mortgages.  We are not that stupid.  This is about diverting and making sure a second tracker mortgage scandal does not happen or that the Davy stockbroker sale of a bond to itself does not happen again.  In cases like the insurance companies lying to the Central Bank, as the former Governor of the Central Bank told the former Minister, Michael Noonan, many years ago or of many other scandals, this would not happen without recourse.<\/p><p>It has taken the Minister four and a half years to bring forward this legislation.  If that is the Minister giving priority to something, I would hate to see something he has not prioritised because that is ridiculous and scandalous.  When the Central Bank publicly calls for additional powers to hold individuals to account, the Minister should be moving heaven and earth to do that.  He has not done that; he has taken four and a half years to do it and that is my problem.  I welcome that the Minister has belatedly done it and I will engage with this on Committee Stage as we want to strengthen parts of the Bill.  When the Central Bank is looking for more powers to hold individuals to account those powers should be given.  The only conclusion I can draw from the Minister's <i>laissez-faire<\/i>attitude and the delay in bringing this forward is that it is about protecting the elites.  The Minister would have prioritised it if he genuinely wanted to hold them to account.  If I was in the Minister's position, I can guarantee that it would not take me four and a half years to mirror legislation that has been in operation in Britain for years and to bring it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021111000002#J00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Do I have the opportunity to respond to the charges made against me?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021111000002#J00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":409,"content":"<p>You do but this will be it for this scrap; we will move on to someone else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021111000002#J00400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":410,"content":"<p>The Central Bank called on me to bring in this Bill in May 2018.

Many Deputies, as public representatives, have interposed ourselves into that position in order to protect, insofar as we can, people who became heavily indebted in recent years and whose problems have not yet been resolved.

The figures I have show that, in the majority of cases, the legal framework in place leads to a resolution of many of the difficult matters that bank customers may face.  I believe we have the balance right and that those involved in delivering financial services in Ireland are aware of their obligations.

I am not certain whether we can adequately deal with those exceptions.  There are numerous cases involving properties that were repossessed by the lending institution up to ten years ago and then left idle.  They have now been sold on to an investor which will move into top gear to dispose of the property regardless of what might be the consequences for the original borrower, who is considerably out of pocket, obviously, because the debt has accumulated over the period.  The borrower may not be well treated by the agents of the financial institution who are now dealing with him or her.  This applies to ordinary home borrowers and business people who find themselves in the position.<\/p> <p>  As elected public representatives, we are not shrinking violets and we will certainly take on the institutions.  However, there is a little whiff of arrogance developing in that the institutions believe they have the right to do what they have the right to do.  In other words, we should realise that they are in business and this is what they do for a living.  That is fair enough but I have concerns about how they do that particular part of their job.  Would it be possible to encourage them to have regard for the personal circumstances of the people concerned and the extent to which their lives have been affected by the failure of the banking system to look after their interests when this began ten or 12 years ago and the whole thing fell off the screen?  I am not blaming anybody for allowing that to happen.  However, it should not follow that somebody makes a killing from buying somebody else's difficulties.

I thank the Minister for the discussion thus far.  Head 4 of the general scheme states that the \"legislation will not define the sectors to be included in SEAR, as this will be provided for by the Central Bank Regulations\" and that other sectors \"may be brought within the scope of SEAR in the future, after the legislation is enacted.\"  Will the Minister clarify what sectors are not envisaged to fall under SEAR in the medium term, once the legislation has been enacted?  Will these be, for example, the payment gateways such as Revolut, Stripe and the buy-now-pay-later company, Klarna, which is to enter the market in the South?<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to how the rules would apply to persons such as in-house lawyers.  I do not see a specific provision relating to such persons but I am aware that this matter was debated in Britain when its regime was being introduced.<\/p> <p>  At our meeting last week, I raised with the Central Bank the issue of directors holding multiple directorships simultaneously.  This practice, whereby individuals can hold multiple directorships of companies, continues.  The number of directorships individuals hold at the same time can run into the hundreds, which would cause concerns about their ability to perform their fiduciary duties and about wider accountability issues in relation to that.  I am aware there can be limitations on the number of directorships that can be held for public companies but not for private companies.  Should this matter be addressed in the Bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021111000002#K00700","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>In the initial phase of the application of SEAR, it will be credit institutions; insurance undertakings; investment firms which underwrite on a firm commitment basis and-or deal on their own account and-or are authorised to hold client moneys and assets; and third country branches of the aforementioned entities.  On the entities that could be brought into SEAR in the future, the main ones are the types of companies that are currently excluded, namely, credit unions and parts of the payments sector, as referred to by the Deputy.  These will be excluded in the first and probably lengthy phase of the application of this legislation.  It will be open to the Central Bank to decide what sectors it wants to include in the future.<\/p><p> The Deputy's second question was about in-house lawyers and whether they will be subject to SEAR.  If an in-house lawyer holds a senior executive function, and we have given examples of what they could be - for example, an executive director - then he or she will be subject to this legislation.  If, however, such people are outside of the pre-approved control function roles, they will be subject to the conduct standards within the legislation.  Again, as we take this legislation through, I am happy to hear the views of colleagues in that regard, but I think the balance as we have it at the moment is right.<\/p><p> As for the issue of people holding multiple directorships, given the level of responsibility they have to hold as non-executive directors in financial institutions, I think the day when people held multiple directorships is now gone.  I would certainly be surprised to find somebody who is a non-executive director of multiple companies that could be subject to this legislation because the responsibilities on them now are so great.  The Deputy is right that there is a limit on the number of directorships of public companies one person can hold.  Would it be possible to put one in place for the private sector?  Probably not, I imagine, because of the balance that is there about recognising the rights of individuals.  Equally, however, I would be surprised if any director coming within the purview of this legislation were to hold multiple directorships.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021111000002#K00800","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":435,"content":"<p>We will finish, I hope, at 3.15 p.m.  I want to ask some short questions of the Minister.

As part of Housing for All, it has been suggested that I engage with how that can happen.

However, we heard recently from Tony Lawlor, who is an individual with a difficulty with Bank of Ireland.  He was before the committee, so the name is public and he made his case and so on.  There are cases like his that still linger on in the banks with little or no outcome, with the bank just taking a position to beat down the client and not to give him or her a fair hearing.  If a hearing is given, it is given within the bank itself so it is not a totally independent one.  I am talking about legitimate, proper problems that individuals are having.  I am not talking about people who are deliberately trying to avoid repayments.  Mr. Lawlor is not trying to avoid repayments and we have done everything here to highlight the case and other cases with AIB and Bank of Ireland with little or no traction, or maybe a little traction and no outcome.

He epitomised much of what the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the other committees represented here today are about.  He straddled both sides of the island and, indeed, the two islands, in the sense that he served as a Member of the D&aacute;il, a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly and a Member of Parliament at Westminster.  He was one of the few individuals who had that experience and contributed across the island and the islands.  He brought that spirit of collegiality and peaceful progress.  He was an advocate for civil rights in the early days and progressed through the political spectrum.  He made a huge contribution across the island and to politics in general.  Sadly, he passed away at his home in County Kildare, which is the constituency I happen to represent.  He will be greatly missed.  Above all, I extend my sympathies to his family.  He is survived by his children and grandchildren.  In particular, I extend my sympathies to his daughter, Senator Emer Currie, who is a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and has made a very strong contribution in her short time here.

I thank them very much for the invitation to be with them today.  We are really glad to be here.  First, on behalf of the committee, as a whole, I share the sadness which has already been expressed at the death of Austin Currie.  I would like to say that right at the very beginning.<br\/><br\/>For those members whom I have not met before, my name is Michael Jay.  I chair the House of Lords Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland Sub-Committee.  I have been pleased, in the context of the House of Lords's scrutiny of the impact of Brexit on Ireland and Northern Ireland, to visit the Oireachtas on a number of occasions, and to have met many members, and it is a pleasure to see them again.<br\/><br\/>The protocol committee includes a wide range of views and expertise both on Northern Ireland and the protocol itself.  Our membership includes senior representatives of political parties in Northern Ireland from both unionist and nationalist perspectives, and draws from wider expertise in Northern Ireland affairs in the House of Lords.  A range of these voices is represented in our delegation today, and my colleagues will introduce themselves the first time they speak.  I should add that Jonathan Caine, Lord Caine, would have been with us today but over the weekend he was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office and, therefore, has left the committee with immediate effect.<br\/><br\/>Many members were present when a delegation of our committee participated in a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in June.  At that stage our committee was in its infancy, having been set up in April.  Much has happened since then and it may be helpful for me to summarise our work over the past five months.<br\/><br\/>On 29 July, the committee published its introductory report.  The chapters of the report set out in turn: the committee&rsquo;s role; the development of the protocol; the economic impact of the protocol, including both the challenges and the potential opportunities it presents; the political and social impact of the protocol; and potential mitigations and solutions.  The report acknowledged the difficulties in seeking to uphold seemingly contradictory principles underlying the protocol, namely, avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland while at the same time maintaining Northern Ireland&rsquo;s place within the UK internal market.  It acknowledged mistakes both by the UK and EU which had led to a mutual breakdown in trust.<br\/><br\/>At around the same time as the report was published, the UK Government published its command paper: Northern Ireland protocol, the next steps.  This was followed by the publication last month of the four Commission non-papers on the operation of the protocol.  Our work during the autumn has primarily focused on scrutinising the issues highlighted in these papers.  In September we heard evidence from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland on the operation of Article 2 on rights of individuals, a vital issue that is often in our view overlooked amidst the political focus on trade issues.  We wrote a detailed letter to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland last month on those issues.  In October, we held an evidence session with representatives of the pharmaceuticals industry on the impact of the protocol on the provision of medicines in Northern Ireland.  This is an issue of universal concern to all citizens, regardless of community or political affiliation.  We will shortly write to Lord Frost summarising our concerns.<br\/><br\/>Meanwhile our key work in scrutinising EU law applying to Northern Ireland under the protocol continues.  We have now written more than 50 letters to UK Government Ministers on the various regulations, directives and delegated Acts brought forward over recent months that will apply to Northern Ireland.  Last week, we held a seminar on perceptions of a democratic deficit under the protocol, whereby EU law applies to Northern Ireland without its consent, and on ways to enhance Northern Ireland&rsquo;s voice and influence in relation to the protocol.  We heard from a wide range of business representatives, academics and parliamentarians from across the political spectrum, sharing perspectives from Westminster, Stormont, Brussels and Dublin, and we were delighted that Oireachtas colleagues were able to join us at that meeting.  That engagement was a demonstration of our firm commitment to continued interparliamentary dialogue with all those with an interest in the protocol and in Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Today&rsquo;s meeting is another welcome opportunity to strengthen engagement between the Oireachtas and Westminster, and between our committees.  I very much hope that we will be able to build on this engagement in the coming months, including, as the public health situation improves, by meeting in person, both in Dublin and in London.  We look forward to answering members' questions about our work, but before we do so, let me finish my opening remarks by quoting the final conclusion from our introductory report: <\/p> <blockquote> \tAddressing the issues of conflicting identity that first Brexit, and then the Protocol, have brought to the fore seems an insoluble problem.  That was also true of the political situation in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.  But through a slow and painstaking process led by political leaders in Northern Ireland and successive governments in London and Dublin, the peace process took root and flourished, leading to the Belfast Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent steps towards a powersharing arrangement.  This process took time, patience, dialogue, and most of all trust.  The same is true in addressing the problems that Brexit and the protocol present for Northern Ireland.  There is therefore an urgent imperative for all sides to make concerted efforts to build trust by recommitting themselves to that process of dialogue, repairing the damage caused to relations across these islands during the past five years, in the interests, as the protocol rightly acknowledges, of communities in both Ireland and Northern Ireland. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Lord Jay of Ewelme"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I thank Lord Jay for that presentation.

It is nice to see them again.  I join with the other speakers in conveying my sympathy to the family of Austin Currie.  I was listening to Colm Eastwood on the radio this morning.  He outlined how Austin Currie and the SDLP adopted peaceful protest to bring about change, they adopted dialogue, and that is a lesson that all of us have taken on board, having regard to the peace process.<\/p> <p>  I thank the House of Lords sub-committee for the work it has done.  It undertook painstaking work and consulted widely.  Its report is diplomatic.  It stated the UK approach has had shortcomings in transparency, clarity and readiness while the EU approach has had shortcomings in balance, understanding and flexibility.  That is very diplomatic indeed.<\/p> <p>  As we speak, all the talk in the Irish political system is about the possibility of the UK triggering Article 16.  I would plead with the House of Lords sub-committee to use its influence to ensure that does not happen.  I hope it is a negotiating tactic.  The Taoiseach informed the D&aacute;il last week that such a move would be irresponsible, unwise and reckless and would certainly damage EU-UK relations and British-Irish relations as well.  The consequences of that would lead to some sort of retaliation by the EU whereby the whole Trade and Cooperation Agreement could be under threat and a trade war would result.<\/p><p>That is in nobody's interests.  In 2022 we would be back to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.  That is the worst case scenario.  I ask the Members of the House of Lords sub-committee to please do everything they can to ensure that Article 16 is not triggered on the UK side and to try to ensure that the UK side, in particular, would use the mechanisms and structures in place in the withdrawal agreement to deal with the issues which have arisen and which are well documented.  That is my plea.<\/p><p> I will conclude with a question on the European Court of Justice.  That seems to have come in from the sidelines.  Nobody was expecting that this was an issue for the UK side and, indeed, for the DUP.  In the sub-committee's conversations and discussions, was the European Court of Justice and the role it plays in interpreting and dealing with the Single Market an issue?  Is that an issue now?  From an Irish point of view we do not believe it is an issue, but we believe it is an academic concept.  It has nothing to do with the practicalities that businesses in Northern Ireland are facing.  Vice-President &Scaron;efovi has come forward with constructive proposals, practical solutions, and the mechanisms are there to deal with the problems outlined.  Does the House of Lords sub-committee see the European Court of Justice as an issue?  Lord Jay's conclusion was fantastic.  It was very positive and constructive.  We have dealt with big issues before in regard to Northern Ireland and we can do so again on this occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#C00400","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I thought by saying I would be ruthless, I would get compliance.

Exactly how it will be resolved, I cannot say.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Haughey very much on what he said about the risks of Article 16 being triggered, and the response to Article 16 by the European Union potentially leading to rather complicated negotiations with the prospect of a no-deal at the last stage.  That is one end of the spectrum.  The other end of the spectrum, which we cannot rule out, and I certainly would not want to rule out although I must say the prospects are not looking brilliant at the moment, is for a negotiated settlement to be reached between now and Christmas or over Christmas.  I do not think we can rule that out, but as Lord Hain said earlier, we have just heard that Lord Frost will be making a statement in the House of Lords at about 11.45 a.m., so we have to wait and see what he says then.<\/p> <p>  Would any of the House of Lords sub-committee like to add anything to what I have just said?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Lord Jay of Ewelme"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I greet colleagues in Dublin.  It is very good to talk to them.  If Lord Frost announces the triggering of Article 16 that will be a very aggressive and bombastic move by the British Government that I fear has been coming for a while.  We are going to need to work together with parliamentarians across the Irish Sea to try to cope with the fall-out because it will be significant.  I do not know what he is going to say but it seems to me that his negotiating stance under the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has pointed to triggering Article 16 and a confrontation which is not designed to solve the problem, but to appeal to the Conservative Party's Brexit base, which is a total and radical departure, if it proves to be the case, from the close relationship of trust that was painstakingly built over decades between Dublin and London.  Given the tangled history of the two countries and the two centres, to destroy that trust is very serious indeed.  That trust is already badly damaged.  If this transpires, we must do our best to rebuild trust and strengthen it between ourselves in parallel with what is going on from London.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Lord Hain"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I thank Lords Hain and Jay for their contributions.

The House of Lords sub-committee has proven to be a very important, and probably now an increasingly urgent, line of communication and of sanity between the two Parliaments.  I hope we can deepen those lines of communication.  Echoing what Lord Hain just said, I am deeply concerned about the triggering of Article 16 of the protocol, which was meant to be a safeguard clause in the event of something unforeseen happening and that there would be time to fix it.  Obviously the issues have already been addressed over the last number of weeks and months by the &Scaron;efovi team, so the strategy behind triggering it is something that is baffling for us.  If Article 16, as is widely rumoured now, is to be triggered possibly today or, if not, within the next day or two, what is the strategy?  What do our colleagues in the House of Lords believe the next move will be?  Things will move backwards rather than forwards once that happens.  More saliently, what can we do in the event of that happening to seek to stop the backward movement in relationships and the consequences of such a move, and to restore what Lord Hain so property underlined, namely, the basis of 20 years of discussion that brought peace to the island of Ireland and an acceptance of one another's good faith?

It strikes me that the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, constantly talks about wanting to create political stability, but its encouragement to Lord Frost and Boris Johnson will create political instability.  It is interesting that last week we took evidence at our committee from Professor Peter Shirlow of the University of Liverpool and he, along with others, produced a report which showed quite clearly that triggering Article 16 will cause that political and economic instability in the North.  We all know, and Lord Hain referred to this, that according to the Good Friday Agreement, both the British and Irish Governments are co-guarantors and are supposed to act impartially in the execution and implementation of the agreement.  That applies to whichever party is in power in the UK.  It is important that our sub-committee holds Lord Frost to account.  I agree with Lord Hain that our House of Lords protocol sub-committee and all the Oireachtas committees represented here today need to work very closely together to build a bulwark against this.  Not only will this cause political instability in the North, it will cause economic instability on the island of Ireland, which is something that none of us wants to see happening.

I thank Lord Jay.  As others said, this meeting is timely.  At the outset, I want to extend condolences to our committee colleague, Emer Currie, on the passing of her father.  This morning I listened intently to Manufacturing NI when it spoke about the protocol and how the protocol was serving it and serving to mitigate the harshness and negativities of Brexit.  It is baffling to us in that nobody across the island, except for a few unionist voices, is calling for the protocol to be abolished.  We know there is no alternative to the protocol.  Trying to abolish to protocol at this stage is reckless and at odds with widespread public opinion.  We welcome what the EU has done in terms of dealing with some of the problems that were becoming transparent with the protocol in relation to sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, medicines and all of that.  We believe that there were workable solutions and that there is an openness there to find other working solutions.<\/p> <p>  We want the joint committee, the mechanism there to be able to solve these problems, to be reconvened.  As Lord Hain said, we await the announcement that will be made by Lord Frost this morning.  It is absolutely reckless and, if this is not sorted out, we are under no illusion as to the chaos this will cause across the island, between the islands, to the relationship between the islands and in terms of the US and the trade agreements with Britain.  Nobody wants that.  I concur with the words Lord Hain used in calling the move of triggering Article 16 aggressive and bombastic.  It is not designed to find a solution.  At this stage, we just wonder what is wanted and what the end game is.  Are we solution focused?  I am glad everybody at this meeting is solution focused.  It is important we send out a unified voice from here.  I hope Lord Frost will listen to the people across this island and acknowledge the good work that has been done over the years, both with the Good Friday Agreement and with successive agreements.<\/p> <p>  I will leave it at that.

We have heard much evidence about problems, particularly on the pharmaceuticals or medicines front but generally people are working very hard.

I ask the members of the House of Lords subcommittee what they think we can do as parliamentarians to help to rebuild trust on both sides.<\/p> <p>  My second question is slightly removed from the protocol.  At present, the UK Government is reviewing the data regime that operates.  As the House of Lords subcommittee will be aware, the European Commission has granted an adequacy judgment with regard to the data regime in the UK.  Concerns have been expressed to the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union that if the UK interferes in some way with what would be seen as data privacy rights, that data adequacy judgment at EU level will be either suspended or terminated.  That would have a direct impact on all sorts of organisations and businesses.  The Data Protection Commissioner here, for instance, indicated that there could be up to &euro;1 billion more in costs for Irish business if that adequacy judgment is dead.  I am conscious that 19 November is the closing date for submissions on the UK Government's review and I am curious as to whether the House of Lords subcommittee has considered that issue, which, on top of any decisions around the protocol, could have quite serious impacts on business.

I do not think a cost-benefit analysis was ever done on Brexit by those advocating it let alone on the protocol.  It was very revealing that, in direct language, Lord Frost talked about the protocol having been signed under duress.  Boris Johnson in his own way said something rather similar.  He has indicated that when he signed it, he did not really mean it and always intended to abandon it.  That is what we are facing.  This is about political-identity politics rather than trade, and Brexit has always been about that.<\/p> <p>  On what could be done at your end, the European Union Commission statement about mitigation measures and how changes could lighten the impact of the protocol, was very important.  It was, in a sense, an opening negotiating stance.  It is important to keep going down that road.  If there has been a criticism of Brussels and maybe Dublin, although that would not be as fair, it is to constantly communicate in person with businesses and the unionist community, especially, in Northern Ireland, to make it clear that nobody wants a fight over this, that there are solutions to it.  However, if one looks at the strategy and policy of London, it is divergence from the European Union in almost every respect.  That means Northern Ireland will diverge from the rest of the UK, insofar as the Single Market and customs union matters are concerned.  Otherwise, London would have signed up in the first place to a closer degree of alignment which would have permitted much freer trade of the kind that we had prior to Brexit.<\/p> <p>  We are here as a result of a distinct decision taken by Boris Johnson, Lord Frost and the Conservative Government.  It is about divergence from the European Union and that means Northern Ireland, by definition, remaining in the Single Market and customs union.  Unless London attempts to revisit that issue - I do not think it can be revisited - there will be increasing divergence and increasing convergence to the Republic.  That is the British Government's trade policy on Northern Ireland.  That is the context in which we should encourage the most active engagement from Dublin and Brussels with citizens in Northern Ireland.  It should be explained that nobody wants a fight from that direction even if a fight is picked from London and practical measures can be taken to ease some of the undoubted difficulties, obstacles and bureaucratic problems that came with the protocol because it was rushed in at the last minute in order to \"get Brexit done\".  The more constrictive, more open to dialogue and engagement Brussels and Dublin can be, the better, frankly, and I would encourage that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Lord Hain"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":498,"content":"<p>We will move to the next couple, Deputy Richmond followed by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#G00500","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":499,"content":"<p>It is the first time that Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and I have been identified as a couple, a new adventure for both of us.

From the outset, I would like to associate with the condolences to the family of Austin Currie, particularly our colleague, Senator Emer Currie.<\/p> <p>  I would like to raise a few issues that can be teased from the points raised by our guests.  The first one, on which a couple of them have given their opinion, is whether they believe invoking Article 16 at this point is justified.  That is one point that is often lost: just because the British Government potentially believes it is justified, does not mean the European Union will agree with it, and there will, no doubt, be legal challenges and arbitrations in that area.  Second, I wish to elaborate on some of the points Lord Jay referred to on whether Article 16 is to be invoked.  The manner and reasons for why it might be invoked will be extremely important.  Given that Lord Frost is due to speak in a couple of hours' time, do we have any indication as to the areas that have already been identified that this is the problem?  It has been mentioned that the European Commission presented a very generous and comprehensive set of proposals.  Hopefully, Lord Thomas will be able to intervene in relation to the issues raised on the European Court of Justice, ECJ.  From a practical point of view, as alluded to by other colleagues, this is something that is not coming up in discussions on the ground.  A lot of us have individual and collective engagements with the business, civic and, indeed, political communities across this island.  The ECJ never comes up.  I believe it is a non-issue.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Lord Hain's point on North-South engagement.  My question is not for him to answer.  Perhaps, if Lord Caine was still on the committee he would have been the person to answer.  What, if any, engagement is the British Government having on the ground formally with the business community and the trade associations in Northern Ireland?  In his opening remarks, Lord Jay referred to the democratic deficit in the European context.  That is acknowledged and members from all three Oireachtas committees have identified potential solutions.  From a British point of view, throughout the Brexit negotiations, there was many issues raised by the devolved administrations and the lack of engagement they were receiving from Whitehall.  To what extend is there such a democratic deficit from the representatives of the Assembly or, indeed, the Executive Committee of the Assembly with Whitehall?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#G00600","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I hand over to Lord Jay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#G00700","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Richmond.

It seems the machinery is there for creating a new court within the overarching Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, structure which could be manned by three or four judges from the EU on the one hand and three or four judges from the UK on the other.  There would be an independent president presiding at the top who would, of course, hold the balance.  That would have a number of consequences.<\/p><p>The objection of the UK Government is that the CJEU can determine causes that may arise between the UK and the EU under the protocol, and it is, of course, the judge and function of one side.  What the British Government has said about that is that it is not going to have an arbiter that is within the scope of one side of the problem but not of the other.  My idea of a separate chamber in the CJEU would give that overarching feeling so that the decision of that arbitration body or specialised court would be, essentially, one of the CJEU, while - according to my plan - also having equal representation for judges from both sides.  A new structure would be needed and that would require much negotiation.  What is the alternative?  It would be the setting up of an <i>ad hoc<\/i>arbitration panel to resolve disputes, a panel sitting somewhere it can find that is suitable, be that in London, Brussels or wherever.  That panel would be of a similar structure to the proposal I am suggesting, namely, equal representation from both sides and with a neutral chairman or president.  That would be something completely outside the structures of the UK courts and of the CJEU.  It seems that what is needed is the will to take something like that idea forward and to make it happen.

I also add my voice to those expressing condolences to the family of Austin Currie, and particularly to Senator Emer Currie.  Austin Currie made a long contribution to political life.  I would not always have agreed with him, but that is for another day.  In fairness, though, when we consider his involvement in the Caledon housing protest, that showed up housing inequality and the sectarian nature of the Northern State.  We should recognise all of that.<\/p> <p>  To a degree, we are repeating ourselves.  In fairness, I could not necessarily disagree with what Deputy Richmond said.  We are all assuming that at 11.45 a.m. we may get this indication from David Frost of the triggering Article 16.  We all know that the article is sometimes sold as more than it is, but it is an integral part of the protocol.  The protocol itself was necessary to mitigate Brexit.  It would also be hard to disagree as well with Peter Hain in the sense that none of this was costed or about logical and sensible moves.  To a degree, then, we are where we are and we should always look for solutions.  That is fine.  I refer also to the European Commission and Commissioner Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi's direct engagements with businesses in the North.  In that regard, I welcome having been able to speak in last week's meeting on the democratic deficit.  As Margaret Ritchie has pointed out, Professor Peter Shirlow said that business interests even across unionism are just interested in getting on with the job and significant moves have been taken to mitigate some of the difficulties in respect of the protocol.<\/p> <p>  The major problem we have now is not just the issue of the ECJ being thrown in, but that Lord Frost has also said that the former Prime Minister, Theresa May, should never have agreed to a backstop in 2017 and that the EU Withdrawal (No.2) Act, also known as the Benn Act, hamstrung the British Government.  In other words, he is stating that the British Government signed up to something it had no intention of adhering to.  We are all second-guessing now what the actual strategy of the British Government is.  I am not sure that anyone could give me an answer regarding the strategy of David Frost or Boris Johnson.  I half hope that Dominic Cummins is correct and that Boris Johnson changes his mind ten times a day.  He has shown that tendency at times.<\/p> <p>  We are in a serious situation.  To an extent, the British Government  is playing the orange card.  An element of political unionism has always had difficulties in this regard and they see many things as the rocky road to unity.  Sometimes that concerned cross-Border initiatives on just simple things like roads and other necessities.  I am just putting that observation out there.  We are not in the 1980s now, and we do not have that element of unionism which has a difficulty with the political trajectory.  As I said, businesses are interested in business being done and in finding solutions.  We must work together, and I am all into positive solutions.  We are working with a British Government, however, that is basically promising to do something which will prove that it is not possible to trust it.<\/p> <p>  From a republican perspective, we would say that the British Government sometimes agrees with every intention of rowing back on the agreement.  Even if it intends to get us to point B, it will take us there via the most circuitous route possible.  Everything I have seen to date has shown this.  It is therefore incredibly difficult to see what the solution in this context is.  Let us be absolutely clear, though.  David Frost has also thrown back out old arguments about there being no reason to worry about the Border on the island of Ireland and that, at the end of the day, technological solutions were possible.  That has proven not to be the case, and, as far as I and the majority of people on this island are concerned, that is a no-go area and we cannot revisit it.  We will see.  I would be delighted if someone could give me an answer regarding what is the strategy of Boris Johnson and David Frost and what their endgame is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#H00400","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Now that the Deputy's time is up, I am faced with the dilemma of deciding whether to let someone in to answer or to move on.

To respond to the question from Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, I would be the last person to understand or appreciate the strategy of the British Government.  I imagine, though, that it is making a political calculation that is all to do with trade policy between the UK, the EU and further afield in regard to making trade deals.  The island of Ireland comes further down their Richter scale, so to speak.  That is deeply unfortunate, because, from a personal perspective, I believe, and the committee has taken umpteen pieces of evidence about this aspect, that the actions of the British Government will cause untold damage on the island of Ireland.  That will especially be the case after we were all able to collectively negotiate the Good Friday Agreement that brought about peace, prosperity and a sound economic base.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the ECJ is undoubtedly another red herring.  Lord Thomas, in fact, has given evidence of alternative ways of dealing with this aspect.  While I was on the way to the airport on Monday, I think I heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, saying quite clearly on \"Morning Ireland\" that there has been little or no engagement between the British Government and the EU, and that the British Government has not responded to those proposals in the four non-papers that dealt with the mitigation measures.<\/p> <p>  Having talked to people in the North, I would have to say that the business community is quite pragmatic about the protocol.  They have said that, in fact, and it can be heard if one listens to Seamus Leheny of Logistics UK or Aodh&aacute;n Connolly of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, NIRC, both of whom gave evidence to us last week, or any others.  They are very pragmatic.<\/p><p>They want to get on and do business and they want everything to work out successfully because the majority of people in the North did not want Brexit.<\/p><p> However, it is interesting to note that the protocol offers real benefits to the North.  There has been full and free access to both the Single Market for goods and to the rest of the UK internal market.  If anything, the British Government should be trying to work with the EU to utilise those benefits for all of us to try to mitigate the many problems that may have arisen and try to create all the possible trade opportunities.  That relates also to a question asked by Senator Joe O'Reilly as well.  There are benefits there.  They are quite well-documented.  I can think of one relating to Dale Farm.  It won a contract to supply whey concentrate to Arla Foods, a major European dairy company.  This has been attributed, at least in part, to the protocol.  Dale Farm said it would have been a challenge without the protocol.  Thus the evidence is there within the business community, which is particularly pragmatic and just wants to get on with it.<\/p><p> As to any threats from Lord Frost, I would think he will not say he is triggering Article 16 today.  I do not want to be a commentator on what he might say but that, apparently, is the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I think Baroness Ritchie is wise to hold fire on what Lord Frost will say until we have heard what he says in an hour or so's time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Lord Jay of Ewelme"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I thank Lord Jay.

That is not right and we must get beyond a stage where we are in suspense over the whims of a British Government.  It is infuriating to see history repeating time and time again.  My question to the members of the House of Lords sub-committee, who are very well-respected, is how can they work for citizens on this island.  There are international agreements which have been agreed to by this island, the EU and indeed by the members of the House of Lords' own government.  We must have those agreements upheld.

He talked about this process taking \"time, ... dialogue, and most of all trust\".  If the negotiations for the Good Friday Agreement had been in the era of Boris Johnson and Lord Frost, I fear we would still be sitting round the table negotiating and renegotiating.  That is how I feel this protocol is taking shape.  The efforts to negotiate and renegotiate are demonstrating serious incompetence on the side of the UK Government.  I think it was Baroness Ritchie who made reference to the fact we are somewhat a pawn in UK efforts to get trade deals across the world.  The protocol is being used as that pawn in efforts to get better deals.  However, because the element of trust is being eroded, specifically by the UK Government on deals that have previously been negotiated between itself and the EU and which are now being renegotiated, it is now undermining its own trustworthiness in the eyes of all the other countries we have yet to negotiate trade deals with.  I would like to get the views of members of the House of Lords sub-committee on that.  Is it something they concur with?  The art of negotiation is compromise but trust is an awfully big part of it.  The UK Government needs to take that element of it seriously as well as the fact that the Irish economy has prospered since Brexit and that the North-South relationship has prospered from a trade perspective.<\/p><p>Until we get back to that element of trust, we are not going very far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#J00900","speaker":"1633","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I agree very much with what has been said about trust.

I await to see, with horror, whether Lord Frost will use Article 16 in some cack-handed way.  I do not believe they have ever understood their own protocol.  That is the problem.  They negotiated it but they did not understand it, and it leaves so many strands.  Although we may not agree with the unionists, they have a point when they say that the protocol leaves a democratic deficit whereby laws are being made that affect the people of Northern Ireland and they have no voice at all in the formulation of those laws.  I have been thinking about that since our discussions at our seminar last week.  At some point during this meeting, I would like to pose a possible solution to that, which was never thought of in the context of the protocol, whereby there should be a form of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Northern Ireland Assembly of European Union directives in Northern Ireland.  One of the contributors took this point last week and suggested that we have something along the lines of a consent motion that has to go to the Northern Ireland Assembly committee.  I looked up the way in which Northern Ireland deals with consent motions in respect of UK legislation and I wondered how it could be adapted.  It seems that if there were a committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly that considered directives before they were made and gave advice to the assembly as to whether to consent to it, one would thereby have brought in a democratic element to the passing of legislation that will affect people in Northern Ireland people.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, not only does this Government not understand the protocol, there are measures within the protocol to resolve disputes that they stubbornly refuse to follow.  There is arbitration with the European Union but nobody has followed it and nobody has tried it.  Until this Government gets a grip on itself and actually works out the protocol, we are going to have these continuous problems.  That is one issue.

When the UK was in the EU one of the advantages was that it allowed for opportunities for meetings between Ireland and the UK on fringes of other meetings.  We must look at more ways of doing that.  Lord Jay said that it is important for us, as parliamentarians.  We also need to look at ways we can support that among civic society to a far greater extent.  With building trust into the future, I am particularly keen on opportunities among young people and particularly young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not necessarily understand the protocol but who are being led to believe that this in some way is impacting on their identity.  At some stage, I would like us to explore more ways for east-west and North-South co-operation and exchange, especially among young people.<\/p> <p>   We also need to look at the areas of education and research.  In my view, it is an enormous pity that the UK chose to withdraw from the Erasmus programme.  I am conscious that the Turing scheme will be up and running.

There is not a single voice that comes out of it, nor would one expect that, but a lot of the time we do not get a voice when we look for evidence from the political parties.  I was wondering about a meeting of this type, with members of the Northern Ireland Assembly present so that the two Governments are represented, and the area where the democratic deficit exists also represented. That would be helpful because it would provide a public platform on which things could be said in a sense of co-operation and constructive dialogue.<\/p> <p>  Our committee has a very important role to play in providing accurate information to address some of the misinformation that surrounds the existence of the protocol and the working of the protocol.  We did that in the first report, but I believe it is an ongoing necessity because once there is understanding and one has facts that can be demonstrated to be reliable, then one can begin to grow trust with people again.  With regard to the community that is disenfranchised - for example, there have been buses burned in the past weeks with the suggestion that this relates to the protocol - there is a huge job to do there around engaging and enabling a dialogue that is constructive rather than bringing young people onto the streets.  It is profoundly important that the language used in Northern Ireland particularly, and in Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, is not a language that inflames the kind of behaviour we have seen.  In reality, when these things happen they get out of control and terrible tragedies can result.  We all have a role to play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Baroness O'Loan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I have one point to make about the importance of the meetings on the fringes.

It would be a good idea to organise that between these committees and the representatives in question.<\/p> <p>  I might not get the chance to contribute again so I will ask a question on behalf of my committee.  Many of the issues have been covered.  RT&Eacute; broadcast some interesting reports by its northern editor, Vincent Kearney, this morning.  He spoke to Manufacturing NI, which represents most of the manufacturing businesses in Northern Ireland.  Crucially, the voice of business was not as strong as it could have been in the run-up to the Brexit referendum and, potentially, in the negotiations that followed.  Manufacturing NI's chief executive, Stephen Kelly, had strong words to say on behalf of its members.  He stated that they want the protocol to work, recognise there are opportunities in the protocol, want to get on with business and need the mitigations and simplifications we are all aiming to achieve.  He described the protocol as the best of both worlds and said that having unfettered access for sales from Northern Ireland into Great Britain and access to the EU market makes it critical for businesses in the North to grasp the opportunity they have.  Is the voice of the business community being heard?  At the end of the day, there appears to be a significant opportunity for Northern Ireland and that view is not being adequately represented.<\/p> <p>  Lord Thomas spoke about the arbitration process and he is right that it has not been properly utilised.  The panel has been established and is there to be used.  It provides for a process that can take up to 12 months to adjudicate on issues regarding the withdrawal agreement and the protocol but that has not kicked into action yet.  The worst case scenario is that it all falls apart and we end up in a full-blown trade war, which nobody wants.  I expect and hope the UK Government does not want that either.  Are discussions taking place within the UK Government or the House of Lords on what will happen if that is the path the UK Government takes and on what that might look like for the UK, Northern Ireland and both of our islands?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#L00100","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":529,"content":"<p>Stephen Kelly gave evidence to our committee and we were struck by the needs of the business community.

The island of Ireland has somehow become caught up in this war between the UK and the EU, which will not bring any particular benefit.  I note that a few days ago the T&aacute;naiste indicated in a radio interview on \"Morning Ireland\" that there could be unintended consequences if there was a triggering of Article 16 and that there would be a response from the EU.

With regard to Lord Jay's question, I had to leave the meeting for ten minutes to do a local radio interview on South East Radio, which Senator Byrne will know is extremely important, representing the constituency of Wexford.  I was on the programme to explain what Article 16 was to the good citizens of my constituency and there is a real interest in these matters.  A point of concern was the impact of the withdrawal agreement and Brexit on trade patterns between these islands.<\/p> <p>  The most important one, from a Wexford perspective, was the continued use of the land bridge.  The vast bulk of Irish goods going to continental markets have traditionally transited the United Kingdom.  It is the simplest way.  Short ferry journeys go from my own constituency to Wales.  My home in Wexford is closer to Wales than it is to Dublin.  Wexford has been affected.  Direct sailings from Rosslare to continental ports have more than quadrupled since Brexit.  There are a number of new companies, DFDS being one of them, with four ships now going from Rosslare to new ports that had not been served directly from the island of Ireland pre-Brexit.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant diversion to traffic from the land bridge, because of the uncertainty and difficulties that arose, to direct continental routes.  We looked at whether that could be a temporary or a long-term matter.  It seems to be very much a long-term settled issue now, because larger ships are being deployed on those routes and dedicated berths have been secured on a long-term basis in places such as Dunkirk, to bring us closer to French, German and Belgian markets, so there has been an impact.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the concern there would be displacement of goods purchased in Great Britain in Northern Ireland for goods purchased in the Republic, that has happened to some degree.  An all-island market has developed, because of the ease of transport throughout the island of Ireland.  Part of that is also a consequence of our growing awareness - COP26 is on - of acquiring goods as close to markets as possible.<\/p> <p>  There are evolutions, but the principal point, made by Lord Thomas and Baroness O'Loan, is there is an incredible opportunity for Northern Ireland, with access to both markets, to serve both markets.  That has not been grasped by the political representatives in Northern Ireland, but certainly has been by the business interests, who repeatedly tell us so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111000002#M00600","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I will have to leave shortly, as I am in the Chamber for 11.30 a.m.  However, Lord Frost is correct.

The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, was before our committee just last week.  It said there has been a 90% increase in imports from Northern Ireland into Ireland, which is a significant change in trading patterns.  Is it a bad thing?  I do not think it is, but I can see how that might concern some communities in Northern Ireland, because it looks like a significant change and a more unified approach on the island in terms of trade.

As others have said, Austin was part of that great founding generation of the SDLP who, among other things, created the framework we have for ending what was the centuries-old conflict within these islands.  They also created the strands and the framework through which we can manage and improve those relationships both within Northern Ireland, between the North and South, and between Britain and Ireland in allowing them to operate as equals and friends.  This is such an important part of what we are doing in general and what we are doing today.  That is why it is concerning there is a minority of what I would call the Brexit community who are trying to make that agreement the fall guy of Brexit and who are trying to undermine this agreement to throw the baby out with the bathwater because it is something they have never embraced.  Like the European Union, it has a more modern understanding of interdependence and sovereignty which does not fit with the Brexit world view.<\/p> <p>  As my colleague Baroness Ritchie has said, one of the rule of law departures we have seen in recent years is that agreement commits the Government to rigorous impartiality, and unfortunately I do not think that any fair observer could suggest that is how this process has been conducted.<\/p> <p>  I wish to reiterate briefly that from the SDLP&rsquo;s perspective, the concerns and the upset of unionism about the protocol are understandable.  We argued for many years that borders have a significant symbolic value, which is why we advocated relentlessly for solutions that would not create barriers in any direction.  It is a matter of regret the UK Government did not pursue any of those forms of Brexit.  We would say, particularly because, unfortunately, political representatives have abstained from this committee, that it is also unfortunate the sectarianising of that decision and its projection onto the EU, the Irish Government and nationalism is not where the fault essentially lies.  We understand that feeling of dislocation but it is important to reiterate that decision was made by the UK Government and it was not about picking a winner or loser and deciding on which of them should triumph but rather it is about the realities of the movement of goods and trades.<\/p> <p>  I will finish with a question.  There have been many astute observers of politics from all political traditions in this island and none of us are really able to discern a rational or reasonable strategy from the UK Government.  People have articulated well the desire of the business community to try to make the best of the situation.  I ask the Lords what forms of accountability or restraint they think can be applied to the UK Government over the course it is currently on.  We know from the Owen Paterson affair that this is not a Government that especially relishes any checks or balances on its very significant power.

To follow up on what has been said earlier by Senator Byrne, Deputy Howlin and others, some of the difficulties and some of the changes in trade scenarios have arisen out of necessity and business has made the calls that it was always going to make.  There has been a lack of clarity which has continued on with the madness we are dealing with now, and there is an element in which we are in a limbo period as we wait on what David Frost actually says at 11.45 p.m.<\/p> <p>  It is fair to say when one looks at the entire Northern state when we are talking about trade, it is a tiny entity.  It has been shown that it is a failed economic entity.  I offer the argument, and the Brexiteers and others have added to this argument, that along with changed demographics, which is the logic of Irish unity, if we have a continuity of actions and threats like this from the British Government, more people, particularly on the island of Ireland, will find themselves in the united Ireland bracket who were not necessarily there before.  We are at that point now of reaching sufficient amount of momentum.  The conversation is well started, there is a requirement for planning, and that is the point we are going to reach.  That is the only way that we can deal with this absolute madness we are facing.  Everybody has commented that nobody knows exactly what Boris Johnson and David Frost&rsquo;s strategy is other than playing high-stakes poker and using Ireland and the North as pawns in that.<\/p> <p>  On trade, everything will change on the basis of necessity.  It is vital we continue these conversations, and whatever happens, we need calm heads.

The provisions are required to provide a definitive endpoint to the process.  Refusal of planning permission application is the appropriate endpoint.  A new MAC application will have to be made to facilitate a new planning application.  MARA must have the opportunity to reassess circumstances as the refusal of planning permission may occur some years after the MAC grant and the world may have moved on significantly.  Failure to secure planning permission would be strong evidence that the MAC holder does not have the required technical capabilities to complete the project.<\/p> <p>  This provision is intended to disincentivise commercially driven risk taken of the kind we have seen on land where the developer may apply for significantly more than the receiving environment can bear.

I can appreciate why these measures appear practical.  However, we must oppose them.  The circumstances where companies enter into receivership and examinership do not generally arise overnight.  These automatic termination provisions will act as a statutory cliff edge to incentivise early action on the part of MAC holders, for example, securing additional financial partners or a joint application for assignment of the MAC to another entity.  Receivership and examinership can be complex and litigious.  This automatic termination provision places the State in a strong position in such circumstances.  The control of the property remains in the hands of the MARA and will be administered in the best interests of the State.  The MARA will act reasonably in such circumstances and as a practical matter would not trigger enforcement action or the rehabilitation schedule pending the outcome of the financial processes.

However, it might well be the case - I could certainly imagine a case - where the stakeholder itself or the NGO would say that, as well as whatever MARA will say, it wants to give evidence in these proceedings as to the reason it thinks MARA's decision is entirely justifiable and to represent its own position as the group that potentially had prompted the entire investigation in the first place.  That is what I am asking.  One could imagine there could be quite controversial matters going on in a court between MARA and the authorisation holder where those stakeholders might state that they have a strong view on this and they want to give their evidence to the court as to why they think sanction is, indeed, justified and MARA has acted correctly in these circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#C00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I hear what the Deputy is saying.

I will alert the Chairman to them as best I can.<\/p><p>As referenced, I propose to deal with amendments Nos. 217 and 227 together as they do the same thing.<\/p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 217 is to disapply this chapter on applications made to coastal planning authorities in respect of two additional categories to those in the original text.  First, subsection 2(b) of the amendment refers to development in accordance with a permission granted in accordance with section 225 of the Planning and Development Act.  Section 225 provides for planning permission for development on the foreshore.  In effect, this amendment seeks to ensure that, where a person is already in possession of a permission under Part XV, he or she will not be required to apply again if that development has not yet commenced.  It is a technical amendment and the previous formulation would have applied this chapter to authorised developments that had not yet commenced.  It is related to an amendment previously agreed to section 12 of the Bill.<\/p><p> Second, subsection 2(c) of this amendment refers to developments authorised under the listed sections of the Foreshore Act 1933.  Post enactment, there will still be limited instances of developments being authorised under sections 10 and 13 of that Act by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This amendment seeks to ensure that there is no double authorisation for such development approvals.  It should be noted that this only applies to applications to coastal planning authorities in their own nearshore areas.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 227 is similar to amendment No. 217 as it relates to the application of chapter III.  It is there to ensure that there is not a requirement to obtain planning permission where a development consent already exists, either through the repealed Part XV of the Planning and Development Act or the referenced sections of the Foreshore Act.  The amendment is in two parts.  The first part is to disapply this chapter in respect of a development in accordance with a permission granted under Part XV of the Planning and Development Act and the second, at paragraph (b), does the same for sections 10 and 13 of the Foreshore Act.<\/p><p> The purpose of amendment No. 218 is to confirm that one of the ways a person is made eligible to apply for permission for development under this chapter is to be the holder of a lease under section 2 of Foreshore Act 1933 for \"the proposed development concerned\".  This provision has already been made in the initiated text, but this formulation more tightly links the eligibility criteria specifically to a lease for the proposed development.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 220 is a technical drafting amendment and related to amendment No. 218.  This amendment carries on the reference to a holder of a lease under section 2 of the Foreshore Act 1933 as a qualifying criterion that enables a planning authority to consider an application for permission under section 34 or to grant such a permission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#C03600","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":631,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 219, 221-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#D00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":632,"content":"<p>My apologies.  The purpose of amendment No. 219 is to remove the existing disapplication at section 281(4) for development to which Part XI applies, as an exemption for coastal planning authorities is already provided for in section 4 of the Planning and Development Act, as amended in this Bill.  The initiated text inadvertently doubled up on this exemption.  In order to avoid a deviation in approach from the existing system in the Planning and Development Act, I am deleting this text because it is unnecessary.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 221 provides that coastal planning authorities can apply a condition as per section 34(5) of the Planning and Development Act.  The subsection provides that a coastal planning authority can attach to a planning permission a condition that points of detail can be agreed between a coastal planning authority and the person carrying out a development.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide that, after the grant of planning permission, fine details of a development may be agreed with a coastal planning authority where, as is frequently the case, it is not possible to determine such details in an application for planning permission.  Its omission in the initiated text was an oversight and would have resulted in a situation whereby applications made on land could have a condition applied under section 34(5) but a maritime application could not.  This will ensure consistency for local authority planning decisions.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 222 inserts a new subsection (4), which provides that section 34(2)(<i>a<\/i>) of the Planning and Development Act shall not apply in respect of a maritime application.  The purpose of this amendment is to remove a limitation that would otherwise have an effect on what a coastal planning authority can consider in respect of a maritime application.  In effect, if the initiated text remained, it could have been inferred that a coastal planning authority was limited to considering the provisions of section 34(2)(<i>a<\/i>) and not the additional considerations provided for in the Bill.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 223 is a technical drafting amendment related to amendment No. 222.

A key problem in terrestrial planning and housing supply is the use of the planning system by people sometimes to speculate by obtaining planning permissions and increasing land values.  It does not always lead to the amount of housing output that is desirable, wanted and needed.  What safeguards are in place in this section of the Bill to give us confidence that the planning processes cannot be used to obtain permissions for, for example, renewable energy, which is necessary, only to then not deliver on it?  The processes could be used to obtain further permissions down the road for when returns can potentially improve as technology improves.  There is a concern that we will not get the delivery of renewable energy that we need because people obtain permissions but do not act on them because they are waiting for technology and returns to improve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#D00700","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I agree with the terms of the Deputy's engagement.

In short, what is being put forward here is that once the regime is up and running there may be developments related to aquaculture that are not exempted development and the provision will allow those leaseholders to apply for planning permission, as is already the case.

It might assist the Deputy.  Amendment No. 229 provides that any applicant for a maritime area consent may enter into pre-application discussions with the board.  This would run contrary to the policy intention of the sequential MAC planning process whereby the MAC is the gateway to planning.  There are a number of possible negative outcomes that could occur as a result of this amendment.  First, where an applicant fails to be granted a MAC there is no resolution proposed for the outcome in the amendment.  In other words, are they no longer a prospective applicant?  There is the further possibility in such instances of the board&rsquo;s resources potentially being wasted.  The applicant cannot guarantee in respect of their access to any specific part of the maritime area without being granted a MAC.  The purpose of the MAC application process in the first instance, as has already been stated repeatedly, is to test the ability of the applicant to deliver on what has been proposed.  The net result of this is that at the pre-application process, the board would engage in a more likely result in an application for development and that speculative applications are actively discouraged.  The result of this amendment could, in theory, be a deluge of applications for MACs with a concurrently deluge of applications for pre-planning with the board, most of which would not get beyond application stage.  The resources of MARA and the board would potentially be wasted.<\/p> <p>  As I have said previously, I am seeking to move a more orderly and plan-led system than we have had heretofore and our fear is this potentially could undermine that objective.  I am sure this is not the intention and the Deputy would no doubt want to see proposals for much needed wind infrastructure processed as soon as possible but I also note the decision in time for a MAC is 90 days.  That is not excessive considering the design and development timeframes for such infrastructure.  The assessment criterion in the MAC process will provide the best applications for planning.  The sequential approach being proposed here is in the best interests of the State and the resources at our disposal.

The formulation in the existing text at paragraph (f) used the word \"will\" and may have inadvertently limited the board to considering only those matters discussed at pre-planning.  This would be at variance from the existing land-based provisions and would, in effect, have precluded the board from considering new information raised, for example, in the public consultation during the period.  I am sure Deputies will agree this would not have been satisfactory.  The board must be allowed to examine all matters it considers relevant when the planning application proper is set before it.  Not all of the details may be apparent at pre-planning stage, and the public and prescribed bodies may be allowed to raise new issues that can be material considerations in the decision-making process.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of amendment No. 233 is to confirm that being the holder of a lease under section 2 of the Foreshore Act 1933 for the same development is a qualifying criterion that enables the board to consider an application for screening for environmental impact assessment in respect of a proposed development.  This is related to other amendments that make foreshore leaseholders eligible applicants and it is designed to accommodate those foreshore functions remaining with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It replaces the existing text to link the lease more tightly to the development concerned, thus closing off any avenues for other legacy foreshore leases to access the planning system.

That creates problems with compliance and enforcement where people may think there is an issue and they want to go in and have a look at the information before they take up anyone's time in an enforcement role or capacity.

There is no mention of city or county development plans in that subsection.  While there are large areas of the marine in respect of which there will be nothing in the city or county development plan that would be relevant, there could well be something in aspects of it.  Therefore, some mention of the city and county development plans in this section would be appropriate.<\/p> <p>  As for amendment No. 239, we had long conversations during pre-legislative scrutiny and engagement with various sectors earlier in the proceedings on the Bill about trying to ensure employment benefits and positive impacts on the local economy, not just, for example, if there are construction works or activity but for the longer-term benefit.  Deputy Gould and I, therefore, propose to insert an additional subsection (p) that would ask the board to give consideration to applying conditions on those local employment benefits and positive impacts on the local economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#G00800","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":706,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 238 seeks to provide in section 293(2)(a) that, subject to section 293(2)(b), the board shall not grant a permission under this section that would materially contravene a city or county development plan in addition to the national marine planning framework.  There are fundamental technical issues surrounding this amendment.  First, the purpose of section 293(2) is to ensure that the board must not materially contravene the national marine planning framework except in very specific circumstances.  This ensures a level of consistency in decision-making across the entire maritime area and ensures that decisions in respect of the State's maritime area are made in accordance with a plan passed by the Oireachtas.  Given the conversations we had on Parts 1 and 2, where every policy or plan was to be approved by the Oireachtas, the Deputies' approach here surprises us somewhat.<\/p> <p>  The amendment, even if it were worded appropriately, would place a county development plan at the same level in the plan hierarchy as the national marine planning framework.  This would be entirely inappropriate from a policy perspective, not only because the framework is a national plan but also because the development plan is a land-based plan.  The national marine planning framework was subject to a significant development and consultation process, as set out in the document itself.  In the amendment as worded, however, the Deputies have not referred to the particular plan that should have this effect in what particular area.<\/p><p>For instance, the development plan for an inland county could be binding on the board in respect of a site 100 km off the west coast.  Notwithstanding this, as the Deputies are no doubt aware, section 308 of the Bill, as proposed, in effect limits the jurisdiction of development plans to land above the high-water mark.  Development plans have no jurisdiction in the maritime area.<br\/><br\/>However, section 293(3)(e) obliges the board to have regard to any relevant development plans of coastal local authorities.  These circumstances would include development on coastal sites that may be adjacent to land that is subject to special local objectives and in that respect, local democracy has its role in this process.  Moreover, the DMAP provisions, as discussed, can be used as an effective tool for local plans in the maritime area in the nearshores of coastal local authorities, as we have discussed in previous hearings.  DMAPs will, of course, form part of the national marine planning framework having regard to section 2 of this Bill.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 239 seeks to provide that the board can attach a condition or conditions to a permission for development under this section in respect of construction and operation requiring local employment benefits and positive impact on the local economy.<br\/><br\/>While I acknowledge the Deputies&rsquo; intentions here, there are some fundamental technical issues with the amendment as it is worded.  First, there is no definition of &ldquo;local economy&rdquo;.  Therefore, for instance would a condition be applied to a development that is located a significant distance from the coast?  These limitations are important in primary legislation if it is to be robust and defensible.  What would be defined as being a positive impact on the local economy?  What are local employment benefits?  We should avoid value judgments in technical drafting as a rule, yet both these phrases imply an element of judgment, meaning that any such condition would be open to challenge.<br\/><br\/>Second, many of the technologies employed in the construction of larger offshore installations are highly specialised and can only be sourced internationally, meaning that the skills and labour may not be available locally.  This makes a condition such as this difficult to apply in all circumstances, however well-intentioned.  Indeed, it is questionable whether such conditions should be applied in all circumstances; rather they should be applied where the circumstances warrant it.  <br\/><br\/>We appreciate the intention to provide for community gain and we have sought, in a manner consistent with the existing SID provisions, to provide for a broader provision in section 293(7)(n).  In addition to this, in respect of offshore energy production, all onshore and offshore projects supported via RESS are required to contribute &euro;2 per MWh of energy produced to community benefit funds and these funds are activated several years prior to project energisation, offsetting disturbance during the construction stages.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, the use of local employment clauses in construction contracts can be appropriately channelled through environmental impact assessment reports, EIARs, and mitigation proposed therein.  This has been the approach taken on SID applications in the past.  What could actively promote the use of such clauses would be to explore how they can be targeted at particular types of developments in particular areas through the development and application of the guidelines being proposed under this Bill.  This would ensure that such clauses are considered from the outset rather than attached as an <i>ad hoc<\/i>condition at the end of the application process.  Indeed, one could envisage that it might even be a mandatory policy requirement of those guidelines that the applicant puts forward for consideration by the board appropriate local employment benefit proposals for any areas on land affected by a particular aspect of a development.  These things need to be looked at closely and I would invite the Deputies to get involved in that.<br\/><br\/>In essence, I am saying that the idea being promoted by the Deputies is laudable and we understand the intention.  I am supportive of the overarching objective but there is more than one way to achieve what they desire here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#G00900","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I do not believe for a moment that the Minister of State was surprised by the intention of the first amendment, nor am I surprised by his response.  I mean that in good humour.<\/p> <p>  In respect of amendment No. 238, I ask the Minister of State and his officials to read the recent High Court judgment on an ongoing dispute between the provisions of the county development plan and central government statutory policy with respect to a retail shopping centre in Cork.  I will not discuss the issue because it has almost concluded its High Court proceedings.  I mention that because there has been a growing tension between the local democratic legitimacy of the county development plans, for example, and various attempts, sometimes for good sometimes for bad, to try to streamline, centralise, or standardise planning rules at a central level.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is right: city and county development plans have very little to say about the overwhelming majority of the marine.  Therefore, this does not become important with respect to those areas.  My concern is precisely the example the Minister of State gave at the end where there might be a conflict with a specific local objective.  At that point there is a question about which set of guidelines or which plan has primacy.  Is it the marine planning framework and the marine spatial plan or the city and county development plans?  The courts are beginning to take a view that it is not as straightforward as the Minister of State or his predecessors outlined.  It would be a mistake to assume that that might not continue to be the trend.  Part of the purpose of the amendment was to make the point that the Minister of State needs to consider that very carefully; I did not expect him to support it.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to speak about the second amendment.

If it is left too much to the discretion of the developer's engagement, we might get good outcomes or we might not.  If it is left solely to local lobbying, albeit very well-intentioned, by local authority members, Deputies or community groups we may get results or we may not.  Given the significant benefits to private investors from these successful projects, in addition to the tax liabilities of the State, local communities which may feel discommoded or excluded from those benefits have a right to get something additional.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is right in saying we do not have the skills for much of the labour involved both in construction and in operation.  Therefore, one of the economic contributions for consideration under a plan could be the contribution to a fund managed by MARA to train people in coastal communities to be able to take advantage of those new jobs.  The Minister of State is right that a local labour clause, if it is limited to people from a geographical area, would absolutely be in contravention of several EU laws.  The State has employed what are effectively local labour clauses in Grangegorman, for example, but it uses things like the live register or other access points into those employment benefits that are not deemed discriminatory under EU law.  I urge the Minister of State and his officials to look at that again.<\/p> <p>  It would be terrible to have large-scale offshore investment producing very good-quality renewable wind energy which is a benefit potentially to the taxpayer centrally but coastal communities feel they are not getting direct access to some of the benefits for the long term.

We fought quite hard to get D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour integrated into the local authority.  It was previously managed separately by a harbour company.  That caused significant problems due to divergent objectives.  We now have, at least in theory, the possibility of having an integrated approach between the county and the harbour, which is a very important asset for us, as I am sure the harbours of towns and villages across the country are.  How then do these two things relate to each other?  Will the Minister of State explain that?<\/p><p> I am not sure whether this is the section where I should raise this issue but the Minister of State referred to it there.  I ask for the Chairman's direction on that.  In this section we are dealing with, and I am pretty sure the Minister of State referred to it, permission may be granted where the national marine planning framework or maritime spatial plan is materially contravened.  There are conditions where permission may be granted.  I must express concern about that.  It states the conditions under which this might happen are if: \"the proposed development is of strategic, economic or social importance to the State\" and where they may be conflicting objectives, essentially, that are \"ambiguous\" in the national marine planning framework or the maritime spatial plan.  That just opens everything up.  Anything goes then, potentially.  We have all these safeguards, all these plans and we have this framework but then, actually, anything goes if it is considered to be \"... of strategic, economic or social importance to the State\".  Alternatively, I can tell the Minister of State that from looking at the marine planning framework, it would not be difficult to construe multiple competing objectives in the same maritime space.  Then we are into a situation where literally anything goes and it is about whoever happens to be making the decision at the time and whatever his or her particular prejudices might be.  Will the Minister of State respond to those concerns?<\/p><p> As a final point, I refer to the benefits and impacts for the local economy, communities and so on.  That is absolutely imperative.  There is nothing that frustrates people more.  By the way, I do not think there is anything discriminatory in it.  It would be discriminatory if we set religious or ethnic conditions or if we were saying there were particular natives or something.  If we are talking about benefits to the local community and people who live in that area, as long as it is done on a non-discriminatory basis it is critically important there are benefits and employment benefits of developments which may be impacting on that area.  It is an entirely laudable and legitimate aspiration.  Maybe the Minister of State could set out what his thoughts are on how we are going to achieve that.

The concern I have is the frequency of very significant decisions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la with respect to terrestrial planning applications where there is dispute over which has precedence, national planning guidelines or local county and city development plans.  They have been increasing and there is now a precedent over about five cases.  One relates to strategic development zones, SDZs, the other relates to retail strategies.  The assumption central Government had had up until this point was that a national planning framework terrestrially took precedence, or ministerial guidelines - and this document has much to say about those - take precedence but the courts have found that is not the case on at least five occasions.  They are unique and may or may not be comparable to the kind of decisions we are dealing with here.  All I would urge the Minister of State to do is be conscious that although central Government says the national planning framework, the marine planning framework and ministerial guidelines take precedence, the courts are not agreeing with that at the moment.  With some of the cases, my non-legal opinion is I am sympathetic to the court's decision and with other cases I am not so sympathetic to their decision.  However, the courts' trend at the moment suggests this is more complicated than the Minister of State's answer has suggested.  To go back to the point we have made from the start, what we do not want is want much-needed offshore wind to be locked into interminable judicial reviews at the High Court, the Court of Appeal and up into the Supreme Court.

Any significant or material changes to consented developments will have to go through the processes set out in section 297, as happens at present with SID development permissions.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 241, as proposed by Deputy Higgins seeks, to provide that conditions can be attached to a planning permission providing that points of detail may be agreed between the MARA and the person carrying out the development.  In amendment No. 240 I have proposed a related amendment, in which points of detail would be agreed between the person granted permission and the coastal planning authority or the board as the case may be; the primary difference being the absence of the MARA in my amendment.  This is because the MARA has no formal role in the environmental decision-making process for development applications, as has been said previously.  I would suggest that my own amendment is preferable, if Deputy Higgins is in agreement.  In any event, what the Deputy is proposing here that has the same effect as my own amendment.  I suggest to the Deputy that in this respect we are aligned and her intention has been satisfied.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 242 is a technical amendment to section 297(2) to expand the list of things that must accompany an application to alter the terms of a permission granted under section 297.  These additional mandatory items from the initiated text are plans or drawings &ndash; the initiated text did not specify these; the prescribed fee for processing the application; and an environmental impact assessment report, if the proposal has already been screened in for such purposes.  In addition to the mandatory requirements, this amendment further provides that the applicant may submit certain materials at the application stage, including an environmental impact assessment report or a Natura impact statement.  In effect, this allows the applicant to pre-empt the screening determination by the board in respect of these assessments and would allow the board to consider these reports in the first instance.  This is a common occurrence in regular planning applications and does not presuppose the outcome of any screening.  Instead, it allows applicants to submit the relevant documents where they are sure any alterations would be screened in for environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 243 is a technical drafting amendment and is related to amendment No. 242.  The purpose of this amendment to section 297(5)(d) is to expand on what is included in the definition of \"relevant materials\" in this section.  In essence, it allows the board to take into consideration all of the things submitted by the applicant in the first instance as set out in amendment No. 242, including any environmental impact assessment report or a Natura impact statement.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 245 is a technical drafting amendment to delete the word \"and\" in order to accommodate amendment No. 246. <\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 246 is a technical drafting amendment.  The purpose of this amendment is to add \"relevant materials\", as defined in section 297(5), to the list of things the board shall have regard to when performing its functions in relation to a requested alteration that is a material alteration.  This amendment is related to amendments Nos. 242 and 243.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#K00300","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1636502400,"counter":734,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1636502400,"counter":735,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 235 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 236:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 151, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(1A) The Board shall&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(a) make the application available on the website of the Board within 2 working days of it being received, and<br \/><br \/>(b) make any related documents to the application, correspondence and submissions available online as soon as is practical and no later than 3 days after they are received or sent by the Board.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#K00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1636502400,"counter":737,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1636502400,"counter":738,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 237 and 238 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":739,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 239:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 162, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(p) conditions on construction and operation requiring local employment benefits and positive impact on the local economy, and&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#K01000","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1636502400,"counter":740,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":741,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 240:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 162, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(9)(a) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (4), the Board may, in addition to any condition attached (in accordance with subsection (7)) to a permission for development proposed to be situated in the nearshore area of a coastal planning authority, attach to that permission a condition that the person who carries out the development agree matters of detail with the coastal planning authority and the Board relating to compliance with the permission, and if agreement cannot be reached in relation to any such matter by that person with the coastal planning authority and the Board within such period as may be specified in the condition, the Board shall determine the matter.<br \/><br \/>(b) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (4), the Board may, in addition to any condition attached (in accordance with subsection (7)) to a permission for development proposed to be situated in the outer maritime area, attach to that permission a condition that the person who carries out the development agree matters of detail with the Board relating to compliance with the permission, and if agreement cannot be reached in relation to any such matter by that person with the Board within such period as may be specified in the condition, the Board shall determine the matter.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#K01200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1636502400,"counter":742,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":743,"content":"<p>The Minister of State seems to have addressed amendment No. 241 in his amendment No. 240.

Amendment No. 247 proposes timelines for strategic infrastructure developments, SIDs.  These are potentially large and complex applications as they relate to the marine environment.  There is a lot of information that people do not know about.  It is somewhat easier to deal with a planning application for the terrestrial environment in respect of knowledge and know-how.  Those applications do not need the same level of expertise in getting the information together for something happening in the marine environment.  We do not want inordinately long periods involved because we have to have movement and these are pressing issues, but the period referred to is the minimum required to ensure proper consultation about the complex issues that are considered.  I would be fearful of losing information if we do not have that longer time period.  I have made the general point that information from public consultation can be very beneficial to a project and its success.  There is often knowledge in the wider community that the developers and their consultants or engineers do not have.  That information can often come out through the consultation process from the local fishing community or other people who have knowledge that may not be captured otherwise in the process.  Issues can then be dealt with as part of the process and that can then lead to the success of the project.  If that is not captured and dealt with in the process because there is not enough time, it may cause issues with development and things can get derailed.  This should be seen as ensuring the process is strong enough to capture all those issues to lead to more robust outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#L00500","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":760,"content":"<p>The points have largely been made.

The Deputies are proposing what we feel is an excessive timeline for the submission period on the documents referred to which are, in effect, a revision of the existing documents to account for any changes in measurable impacts arising from a proposed alteration to an already consented development.  The timelines set out here are reflective of the requirements of Article 6 of the EIA directive, as added to in 2014.  The suggestion here is that the Bill potentially would be inconsistent with that directive.  What is being proposed may lead to a full rerun of the application process rather than an amendment procedure.  Moreover, this would render the timeline inconsistent with the SID procedures and result in a situation where an application that incorporates part of the maritime site would have a different timeline than one wholly on land, something which we cannot accept.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 248 seeks to provide that a copy of the application and any further or additional information submitted to the application subsequently will be available on the application website and on the website of the board.

They are much more akin to SIDs.  In fact, it is arguable that they are SIDs, given their strategic importance to our renewable energy targets.  If 56 days is an acceptable time period, for example, for a flyover on the N7 at Newlands Cross in my constituency as part of an SID, why would the same time not be allowed for something that could be much bigger and impact a far greater number of people and have far greater levels of technical documentation?

This is to avoid conflicts between the new MAC system being established and CPO powers.  It will not prohibit local authorities from acquiring land in the maritime area but will prevent them from engaging in a CPO in respect of same.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of amendment No. 255 is to provide more precisely for the construction of references to proper planning and sustainable development as being references to maritime spatial planning.  It is also the purpose of this amendment to provide more precisely for the construction of references to principles of proper planning and sustainable development as being references to objectives of maritime spatial planning.  In essence, while this provision exists in the initiated text, the revised wording provides for better and more exact drafting as advised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  All of this means that, where the local authority or the board is dealing with a maritime site, it must apply the maritime-specific considerations set out in respect of sustainable development and better reflect the requirements of the MSP directive. <\/p> <p>  The purpose of amendment No. 256 is to provide more precisely for the construction of references to the national planning framework as being references to the national marine planning framework.  The amendments to the syntax are related to those proposed under amendment No. 255.  This provision, in general, will allow the board or the coastal planning authority to read a reference to the national planning framework as being the national marine planning framework in the context of dealing with a maritime site.  The specific required exclusions to this reading of the national marine planning framework are also provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#N01100","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":782,"content":"<p>I have another technical question.

In effect, the listed relevant provisions at Part II of Schedule 9 are where, in relation to a maritime site, &ldquo;development plan&rdquo; will be read as meaning the national marine planning framework. <\/p><p> The purpose of amendment No. 258 is to confirm that this section applies to development wholly or partly in the outer maritime area.  This ensures that for the purposes of a section 5 referral - declaration on exempted development - An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not confined to considering only that part of a proposed development that is situated in the outer maritime area.  This is purely an avoidance of doubt measure and it will be up to the applicant to determine what question is being asked of either the board or a relevant coastal planning authority.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 259 is a technical, drafting amendment, which seeks to insert, at the commencement of section 317(1) \"Subject to section 289,\" before \"Part X\".  The reason for this is that the board has already been granted its screening powers under section 289 and the initiated text would have resulted in a doubling up of those provisions.<\/p><p> Amendment 260 is a technical, drafting amendment, the purpose of which is to delete \"a planning authority\" and substitute \"planning authority\".  There is no other material impact.<\/p><p> The purpose of amendment No. 261 is, for technical and drafting reasons, to provide that 'excluded provisions' are expanded to include the listed sections.  These references need to be excluded for procedural reasons as follows: section 175 refers to local authority development and is not needed here; section 173(1) and (2) refer to appeals and are not relevant to Chapter III; section 173C(9) relates to applications to the coastal planning authority and are not relevant to Chapter III and section 174(1) and (2) already refer to the board appropriately and are not needed.  Similarly, the references to section 172 are necessary as the board is already appropriately referenced here already.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 262 inserts a new section 320 into the Bill.  The related amendment No. 263 seeks to delete the existing sections.  For clarity, I will deal amendment No. 263 separately.  Effectively, these new sections provide coastal planning authorities and the board the power to consult with the MARA with respect to the eligibility of the applicant to apply for planning permission in the first instance, but it is not limited to this.  The reason for this is that the planning authorities need to be sure the applicant is eligible to apply for permission having regard to the MAC requirements.  Moreover, there may be specific conditions to the relevant MAC that the planning authorities should be aware of when assessing the applications.  This amendment is relatively straightforward.  I am sure the Deputies will agree it is a useful provision.<\/p><p> I am dealing with amendment No. 304 with amendment No. 263 as they are related and should be read together for completeness. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#N01700","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":789,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

A similar provision is provided in the amendment proposed for page 227 of the Bill, being the insertion of a new subsection (1A) into section 157 at amendment No. 304 and the powers of authorised officers at amendment No. 209, already approved.

Subsection (6) of section 34.  \t3. Subsection (2) of section 177K.<br \/><br \/>4. Subsection (2) of section 247.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>This is a technical drafting amendment.  The purpose of the amendment is, for technical and drafting reasons, to add section 34(6) of the Planning and Development Act to relevant provisions for the purposes of section 312, relating to construction of references to development plan.  This effectively will apply the material contravention procedures to the national marine planning framework, ensuring that coastal planning authorities are held to account where they intend to deviate from the plan or, indeed, their own designated maritime area plan, DMAP.<\/p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 293 to section 4(1) of the Planning and Development Act is to include, in the category of exempted development, development by a coastal planning authority in its nearshore area, where the coastal planning authority is the owner of the maritime site on which the development is proposed to be situated, or it is the holder of a MAC granted for the occupation of a maritime site for the purposes of the proposed development.  The initiated text only provided for an exemption where there was a MAC.  This amendment applies the exemptions in the limited cases where the local authority is the owner of the maritime site. <\/p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 294 is to delete from section 4 of the Planning and Development Act, relating to exempted development, development consisting of prospecting for or working of minerals under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 and 2017, and the restoration of the area in which such prospecting for or working of minerals has taken place.  This type of development is now being brought into the maritime planning regime owing to the lack of a suitable assessment framework for EIA in the maritime area.  Amendment No. 291 relates to this issue. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 295 is a technical drafting amendment to change the reference of the current subsection (1A)(d) in section 4 of the Planning and Development Act to subsection (1A)(c).  This is a renumbering required as a result of the deletion of paragraph (c) of the initiated text and the subsequent amendments all do likewise in respect of the relevant paragraphs. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 296 changes the current subsection (1A)(e) to subsection (1A)(d).<\/p><p>Amendment No. 297 changes the current subsection (1A)(f) to subsection (1A)(e).<\/p><p>Amendment No. 298 changes the current subsection (1A)(g) to subsection (1A)(f).  I note a typo in the listed amendments.  The number &ldquo;5&rdquo; should be inserted after &ldquo;Part&rdquo; in this amendment as in the initiated text.<\/p><p>I will be instructing the Bills Office accordingly.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 299 changes the current subsection (1A)(h) to subsection (1A)(g).  The purpose of amendment No. 300 is to adjust the numbering in this list to reflect the renumbering.  This clause is similar to existing clauses in the Planning and Development Act 2000 that limit exemptions where an environmental impact assessment is required.<\/p><p> The purpose of amendment No. 301 is to adjust the numbering in this list to reflect the renumbering.  This clause is similar to existing clauses in the Planning and Development Act 2000 that limit exemptions where an appropriate assessment is required.<\/p><p> I want to flag to Deputies that I will table a further minor technical amendment on Report Stage to paragraph (b)(i) of the list in the new section 4(1A) to reference more accurately sections 8, 9 and 19 of the referenced Act at line 41.  These references were inadvertently omitted from the initiated text and should be inserted.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 302 inserts a series of new direct amendments to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to do two key things.  The first is to ensure the hierarchy of land-based plans, where they interact with the maritime area, has appropriate regard to the national marine planning framework when they are being prepared.  The second element relates to the functions of the Office of the Planning Regulator, where it is proposed to increase its training and functional review functions to cover the provisions of the Bill.  I will address each of these in turn but I note that, for clarity, all of the numbering in this Schedule will be adjusted to reflect the new insertions and deletions as provided for in the proposed amendments.<\/p><p> The following references follow the numbering in amendment No. 302.  Reference No. 4 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 12(18) of the Planning and Development Act is to provide that there is an obligation to ensure that any development plan prepared by a coastal planning authority should be consistent with the national marine planning framework.  This is to ensure compliance with the marine spatial planning directive and section 14 of the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021.<\/p><p> Reference No. 5 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 13(14) of the Planning and Development Act is to provide that there is an obligation to ensure any development plan prepared by a coastal planning authority should be consistent with the national marine planning framework.  This is to ensure compliance with the marine spatial planning directive and section 14 of the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021.<\/p><p> Reference No. 6 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 23(3) of the Planning and Development Act is to provide that a regional assembly, in preparing its regional spatial and economic strategy, must ensure it is consistent with the national marine planning framework if the strategy is likely to affect the maritime area.<\/p><p> Reference No. 7 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 31(1)(ba) of the Planning and Development Act is to allow the Minister to issue a direction to a planning authority where its development plan is not consistent with the national marine planning framework.  This is to ensure compliance with the marine spatial planning directive and section 14 of the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021.<\/p><p> Reference No. 8 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 31Q(1)(a) of the Planning and Development Act is to provide that the Office of the Planning Regulator can provide education and training programmes for members of planning authorities and regional assemblies in respect of the role of such members, authorities and assemblies in relation to guidelines issued under section 7 of the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 and policy directives issued under section 8 of the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021.  The purpose of the amendment to section 31Q(1)(b) of the Planning and Development Act is to provide that the Office of the Planning Regulator can provide education and training programmes for members of the staff of local authorities or regional assemblies in relation to maritime spatial planning.<\/p><p> Reference No. 9 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 31S(1)(a) of the Planning and Development Act is to add section 7 or 8 of the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 on ministerial guidelines and directives to the policies and objectives to which the Office of the Planning Regulator, in performing its functions, must have regard.  This is consistent with the provisions in respect of the land-based planning systems.  The purpose of the amendment to section 31S(1)(c) is to require the Office of the Planning Regulator, in performing its functions, to have regard to the national marine planning framework in addition to the national planning framework.<\/p><p> Reference No. 10 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 31AM is to require that the Office of the Planning Regulator includes consistency with the national marine planning framework in its evaluations and assessments of matters relating to development plans.  This is to ensure compliance with section 14 of the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021.<\/p><p> Reference No. 11 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 31AQ(2) of the Planning and Development Act is to require that the Office of the Planning Regulator includes consistency with the national marine planning framework in its evaluations and assessments of matters relating to regional spatial and economic strategies.  This is to ensure compliance with section 14 of the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021.<\/p><p> With regard to amendment No. 303, on foot of legal advice the purpose of the amendment to section 125 of the Planning and Development Act, regarding appeals, referrals and applications with which the board is concerned, is to insert a new subsection (2) stating that Chapter III of the Planning and Development Act, other than sections 126 to 134, inclusive, shall apply to applications under section 291 of the Planning and Development Act and requests under section 297 of the Planning and Development Act.  Section 125 as it stood before the insertion of this amendment will become subsection (1) of the section.<\/p><p> This construction will ensure the board is obliged to comply with the provisions of Chapter III of Part VI, save for the excluded provisions.  The excluded provisions are not relevant to applications under section 291 or requests under section 297 or a specific provision has already been made in the Bill, for example, oral hearings under the new section 305.  It is here that the obligations are placed on the board to publish the material referred to in earlier discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#R01800","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":964,"content":"<p>The Minister of State would not explain that again, would he?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021111000002#S00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":965,"content":"<p>With regard to amendment No. 305, the purpose of the amendment to section 173(1) of the Planning and Development Act on permission for development requiring environmental impact assessment is to insert \"or Chapter III of Part XXI\" after \"In addition to the requirements under section 34(3)\".  This is to ensure applications made under Chapter III are covered under the provision that relates to environmental impact assessment.<\/p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 306, the purpose of this amendment to the new section 178A is to provide for agreements between a local authority and another person to carry out development.  This is to provide for commissions, joint ventures and partnerships, and the previous wording did not permit this.  This would, for example, allow local authorities to work together or allow local authorities to employ a third party to carry out the works.<\/p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 307, the purpose of this amendment of new section 178A is to provide for agreements between a State authority and another person to carry out development.

As I read amendment No. 302 and as the Minister of State outlined its provisions, a shiver went down my spine as he articulated the iron grip of central government planning regulations closing in on what little is left of the local democracy of our city and county development plans.  I will not open up the argument here.  Much and all as I am concerned with this direction in terrestrial planning, I am equally concerned with the way in which it is articulated here.  It is a fight for another day.  The Schedule has 22 pages of amendments to planning and development Acts.<\/p><p>The Minister of State's amendments to that Schedule provide for another 35 changes.  If people here think this Bill is long, technical and complicated, they should look at the fully consolidated Planning and Development Act because it is probably one of most unwieldy legislative measures.  If the Department has a draft consolidated version of that Act incorporating both all of Schedule 12 and these amendments, it would be helpful to share that with the committee.

Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 4 are to be taken together and allow for non-European Union states operating to a framework decision.  This is particularly relevant for Schengen-associated states, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland, which are not EU member states.  The new section would allow states to be designated based on an agreement between those state and the EU.

I cannot tell the joint committee how many others within the communications division are fluent Irish speakers but I can get that figure for the committee.  I will discuss the issues raised by the Deputy about communications, as mentioned by Mr. Canavan.  Obviously our services to Irish speakers and Gaeltacht communities go beyond communications but communications is a very important part of it.  <\/p> <p>  During the period of Covid-19, we produced three booklets or leaflets that were delivered door-to-door across the State, including to Gaeltacht communities.  In listing these things, I am not saying we have done a fantastic job but describing what we have done and perhaps giving a commitment that we will build on it.  The booklet was in English only, and was produced very quickly in March 2020.  A decision was taken that there was an urgency to get the information out and that it would take some time to produce an Irish language version and therefore it was put out in English only.  The latter two booklets, in November 2020 and March 2021, related to vaccinations and were produced both in Irish and in English.  Key television advertising on Covid-19 vaccinations was translated, produced and played in Irish on TG4 and online.  We did over 100 Twitter posts in Irish on social media during the course of the campaign.<\/p> <p>  The HSE website has developed as a key resource for everybody during the pandemic for information about Covid-19 and the vaccination programme.  With the help of Mr. Mac Aodha Bhu&iacute; and his team, we translated 108 pages of the website relating specifically to Covid-19 information into Irish.  As I said earlier, I am not making any great claims about that as there are 80,000 pages on the HSE website but these were the most relevant pages and information on the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  The next step in the course of the first part of 2022 is to scope out a proposal to expand the Irish language content provided by the website, to come up with a proposal for how best to curate and manage that on the website, to cost it and to move forward from there.<\/p> <p>  I fully accept the Deputy's point about things we did not do that we should have done in communications.  The communications team would say that they worked at extraordinary speed during an extraordinary and very difficult time for the country and produced a certain amount of Irish language material, but we have a commitment that has been given from the very highest level in the HSE to do more about that we into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021111000002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Brennock"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1115,"content":"<p>Ar mhaith le Muiris O&rsquo;Connor na ceisteanna seo a fhreagairt?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021111000002#D00500","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1116,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta as an gceist agus as na point&iacute; a l&eacute;irigh s&eacute;.  &Oacute; thaobh na Ronne de, bh&iacute;omar ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar an gcumas at&aacute; againn freastal ar &aacute;r ndualgais gn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge agus ar an ngn&oacute; teagmh&aacute;la agus d&eacute;ile&aacute;la leis an bpobal, le polaiteoir&iacute; agus le haon duine a th&eacute;ann i ngleic leis an Roinn tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge.

I can list micro lessons we have learned from a communications perspective and maybe give an overall lesson.  In micro terms, there are specific things we could have done better.  There are more outlets for radio advertising as Gaeilge than we used and which we could use next time.  There is scope to better grow and curate the Irish language content on our website.  Quite early on in the pandemic, we started to maximise the exposure of those at senior level in the HSE who could speak Irish to do broadcasting, such as the chief clinical official, Colm Henry, and the national director for infection control, Martin Cormican.  We use them as much as possible on Irish language stations.  I could list all the things we did and all the things we certainly did not do.<\/p> <p>  As regards an overall lesson, reference has been made to Irish being not central, or being left to one side.  Many legitimate complaints were made about the vaccination portal and how little one could do in Irish in that regard for quite some time after it was introduced in English.  When the Covid tracker app was introduced, it was introduced in Irish and English at the same time.  The difference was that the vaccination portal was based on software bought in from elsewhere on which a lot of work then had to be done.  We built the Covid tracker app ourselves.  That work was not done terribly quickly.<\/p> <p>  The overall lesson is the point Mr. O'Connor made - that Irish was not central to our thoughts for many of those times.  I can give the reasons.  Deputy Connolly has very fairly laid out the reasons in that we were doing things quickly and fast.  I have to put my hand up and say that as we were doing those things, I did not think of Irish very often.  The lessons to learn is we have to understand accept the deep anger and annoyance out there over that, ensure we take steps to fix that and pursue the 2019-23 Irish language strategy.  Much work has not been done on that because of what we have been through over the past 18 months.  A lesson has to be learned about understanding the anger, irritation and annoyance that was caused and work has to be done to implement that Irish language strategy to take steps to ensure that if we face any extraordinary crisis such as this again, Irish is more central than it was over the past period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021111000002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Brennock"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1143,"content":"<p>N&iacute; theasta&iacute;onn uaim a bheith c&aacute;inteach.

T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go bhfuil na ranganna ar si&uacute;l ar l&iacute;ne anois, agus b'fh&eacute;idir go fisici&uacute;il freisin sar i bhfad, d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d san eagras at&aacute; ag lorg a gcuid Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Ag teacht &oacute; sin, an bhfuil buis&eacute;ad ar leith sa Roinn n&oacute; sa HSE chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus chun cuidi&uacute; leo si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim n&oacute; snas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge?  An bhfuil buis&eacute;ad ar leith &oacute; thaobh poibl&iacute;ochta de agus &oacute; thaobh gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta maidir leis an riachtanas at&aacute; ar na heagrais i leith Achta na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, 2003?  Beidh Acht eile ann laistigh de mh&iacute; nuair a bheidh an Bille at&aacute; sa Seanad inniu achtaithe.  T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist &eacute; a bheith cr&iacute;ochnaithe roimh dheireadh na m&iacute;osa.  T&aacute; obair le d&eacute;anamh ag gach uile Roinn agus gach uile eagras St&aacute;it chun dul i dtaith&iacute; air sin ionas nach mbeidh aon mhoill n&oacute; aon athr&uacute; ann.<\/p> <p>  N&iacute; dh&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; m&oacute;r&aacute;n tr&aacute;chta ar an mbileog eolais a cuireadh amach, seachas a r&aacute; nach leithsc&eacute;al ar bith &eacute; go raibh deifir &eacute; a chur amach i mB&eacute;arla.

Bliain ina dhiaidh sin cuireadh litir chuig gach uile thuismitheoir a bh&iacute; ag cur a bp&aacute;ist&iacute; ar ais chuig an scoil.  An teideal a raibh ar an litir n&aacute;: \"Return to Educational Facility Parental Declaration Form.\"  Chuaigh sin i mB&eacute;arla timpeall na t&iacute;re ar fad go gach uile ph&aacute;iste scoile.  Th&oacute;g s&eacute; leathuair an chloig orm Gaeilge a chur uirthi agus n&iacute;l c&eacute;im sa Ghaeilge agam.  B'fhearr liom go mbeadh s&iacute; i nGaeilge le bot&uacute;in n&aacute; gan a bheith ar f&aacute;il in aon chor.

Before I commence, I remind members participating remotely that they must do so from the precincts of Leinster House.<\/p> <p>  Today we convene to discuss the recently published report of the Pensions Commission.  We are all aware that the State pension is valued by our society and it is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at preventing pensioners from falling into poverty, and we want to make sure that this remains the case into the future.  However, a State pension should do more than protect a person from poverty.  It should provide financial security while enabling the older person to continue to live a fulfilling and active life.  It is also imperative that people who take time off for caring or homemaking reasons should be facilitated to do so, and their value and contribution to society recognised through the award of social welfare credited contributions for these periods.<\/p> <p>  There are clear challenges in ensuring the sustainability of State pensions for future generations, thankfully in part because people are living much longer.  This has been known for many years and confirmed in the report of the Pensions Commission.  The committee believes that in deciding the State pension age, the variations in work people undertake should be taken into account, as those working in manual employment have, in many cases, no practical alternative to retiring earlier than those in less physically strenuous employment.  We also believe that workers must be given the option of continuing in work if they wish to do so, and there are widespread benefits to providing an option of working later.  During these periods, they should have an option to pay PSRI if it is needed to receive full pension.  <\/p> <p>  The Government has asked this committee for our views on the recommendations set out in the report.  This follows on the from the committee's remit and our recent submission to the Pensions Commission.  In this regard, I welcome Dr. Claire Keane, senior research officer at the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, Dr. Barra Roantree, research officer at the ESRI, and Dr. Nat O'Connor, senior public affairs and policy analyst from Age Action Ireland.  You are all very welcome this morning. <\/p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such directions.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded that full parliamentary privilege only applies to those participating from within the precincts of Leinster House.  Witnesses participating remotely should exercise caution in terms of their utterances accordingly and be attentive to the direction of the Chair in this regards.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I call Dr. Keane from ESRI to make her opening statement.  She will be followed by Dr. Nat O'Connor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#A00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1197,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to be here today.  I am an economist working as part of the ESRI&rsquo;s taxation, welfare and pensions research programme.  As part of the Pensions Commission's public consultation, I, along with various ESRI colleagues, made a submission to the consultation summarising relevant ESRI and other research relating to issues on the financing and sustainability of the State pension, retirement and the qualifying age for the State pension and pensions and income adequacy in retirement.<br\/><br\/>The commission was established in part as a response to public discontent with the proposed rise in pension age.  The State pension age was due to increase to 67 in January 2021, having increased from 65 to 66 in 2014.  This increase was in recognition of the sustainability issues surrounding the State pension.  People are living longer and the population is ageing, so the old-age dependency ratio is set to rise substantially.  The proposed age increase was paused while the commission examined the issue. <br\/><br\/>Regarding pension age, Dolls <i>et al<\/i>. 2017 estimate that across Europe, including in Ireland, the pension age would need to rise by five years by 2030 to offset the effect of demographic change.  However, this is in the absence of any other change, such as tax or social insurance increases.  The positive fiscal effect comes mainly through increased taxes paid by those working longer rather than the savings made on pension benefits.<\/p><p>In our submission we pointed out that increasing the retirement age is not the only way to address pension affordability, increased PRSI or income taxes or reduced State pension payments for current or future recipients would also help with affordability.  Along with the proposed increase in pension age, the commission proposes increases in the self-employed rate of PRSI.  This would help to equalise the treatment of income from self-employment and employment.  They also propose other PRSI increases, all of which would help with the fiscal sustainability of the State pension.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the 2014 increase in pension age from 65 to 66, ESRI research from Redmond<i>et al.<\/i>examined this rise and found no evidence of a reduction in the retirement rate of 65-year-olds.  Why was this the case?  There was no real financial incentive to continue working until the age of 66, as retirees could avail of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for one year.  An additional and very important issue is that of the retirement age stated in employment contracts and occupational pensions.  These may take time to catch up with the policy change.  The recommendation by the commission to align retirement ages in employment contracts with the State pension age is therefore an important one.  In recognition of the fact that some people&rsquo;s contracts may require retirement earlier than the increased State pension age the benefit payment for 65-year-olds was introduced in 2021 to bridge the gap.  However, it is likely that such a payment will continue to result in people retiring before the increased State pension age.  Therefore, achieving improvements in the sustainability of the system via an increased State pension age is therefore likely to require reforms to such <i>de facto <\/i>pension payments.<br\/><br\/>The commission also recommends increased flexibility regarding access to the State pension, which would be welcomed.  This would include deferred access to the State contributory pension with a resulting increase in the rate of payment received.  This would allow those who want to work for longer remain in employment.  Importantly, given the finding of Dolls <i>et al.<\/i>2017, it would mean these people continue to pay income taxes for longer, helping the fiscal situation further.  In addition, while many people may welcome retirement, others may experience negative impacts.  Dave <i>et al.<\/i>2008 found that in the US - there is similar evidence for Ireland - there are negative physical and mental health effects of retiring, particularly where retirement was involuntary, meaning where people were forced to retire at a certain age.  Therefore, retiring at a later age may lessen or postpone poor health outcomes for older adults, raise their well-being and reduce health care services usage.<br\/><br\/>As well as increased flexibility, we also need to give people certainty regarding the State pension they will receive to allow them to plan accordingly.  Difficulties currently exist for those planning for retirement as they may be uncertain as to the State pension amount they will receive as the move from the old yearly average approach to the new total contributions approach has not been fully implemented.  The commission&rsquo;s recommendation that a full transition to the total contributions approach should occur as soon as possible is welcome, as well as confirmation on the calculation basis, that is, how many years or contributions will qualify someone for the maximum State pension.  This would provide certainty to future retirees.  It is also positive that it recommends the issuing of regular PRSI contribution statements that would inform those of working age of the State pension amount they can expect to receive. Therefore, people can plan for retirement accordingly.<br\/><br\/>Finally, the commission also examined the issue of pension adequacy.  A key area of policy concern is the extent to which those who retire will have adequate resources to fund their retirement.  Currently, the rate of income poverty among the older population is lower than for other age groups and the maximum State pension rate is higher than that of working age benefits.  Why then are some of the over 65 group at risk of poverty?  Up to one quarter of those receiving the State pension are getting below the top two rates, which can be explained by weak previous attachment to the labour market and periods of emigration.  Thus, the proposal to allow people continue to pay social insurance contributions past the State pension age will facilitate people to plug gaps in their contribution history.  We may also need to consider wider policy approaches, for example, the average pension income of retired women is 35% lower than that of retired men.  Therefore, policies that seek to keep women in employment for longer, such as affordable quality childcare, long-term care services and flexible work arrangements will also be important. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Claire Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1199,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Keane for her contribution.

Age Action is the leading advocacy organisation on ageing and older people in Ireland.  We advocate for a society that enables all older people to participate and to live full, independent lives.  In addition to my remarks today, we have provided a detailed written submission to the committee and we are happy to follow up with members on their queries.<\/p> <p>  A State pension is one of the signature policies of a civilised society.  It recognises that most older people do not have the means to provide an adequate income for themselves.  The current State pension system is vital, but flawed.  It fails to provide an adequate income for many people, especially women, such as those who worked rearing children or as carers, as well as those who are counted as dependants of their spouse, not as pension recipients in their own right.  The Pensions Commission makes useful suggestions to reduce the pension inequality experienced by carers in particular, although the commission did not have the remit to look at all inequalities in the system.<\/p> <p>  It is not a crisis that more of us are living into older age; it is a success story.  Most people can look forward to many years of healthy older age.  However, like many successes, there is a price to be paid.  The question for policymakers is simple.  Will you will fund an adequate State pension for all of us when we age, or will you shrink the value of the State pension by lowering the rate or raising the pension age?<\/p> <p>  Age Action agrees with the Pensions Commission that the State pension should be the bedrock for income in older age and that it should continue to be funded annually from tax and social insurance.  People have paid their social insurance on the basis that the State pension will provide a basic, but adequate income in older age.  Yet we know from those who have contacted Age Action that the lived experience of many older people is a weekly struggle to make ends meet.  We know from our budget analysis that inflation has reduced the spending power of the State pension by more than &euro;10 since January 2019, and the &euro;5 increase next year will only make up for half of that lost spending power, while inflation is projected to continue to rise.<\/p> <p>  We can define adequacy using evidence like the minimum essential standard of living, supplemented by costs that are particular to people in older age, such as healthcare costs.  We need a comprehensive study of ageing and the costs associated with ageing so the State pension can be rooted in that evidence.  Age Action agrees with the Pensions Commission about benchmarking and indexation of the State pension against prices and against earnings.  This is done across Europe, and it is essential to prevent older people from falling behind as the economy develops.<\/p> <p>  The Pensions Commission makes recommendations for raising social insurance over time, including self-employed and employers&rsquo; PRSI, which are among the lowest in Europe.  More detailed analysis is needed of these proposals, not least an audit of the likely effects on equality of outcome for older people.  For example, it would be unjust to force retirees such as former semi-State employees to pay PRSI on a modest occupational pensions when they have no entitlement to the State pension.<\/p> <p>  As expected, given their terms of reference and the programme for Government objectives, the commission reintroduces the proposal to raise the State pension age, starting at 66 years and 3 months in 2028 and culminating at 68 in 2039, or potentially older in later years.  This proposal remains premature.  How can we move the State pension age when a large proportion of employment contracts have a mandatory retirement age of 65?  How can we propose people work until 68 when many people in their 50s and 60s find it difficult to get job interviews due to ageism?  <\/p> <p>  The commission has also not made a compelling case that changing the State pension age will save a great deal of money.  The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s analysis is that the payment of alternative forms of welfare will negate much of what savings might be achieved.<\/p> <p>  The commission rightly identifies the problem of mandatory retirement clauses forcing people out of work a year before they have any State pension entitlement.  At a minimum, these should never be lower than the State pension age.  Age Action calls on the Government to go further and to ban compulsory retirement altogether, allow people to keep their jobs for as long as they wish if they are fit to continue work and do more to root out ageism in the labour market, which makes it so hard for older people to find new opportunities.<\/p> <p>  Age Action has a vision of a fair and flexible State pension system.  This should allow people to stop working once they have done a lifetime&rsquo;s work, which the commission suggests is 40 years of contributions, and in older age everyone should have an adequate income to live in dignity.  They should have the security of knowing their pension income is indexed to the cost of living and earnings, so that it will rise along with the rest of the economy.<\/p> <p>  Policymakers have a moral responsibility to ensure the State pension is adequately funded through fair and progressive increases in taxation and social insurance.  Everyone should have the choice to continue working for as long as they wish if they are fit to continue work.  Some people need to continue working due to housing costs and other demands.  Nobody should be forced to give up their jobs against their will, and no one should be forced to accept inferior terms and conditions at work because of their age.<\/p><p>The success story of healthy ageing and longer lifespans is a great achievement.  It is now up to policymakers to take the necessary steps to fund an adequate State pension, so that everyone can look forward to full participation and social inclusion in older age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nat O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1202,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Keane and Dr. O'Connor for their presentations.

Dr. O'Connor diverged slightly, in not wishing to push for an increase in the pension age, saying that it was premature.  As well as that, I point to pages 12 and 13 of the Pensions Commission's report, which outlines the four options that the Pensions Commission laid before the Government.  It made a recommendation about package four.  Do the witnesses concur that those four options are the best four mixes that we could take from the report?  Do they concur that the fourth option - which, to be reductive about it, is a little bit of everything - is the most workable?

We can clearly acknowledge that there is a problem, which is not just in Ireland.  Ireland has a slightly younger population than other European countries, so we have a little more time before this becomes an issue, but we know that the old age dependency ratio will rise substantially.  We will have fewer workers relative to the number of older people.  What do we do about that?  If we do nothing, if we do not touch retirement age or think about the rate of payment, then more taxes and PRSI will have to be levied on the working age population if we are going to avoid not having enough to fund pensions.  That in itself is not neutral.  If more taxes are imposed on the working age, there will be a distributional impact.  We know that there are lower homeownership rates and affordability issues for younger people, so there are intergenerational issues to account for.<\/p> <p>  In deciding what the right thing to do is, there are three main levers, which are changes to the pension age, changes to taxes and PRSI, or changes to the rate of the benefit.  The commission has come out strongly against changing the rate of benefit, citing the poverty reduction from the old age pension.  We know that the elderly poverty rate is lower than that of other age groups.  The pension has a significant impact on protecting older people from poverty.  Changes to the rate of payment have been taken off the table, so therefore we are looking at a combination of increasing pension age and increasing PRSI.  International research states that, by 2030, if we do nothing else, we would have to increase the pension age by five full years, which is substantial.  The research is not calling for that but is pointing out that that is what would be needed.  The commission has proposed an increase in the retirement age, but not to that extent, and also an increase in PRSI.  It is important to acknowledge that significant numbers of people may not want to retire at 65, and tackling the problem with contracts will be important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Claire Keane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1204,"content":"<p>It is not a problem that people are living longer but there is a challenge with how we fund the pension.  Looking at the figures in the Pensions Commission's report and its annexes, if the pension age is changed, as is recommended in the report, it covers less than 16% of the overall increase in the cost of the pension.  Paying for the State pension will cost 2.5 times as much by 2050 as it does now.  If we increase the pension age, thereby shrinking the amount of pension that people get, we will still have to pay twice as much as we do now to fund the pension.  Funding the State pension is a significant challenge, a large proportion of which falls on the social protection system and on the amount of social insurance that is paid.  We can slightly lower the cost by raising the pension age, unless we raise it radically.  That reduces the entitlement that people get by reducing the number of years they get it for, effectively shrinking what people gain from the system, even if they have paid into it for 40, 45 or 50 years.  That is why it is different and why we put the emphasis on social insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nat O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1205,"content":"<p>While reducing the pension payment might be mathematically legitimate, I think everybody on this committee, the Pensions Commission and probably the ESRI as well would not regard it as an outcome that we want.

I have a question for Dr. Keane from the ESRI.  In her submission, she pointed out the possibility of reducing State pension payments for current recipients.  Could she expand on that?  Has she a figure in mind?  Where did that come from?  We have to acknowledge that while the current rate, before the &euro;5 increase, is &euro;248.30, many pensioners are on much less than that.  No citizen of the State is an individual in the eyes of the social protection system.  A wife or a husband is a qualified adult, and those people do not get a pension in their own right.  Many people are on reduced pension rates.  I think it would be a bad move to reduce pension rates and I would not like to see that even be proposed.  I ask Dr. Keane to expand on that.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the issues with mandatory retirement.  I do not know if this has been made a bigger issue than it actually is.  Legislation was passed in this House, not for the first time, in 2016 to ban mandatory retirement in employment contracts.  It passed unanimously.  Issues arose relating to the Constitution and the retrospective nature of doing this for employee contracts.  I feel that we need to move on that.  I would love to hear any suggestions the witnesses have about how to move that forward.  It will allow people who want to, and are willing and able, to work on.  It is not just for financial reasons that they might choose to do so, since a job is all that some people have and they want to work on, with a social aspect being involved too.  Where we allow them to work on and they choose to do so, they can continue making their contributions and paying PRSI, which is important.<\/p> <p>  Reduced pensions for women are an issue, which is referred to in the ESRI's opening statement and has been raised by Age Action.  I note that in its submission to the commission, Age Action stated that the transition to the total contributions approach, which is the only way that the State pension will be calculated, is not straightforward, and I agree.  We need to look carefully at how that approach has worked for carers and women who have taken time out of work to rear children.  We need to make sure that that approach works and that it benefits people compared with the averaging.  I know that there were many issues with the averaging too.  Will the witnesses comment on the total contributions approach?<\/p> <p>  Dr. O'Connor mentioned in his opening statement that we need to do more to root out ageism in the labour market.  Will he expand on what we can do?  I agree that there is an issue.<\/p> <p>  On the adequacy of the State pension, the minimum essential standard of living was required &euro;252 this year, according to the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.<\/p><p>The State pension in January will barely reach that and slightly beyond.  Again, not everyone on a State pension receives the full amount, and that is the problem.<\/p><p> Linking the State pension to earnings, the cost of living and whatever else has been mentioned.  Where does Age Action think the rate of State pension needs to go in terms of a figure in the next couple of budgets?  I assume what is meant is the minimum essential standard of living plus in the case of the State pension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#C00600","speaker":"1604","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1208,"content":"<p>I will start by discussing ageism in the labour market.  For starters, compulsory retirement is at 65 years in many employment contracts where you do not even have an entitlement to the State pension.  The Employment Equality Act offers less protection to a worker once that person passes the age of 65.  It is possible to discriminate on age grounds after that point, so even if a person is in employment in his or her late 60s and 70s, he or she is less well protected by that Act.  That is a structural change that needs to be made.<\/p> <p>  It is simply the fact that, anecdotally, we receive many approaches from people who are in their late 60s and early 70s who need to work to meet whatever costs.  They have the skills, motivation and an ability to work, but as soon as their age comes up, the door closes.  We know that more than half the people over the age of 55 who are unemployed are long-term unemployed.  The evidence exists, and more research is needed, that there is a problem in terms of older people getting access to jobs and opportunities in the labour market.  We need to bring about both attitudinal and cultural changes.  If we are going to have a fair and flexible retirement system where many people will work into their late 60s and 70s, then you need a culture change that normalises that, makes it a choice that people have and that employers keep their doors open.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about mandatory retirement.  Again, the Pensions Commission identified that this is still an issue that needs to be further addressed.  For contrast, this matter was addressed in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s to rule out compulsory retirement comprehensively.  Ireland is looking at a similar problem 35 or 40 years later.<\/p> <p>  On the minimum essential standard of living, yes it is a plus on top of that because we know many older people face additional costs, sometimes significant costs, to do with healthcare or disability.  We know people in rural areas can face a lot of costs to do with transport, particularly if they are not able to drive at a certain point.  We know, if people are retired for 20 years, capital costs are a major issue in terms of home repairs, especially insulation and energy efficiency in the home.  We do not have an exact figure, which is why we have called for a long time for a comprehensive study of the cost of ageing.  Recently the State conducted a study on the costs associated with disability.  We now need to build on that by doing a comprehensive cost of ageing study.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nat O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1209,"content":"<p>The Government has asked the public for their views on research through the Creating our Future initiative.

We certainly were not suggesting a cut to the rate.  We were just acknowledging that the elderly poverty rate is lower than other age groups and the rate that older people get is higher than working age benefits.  Recognising that, elderly poverty would be 87% if the State pension did not exist, and it is brought down to under 11% once that State pension comes in.  We very much recognise the poverty protection the pension provides, so we are not suggesting a cut in the rate.<\/p> <p>  It is quite right to acknowledge that we have a quarter of people who receive below the top first or second rate.  We need to think about why that is.  That is mainly driven by people having gaps in their work history.  It can be people who have been abroad or it can be people who have taken time out for caring.  We need to think about what other policies would help tackle that, particularly the gender pensions gap.  There we are thinking about things like policies that would provide affordable, quality childcare.  We know we have extremely high childcare costs.  While some people might decide to take time out for childcare, others may be forced because financially they cannot afford to pay for childcare.  Therefore, childcare is very important, as is flexibility.  It may be that people, both men and women with children, may not want to work part time, or people who are caring for dependants such as elderly relatives etc. may want to have flexible work time or the option to work reduced hours.  Rethinking how we think about work is very important.  Perhaps in light of the pandemic and remote working, positives could come out of those.  We are certainly not suggesting a cut to the rate.  We are suggesting we need to look and see why it is some people get lower rates - they are the people who are especially at risk of poverty - and to tackle those issues.<\/p> <p>  In terms of working for longer, having flexibility in the system, whereby if people are close to being able to qualify for the maximum rate but do not have enough contributions, there is the ability to stay on and continue paying contributions, will be very important.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to Dr. Roantree because he is going to talk about the yearly average and total contributions approaches and the importance of certainty around that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Claire Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1213,"content":"<p>That is an issue that is close to all our hearts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#D00700","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1214,"content":"<p>I will add to what Dr. Keane said before discussing the total contributions and yearly average approach.  In research we have done in the ESRI over recent years, one group we pointed out who were at a high risk of poverty among retirees, although the overall at-risk poverty rate and deprivation rates are lower than for other age groups, are those who live alone in the years before retirement.  That is a group the Government has recognised on foot of this research, and they are ones we need to be particularly concerned about.  From that point of view, increases in the living alone aspect in recent years are quite welcome in that they are very well targeted towards a group we might be especially concerned about of being at higher risk of poverty or deprivation among retirees.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, there will be some winners and losers from going from the current career averaging system towards a total contributions approach, TCA, system.  A point we made in our submission to the Pensions Commission when public consultation was open was that, ultimately, this is something on which there is a need for much greater certainty.  We were meant to move to the TCA system several years ago and that decision has been repeatedly pushed out.  That generates real uncertainty for people who will retire in the years ahead about how much they will get in retirement.  A few Deputies have commented on the importance of looking through the details of this matter, which is incredibly important.  It would be good to see more research on who will gain and lose from this.  Not much has been published on that as far as I am aware.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, there is an imperative to move relatively quickly towards the TCA system, if that is what we are going to move towards.  Otherwise people will face this uncertainty in that they do not know what they will get in retirement, and that is not a good situation in which to be.  Given the long-running nature of the pensions system and if we expect people to be able to provide resources for themselves in retirement on top of the State pension, that is a decision that very much depends on how much they think they will get in retirement.<\/p> <p>  There are some welcome measures suggested in the report compiled by the Pensions Commission that would provide greater certainty, such as regular statements of entitlement and what that will likely get you in retirement.  While that is to be welcomed, there is a need to move towards this TCA system, if that is the system it has been decided towards which we are going to move, and to provide the details, at least, on that, what that will provide and how we are going to transition towards it.  Again, transition arrangements can be introduced and were, I think, fleshed out in the Pensions Commission report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Barra Roantree"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1215,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Keane, Dr. O'Connor and Dr. Roantree for their comments and presentations.<\/p> <p>  I very much support the comments made by my colleague from County Roscommon, Deputy Kerrane, about women who took time out to raise children.

We sent it out in paper form and online and got over 270 responses from people across the country.  As the Senator can imagine, there was a variety of circumstances but many people were finding it difficult to meet the cost of living.  There was a huge amount of concern over energy prices and we have seen 10% and 12% increases announced recently, with some utilities announcing increases twice in a one-year period.  The cost of insurance is a big concern for people, especially those in a rural area who need to keep a car on the road.  People cannot afford to replace their car but even maintaining it is a significant cost in rural areas where it is an absolute necessity for people so they have their independence.  Home insulation or any kind of retrofitting is very expensive and people are concerned about how to address those costs.  There is also private health insurance.  Not everybody has it, but many people go without very basic necessities because they feel they need to keep their private health insurance.  People have raised many issues with the cost of living with us.<\/p> <p>  A fourth lever available to us to ensure income adequacy in older age is looking at these prices.  In other jurisdictions, utility companies have a cap on how much they can raise prices by in a single year.  We have already introduced rent control zones here.  We know from the last census that one older person in 50 is now renting in the private rental sector.  That is a risk going forward.  Of course, rents rise very quickly and that is not captured by either the EU-level harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, or the minimum essential standards of living.  Prices in the private rental sector are increasingly affecting older people.  Thus, there are quite a lot of costs people are worried about but we can do things to control those costs through policy as well as looking at the actual amount of money they get.<\/p> <p>  On poverty among older people, those living alone are statistically more likely to experience problems with poverty.  One person may be looking after a household with one income where previously there were two before a spouse passed away.  It is disproportionately women who end up living alone because we know that especially past the age of 90 years, women outnumber men on a two-to-one basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nat O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1218,"content":"<p>Does the ESRI want to add anything there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#E00300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1219,"content":"<p>I will just make a very quick comment.  The Senator was talking about enforced retirement and the research certainly shows the effects this can have.  The paper I cited was on the US but we have similar evidence for Ireland.  It shows the negative mental and physical health effects are worse for people who are involuntarily retiring, in other words, people forced to retire at a certain age.  There is a wider thing to think about there.  From the person's point of view it would be positive for his or her own well-being to stay on in employment and not be forced to retire.  There would be physical benefits as well.  There would be benefits for the health system as we would not have as much usage of it.  The really key thing with people staying longer in work if they want to is they are then paying income tax and social insurance for longer, so that is all quite positive.  I totally agree with what Dr. O'Connor was saying about not having those enforced retirement ages.  That is going to be really important, especially as we will face a labour shortage if we do not have increased participation of older people.  If we have fewer and fewer young people working then we are going to have to draw down that expertise of older people and have them participate.<\/p> <p>  On the gender gap, as Dr. O'Connor pointed out, women are more likely to be living alone and therefore more likely to be in poverty when they are older.  There is a continued gender gap in occupational pensions as well.  We have lower participation rates of women which feeds through their entire lifetime.  It is improving.  If we look at the proportion of men and women who are getting the State contributory pension, there has been a large gender increase there with many more women getting that pension.  That is reflecting rising female participation.  It is going to be something important.  Challenging the things stopping increased female participation will be important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Claire Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1220,"content":"<p>I thank both speakers for their presentations.

I have a concern I want to put to Dr. Keane and Dr. O'Connor to see what their response might be.  There are huge numbers of workers who are physically wrecked or exhausted from a lifetime of working.  I am thinking of construction workers, workers in our meat factories and workers in retail.  I refer to the idea that they will not be able to retire at 65 or 66 and must work until 67, or indeed 68 if we follow one particular path set out in the Pensions Commission's report.  What are those people to do?  If we really buy into the idea of flexibility, surely we must also buy into the idea that it works both ways.  That means people who are tired after a lifetime of hard work should be able to retire at the current retirement age at the very least.  We are talking about a huge amount of the workforce here.  This is a large section of factory, construction and retail workers.  It does not seem morally right to suggest they must work on to the age of 67 or 68.  Our guests might give me their comments on that.<\/p> <p>  I ask Dr. Keane to comment on Dr. O'Connor's point that the savings from increasing the retirement age do not add up to a huge amount when we factor in the replacement payments typically made in the form of social welfare payments.

We already have the situation that people are unable to reach the current retirement age.  There is an alternative system of illness or disability payments if people have poor health.  There can be an all-or-nothing approach to working whereby a person works full-time or not at all.  On facilitating people to work part time, many employees who talk about retiring early show a preference for perhaps reducing their hours.  It is about not having people retire fully and having part-time work available.  Increased flexibility away from the State pension but also in work would be quite important.  We could think of people who may have lower levels of educational attainment and started working aged 17 or 18.  If 40 years is the target for contributions, the Pensions Commission suggests that people who have made their 40 years of contributions could potentially be able to retire below the mandatory retirement age as they have made their full contributions.<\/p><p>That might be one way to help that group.

There it will be quite important to look at why, as the previous ESRI research showed, people actually did not retire later when the age increased.

They need to be reformed alongside moves to increase the State pension age.  Effectively, the ESRI's research found that when the State pension age was previously raised, people just took up the payment they could get instead of the State pension.  There was not therefore really an increase in the State pension age.  We just provided a way of claiming a different benefit for that.<\/p> <p>  It can be, and we know this from research in other countries, that if the de facto as well as the legal pension age is raised by also addressing those other benefits, increases in the retirement age are seen and they do contribute to significant savings from both, as my colleague Dr. Keane mentioned, the increased tax revenue one would get from people working later in life as well as from the savings from not paying out the State pension for an additional few years.  It is important to highlight there are real savings to be made from raising the State pension age.  However, it should not just be that in and of itself.

First, the Pensions Commission makes an important recommendation that we look at the possibility of earlier retirement for people who have done 45 years of arduous work.  It is an important recommendation that they could retire at 65 with the full State pension if they have made enough contributions.  This would cover people who started work in their teens or at an early stage.<\/p> <p>  We are getting into a lot of complexity, which is good, because the issue of how tax and welfare interact is at the heart of this question.  It is right there is a Commission on Tax and Social Welfare that will look at this in more detail, because we need to get into the detail.  If we were to raise the pension age today by two years, we would certainly see a situation whereby many workers who do arduous work would simply be unable to find other work and would be on a social welfare payment.  We do not yet have a society or culture where there are job opportunities for people in their late 60s into their 70s.<\/p> <p>  On the question about the taxation side, that those who are in work are paying the taxation to fund the system, while that is certainly true at the current time, the Pensions Commission makes recommendations about social insurance, including increasing social insurance on those who are beyond the age of 65.  While Age Action is certainly not advocating for that, it needs to be looked at through an equality lens to see the equality of outcome we would have between different generations and different people as of mechanism for funding the pension.  It is important to look at studies such as by Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins in UCD about the overall distribution of taxation.  Many people on low incomes would pay a proportion of their income in VAT and other consumption taxes equivalent to the proportion of the income tax paid by those on higher incomes.  Tax revenue comes from a number of sources.  If we were to follow the Pensions Commission's recommendations, social insurance would also come from a wider base to fund the State pension system.<\/p> <p>  On the intergenerational question, I again would urge caution here.  It is certainly not welcome when people say pensioners have a lower poverty rate than people who have disability.  It is not right that anybody should be experiencing poverty in a situation where they rely on the State for support.  Likewise, we should not be pitting older people against younger people.  If we are looking at the intergenerational issue, we need to take a much wider lens.  Today, over 52% of younger people are going to third level education.  For people who are now retired, third level education was an opportunity afforded to an elite, which was less than 5%.  The opportunities afforded to younger people are different.  Their possibility for earning in the labour market throughout their lifetime is different from older people.  They are likely to earn higher incomes in a higher value-added economy, which provides us with the productivity and the capacity to fund the State pension.  We cannot simply say there is intergenerational unfairness about who is paying.  We need to take a wider look at how we as a society generate taxation and how we create different benefits, both direct payment benefits and public services such as education, across the whole population.  That is how I would address that point.<\/p><p> Carers should be included among those who are engaged in arduous employment.  It is equally important that we prioritise health and safety at work, for example with regard to the use of machines and devices, to reduce the physical damage people incur through their working lives.  If we can reduce acquired disability throughout the life course, that will lead to people having a better quality of life in older age.  It is important to address the issue of arduous employment as a matter of public policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#F01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nat O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1236,"content":"<p>One of the problems with getting reports that are 244 pages long is that, with all the other work, it takes a long time to get an opportunity to read the report in detail, from A to Z.  I would be the first to admit that I certainly have not done that but I will do so when I get an opportunity during the Christmas break.  I believe in reading reports but one of the challenges we face in the modern world is that many long documents are produced, one after the other, and they keep piling up on one's desk.  Even politicians are limited to a 24-hour day.<\/p> <p>  I thank anyone who spends a year in a constituency clinic, facing real people with real problems in all the myriad circumstances of their real lives, rather than the ideal lives that are often presented to us.  We must deal with real people and their real lives.  Rules are often brought in when nobody has thought about the real consequences for real people.  One is left wondering what the hell were we thinking about and asking why we did not talk to some real people.  I am very disappointed, although I am a member of a Government party, that nobody who has spent a life as a labourer, in the building trade, as a carer or working in a physical industry was placed on the commission to explain their point of view on pensions.<\/p> <p>  One great move I have seen during my lifetime and which I do not want to see undermined is the move from a big proportion of the pension group getting non-contributory pensions, with the Victorian attitude we have to means-testing in this country, to the vast majority getting contributory pensions.  That was partly because one could not get a State pension in the past if, for example, one was a self-employed small shopkeeper, small farmer or anything else.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  What are the differences at the moment between the benefits throughout the social welfare system to which a self-employed person is entitled and those to which an employed person is entitled?  My understanding is that, actuarially, the greatest benefit we all get for our contributions to PRSI is not an invalidity pension, jobseeker's benefit or any of those things, but a State pension.  Therefore, if a calculation is conducted on an actuarial basis, what would the self-employed rate be versus the employed rate?  At the moment it is 4% compared with 14%.  If that is calculated actuarially, comparing benefit and cost, what would the difference be, objectively?  I know many self-employed people on small farms and in all sorts of circumstances with modest incomes and the best insurance policy they were ever offered in their lives was the possibility of getting a contributory State pension.<\/p> <p>  As I said, I have not read the full report but the commission might confirm the following.  Ten years ago, the proposal was that 30 years of full credited contributions, or a mixture of paid and credited contributions, was going to be a full record.  Is the commission now recommending 40 years?  One might say that people start working at the age of 20 and when they retire at the age of 66, they will have 46 years of contributions.  However, many people have breaks in social insurance.  The carer's contribution helps, particularly for men and women who have taken time off to care for someone, and it is more often women.  There are still people with all sorts of gaps.  Some people go abroad and pay their social contribution elsewhere.  It is not for me to judge the actions of another man or woman but when such people get to pension age, they regret that they worked on the lump, but these are realities.  That is the difference between a theoretical exercise in the not-real world and what happens when one is dealing with real people who suddenly hit a wall.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Keane mentioned increasing PRSI and income tax.  Of course, there was no talk about phasing out the universal social charge, USC, which was only intended as a temporary measure introduced by the Government of the time.  I was a part of the Government which made the decision, on a very temporary basis, just to get us over a financial crisis.  If that is eliminated, PRSI can be adjusted by taking what is going into the USC and putting it into PRSI.  I often hear a mantra that the poor do not pay taxes.  Of course they do.  They pay VAT.  They pay taxes on their beer and if they buy cigarettes.  They pay taxes on petrol, fuel and so on.  People are paying taxes all the time.  Two things could be introduced that would capture young and old.  A wealth tax could be introduced.  I have no principled objection to that, and I know my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues will be happy to hear me say that.  Higher VAT rates on luxury goods could be introduced.  If the State decides something is a good idea, it can always raise the money, as has been seen in the past.  In the past two years, we raised something like &euro;20 billion when we needed to because we were not going to allow people become suddenly unemployed because of a virus.  I wonder why the focus is so narrow on the tax front.  There are many ways to raise tax.<\/p> <p>  I deal an awful lot with people who do physical work.  They might be carers or nurses.  They are all sorts of people.  I also deal with people who are burned out after 40 years.  It is interesting.  Many people who have desk jobs in the public service or in teaching are out the door when the opportunity arises at the age of 60.  That is common enough in the public service.  We are saying here that people must feel up to it, mentally and physically, until the age of 66, 67 or 68.  I have the experience because I am beyond those ages.  I am well past the pension age but I am still working 16 hours a day.  That is my luck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#G00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1237,"content":"<p>A few of the Deputy's constituency colleagues hope he would retire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#G00300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1238,"content":"<p>That is surely the case.

It is not my experience of life.  Many people are counting the days until they get their pensions.<\/p> <p>  One option would be to introduce the State pension transition, if people remember what that was.  A person would have to be retired to be eligible.  Someone could not get it and have a full salary although they could have a small amount of part-time work.  That would be something.  If the State pension transition was introduced for those who cannot continue working and actually retire, not necessarily because they were forced to but because they retire, what extra cost would that include, taking into account the point Senator Gavan made?  I often come across people aged between 60 and 66 who find it hard to get a job and, in many cases, have physical difficulties, conditions or injuries, including bad hips, that make them eligible for an invalidity pension.  The definition of eligibility for an invalidity pension is that one is incapable of work for a year or more.  It takes into account the work a person is trained for and which he or she has traditionally been doing.  A university professor would be able to sit at a desk in a wheelchair.  The invalidity pension is relevant to someone whose whole life was spent doing physical and manual work, for example, a block layer.<\/p><p>That has to be taken into account in regard to the invalidity pension.  The problem with that is people will have to get social welfare.  They cannot be left to go on nothing.  Many of these people would pass a means test but means tests are invidious, as any of us who spend our lives helping people with means tests will know.  In the case of the invalidity pension, it is back to trying to make cases and getting consultants' reports on whatever, and the person has no income.  He or she will have worked all his or her life, yet must try to prove this argument all the time.  I have had cases where the doctor clearly said the person could not work for a year or more, and we end up in the argument relating to the basis on which the person is not capable.  You then have to prove the disability relates to the work he or she was doing and was qualified for doing as per the Act.  It gets messy, although we normally win in the long term.  My colleagues and I are expert in this.  We normally win in the long term but it puts people through the ringer, and in the end there is no saving for the State because something has to give.<\/p><p> I think the 45-year contribution aspect, whereby people can retire after 43 years, will be a minority sport.  In time, I imagine it will become even more of a minority sport as more and more people engage in some kind of education, apprenticeship or whatever and will not have the stamps.

The end goal we should seek relates to how we can ensure everybody has an adequate, decent income in older age, regardless of the paths they have followed, whether they have been in caring or have a disability.  That has to be the end goal.  The issue of how we fund the State pension follows after that.  As for the actuarial cost or value for, for example, the self-employed, that is something the Pensions Commission goes into.  It suggests increasing, in a slow and predictable way, the PRSI contributions of the self-employed, and that is something I imagine the Commission on Taxation and Welfare will look into in more detail.  It would be certainly welcome if that commission were to call more witnesses and have a broader range of inputs, including from the variety of people who visit the Deputy's constituency office or those of other Deputies, to allow them to give their side of the story.<\/p> <p>  The idea that the USC could be converted to PRSI has been considered in the past.  The Pensions Commission's report suggests an annual tax payment should be made by the Exchequer to the Social Insurance Fund as part of a tripartite approach to funding the State pension.  A conversion or use of the USC for that purpose might be one way to finance that contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.  It is a long-term concern that, at the moment, the Exchequer lends money to the Social Insurance Fund and, even though it is done on a pay-as-you-go, annual basis, there is a legal or accounting fiction to the effect that the Social Insurance Fund is a separate fund from the Exchequer.

On why we are looking at PRSI only, I do not think there is a good economic reason.  The Pensions Commission does that because its terms of reference restricted it to doing so, broadly within the existing system of the Social Insurance Fund.  That is why it is focused on that.  I agree with the Deputy that we should examine options for raising revenue elsewhere as well and that it should not be restricted to PRSI.  We published a report earlier this year exploring various options for raising taxes and I would be happy to send a copy to the Deputy and the committee.  Ultimately, as Dr. O'Connor said, we should not get caught up in the idea of the Social Insurance Fund.  It is an accounting device issue rather than a real constraint.  There is an issue relating to the sustainability of payments more generally but that is tied in to the sustainability of the wider public finances.  The Pensions Commission talks about raising taxes and having an Exchequer contribution and, in that regard, it is talking about raising taxes elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  The point the Deputy made about the self-employed is really important.  The Department of Social Protection published some figures on this a year or two ago.  Self-employed workers now have access, in value terms, to about 93% of the benefits that are noted and paid out of the Social Insurance Fund to which contributions give people an entitlement, even though they make, as the Deputy noted, a much smaller volume of contributions as a share of earnings than are made on behalf of employees.  A report from the Department of Social Protection, which, again, I would be happy to send to the committee, indicated that covering the pensions entitlement alone would require something of the order of 15%.  The figure would need to increase substantially and that is the case regardless of whether there is an issue of sustainability.  There is an issue of equity in the sense of whether we should grant full pension contributions and other contributory benefits to the self-employed.  Without class S, however, the self-employed rate is nowhere near the class A rate for employees and employers.  There is an important issue there.  Even if the sustainability issue did not exist, there would be a case for doing what the Pensions Commission suggested in that domain.<\/p> <p>  On the wider point, the Deputy is entirely correct.  To the extent that we want to address the fiscal sustainability issues that exist, we should not be restricted to examining PRSI only.  We should consider the entire tax and welfare system but, as I said, the Pensions Commission was constrained in what it could consider from that point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Barra Roantree"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1246,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Keane, Dr. Roantree and Dr. O'Connor for their presentations, which were very insightful.

Over recent weeks, a number of my constituents have come to my clinics - the real people Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned - and, in the case of two women who are classified as dependent adults, the payment of their pensions is still associated with their partners.<\/p><p>In both cases it is, unfortunately, a controlling partner.

We have touched on that issue previously.

Dr. O'Connor might have an opinion on the people Age Action would deal with and the issues they face.<\/p> <p>  On the gender gap, the Senator is correct in that there can be situations where it is more likely that the woman is getting the increase for the qualified adult.  A positive development in the past few years that has been in place for quite a while now is that by default the increase for a qualified adult is paid directly to that adult.  That is different from all other benefits.  In the case of unemployment supports, it is a lump sum.  The personal rate and the increase for the qualified adult is paid to the person who qualifies.  It is positive that those payments are separated, but the amount of increase for a qualified adult is less than the personal rate.  <\/p> <p>  As pointed out, the gender pensions gap is showing that women are getting pensions that are 35% lower.  That is a combination of State pensions and occupational pensions.  Once women qualify for a State pension, they do not tend to qualify for a lower rate of State pension than men.  The big difference is that there are fewer women who qualify.  That is driven by lower female participation rates over the lifetime.  There are, of course, historical reasons for that, including the marriage bar in Ireland some decades ago.  There are large historical legacy issues.  Female participation is rising but women still have both a large income gap and a large pensions gap because they are less likely to work and when they do work they are more likely to do so part time.  We need to think about what drives that.  For some, that may be choice, but others might be constrained by not having access to affordable childcare.  There have been some positives in recent years in terms of the introduction of the national subsidy for childcare, but again many people do not qualify for that.  Realistically, unless we tackle the issue of lower female participation and a higher likelihood of women working part time, this will continue into the future.  <\/p> <p>  There is one issue we have not talked about thus far, namely, auto-enrolment.  Ireland is the only OECD country to not have a mandatory or soft mandatory occupational pensions scheme.  We are an outlier at the moment, but there are plans to introduce auto-enrolment such that people would contribute PRSI not only towards their State pension but also to an occupational pension.  Unfortunately, the research we published, which is available on the ESRI website, shows that this will not increase female pension coverage, in the main because women are less likely to be working and when they are working they are more likely to be on lower incomes that are under the threshold for auto-enrolment.  Unfortunately, auto-enrolment in itself will not do a huge amount for the gender gap.  It is about tackling the issues as to why we have quite low participation rates of women.<\/p> <p>  It is hoped that recent developments such as parental leave and paternity leave, such that childcare responsibility is being shared between men and women, will bring about some positive changes but we need to try to tackle why we have much lower female participation rates than male participation rates as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Claire Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1249,"content":"<p>I invite Dr. O'Connor to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#J00300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1250,"content":"<p>Dr. Keane has addressed many of the issues in her responses.  One of the recommendations in the Pensions Commission's report is that in regard to the 20-year cap on homecaring credits there should be a movement beyond that cap for people who are long-term carers.  There is an attempt in the report to define how a long-term carer might go into a registry in order not to be caught by that because somebody could care for their children and then later in life care for a parent with a disability, for example, and suddenly his or her pension contributions would stop at an arbitrary 20-year cap out of the 40 years' contributions.  The Pensions Commission makes the important recommendation that we might move beyond that.  The question is why that should be made so onerous.  Why have a 20-year cap at all?  Why not just dispense with the cap?  That needs to be unpicked.  The recommendation in the Pensions Commission report is quite specific: anybody getting a dispensation beyond the 20-year cap would only get social insurance credits towards the pension but not towards any other social insurance payment, yet the same person on reaching 60 could require a disability payment or an illness payment that he or she would be barred from getting, or would get it a lower rate.  The 20-year cap needs to be looked at as an equality issue within the pensions system, one that particularly affects women.<\/p> <p>  As I said, Dr. Keane has addressed many of the other points.  Women are working part time more often than men.  There are other explanations of why women are likely to have a lesser pension.  In terms of the qualified adult payment, this is the legacy of what is known as the male breadwinner model of social insurance, that is, the assumption that it is the man who goes out to earn an income and brings homes the money.  It is welcome that the qualified adult payment is paid to the spouse, but why not simply pay one pension, compriseding a core payment and a qualified adult payment, split it 50:50 and pay it equally to both spouses?  There is an assumption in the system that there is a male breadwinner.  On a cost-neutral basis, we could create more equality in the pensions system by simply splitting that block of money on a 50:50 basis.  That would require us to, perhaps, change the frame of analysis because we have to take into account the work that people do as carers, sometimes men but more often women, bringing up children.  That work within the family should entitle someone to an equal pension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nat O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1251,"content":"<p>I will allow a brief intervention from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#J00500","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1252,"content":"<p>That brings me to a something for which I have been fighting for 30 years, namely, why not pay the dependant adult double the single rate?

Reams of information have been published.  The OECD is a good source because it publishes quite detailed reports on pension systems across Europe.  The majority of the systems are pay-as-you-go.  Annual tax and social insurance is raised from the economy and that money is used on an annual basis to pay the pensions.  The structure of the pensions systems vary.  Many countries have a very low basic pension but the more you earn and the more you pay in social insurance, the more you are entitled to an earnings-related State pension.  That is very different from the system we have.<\/p><p>We have a single core payment which is more generous than the core payments in other jurisdictions but we do not have the earnings-related element on top of that.

The Social Insurance Fund is often put forward and discussed as if it pays pensions.  It does not.  It is more of an accounting device than anything real.

It is all of tax revenue as long as we have a pay as you go system and particularly, as Dr. O'Connor said, as long we have that not earnings-related but unitary pension, which has a lot of value.  By having that higher level, it provides a kind of insurance to people knowing that in retirement, through contributory or non-contributory pension, they will not fall under.

On the first one, if the witnesses want to venture an answer it is great.  If they do not, I will excuse them.  It picks up on a comment Deputy Kerrane made regarding removing the mandatory pension retirement.  She made the point that constitutional issues have been flagged.  In this country over the past decade, we dismissed constitutional rights when we introduced emergency measures in the public interest.  Surely dealing with the issue of mandatory retirement is in the long-term economic interest of the country.  It should not cause a problem.  It seems the problem is being falsely created at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Keane made the point on women's participation and the fact that one quarter of people get less than the full rate.  The majority of those are women and women are forced to leave the workforce for childcare.  This is a huge issue.  Its submission to the Pensions Commission, the committee made the point that people taking time off for homemaking and caring reasons should be facilitated and get their credited contributions.  It comes back to the comment Dr. Roantree made on the 20-year threshold.  If we address the issue regarding homemaking credits in terms of carer's credits and go beyond the 20 years rather than having an arbitrary cut-off, does that not add to the economic argument to support childcare and women as much as possible in the workforce?  There will be, at the other end, less credited contributions to give, especially in relation to the homemaking element of it.  Will the ESRI representatives comment on that?<\/p> <p>  My next question is again for the ESRI.  Has any modelling been completed on the removal of the mandatory retirement age and of the barriers to people continuing in employment beyond the current retirement age, along with the recommendation of the Pensions Commission on the removal of the age cap on PRSI?  Surely that would bring in a potentially significant additional amount of PRSI contributions if it was done in tandem with a flexible approach to retirement.  The witnesses may correct me if I am wrong, but the likelihood, given what has happened in the US, is that people will work considerably longer, but not necessarily full time.  They have reduced hours as they continue longer.  That brings health benefits.  People are not falling off a cliff in terms of retirement.  They are working fewer hours, getting a balance between work and retirement and still making an economic contribution.  There is the add-on impact of retaining the knowledge built up in that employment sector.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to the 40-year versus 30-year threshold for full contributions.  Is it not the case that no one is going into private sector employment today who will have a 30- or 40-year unblemished employment record?  That is unattainable in the current working environment.  Does that not need to be reflected in the total contributions approach we take to pensions?

If we spend money on childcare, we often think how much it costs and the Department with responsibility for children will be focused on how much the subsidies cost.  We tend not to look at the knock-on positives of that for the fiscal situation.  The Chair is right that, while it might be costly to provide childcare subsidies, we are not thinking of the long term.  If we have more women in employment for longer and, perhaps, doing more hours, there is a tax bonus.  Similarly, if we have people working longer and remove mandatory retirement ages, there is a positive impact on our tax take.  It is important we think more about the bigger picture.<\/p> <p>  I am a researcher so obviously I will call for more research.  Research can be done on that.

I have a terribly wide one to finish on, but never mind that for the moment.  I very much agree with the idea of transparency in respect of PRSI entitlements.  Again, there is a disproportionate impact on women.  I am thinking of the phase of life I have just come out of, the starting-a-family period.  The last thing on my mind during the six to eight years of sleepless nights was what my pension contributions were going to be.  It disproportionately affects women because their work history is affected.  Having transparency much earlier is needed.  As I sit here as a Green Party spokesperson on social protection, I have no earthly idea what my PRSI contributions history entitles me to.  This is because retirement seems so far away and distant.<\/p> <p>  The ESRI appears to welcome an increase in PRSI payments.  Reading the report, I saw nothing but hard decisions everywhere.  There are no easy decisions.  Under the four packages, particularly package one, which is not the one favoured by the Pensions Commission, there is a substantial increase in PRSI contributions mooted, particularly in respect of the self-employed.  I want to give the delegates an opportunity to expand on their views on that.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to give the delegates an opportunity to refer to auto-enrolment.  It was said that Ireland is the only OECD country that does not have auto-enrolment and that it might not have the impact we would like, particularly on women's pension provisions.  Having regard to the contributions expected, I believe the total contributions approach would not become significant by 2030 but, by 2070, in all the packages presented by the Pensions Commission, it would be significant.  I want to give the witnesses an opportunity to expand on that.  Dr. O'Connor made an interesting point on a State-led savings option in any auto-enrolment system.  I want to give him an opportunity to talk specifically about that.<\/p> <p>  My next question, on the living alone payment, is also directed at Dr. O'Connor.  We are aware that there are groups more at risk of poverty than pensioners and that people living alone comprise one such group.  I want to give Dr. O'Connor the opportunity to comment on some of the specific provisions that have been put in place, specifically through the last two budgets.  I very much agree that we should be aiming at a minimum essential standard of living, MESL.  I very much agree that we should be benchmarking and that it should not be a matter of a yearly discussion about adding &euro;5 to the pension.  Are we going far enough with the specific provisions concerning the living alone allowance?<\/p> <p>  I warned the delegates that I would ask a wide-ranging question last.  We were talking about how we could address the pensions deficit by increasing women's participation in the workforce, but that prompts a question about the future of work, not only for women but also for people more generally.  This was excluded from the terms of reference of the Pensions Commission but it is included in those of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  The Pensions Commission report includes models to bring us as far as 2070, which is 50 years into the future.  Over the past decade, we have seen the rate of change owing to artificial intelligence and digital disruption.  Are we using a completely flawed premise if we are considering mapping out today's work practices and today's world of work for the 50 years ahead of us?  Do we not need to be much more creative in planning for future social welfare provision if the world of work changes in the radical way that I believe it might?  I warned the Chairman about how broad my last question would be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#L00300","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1264,"content":"<p>We might start with the ESRI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#L00400","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1265,"content":"<p>Maybe I will respond to the question on PRSI and pass on the part C, higher-level question that the Deputy asked at the end.<\/p> <p>  In our submission to the Pensions Commission and our opening statement, we highlighted that there are, as matters stand, very much differentiated rates of PRSI levied on different forms of economic activity.  An employee pays the class-A employee rate, which is 4%, and an employer's rate is either a little more than 8% or over 11%.  That adds up to a quite substantive amount; however, the class-S rate, for the self-employed, is just 4%.  A point we have made in our budgetary analysis over recent years, along with the OECD, the National Economic and Social Council and a vast number of other bodies, is that it is very difficult to justify differences of this magnitude in PRSI across different economic activities.  A counterpoint is that the 3% surcharge of USC on the self-employed is also hard to justify.  It should be either abolished or applied to other employees on grounds of consistency.  Historically, the argument made for the low rates of PRSI applied to the self-employed was that they did not have access to the same benefits.  That is no longer the case.  Over the past few years, access to the vast majority of contributory benefits has been extended to the self-employed.  It amounts to 93% in value terms.  The Pensions Commission's recommendation seeking to address this is welcome regardless of whether there is a fiscal sustainability issue with the State pension.  It would be better if it could be achieved simultaneously with the roll-out of any remaining benefits.  That is my answer to the Deputy's question on some of the reasoning and thinking in this area.  I have referred to an important part of the Pension Commission's recommendations and one that is welcome, not just on grounds of sustainability but also on grounds of equity more broadly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Barra Roantree"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1266,"content":"<p>On the living alone payment, Age Action welcomes the recognition that older people living alone are at higher risk of poverty and material deprivation.  Therefore, benefits such as the living alone payment are very valuable.  It went up 16% in the last budget.  It is a very appropriate measure to deal with a cohort who are particularly badly affected.  What happens is that if one member of a couple with two incomes and home expenses passes away, the other is left living alone.  While he or she may have the living alone supplement, it is still very modest, at &euro;22 per week, and does not make up for the loss of the spouse's pension or income.  That affects people quite considerably in making ends meet.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, however, the State pension is meant to provide an adequate basic income.  It is not just an anti-poverty measure.  Therefore, we caution against any move simply focusing on bringing everybody above the poverty line.  It is about a basic, decent income so people can participate in society and be included.  When people have an income they can rely on, they are more likely to spend money in the economy.  They are more likely to be active in society and their health is better.  A slew of benefits follows.<\/p> <p>  This brings us to one of the core recommendations of the Pensions Commission's report, namely the one on benchmarking and indexation.  In the past, we had a benchmark of 34%, or about one third, of average earnings.  The commission warns that this benchmark might not be high enough to keep people out of poverty; therefore, we must consider carefully the level at which we set the benchmark.  It should not just be a percentage of average earnings in the abstract.  This is why we need the cost-of-ageing study.  We need to consider the MESL.  Also, since housing and health costs are not included in respect of the MESL, we need to include them in a more comprehensive study.  That should be our benchmark.<\/p><p>Indexation means as prices go up in the economy and earnings go up, the pension is linked to that.  People then have security as they know their pension is going to keep up with the economy and they will not be left behind.  That is a core message.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's point about the report being full of nothing but hard decisions, that is absolutely true.  That is why it is so important we look at those hard decisions, especially around raising social insurance.  There may be a misunderstanding about raising the pension age, that if we do that we can somehow kick to touch this issue of funding the State pension.  At best, raising the pension age deals with a small fraction of the cost.  It is about putting in place a funding model.  That is the challenge the Pensions Commission has laid out.  It has proposed various streams of how social insurance might be raised, and it should be said, raised slowly and steadily over time.  There should be no sudden shock to the economy.  It is that sustainability we need to build in.  We have one of the lowest tax bases, and in particular one of the lowest social insurance bases, across the EU.  If we want to attain European standards of welfare protection for people we must look at how we fund that.<\/p><p> I hesitate to say much about the future of work other than what we are looking for is a flexibility for older people so they can stay in work.  That flexibility is something we are likely to see throughout the life course as people perhaps move in and out of full-time and part-time work, care duties and working in the home.  As long as we have that model of flexibility extending into older age we simply need to ensure the social protection system takes account of that by allowing people to make contributions in flexible ways and then giving people payments that are likewise flexible in a situation where the working life is perhaps going to be more complicated than it was in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nat O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1268,"content":"<p>Does Dr. O'Connor want to address the State-led savings option?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#M00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1269,"content":"<p>Yes.  Auto-enrolment is a good idea.  It is inviting everybody to save more for their own retirement.  We know there is a human difficulty that people do not perhaps imagine they are going to make it to older age but the good news is the great majority are going to make it.  When we reach the age of 65 years most of us can look forward to 18 to 20 years of life and of course one wants an income at that point and might not be able to generate one.  In order to not just have the basic State pension but a bit more comfort and spending power, auto-enrolment is a good idea.  Of course, one might ask where that money is going to go.  If it is entirely that people are going to make these pension savings and it is going to go into private pension funds that is not necessarily a bad thing but people would need transparency about where that money is going.  Is it going into the oil industry, for example?  That would be wholly inappropriate given State policy on climate action.  Some people may want to have a safe option of perhaps a lower return whereby their auto-enrolment contribution would go into a State-led fund to give them a safe return, as they do not want to rely on the ups and downs of the Stock Market for their own pension savings.  Pension savings must generally be triple A-rated but we need to look at where the auto-enrolment money is going to go.

I hope the questions I ask have not already been answered.  If they have it is fine as I will watch this back.  We can skip over.  Just before I was leaving, the ESRI was talking about the significant savings that can and would be made if the pension age was increased.  Does it have specific figures for those savings because it is clear that argument has been challenged?  I have heard Mr. Michael Taft of SIPTU and others argue against it so I am wondering whether the ESRI has specific figures.<\/p> <p>  We have seen very slow moves on mandatory retirement ages in contracts.  If nothing happens on it and the pension age increases to 67 years, what does the ESRI propose happens then?  While it may be the case people took up that payment at 65 years, and up until recently that was a jobseeker's allowance payment, in many cases people had no choice.  They could not remain at work beyond 65 years of age and had to take a lesser payment.  For many people it was not so much the lesser payment of &euro;203 per week, it was the fact that after perhaps 40 years or 50 years of work, they were asked to sign on for a jobseeker's payment.  That was really inappropriate for many people.<\/p> <p>  On auto-enrolment, I agree with what Dr. O'Connor has said on the need for it to be State-led.  We are going to be making a big ask of people and today's workers where auto-enrolment is concerned, when it is introduced - and it is already behind schedule.  For many workers who are struggling to pay rent and trying to save for a mortgage, requesting they put money aside for a pension is a big ask, albeit very important.  I agree we need it so we have the State pension as the bedrock and auto-enrolment as that supplementary pension for people.  Private pensions, if people want them, are the third layer.  We have seen the risk with the likes of defined benefit schemes and people being left with little or nothing.  We need to ensure that risk is eliminated as much as possible.  I am aware there are matters outstanding regarding what the State contribution to auto-enrolment will be but we must get that right.  I agree with what Dr. O'Connor has said on that being State-led.  There will be fees as currently it is very complex.  There are many providers out there.  We need to make it as simple as possible for people.  We need to ensure there is something at the end and they can see that quite clearly as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#M00400","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1271,"content":"<p>We might take the ESRI first as there were specific questions for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#M00500","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1272,"content":"<p>I will jump in there.

There was no real increase in the actual, real retirement age.  That is sort of a problem.  If we do not change the retirement age at all then we are going to have to increase taxes and PRSI further.  We are suggesting a balance between those two.  We would need to ensure that if we are going to increase the pension age then we ensure people are not forced to retire at a younger age and that they can continue to work.  Also, if we continue to offer those benefits people can continue to draw down, such as the benefit payments for 65-year-olds, realistically it is not going to do very much.

If, however, we change the pension age as recommended, it will be 8.3% of GNI*.  There is that difference of about 0.9 percentage points.  It represents a significant amount of money but, seen in the bigger picture, it covers only 16% of the cost of the State pension.  The remaining 84% of the cost of the State pension has to be covered through funding.  The difficulty with even that 16% is that those are the Department of Finance's figures assuming that people continue to work rather than draw the State pension.  The Department of Social Protection's analysis, however, is that a significant proportion of those people are not working at present and, therefore, not contributing to taxation but drawing down a different welfare payment, whether a transitional pension, a jobseeker's payment or whatever else, such that the net benefit is even smaller.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt but that money can be saved by raising the pension age, but that is not the main issue.  The main issue is how we fund a sustainable pension when we will have a significantly larger number of people drawing down the pension and living longer.

Consider the public sector, where there are early retirement options at times, and the number of people taking those options.  They might do something small part time but they do not continue in their full-time jobs.  Many people feel when they have done 40 years - and studying is working - that they have done their piece.  We would not want to run away with ourselves with the idea that if the age is raised, everyone will start working later and later.  They will find other ways to try to do what they wanted to do, and that is to retire.<\/p><p>Does the ESRI have figures as to what percentage of State pensions, non-contributory and contributory, were funded from the Social Insurance Fund in the 1960s and how much of that came from the Exchequer?  I will remind the committee of how averaging came in.  If you had only ever paid social welfare for three, four or five years from the day social welfare came in - I think it was in the 1950s - you were immediately entitled to get the full pension.  That is why averaging was introduced in the first place.  There was a much bigger percentage of people getting non-contributory pensions, so we just funded it out of the Exchequer.  The world has gone backwards.  It seems to have made very complicated what was awfully simple.  In the past, if you decided on a policy, you funded it.  Have the witnesses any statistics on this?  To my knowledge, the Social Insurance Fund did not pay for itself, even for the contributory pensions.  When you go back to look at the figures, you can see that the non-contributory proportion was huge.<\/p><p>The second issue I wish to raise is auto-enrolment.  I am not against people paying into private pension funds.  I have my reservations about it because, between the taxman grabbing money out of private pension funds to fund the tourism industry - I think it was in 2011 that this happened - and the vagaries of the markets with banks going bust and all sorts of unforeseen acts, it can be a little risky to put moneys into future funds, even with AAA ratings.  There is very little return on ethical money at the moment, unfortunately.  If you start paying in today, if auto-enrolment is introduced tomorrow, when will it have an effect such that people will see a significant gain over what they would have had if they had not been enrolled?  Will that happen in 20 or 30 years' time?  In the meantime - and this is the <i>quid pro quo<\/i>- I understand there is to be a straight State cash contribution into auto-enrolment.  How much would the State have put in?  I would set that against the alternative.  Has anyone done an analysis on this?  PRSI is the ultimate auto-enrolment in the State pension fund.  If you put the same money into a mandatory scheme, it is much better for the less well-off.  I guarantee that.  It might not be as good for the most well-off.  Is auto-enrolment for the people who are way up there in wealth terms?  For the average person with employment here and employment there in retail and so on, is the best auto-enrolment of them all, compared with this new fancy auto-enrolment, telling the employer and the employee to pay into the Social Insurance Fund?  It is just a mandatory auto-enrolment scheme.  It is the most mandatory of them all and you cannot opt out of it.<\/p><p>The other thing is that with the new auto-enrolment you can opt out.  Then, in time, it will be said, &quot;You can be poor now because you opted out.&quot;  As I said earlier, however, and as I think my good colleague said, when you are 35 or 40 you are trying to keep the mortgage paid and you will do stupid things in your short-term interest.  That is why I am not the greatest fan of auto-enrolment.  The best auto-enrolment system of them all is the one that the State controls and which does not rely on investment funds.  Has the ESRI looked at this in the round and asked why we should not put our auto-enrolment where the State has the biggest grip on it and force the employer to pay into that auto-enrolment scheme?  Is this just some big thing driven by the pensions industry?  This happens right across Europe, by the way, so telling me they do things in Europe does not overly impress me one way or the other.

Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is right that the procedure has been that we do not take in as much in PRSI as is spent on benefits linked to PRSI payments.  It is a very weak link in that sense.  At that time, if you just had a stamp or were deemed eligible, you got the payment.  That link is therefore quite weak.  The history of the Social Insurance Fund is that the State just topped it up when there was not enough income in it.  For that reason it is nearer an accounting fiction than a real device.  That is not to say there are not issues surrounding sustainability of pensions and so on; it is just that they are not really because of the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p> <p>  I will add, from a parliamentary perspective, that one thing the committee might be particularly concerned about is that the Social Insurance Fund does not qualify as voted expenditure.  There is therefore also an issue of transparency surrounding the Social Insurance Fund in that it does not necessarily come into the budget day discussions and it is a little hard to work out how much is actually being spent in additional payments because some netting of the Social Insurance Fund has to be done in order to try to work out what is going on there.  Again, the Pensions Commission was really constrained by its terms of reference into looking within the existing broad structure of that system.  Several Deputies, including Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, made well the point that, historically, the approach has been that when we have not raised enough in PRSI, we have an Exchequer contribution from general tax takings.  Therefore, pensions are best thought of as funded on a pay-as-you-go basis through the entirety of tax revenue.  That still means we need to consider how we pay for that for the pension in the long run, but it is a broader question than just PRSI or the pension age.  It is a more holistic thing.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. Keane, on auto-enrolment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Barra Roantree"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1282,"content":"<p>We have a couple of reports relating to auto-enrolment up on our website.  I am sorry - I do not mean to add to the Deputy's reading burden.  He can just read the first executive summary pages.  I swear, everything important is in them.  We profiled who are the people who will be auto-enrolled.  They will be mainly those on lower incomes.<\/p><p>The plan is to have a &euro;20,000 threshold and, as such, one will not be automatically enrolled if one is under &euro;20,000.  That is to protect those on lower incomes.  However, people who currently contribute to a pension are, in general, those on higher incomes.  That is in large part because the pension may be provided through their employer in the private or public sector and, in addition, there are significant tax benefits to higher earners for contributing to a pension.  Those on higher incomes get 40% tax relief on contributions and there is quite a large lump sum they can take out tax free at the end.  At the moment, without auto-enrolment, those on lower incomes will be more affected by not having a second or occupational pension on top of the State pension.<\/p><p> As regards behavioural reaction, the Deputy is quite right that people may face affordability issues.  This week, we published an article on our website that considered the distributional poverty impact of the auto-enrolment charges.  We did not find those impacts to be substantial because there is that income cut-off such that only people earning above &euro;20,000 will be auto-enrolled.  The behavioural evidence shows that if people are auto-enrolled, the vast majority of them do not drop out.  They are auto-enrolled and can drop out after six months, but what we have seen internationally in countries that have introduced this is that people tend to stay in.  Once  people start paying, they sort of get used to it and tend not to drop out.<\/p><p> On the question of whether it should just be put into PRSI, that is a whole other ball game.  However, it is worth noting we have to recognise the State pension is a flat-rate amount.  I refer to those who are on a higher income and may have relatively high costs of living.  We know older people now may be less likely to own their home and may still have to pay rent.  We do not want people who are not on the lowest level of income to have a big shock to their income because there will be a big negative effect on their well-being if they suddenly face a significant reduction in income in retirement.  Having auto-enrolment to go in line with the flat-rate State pension would mean people throughout the income distribution would have their incomes protected.  We know those at the top are already paying into pensions and will not be massively affected by auto-enrolment because the vast majority of them are already paying in.

If you wanted to implement the concept of people who pay in more getting more out, that could be done through the State pension if you really wanted.  At the moment, if a self-employed person pays in &euro;500 a year, he or she will get the full whack, while a person on &euro;100,000 obviously pays far more, with a total of &euro;14,000 between employer PRSI and employee PRSI.  However, that levelling out is a good thing, in my view.  It is a redistribution of wealth and a decision the State made.<\/p> <p>  If auto-enrolment were to be introduced tomorrow, would people have to be paying into it for 20 years or so before getting significant benefits of all the money they have put in?  That kind of means the people who are now 50 or 45 and so on will not get much benefit from this gig.  It is very much for people who see the pension as being somewhere in the distant future.<\/p> <p>  By the way, one thing that was repeated a few times, and with which I agree, is that people should own their own homes.  However, that is a political job for us to do to make sure people own their own homes, as they did in the past.  It is a much bigger task and it is not just for this committee.  I do not agree with the concept of people of pension age living in rented accommodation.  I do not live in a country where that is common.  I want people to own their homes.  It has great value for society and it has contributed greatly to Irish society, but that is a different day's work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#O00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1285,"content":"<p>The number of people who are aged 65 or over and are at work has increased by 50% in the past five years.

A concern is that the State pension should give people an adequate income and the auto-enrolment should be attractive to people to give them a supplementary income.  We would be very concerned about a situation where one needs to be in auto-enrolment because one's State pension will be so low that it will not bring one out of poverty.  The State pension needs to be the bedrock, as the commission says, and the auto-enrolment should be for a supplement.  There is a need to provide more education and encouragement, particularly to lower income workers, for their own benefit, to build up that supplementary pension so they can have a more comfortable older age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111000002#O01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nat O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1296,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses for attending and for their very constructive and positive engagement with the committee.

I thank the Chairperson and the members of the committee for the invitation to speak here.  This committee plays a crucial role in guiding policy, and I look forward to hearing the perspectives of and suggestions from committee members following this statement.  They will be valuable to me as I commence my role.  I commit to bringing all the points raised here back to the full Port of Cork Company board for discussion at our December meeting.<\/p> <p>  I am a native of Kildare and I have spent my career between the public and private sectors.  I am currently responsible for global commercial operations for the US energy technology company Smart Wires, which specialises in delivering electricity infrastructure to enable grid connections for renewables with minimal disruption to the environment.  Before taking up my post with Smart Wires, I held senior leadership positions in EirGrid, the ESB and the Irish Wind Energy Association, IWEA, now Wind Energy Ireland, WEI, and I was also a lecturer in University College Dublin, UCD.  I have been a member of various corporate boards, including those of Smart Wires Grid Europe, WindEurope and the System Operator for Northern Ireland, SONI, as well as some small private companies.  I chair the research advisory committee for the Global Power System Transformation, G-PST, Consortium.  I have a PhD in engineering and a masters in business administration, MBA.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the Port of Cork, it is Ireland&rsquo;s second-largest port and its designation as a trans-European transport network, TEN-T, core port by the European Commission confirms its importance as a tier 1 port of critical importance as a part of European and Irish infrastructure.  The port has recently doubled its container capacity with the construction of a new &euro;100 million container terminal at Ringaskiddy.  Due to its favourable location on the south coast of Ireland, its modern deepwater facilities and these recent investments, the Port of Cork is ideally positioned for additional European trading as well as for yet unexploited deep sea shipping services.  The port has responded strongly to the challenges arising from Covid-19 over the past two years and has played a critical role in keeping supply chains moving smoothly, while also maintaining its own operations on track.  The Port of Cork Company's safety record is strong, and I commit to ensuring continued investment in systems and processes to keep our people safe.<\/p> <p>  I turn now to a brief overview of some of the key opportunities and challenges I see ahead for the Port of Cork.  First, several significant physical moves are anticipated in the near future.  Phase 2 of the terminal at Ringaskiddy will allow the Port of Cork to move the remainder of its container business from the city to the lower harbour.  It will also increase national port capacity, and that will help to relieve some of the pressure on other ports.  The completion of the M28 road will be a key enabler of this increased capacity.  The addition of a customs facility or border inspection post at the Port of Cork would allow for more efficient transport of organic foodstuffs from outside the EU into Ireland and reduce the cost and carbon impact of bringing these products to Irish consumers.  I note that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is considering this matter.  The Port of Cork also plans to develop bulk trade at Marino Point and to utilise the rail link there, where feasible.  That will reduce the carbon impact of this trade by moving freight from road to rail, as well as allowing the bulk trade to leave Cork city's quays and thereby leaving those docklands free for development.<\/p> <p>  Second, the port is also playing a key role with other State stakeholders in providing the necessary infrastructure to support renewable energy projects, especially regarding offshore wind.  I see significant opportunities in this area for Ireland and for Cork.  We will work closely as a port with the wider industry, the Government and all stakeholders to ensure that we play our part in delivering Ireland&rsquo;s potential in this area.<\/p> <p>  As I look forward, I note that the Port of Cork will need to continue its strong growth to meet the needs of Irish consumers and industry and to generate the revenues required to sustain our operations and future infrastructural development.  I am mindful of the relatively high levels of debt that the port has relative to its earnings arising from recent infrastructure developments.  I note that to finance further Port of Cork investments in infrastructure facilities in Ringaskiddy and Marino Point, the company anticipates a need to realise value from surplus assets in addition to generating free cash from trading.<\/p> <p>  As chairperson designate, I assure the committee that we in the Port of Cork will redouble our efforts to improve our sustainability and to reduce the carbon impact of all our operations.  We will also continue to work closely with our host communities to ensure sustainable operations and minimum disruptions to the lives of the people who live or work near our facilities.  I again thank the Chairperson for the opportunity to address the committee and I welcome any questions or suggestions that he or the members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021111000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1304,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Walsh for his opening statement.

We will obviously review it in quite a bit of detail as a company and board, and we will be actively involved in a process.  We welcome the opportunity to share the views of the port management and board with policymakers.<br\/><br\/>I will turn to the finances.  I would not describe that as a challenge, based on my initial examination of the accounts.  The company has done an excellent job in bringing forward significant major capital investment in a very efficient way.  We now need to be mindful of making sure that we operate prudently to continue servicing the debt that we took in, and growing our operations and business.  I do not think there is any problem <i>per se<\/i>, but it behoves us to operate prudently, keep a close eye on the situation and make sure that we are setting ourselves up to continue making investments as needs arise.  I do not think there are any issues or that jobs are at risk.  It is more a matter of needing to be mindful and continuing the prudent management of the business.<br\/><br\/>On offshore wind and hydrogen, I see a huge opportunity for Ireland and Cork.  We have a tremendous natural resource available to us in the wind industry, and we are seeing greater interconnection to Europe and opportunities for us to take a natural resource and share it with some of our European neighbours.  This is a scenario I was previously heavily involved in in Ireland and I continue to be incredibly optimistic about the future of the sector.  There is a particularly good role for Cork in this, given its favourable location on the south coast of Ireland and very good access to a lot of other areas.<br\/><br\/>With hydrogen, there is a significant opportunity of Ireland and Cork.  I note that Cork is a historically good location based on the Kinsale gas field.  There is a lot of really good existing infrastructure there.

I will mainly give my comment from a slight distance based on that.  There is huge potential.  When I was in IWEA I always looked at the need for joined-up policy and thinking.  Developing a large offshore wind project is very complex and capital intensive.  For the operator, it is important that there is joined-up thinking between the availability of planning, consents, licences and grid connection support systems.  They are all fairly major pieces of consents or licences.  Trying to get all of them lined up and ready within the same timeframe to enable a quick delivery when we are looking at very ambitious targets of 2030 will be one of the key challenges.<\/p> <p>  I know from informal conversations with stakeholders that there is a lot of optimism and ambition.  This committee and Oireachtas Members have a role in guiding practicality and joined-up thinking.  That is probably the single biggest challenge.  The ambition is good.

If we have time we will come back to questions on that.<\/p> <p>  I refer to parts of Cork Port which fall under the remit of my constituency.  The witnesses spoke about Marina Point, which is in very close proximity to the town of Cobh and Great Island, and aspects of future growth in the facilities in Cork Port.  I have a few points I would like to raise with Mr. Walsh.  I ask him to understand that we are under time constraints.  <\/p> <p>  What is the current status of Marina Point?  A concern raised regularly with me by residents in the Cobh area is access to some of the commonage areas around Marina Point.  There are wonderful walkways there.  Grassland is not being maintained.  There is an opportunity for Cork Port, before there is a permanent plan, to use a minor amount of money in the grand scheme of things to bring the area up to a standard whereby it can be utilised.  That would benefit the people of Cobh.  I have walked the area and have visited it with people living in the region.  With very little investment a lot could be done for the people in the town of Cobh.  Approximately 30,000 people live in Cobh and this is a key concern for them.<\/p> <p>  I also want to raise another issue.  Dual access on and off Great Island is a major issue in Cobh.  It is an issue repeatedly raised by the local chamber of commerce for Cork Harbour and Cobh, under the president, Ms Johanna Murphy.  She and her colleagues have done fantastic work to lobby on that issue.  I have been in constant communication with the Government about it.  Does Cork Port have a position on the need for extra road capacity and dual access?  Belvelly Bridge is an ancient bridge which is definitely no longer fit for purpose for the type of traffic going over it.  It is extraordinarily narrow.

Our views are aligned with the Deputy's suggestions, and we welcome his support in that regard.  It is an important issue.<\/p> <p>  I want to make a general point related to much of my experience, originally in the wind industry: there is a need for good engagement with communities.  Operating properly, in co-operation and consultation with local communities and their representatives, generally makes things run much more smoothly in building infrastructure of good quality that meets both national needs and the needs of the communities that host it.  That is one of the key principles that I want to bring to the Port of Cork as chairperson.  All the comments the Deputy is making are incredibly valuable.<\/p> <p>  I was fortunate to have an opportunity to visit the port three or four weeks ago and meet the CEO.  I had a wonderful walk around Paddy's Point pier, where I saw the facilities that the port has put in place.  I heard many encouraging sentiments about the need for community engagement and developing facilities.  All the points that have been made on the Cobh area and Great Island sound incredibly important.  I will discuss them in more detail with the port management.  We would definitely look to see where there are opportunities to bring things forward that benefit the local community.

I have only two minutes left approximately.  I welcome Mr. Walsh's replies but have a question.  It is great to hear he is interested in community engagement.  I would welcome him to Carrigaloe and would be delighted to show him in person what I mean by the Port of Cork creating some type of amenity in conjunction with Cork County Council around Marino Point and using the facility that is lying idle.  That it is lying idle is a great shame.  It is beautiful along the banks of the River Lee as it heads south towards the sea and into the lower harbour.<\/p> <p>  I have a request for the Port of Cork.  It is important for Mr. Walsh to be aware of it.  People listen to what the private sector and major State bodies have to say.  Mr. Walsh has a major and critical role.  I am aware that he is not a native of Cork but he will probably grow into his role and do well.  I wish him well in the role but ask him to push the Fota road issue with the members of the Cabinet and State agencies such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  It is a complicated matter because it requires the reclassification of a regional road as a national road.  It is hard to find an example in the country of where this has happened, particularly in Cork, which has the most roads per kilometre in the country.  Therefore, it is quite complicated.  I am sure there is plenty of infighting involving the local authority's roads department, which is doing a great job, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, with which everyone knows I have many problems.  It is a development I would like Mr. Walsh to push.  It is necessary and badly needed.  To ensure the full use of the Marino Point site, having road access will be crucial.  The new Cork metropolitan transport area strategy, which will treble the capacity of the rail network in the east-Cork region, including the area past Marino Point and to Cobh, will also be crucial.<\/p> <p>  Bearing in mind those two points, will Mr. Walsh accept my invitation?  I would be delighted to have him in the area, including Marino Point and Cobh.  Could he commit, in his new role, to working to push these items with the Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021111000002#E00200","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1320,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his invitation.

To the extent that we in the port can play a constructive role in boosting the infrastructure, we will do so.<\/p> <p>  It is great to have the Deputy's support.  It is incredibly important that public representatives and State companies have the same understanding of issues and try to bring forward developments that will benefit local communities.

My understanding is there has been a significant upturn in trade and the economy and Ireland is doing incredibly well.  This needs more port capacity.  With the infrastructure investments the Port of Cork has made in recent years, it is in a position to be able to help with national port capacity and help to sustain continued growth in the economy.  The Port of Cork will be a very good entry point for a large part of the country.  It is logistically close and accessible to many other parts of the country.  From listening in at the previous board meeting, I know there is definitely an appetite for growth in the port.

There were many things that we probably just assumed would never change and in the space of two or three years, we are in a different world to where we were.  The Port of Cork has been no exception.  My understanding is that through the pandemic, there were good working arrangements with the staff.  Some of the committee members mentioned the staff and everything I have heard from the management and the board has been complimentary about the staff of the Port of Cork.  I feel privileged to be joining a team that has stood up and helped to keep supply chains running and operations happening in a challenging and difficult environment.  I recognise that and it is not something I take for granted.  I am privileged to feel I am joining a team that has a group of people who have gone over and above the call of duty and delivered so much.<\/p> <p>  I understand that not one ship was missed in the Port of Cork.  The logistics continued to run incredibly smoothly throughout the past two years.  Supply chains remained open and logistics kept functioning as described.  There was, obviously, a lot of change in commercial patterns and logistics due to Brexit.  A lot of traffic that may otherwise have come from the UK is now coming directly from mainland Europe  There have been various other changes.  As was mentioned, there have been changes around the cruise line and passenger traffic.  Looking through the accounts, that posed a particularly difficult challenge last year and the year before.  At that time, there were relatively small financial volumes, relative to the infrastructural investments that were being made in facilities such as Ringaskiddy.  A significant amount of debt was taken on to enable that infrastructure to be delivered.  The management and board have done a remarkable job in keeping supply chains open but also in growing business, opening routes and getting out and trying to find areas where the Port of Cork is a better and more sustainable solution for logistics providers for shipping in terms of reducing carbon, as well as improving the facilities and businesses in the port.<\/p> <p>  I do not have detailed facts and figures but it is something into which I will look.  I will try to come back with some of the managers to address the details and give a bit more flavour on these matters.  There has been remarkable change in the past couple of years.

Currently, when we are importing foodstuffs such as bananas from Costa Rica or other foodstuffs from the US, which are organic foodstuffs, the first port of entry into the EU must be a customs inspection port and those facilities are not currently available in the Port of Cork.  What can happen is that either the transport can be rerouted to Dublin, where those facilities exist, and that brings a degree of congestion and extra travel with it, or in some cases I believe it is going to other EU countries first, so it travelling from the Americas, coming to mainland Europe, clearing the agricultural inspections there and then being put back on a ship and coming to Cork for transport into Ireland.

I mentioned the public service aspect of it.  That is important to me.  In addition, there is always an interest in doing something new and the challenge of doing something a little different.  There are a few of those aspects to it.  More generally, as we look at energy we see that things are converging more at present.  I am also involved in the Global Power System Transformation Consortium, which is essentially looking at what we need to do to get to a net-zero world.  It emerged from the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory and one of the main themes it is bringing up is the converges of electricity, energy, transport and heating and how all these things must come together in the future to enable sustainable living.<\/p> <p>  Optimistically, I am still probably in the middle of my career at this stage and I believe the interactions between the marine sector and the energy sector are growing year by year.  They are becoming incredibly important.  As we look through the initial briefings on the Port of Cork and we see the number of aspects that are energy-related and that fit into the strategy of the port and its future development, it is very clear that the two sectors are much closer than might be seen at first glance.  That is only going to continue over time.  The projections for investment in the energy sector in Ireland over the coming ten years show that most of the investment by capital is going to come in the offshore sector.  Looking at how people are considering developing energy networks into the future, most of that is offshore.  There is a large aspect of convergence of infrastructure across transport, electricity and so forth.<\/p> <p>  On a personal level, I mentioned previously that it is something I am very proud to do.  It is a position of honour.  Since I was appointed I have been celebrating and upbeat and just generally happy.  It is a privilege to have an opportunity to take a position such as this where one is guiding the leadership of one of the most important facilities in the country, so I am incredibly satisfied on a personal level.  I am very proud to have been appointed.  I know there is a little variety in all that, but two things sum it up.  One is that I value public service in Ireland.  Second, the level of overlap between various types of infrastructure and sustainability is growing over time and for me to have the opportunity to take a leadership position in one of the most important growing areas that is adjacent to the energy sector is incredibly exciting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021111000002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1370,"content":"<p>In your role as chair, what will you bring to the Port of Cork that is different?

I believe that level of expertise and guidance will be valuable for the core role.  One thing I will be very careful about is not to take the eye off the ball.  It is sometimes very easy to get excited by the shiny new thing and forget the basic operation and the basic reason one is there.  With all my experience I have become very conscious not to do that and to make sure that we continue the very strong governance we have at present.<\/p> <p>  More generally, the experience of infrastructure development and funding, particularly in offshore wind, is going to be a helpful bridge between the Port of Cork and the offshore sector and ensure that we understand what is required and put the facilities in place.  I have also been looking at this from a commercial aspect for many years so it is very important to ensure that we do this in a way that makes sense for the Port of Cork and for the local infrastructure.  We want to enable and facilitate it, but we want to do it in a way that is sustainable for the Port of Cork, its various stakeholders and other companies that are active in the marine sector in the port.  It is important that we do this in a way that is organised, thoughtful and that fits well with it.

That is going to be important for everything we do, not just in how we facilitate offshore wind but also in how we use energy, how we look at getting the freight traffic through the port most efficiently and getting it to the consumer with the lowest cost possible in carbon emissions.

The feedback I have received from many business people is that because many renewables depend on wind energy and many other factors that are not as certain, one will have to build at serious scale, certainly for renewable wind energy generation to work.  I make that observation as a layman.  For offshore wind energy and renewables to really take off, the ordinary person must understand all of their features.

One needs to consider the situations, how much of it one can have on at any given time, what the back-up sources of energy are, and how one transports it from where it is generated to where consumers need it.  They are the technical challenges that we look at globally in terms of systems transformation and how to manage the challenges.  We are lucky in Ireland because we have very strong engineering experts in these areas.  They are very prudent yet progressive, which is exactly what one would hope for.  We need to make sure that we take steps in a well-measured way that is clearly understood.  Offshore wind energy is reliable and has huge potential.  At the moment, in many parts of the world offshore wind energy generation has a lower cost than fossil fuel alternatives and there is better energy security.  I do not know whether Members have followed the situation all over Europe but in the last month there were huge issues with gas prices in the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021111000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1377,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021111000002#K00400","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1378,"content":"<p>Energy suppliers went bankrupt.

Politics is the art of the possible.  Connecting, as we are doing today, can only advance that.<\/p> <p>  As the Co-Chairman said, I wish to mention former Deputy Austin Currie, who sadly passed away overnight.  He epitomised much of what the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the other committees represented here today are about.  He straddled both sides of the island and, indeed, the two islands, in the sense that he served as a Member of the D&aacute;il, a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly and a Member of Parliament at Westminster.  He was one of the few individuals who had that experience and contributed across the island and the islands.  He brought that spirit of collegiality and peaceful progress.  He was an advocate for civil rights in the early days and progressed through the political spectrum.  He made a huge contribution across the island and to politics in general.  Sadly, he passed away at his home in County Kildare, which is the constituency I happen to represent.  He will be greatly missed.  Above all, I extend my sympathies to his family.  He is survived by his children and grandchildren.  In particular, I extend my sympathies to his daughter, Senator Emer Currie, who is a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and has made a very strong contribution in her short time here.

I thank them very much for the invitation to be with them today.  We are really glad to be here.  First, on behalf of the committee, as a whole, I share the sadness which has already been expressed at the death of Austin Currie.  I would like to say that right at the very beginning.<br\/><br\/>For those members whom I have not met before, my name is Michael Jay.  I chair the House of Lords Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland Sub-Committee.  I have been pleased, in the context of the House of Lords's scrutiny of the impact of Brexit on Ireland and Northern Ireland, to visit the Oireachtas on a number of occasions, and to have met many members, and it is a pleasure to see them again.<br\/><br\/>The protocol committee includes a wide range of views and expertise both on Northern Ireland and the protocol itself.  Our membership includes senior representatives of political parties in Northern Ireland from both unionist and nationalist perspectives, and draws from wider expertise in Northern Ireland affairs in the House of Lords.  A range of these voices is represented in our delegation today, and my colleagues will introduce themselves the first time they speak.  I should add that Jonathan Caine, Lord Caine, would have been with us today but over the weekend he was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office and, therefore, has left the committee with immediate effect.<br\/><br\/>Many members were present when a delegation of our committee participated in a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in June.  At that stage our committee was in its infancy, having been set up in April.  Much has happened since then and it may be helpful for me to summarise our work over the past five months.<br\/><br\/>On 29 July, the committee published its introductory report.  The chapters of the report set out in turn: the committee&rsquo;s role; the development of the protocol; the economic impact of the protocol, including both the challenges and the potential opportunities it presents; the political and social impact of the protocol; and potential mitigations and solutions.  The report acknowledged the difficulties in seeking to uphold seemingly contradictory principles underlying the protocol, namely, avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland while at the same time maintaining Northern Ireland&rsquo;s place within the UK internal market.  It acknowledged mistakes both by the UK and EU which had led to a mutual breakdown in trust.<br\/><br\/>At around the same time as the report was published, the UK Government published its command paper: Northern Ireland protocol, the next steps.  This was followed by the publication last month of the four Commission non-papers on the operation of the protocol.  Our work during the autumn has primarily focused on scrutinising the issues highlighted in these papers.  In September we heard evidence from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland on the operation of Article 2 on rights of individuals, a vital issue that is often in our view overlooked amidst the political focus on trade issues.  We wrote a detailed letter to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland last month on those issues.  In October, we held an evidence session with representatives of the pharmaceuticals industry on the impact of the protocol on the provision of medicines in Northern Ireland.  This is an issue of universal concern to all citizens, regardless of community or political affiliation.  We will shortly write to Lord Frost summarising our concerns.<br\/><br\/>Meanwhile our key work in scrutinising EU law applying to Northern Ireland under the protocol continues.  We have now written more than 50 letters to UK Government Ministers on the various regulations, directives and delegated Acts brought forward over recent months that will apply to Northern Ireland.  Last week, we held a seminar on perceptions of a democratic deficit under the protocol, whereby EU law applies to Northern Ireland without its consent, and on ways to enhance Northern Ireland&rsquo;s voice and influence in relation to the protocol.  We heard from a wide range of business representatives, academics and parliamentarians from across the political spectrum, sharing perspectives from Westminster, Stormont, Brussels and Dublin, and we were delighted that Oireachtas colleagues were able to join us at that meeting.  That engagement was a demonstration of our firm commitment to continued interparliamentary dialogue with all those with an interest in the protocol and in Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Today&rsquo;s meeting is another welcome opportunity to strengthen engagement between the Oireachtas and Westminster, and between our committees.  I very much hope that we will be able to build on this engagement in the coming months, including, as the public health situation improves, by meeting in person, both in Dublin and in London.  We look forward to answering members' questions about our work, but before we do so, let me finish my opening remarks by quoting the final conclusion from our introductory report: <\/p> <blockquote> \tAddressing the issues of conflicting identity that first Brexit, and then the Protocol, have brought to the fore seems an insoluble problem.  That was also true of the political situation in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.  But through a slow and painstaking process led by political leaders in Northern Ireland and successive governments in London and Dublin, the peace process took root and flourished, leading to the Belfast Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent steps towards a powersharing arrangement.  This process took time, patience, dialogue, and most of all trust.  The same is true in addressing the problems that Brexit and the protocol present for Northern Ireland.  There is therefore an urgent imperative for all sides to make concerted efforts to build trust by recommitting themselves to that process of dialogue, repairing the damage caused to relations across these islands during the past five years, in the interests, as the protocol rightly acknowledges, of communities in both Ireland and Northern Ireland. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021111000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Lord Jay of Ewelme"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1402,"content":"<p>I thank Lord Jay for that presentation.

It is nice to see them again.  I join with the other speakers in conveying my sympathy to the family of Austin Currie.  I was listening to Colm Eastwood on the radio this morning.  He outlined how Austin Currie and the SDLP adopted peaceful protest to bring about change, they adopted dialogue, and that is a lesson that all of us have taken on board, having regard to the peace process.<\/p> <p>  I thank the House of Lords sub-committee for the work it has done.  It undertook painstaking work and consulted widely.  Its report is diplomatic.  It stated the UK approach has had shortcomings in transparency, clarity and readiness while the EU approach has had shortcomings in balance, understanding and flexibility.  That is very diplomatic indeed.<\/p> <p>  As we speak, all the talk in the Irish political system is about the possibility of the UK triggering Article 16.  I would plead with the House of Lords sub-committee to use its influence to ensure that does not happen.  I hope it is a negotiating tactic.  The Taoiseach informed the D&aacute;il last week that such a move would be irresponsible, unwise and reckless and would certainly damage EU-UK relations and British-Irish relations as well.  The consequences of that would lead to some sort of retaliation by the EU whereby the whole Trade and Cooperation Agreement could be under threat and a trade war would result.<\/p><p>That is in nobody's interests.  In 2022 we would be back to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.  That is the worst case scenario.  I ask the Members of the House of Lords sub-committee to please do everything they can to ensure that Article 16 is not triggered on the UK side and to try to ensure that the UK side, in particular, would use the mechanisms and structures in place in the withdrawal agreement to deal with the issues which have arisen and which are well documented.  That is my plea.<\/p><p> I will conclude with a question on the European Court of Justice.  That seems to have come in from the sidelines.  Nobody was expecting that this was an issue for the UK side and, indeed, for the DUP.  In the sub-committee's conversations and discussions, was the European Court of Justice and the role it plays in interpreting and dealing with the Single Market an issue?  Is that an issue now?  From an Irish point of view we do not believe it is an issue, but we believe it is an academic concept.  It has nothing to do with the practicalities that businesses in Northern Ireland are facing.  Vice-President &Scaron;efovi has come forward with constructive proposals, practical solutions, and the mechanisms are there to deal with the problems outlined.  Does the House of Lords sub-committee see the European Court of Justice as an issue?  Lord Jay's conclusion was fantastic.  It was very positive and constructive.

I do not know what he is going to say but it seems to me that his negotiating stance under the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has pointed to triggering Article 16 and a confrontation which is not designed to solve the problem, but to appeal to the Conservative Party's Brexit base, which is a total and radical departure, if it proves to be the case, from the close relationship of trust that was painstakingly built over decades between Dublin and London.  Given the tangled history of the two countries and the two centres, to destroy that trust is very serious indeed.  That trust is already badly damaged.

The House of Lords sub-committee has proven to be a very important, and probably now an increasingly urgent, line of communication and of sanity between the two Parliaments.  I hope we can deepen those lines of communication.  Echoing what Lord Hain just said, I am deeply concerned about the triggering of Article 16 of the protocol, which was meant to be a safeguard clause in the event of something unforeseen happening and that there would be time to fix it.  Obviously the issues have already been addressed over the last number of weeks and months by the &Scaron;efovi team, so the strategy behind triggering it is something that is baffling for us.  If Article 16, as is widely rumoured now, is to be triggered possibly today or, if not, within the next day or two, what is the strategy?  What do our colleagues in the House of Lords believe the next move will be?  Things will move backwards rather than forwards once that happens.  More saliently, what can we do in the event of that happening to seek to stop the backward movement in relationships and the consequences of such a move, and to restore what Lord Hain so property underlined, namely, the basis of 20 years of discussion that brought peace to the island of Ireland and an acceptance of one another's good faith?

It strikes me that the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, constantly talks about wanting to create political stability, but its encouragement to Lord Frost and Boris Johnson will create political instability.  It is interesting that last week we took evidence at our committee from Professor Peter Shirlow of the University of Liverpool and he, along with others, produced a report which showed quite clearly that triggering Article 16 will cause that political and economic instability in the North.  We all know, and Lord Hain referred to this, that according to the Good Friday Agreement, both the British and Irish Governments are co-guarantors and are supposed to act impartially in the execution and implementation of the agreement.  That applies to whichever party is in power in the UK.  It is important that our sub-committee holds Lord Frost to account.  I agree with Lord Hain that our House of Lords protocol sub-committee and all the Oireachtas committees represented here today need to work very closely together to build a bulwark against this.  Not only will this cause political instability in the North, it will cause economic instability on the island of Ireland, which is something that none of us wants to see happening.

I thank Lord Jay.  As others said, this meeting is timely.  At the outset, I want to extend condolences to our committee colleague, Emer Currie, on the passing of her father.  This morning I listened intently to Manufacturing NI when it spoke about the protocol and how the protocol was serving it and serving to mitigate the harshness and negativities of Brexit.  It is baffling to us in that nobody across the island, except for a few unionist voices, is calling for the protocol to be abolished.  We know there is no alternative to the protocol.  Trying to abolish to protocol at this stage is reckless and at odds with widespread public opinion.  We welcome what the EU has done in terms of dealing with some of the problems that were becoming transparent with the protocol in relation to sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, medicines and all of that.  We believe that there were workable solutions and that there is an openness there to find other working solutions.<\/p> <p>  We want the joint committee, the mechanism there to be able to solve these problems, to be reconvened.  As Lord Hain said, we await the announcement that will be made by Lord Frost this morning.  It is absolutely reckless and, if this is not sorted out, we are under no illusion as to the chaos this will cause across the island, between the islands, to the relationship between the islands and in terms of the US and the trade agreements with Britain.  Nobody wants that.  I concur with the words Lord Hain used in calling the move of triggering Article 16 aggressive and bombastic.  It is not designed to find a solution.  At this stage, we just wonder what is wanted and what the end game is.  Are we solution focused?  I am glad everybody at this meeting is solution focused.  It is important we send out a unified voice from here.  I hope Lord Frost will listen to the people across this island and acknowledge the good work that has been done over the years, both with the Good Friday Agreement and with successive agreements.<\/p> <p>  I will leave it at that.

We have heard much evidence about problems, particularly on the pharmaceuticals or medicines front but generally people are working very hard.

I ask the members of the House of Lords subcommittee what they think we can do as parliamentarians to help to rebuild trust on both sides.<\/p> <p>  My second question is slightly removed from the protocol.  At present, the UK Government is reviewing the data regime that operates.  As the House of Lords subcommittee will be aware, the European Commission has granted an adequacy judgment with regard to the data regime in the UK.  Concerns have been expressed to the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union that if the UK interferes in some way with what would be seen as data privacy rights, that data adequacy judgment at EU level will be either suspended or terminated.  That would have a direct impact on all sorts of organisations and businesses.  The Data Protection Commissioner here, for instance, indicated that there could be up to &euro;1 billion more in costs for Irish business if that adequacy judgment is dead.  I am conscious that 19 November is the closing date for submissions on the UK Government's review and I am curious as to whether the House of Lords subcommittee has considered that issue, which, on top of any decisions around the protocol, could have quite serious impacts on business.

I do not think a cost-benefit analysis was ever done on Brexit by those advocating it let alone on the protocol.  It was very revealing that, in direct language, Lord Frost talked about the protocol having been signed under duress.  Boris Johnson in his own way said something rather similar.  He has indicated that when he signed it, he did not really mean it and always intended to abandon it.  That is what we are facing.  This is about political-identity politics rather than trade, and Brexit has always been about that.<\/p> <p>  On what could be done at your end, the European Union Commission statement about mitigation measures and how changes could lighten the impact of the protocol, was very important.  It was, in a sense, an opening negotiating stance.  It is important to keep going down that road.  If there has been a criticism of Brussels and maybe Dublin, although that would not be as fair, it is to constantly communicate in person with businesses and the unionist community, especially, in Northern Ireland, to make it clear that nobody wants a fight over this, that there are solutions to it.  However, if one looks at the strategy and policy of London, it is divergence from the European Union in almost every respect.  That means Northern Ireland will diverge from the rest of the UK, insofar as the Single Market and customs union matters are concerned.  Otherwise, London would have signed up in the first place to a closer degree of alignment which would have permitted much freer trade of the kind that we had prior to Brexit.<\/p> <p>  We are here as a result of a distinct decision taken by Boris Johnson, Lord Frost and the Conservative Government.  It is about divergence from the European Union and that means Northern Ireland, by definition, remaining in the Single Market and customs union.  Unless London attempts to revisit that issue - I do not think it can be revisited - there will be increasing divergence and increasing convergence to the Republic.  That is the British Government's trade policy on Northern Ireland.  That is the context in which we should encourage the most active engagement from Dublin and Brussels with citizens in Northern Ireland.  It should be explained that nobody wants a fight from that direction even if a fight is picked from London and practical measures can be taken to ease some of the undoubted difficulties, obstacles and bureaucratic problems that came with the protocol because it was rushed in at the last minute in order to \"get Brexit done\".  The more constrictive, more open to dialogue and engagement Brussels and Dublin can be, the better, frankly, and I would encourage that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021111000002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Lord Hain"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1441,"content":"<p>We will move to the next couple, Deputy Richmond followed by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021111000002#G00500","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1442,"content":"<p>It is the first time that Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and I have been identified as a couple, a new adventure for both of us.  More important, I welcome our guests again.  It is disappointing that we have to do this remotely, but we are all familiar with each other.  From the outset, I would like to associate with the condolences to the family of Austin Currie, particularly our colleague, Senator Emer Currie.<\/p> <p>  I would like to raise a few issues that can be teased from the points raised by our guests.  The first one, on which a couple of them have given their opinion, is whether they believe invoking Article 16 at this point is justified.  That is one point that is often lost: just because the British Government potentially believes it is justified, does not mean the European Union will agree with it, and there will, no doubt, be legal challenges and arbitrations in that area.  Second, I wish to elaborate on some of the points Lord Jay referred to on whether Article 16 is to be invoked.  The manner and reasons for why it might be invoked will be extremely important.  Given that Lord Frost is due to speak in a couple of hours' time, do we have any indication as to the areas that have already been identified that this is the problem?  It has been mentioned that the European Commission presented a very generous and comprehensive set of proposals.  Hopefully, Lord Thomas will be able to intervene in relation to the issues raised on the European Court of Justice, ECJ.  From a practical point of view, as alluded to by other colleagues, this is something that is not coming up in discussions on the ground.  A lot of us have individual and collective engagements with the business, civic and, indeed, political communities across this island.  The ECJ never comes up.  I believe it is a non-issue.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Lord Hain's point on North-South engagement.  My question is not for him to answer.  Perhaps, if Lord Caine was still on the committee he would have been the person to answer.  What, if any, engagement is the British Government having on the ground formally with the business community and the trade associations in Northern Ireland?  In his opening remarks, Lord Jay referred to the democratic deficit in the European context.  That is acknowledged and members from all three Oireachtas committees have identified potential solutions.  From a British point of view, throughout the Brexit negotiations, there was many issues raised by the devolved administrations and the lack of engagement they were receiving from Whitehall.  To what extend is there such a democratic deficit from the representatives of the Assembly or, indeed, the Executive Committee of the Assembly with Whitehall?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021111000002#G00600","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1443,"content":"<p>I hand over to Lord Jay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021111000002#G00700","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1444,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Richmond.

There is only one at present and that deals with the civil service.  It seems the machinery is there for creating a new court within the overarching Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, structure which could be manned by three or four judges from the EU on the one hand and three or four judges from the UK on the other.  There would be an independent president presiding at the top who would, of course, hold the balance.  That would have a number of consequences.<\/p><p>The objection of the UK Government is that the CJEU can determine causes that may arise between the UK and the EU under the protocol, and it is, of course, the judge and function of one side.  What the British Government has said about that is that it is not going to have an arbiter that is within the scope of one side of the problem but not of the other.  My idea of a separate chamber in the CJEU would give that overarching feeling so that the decision of that arbitration body or specialised court would be, essentially, one of the CJEU, while - according to my plan - also having equal representation for judges from both sides.  A new structure would be needed and that would require much negotiation.  What is the alternative?  It would be the setting up of an <i>ad hoc<\/i>arbitration panel to resolve disputes, a panel sitting somewhere it can find that is suitable, be that in London, Brussels or wherever.  That panel would be of a similar structure to the proposal I am suggesting, namely, equal representation from both sides and with a neutral chairman or president.  That would be something completely outside the structures of the UK courts and of the CJEU.  It seems that what is needed is the will to take something like that idea forward and to make it happen.

I also add my voice to those expressing condolences to the family of Austin Currie, and particularly to Senator Emer Currie.  Austin Currie made a long contribution to political life.  I would not always have agreed with him, but that is for another day.  In fairness, though, when we consider his involvement in the Caledon housing protest, that showed up housing inequality and the sectarian nature of the Northern State.  We should recognise all of that.<\/p> <p>  To a degree, we are repeating ourselves.  In fairness, I could not necessarily disagree with what Deputy Richmond said.  We are all assuming that at 11.45 a.m. we may get this indication from David Frost of the triggering Article 16.  We all know that the article is sometimes sold as more than it is, but it is an integral part of the protocol.  The protocol itself was necessary to mitigate Brexit.  It would also be hard to disagree as well with Peter Hain in the sense that none of this was costed or about logical and sensible moves.  To a degree, then, we are where we are and we should always look for solutions.  That is fine.  I refer also to the European Commission and Commissioner Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi's direct engagements with businesses in the North.  In that regard, I welcome having been able to speak in last week's meeting on the democratic deficit.  As Margaret Ritchie has pointed out, Professor Peter Shirlow said that business interests even across unionism are just interested in getting on with the job and significant moves have been taken to mitigate some of the difficulties in respect of the protocol.<\/p> <p>  The major problem we have now is not just the issue of the ECJ being thrown in, but that Lord Frost has also said that the former Prime Minister, Theresa May, should never have agreed to a backstop in 2017 and that the EU Withdrawal (No.2) Act, also known as the Benn Act, hamstrung the British Government.  In other words, he is stating that the British Government signed up to something it had no intention of adhering to.  We are all second-guessing now what the actual strategy of the British Government is.  I am not sure that anyone could give me an answer regarding the strategy of David Frost or Boris Johnson.  I half hope that Dominic Cummins is correct and that Boris Johnson changes his mind ten times a day.  He has shown that tendency at times.<\/p> <p>  We are in a serious situation.  To an extent, the British Government  is playing the orange card.  An element of political unionism has always had difficulties in this regard and they see many things as the rocky road to unity.  Sometimes that concerned cross-Border initiatives on just simple things like roads and other necessities.  I am just putting that observation out there.  We are not in the 1980s now, and we do not have that element of unionism which has a difficulty with the political trajectory.  As I said, businesses are interested in business being done and in finding solutions.  We must work together, and I am all into positive solutions.  We are working with a British Government, however, that is basically promising to do something which will prove that it is not possible to trust it.<\/p> <p>  From a republican perspective, we would say that the British Government sometimes agrees with every intention of rowing back on the agreement.  Even if it intends to get us to point B, it will take us there via the most circuitous route possible.  Everything I have seen to date has shown this.  It is therefore incredibly difficult to see what the solution in this context is.  Let us be absolutely clear, though.  David Frost has also thrown back out old arguments about there being no reason to worry about the Border on the island of Ireland and that, at the end of the day, technological solutions were possible.  That has proven not to be the case, and, as far as I and the majority of people on this island are concerned, that is a no-go area and we cannot revisit it.  We will see.  I would be delighted if someone could give me an answer regarding what is the strategy of Boris Johnson and David Frost and what their endgame is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021111000002#H00400","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1450,"content":"<p>Now that the Deputy's time is up, I am faced with the dilemma of deciding whether to let someone in to answer or to move on.

To respond to the question from Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, I would be the last person to understand or appreciate the strategy of the British Government.  I imagine, though, that it is making a political calculation that is all to do with trade policy between the UK, the EU and further afield in regard to making trade deals.  The island of Ireland comes further down their Richter scale, so to speak.  That is deeply unfortunate, because, from a personal perspective, I believe, and the committee has taken umpteen pieces of evidence about this aspect, that the actions of the British Government will cause untold damage on the island of Ireland.  That will especially be the case after we were all able to collectively negotiate the Good Friday Agreement that brought about peace, prosperity and a sound economic base.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the ECJ is undoubtedly another red herring.  Lord Thomas, in fact, has given evidence of alternative ways of dealing with this aspect.  While I was on the way to the airport on Monday, I think I heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, saying quite clearly on \"Morning Ireland\" that there has been little or no engagement between the British Government and the EU, and that the British Government has not responded to those proposals in the four non-papers that dealt with the mitigation measures.<\/p> <p>  Having talked to people in the North, I would have to say that the business community is quite pragmatic about the protocol.  They have said that, in fact, and it can be heard if one listens to Seamus Leheny of Logistics UK or Aodh&aacute;n Connolly of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, NIRC, both of whom gave evidence to us last week, or any others.  They are very pragmatic.<\/p><p>They want to get on and do business and they want everything to work out successfully because the majority of people in the North did not want Brexit.<\/p><p> However, it is interesting to note that the protocol offers real benefits to the North.  There has been full and free access to both the Single Market for goods and to the rest of the UK internal market.  If anything, the British Government should be trying to work with the EU to utilise those benefits for all of us to try to mitigate the many problems that may have arisen and try to create all the possible trade opportunities.  That relates also to a question asked by Senator Joe O'Reilly as well.  There are benefits there.  They are quite well-documented.  I can think of one relating to Dale Farm.  It won a contract to supply whey concentrate to Arla Foods, a major European dairy company.  This has been attributed, at least in part, to the protocol.  Dale Farm said it would have been a challenge without the protocol.  Thus the evidence is there within the business community, which is particularly pragmatic and just wants to get on with it.<\/p><p> As to any threats from Lord Frost, I would think he will not say he is triggering Article 16 today.  I do not want to be a commentator on what he might say but that, apparently, is the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021111000002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1454,"content":"<p>I think Baroness Ritchie is wise to hold fire on what Lord Frost will say until we have heard what he says in an hour or so's time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021111000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Lord Jay of Ewelme"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1455,"content":"<p>I thank Lord Jay.

That is not right and we must get beyond a stage where we are in suspense over the whims of a British Government.  It is infuriating to see history repeating time and time again.  My question to the members of the House of Lords sub-committee, who are very well-respected, is how can they work for citizens on this island.  There are international agreements which have been agreed to by this island, the EU and indeed by the members of the House of Lords' own government.  We must have those agreements upheld.

If the negotiations for the Good Friday Agreement had been in the era of Boris Johnson and Lord Frost, I fear we would still be sitting round the table negotiating and renegotiating.  That is how I feel this protocol is taking shape.  The efforts to negotiate and renegotiate are demonstrating serious incompetence on the side of the UK Government.  I think it was Baroness Ritchie who made reference to the fact we are somewhat a pawn in UK efforts to get trade deals across the world.  The protocol is being used as that pawn in efforts to get better deals.  However, because the element of trust is being eroded, specifically by the UK Government on deals that have previously been negotiated between itself and the EU and which are now being renegotiated, it is now undermining its own trustworthiness in the eyes of all the other countries we have yet to negotiate trade deals with.  I would like to get the views of members of the House of Lords sub-committee on that.  Is it something they concur with?  The art of negotiation is compromise but trust is an awfully big part of it.  The UK Government needs to take that element of it seriously as well as the fact that the Irish economy has prospered since Brexit and that the North-South relationship has prospered from a trade perspective.<\/p><p>Until we get back to that element of trust, we are not going very far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021111000002#J00900","speaker":"1633","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1463,"content":"<p>I agree very much with what has been said about trust.

They negotiated it but they did not understand it, and it leaves so many strands.  Although we may not agree with the unionists, they have a point when they say that the protocol leaves a democratic deficit whereby laws are being made that affect the people of Northern Ireland and they have no voice at all in the formulation of those laws.  I have been thinking about that since our discussions at our seminar last week.  At some point during this meeting, I would like to pose a possible solution to that, which was never thought of in the context of the protocol, whereby there should be a form of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Northern Ireland Assembly of European Union directives in Northern Ireland.  One of the contributors took this point last week and suggested that we have something along the lines of a consent motion that has to go to the Northern Ireland Assembly committee.  I looked up the way in which Northern Ireland deals with consent motions in respect of UK legislation and I wondered how it could be adapted.  It seems that if there were a committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly that considered directives before they were made and gave advice to the assembly as to whether to consent to it, one would thereby have brought in a democratic element to the passing of legislation that will affect people in Northern Ireland people.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, not only does this Government not understand the protocol, there are measures within the protocol to resolve disputes that they stubbornly refuse to follow.  There is arbitration with the European Union but nobody has followed it and nobody has tried it.

I certainly agree with the remarks of Lord Thomas.  Coming back to my earlier point on building trust, this issue has come right through all of our discussions.  When the UK was in the EU one of the advantages was that it allowed for opportunities for meetings between Ireland and the UK on fringes of other meetings.  We must look at more ways of doing that.  Lord Jay said that it is important for us, as parliamentarians.  We also need to look at ways we can support that among civic society to a far greater extent.  With building trust into the future, I am particularly keen on opportunities among young people and particularly young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not necessarily understand the protocol but who are being led to believe that this in some way is impacting on their identity.  At some stage, I would like us to explore more ways for east-west and North-South co-operation and exchange, especially among young people.<\/p> <p>   We also need to look at the areas of education and research.  In my view, it is an enormous pity that the UK chose to withdraw from the Erasmus programme.  I am conscious that the Turing scheme will be up and running.  We need to look at ways by means of which we can encourage, to start with, at least as much east-west exchange under the Turing scheme and other programmes, and equally that we encourage greater research co-operation, which is always been in place between the universities on these islands.  I am concerned that if the breakdown of trust at a political level continues to manifest itself in wider society, we are going to be back to much more difficult times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021111000002#K00600","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636502400,"counter":1468,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

It is very hard to get responses from the Northern Ireland Assembly because of the processes under which it operates.  There is not a single voice that comes out of it, nor would one expect that, but a lot of the time we do not get a voice when we look for evidence from the political parties.  I was wondering about a meeting of this type, with members of the Northern Ireland Assembly present so that the two Governments are represented, and the area where the democratic deficit exists also represented. That would be helpful because it would provide a public platform on which things could be said in a sense of co-operation and constructive dialogue.<\/p> <p>  Our committee has a very important role to play in providing accurate information to address some of the misinformation that surrounds the existence of the protocol and the working of the protocol.  We did that in the first report, but I believe it is an ongoing necessity because once there is understanding and one has facts that can be demonstrated to be reliable, then one can begin to grow trust with people again.  With regard to the community that is disenfranchised - for example, there have been buses burned in the past weeks with the suggestion that this relates to the protocol - there is a huge job to do there around engaging and enabling a dialogue that is constructive rather than bringing young people onto the streets.  It is profoundly important that the language used in Northern Ireland particularly, and in Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, is not a language that inflames the kind of behaviour we have seen.  In reality, when these things happen they get out of control and terrible tragedies can result.

Many of the issues have been covered.  RT&Eacute; broadcast some interesting reports by its northern editor, Vincent Kearney, this morning.  He spoke to Manufacturing NI, which represents most of the manufacturing businesses in Northern Ireland.  Crucially, the voice of business was not as strong as it could have been in the run-up to the Brexit referendum and, potentially, in the negotiations that followed.  Manufacturing NI's chief executive, Stephen Kelly, had strong words to say on behalf of its members.  He stated that they want the protocol to work, recognise there are opportunities in the protocol, want to get on with business and need the mitigations and simplifications we are all aiming to achieve.  He described the protocol as the best of both worlds and said that having unfettered access for sales from Northern Ireland into Great Britain and access to the EU market makes it critical for businesses in the North to grasp the opportunity they have.  Is the voice of the business community being heard?  At the end of the day, there appears to be a significant opportunity for Northern Ireland and that view is not being adequately represented.<\/p> <p>  Lord Thomas spoke about the arbitration process and he is right that it has not been properly utilised.  The panel has been established and is there to be used.  It provides for a process that can take up to 12 months to adjudicate on issues regarding the withdrawal agreement and the protocol but that has not kicked into action yet.  The worst case scenario is that it all falls apart and we end up in a full-blown trade war, which nobody wants.  I expect and hope the UK Government does not want that either.

I note that a few days ago the T&aacute;naiste indicated in a radio interview on \"Morning Ireland\" that there could be unintended consequences if there was a triggering of Article 16 and that there would be a response from the EU.

We have to get away from that.<\/p> <p>  We know that Stephen Kelly from Manufacturing NI said last week that businesses, particularly Manufacturing NI, were pragmatic about the protocol.

With regard to Lord Jay's question, I had to leave the meeting for ten minutes to do a local radio interview on South East Radio, which Senator Byrne will know is extremely important, representing the constituency of Wexford.  I was on the programme to explain what Article 16 was to the good citizens of my constituency and there is a real interest in these matters.  A point of concern was the impact of the withdrawal agreement and Brexit on trade patterns between these islands.<\/p> <p>  The most important one, from a Wexford perspective, was the continued use of the land bridge.  The vast bulk of Irish goods going to continental markets have traditionally transited the United Kingdom.  It is the simplest way.  Short ferry journeys go from my own constituency to Wales.  My home in Wexford is closer to Wales than it is to Dublin.  Wexford has been affected.  Direct sailings from Rosslare to continental ports have more than quadrupled since Brexit.  There are a number of new companies, DFDS being one of them, with four ships now going from Rosslare to new ports that had not been served directly from the island of Ireland pre-Brexit.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant diversion to traffic from the land bridge, because of the uncertainty and difficulties that arose, to direct continental routes.  We looked at whether that could be a temporary or a long-term matter.  It seems to be very much a long-term settled issue now, because larger ships are being deployed on those routes and dedicated berths have been secured on a long-term basis in places such as Dunkirk, to bring us closer to French, German and Belgian markets, so there has been an impact.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the concern there would be displacement of goods purchased in Great Britain in Northern Ireland for goods purchased in the Republic, that has happened to some degree.  An all-island market has developed, because of the ease of transport throughout the island of Ireland.  Part of that is also a consequence of our growing awareness - COP26 is on - of acquiring goods as close to markets as possible.<\/p> <p>  There are evolutions, but the principal point, made by Lord Thomas and Baroness O'Loan, is there is an incredible opportunity for Northern Ireland, with access to both markets, to serve both markets.  That has not been grasped by the political representatives in Northern Ireland, but certainly has been by the business interests, who repeatedly tell us so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021111000002#M00600","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1486,"content":"<p>I will have to leave shortly, as I am in the Chamber for 11.30 a.m.  However, Lord Frost is correct.

It said there has been a 90% increase in imports from Northern Ireland into Ireland, which is a significant change in trading patterns.  Is it a bad thing?

As others have said, Austin was part of that great founding generation of the SDLP who, among other things, created the framework we have for ending what was the centuries-old conflict within these islands.  They also created the strands and the framework through which we can manage and improve those relationships both within Northern Ireland, between the North and South, and between Britain and Ireland in allowing them to operate as equals and friends.  This is such an important part of what we are doing in general and what we are doing today.  That is why it is concerning there is a minority of what I would call the Brexit community who are trying to make that agreement the fall guy of Brexit and who are trying to undermine this agreement to throw the baby out with the bathwater because it is something they have never embraced.  Like the European Union, it has a more modern understanding of interdependence and sovereignty which does not fit with the Brexit world view.<\/p> <p>  As my colleague Baroness Ritchie has said, one of the rule of law departures we have seen in recent years is that agreement commits the Government to rigorous impartiality, and unfortunately I do not think that any fair observer could suggest that is how this process has been conducted.<\/p> <p>  I wish to reiterate briefly that from the SDLP&rsquo;s perspective, the concerns and the upset of unionism about the protocol are understandable.  We argued for many years that borders have a significant symbolic value, which is why we advocated relentlessly for solutions that would not create barriers in any direction.  It is a matter of regret the UK Government did not pursue any of those forms of Brexit.  We would say, particularly because, unfortunately, political representatives have abstained from this committee, that it is also unfortunate the sectarianising of that decision and its projection onto the EU, the Irish Government and nationalism is not where the fault essentially lies.  We understand that feeling of dislocation but it is important to reiterate that decision was made by the UK Government and it was not about picking a winner or loser and deciding on which of them should triumph but rather it is about the realities of the movement of goods and trades.<\/p> <p>  I will finish with a question.  There have been many astute observers of politics from all political traditions in this island and none of us are really able to discern a rational or reasonable strategy from the UK Government.  People have articulated well the desire of the business community to try to make the best of the situation.  I ask the Lords what forms of accountability or restraint they think can be applied to the UK Government over the course it is currently on.

Wales is losing out in particular.<\/p> <p>  I will leave it at that but I suggest, and I am sure Deputy Howlin and I could do the following, that in respect of the meeting of these assemblies we talk about, perhaps including our colleagues from Stormont, it might happen in Rosslare, which could be a good central point.

To follow up on what has been said earlier by Senator Byrne, Deputy Howlin and others, some of the difficulties and some of the changes in trade scenarios have arisen out of necessity and business has made the calls that it was always going to make.  There has been a lack of clarity which has continued on with the madness we are dealing with now, and there is an element in which we are in a limbo period as we wait on what David Frost actually says at 11.45 p.m.<\/p> <p>  It is fair to say when one looks at the entire Northern state when we are talking about trade, it is a tiny entity.  It has been shown that it is a failed economic entity.  I offer the argument, and the Brexiteers and others have added to this argument, that along with changed demographics, which is the logic of Irish unity, if we have a continuity of actions and threats like this from the British Government, more people, particularly on the island of Ireland, will find themselves in the united Ireland bracket who were not necessarily there before.  We are at that point now of reaching sufficient amount of momentum.  The conversation is well started, there is a requirement for planning, and that is the point we are going to reach.  That is the only way that we can deal with this absolute madness we are facing.  Everybody has commented that nobody knows exactly what Boris Johnson and David Frost&rsquo;s strategy is other than playing high-stakes poker and using Ireland and the North as pawns in that.<\/p> <p>  On trade, everything will change on the basis of necessity.  It is vital we continue these conversations, and whatever happens, we need calm heads.  If you are part of the European Commission at this time, it is very difficult to deal with someone who has shown no signs of trustworthiness in negotiations.  Other than that fact, you have to deal with the players that are in there.<\/p><p>We are in a very serious situation, and it can only lead to one place.  Obviously, we ask for calm heads.  As I said, there is that little bit of hope that Boris Johnson will have a change of mind, which he seems to have from time to time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021111000002#N00800","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1636502400,"counter":1498,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I know Lord Thomas put a lot of thought and time into what he believes can be solutions.  Ultimately, however, there are very solid EU proposals there at the moment, and we hope the UK will take them on board and avoid a situation which we, as politicians, and particularly our constituents do not want to face.  <\/p> <p>  I would like to thank Deputy Lawless, Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and Senator Lisa Chambers for trying to do a trilateral chairmanship.  Senator Chambers proposed widening this out further to include local Northern representatives, and Baroness Ritchie agreed with her.  I also think that would be a very good idea, so we will try to pursue that.<\/p> <p>  I thank Lord Jay and his team for their time.  This is a serious matter but politics is about the art of finding solutions.  We face many obstacles and challenges in the days ahead but we all know what we have gained through politics, seeing the likes of Senator Blaney and Lord Hain here today, both of whom I believe co-chaired the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, as it was 20 years ago.
