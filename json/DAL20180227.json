The role of the strategic communications unit, SCU, which the Taoiseach established and whose head he selected, must come under the closest of scrutiny and most comprehensive of reviews.  The SCU-directed campaign has, either advertently or inadvertently, politicised elements of the Civil Service, whether we like it or care to admit it.  The campaign represents an abuse of taxpayers' money.  Government advertisements or funding of the media should be at arm's length and should not be used for party political or electoral objectives.  The Civil Service code in this regard has been breached as a result of this campaign.<\/p><p>If one reads the <i>Longford Leader<\/i>, <i>Limerick Leader <\/i>or <i>Roscommon Herald<\/i>, for example, one will see advertisements masquerading as news articles, with Fine Gael Party candidates prominent in them.  Some are not members of the Government or even Members of the Oireachtas but election candidates.  A double page spread in the <i>Sunday World<\/i>features Senator Gabrielle McFadden and places emphasis on Athlone.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, features but not to the same degree as Senator McFadden.  Again, this is a clear electoral pitch by any yardstick.  It is meant to be an advertisement informing members of the public about the national planning framework or national development plan.  In essence, however, it is the use of taxpayers' money to advance and promote Fine Gael election candidates.  One sees the same trend in other constituencies in terms of trying to identify key marginal constituencies and promoting issues that affect them. <\/p><p>We have an independent media, thanks be to God, which is essential to the health of our democracy.  Speaking truth to power is an essential prerequisite of this.  The media need revenue and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party does not have any difficulty with advertisements that are clearly identified as such.  Media content partnerships between government and the media should be fully transparent.  In that context, one local editor told <i>The Times,<\/i>Ireland edition:<\/p><blockquote>This is fake news.  Newspapers are struggling and the government know that, so they've got us by the...&quot;<\/blockquote><p>Parliamentary decency prevents me from finishing the sentence.  Regional newspapers were instructed to make Government advertorials look like independent stories and, in some cases, part of the normal news cycle.<\/p><p>I have some basic questions.  Last week the Taoiseach was asked the estimated cost of this campaign.  Will he outline to the House what it has cost and the overall estimated cost?  Does he accept that there has been a blurring of lines in how all of this has transpired, that it has involved politicisation of the staff of the strategic communications unit and that, essentially, the entire promotion has been about Fine Gael's electoral advancement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519740300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The strategic communications unit operates at arm's length from me and the rest of the Government.

From the records I have, the most expensive one was run by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party coalition, the \"Change\" campaign which dealt with the Government's climate change agenda.  It cost &euro;15 million.  The public relations campaign for Transport 21, again when the Deputy was a member of the Government, cost &euro;3 million.

Tomorrow and the next day, we will see the text that will give effect to the agreement struck between the European Union and the British Government last December.  The Taoiseach will recall at the time of its publication we acknowledged some political progress had been made.  However, we raised a series of contradictions inherent in that agreement at the time and I want to place them again on the record of the House.<\/p>  <p>  The first contradiction was the claim there would be no hard border on the island of Ireland but yet the North would be taken out of the customs union and the Single Market.  The second contradiction was the assertion there would be no threat to the Good Friday Agreement against the fact there are 142 areas of all-Ireland co-operation that could be adversely affected by Brexit.  Contradiction number three was the claim there would be no erosion in the rights of citizens living in the North as against the fact the British are determined to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.<\/p><p>The fourth is that although the North voted to remain in the European Union that decision has been set aside by the British Government, the DUP and others.<\/p> <p> In the conversion of December's political agreement into a legally binding withdrawal text it is critical that these contradictions are resolved.  That is the only way to achieve clarity and certainty for our people, the all-Ireland economy and for our agreements.  That means the text must explicitly state that there will be no Brexit border on the island, and the only way to guarantee this is by the North remaining inside the customs union and the Single Market.  The text must explicitly protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and it must make clear in substance that there will be no loss of rights for citizens.  The T&aacute;naiste met with Mr. Michel Barnier in Brussels yesterday and he has seen the draft legal text.  He is quoted widely today as saying that he is more than satisfied that the Irish Government and the EU are of one mind on the draft text.<\/p> <p> Have those four contradictions been resolved?  The Taoiseach said previously that this country cannot take a leap into the dark when dealing with matters connected with Brexit, and I agree with him.  Can the Taoiseach confirm, therefore, that the text we will see resolves all the issues I have set out and, in real terms, represents the legal protection and guarantees we need?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700005#C04400","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519741500,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I am satisfied it does.

Obviously, I am not at liberty to give detail of it here today, but it will be available for people to see at 12 noon tomorrow.  The T&aacute;naiste met with Mr. Michel Barnier yesterday to indicate our satisfaction with the text and I spoke by telephone to the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, last night.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware of the background to all of this.  The United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.  Almost immediately afterwards we sought an assurance from the United Kingdom that there would be no hard border and that everything possible would be done to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  We got that verbal assurance last year.  We then sought to have that written down in black and white and made into a political agreement.  We got that political agreement last December.  Since then we have sought to turn the black and white text of the political agreement and commitment into a legal text which forms a protocol to the withdrawal agreement.  The Deputy will see that legal text tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that it sets down in law how we can avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  As I said last December, there are three options for how to do that.  The first is in the context of a new close relationship between the UK and the EU.  That is our absolute preference.  We do not want a border between the North and the South any more than we want a border in the Irish Sea between east and west.  The second option, or option B, is the British bespoke solutions which they have yet to outline, but we look forward to seeing them when they have completed them.  The third option, option C, is the fall-back option, or last resort as the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, prefers to describe it.  That is outlined in legal form in the withdrawal agreement being published tomorrow in Brussels.  However, that withdrawal agreement is a draft text and we cannot automatically assume it will be acceptable to the United Kingdom or to all the parties in Northern Ireland.  We could have an interesting few weeks ahead of us, as was the case last December.

I believe the Taoiseach has not signed it yet but I hope he will.  It asks every Teachta D&aacute;la and Senator to recognise the absolute injustice being done by a company, which is solvent and very well off with a &euro;240 million surplus in its defined benefit scheme, where it has withdrawn from talks and reduced its defined benefit scheme to the mercy of the casino stock markets while pushing its 1,000 workers into a defined contribution scheme.<\/p>  <p>  We saw recently the turmoil in the stock market.  This morning we were arguing about the plans the Government has made to ensure we all have a good future.  When workers are left to the mercy of the gambling casino of the stock market, it means they have no guarantee of a good future.  Indeed, they could be paying all their working lives into a pension scheme to find at the end of it, because of the behaviour of those who gamble, they will have no pension at all.  We do not want to drive any more people into poverty or workers into worse conditions.<\/p>  <p>  What does the Taoiseach think of companies like Irish Life, which out of the pure greed of making more profits, will withdraw, without any discussion, from such a scheme, leaving 1,000 workers at the mercy of the market?  It is significant in the case of Irish Life because it administers most of the other pension schemes which exist in this country.  There are over 100,000 workers on defined benefit schemes who will also feel extremely vulnerable if Irish Life gets away with this.  When these workers vote to take strike action and stand up for themselves, I hope the Taoiseach and his Cabinet will support their petition.  This goes to the heart of who is standing up for decent planning, justice and equality.  If we throw these workers to the mercy of the market, more will follow.  Will the Taoiseach condemn Irish Life for unilaterally withdrawing from a defined benefit scheme and forcing these workers to take action against the company?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700007#E00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1519741800,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I am afraid I do not have the details of the particular defined benefit pension scheme to which the Deputy referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700007#E00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1519741800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach was sent the petition on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700007#E00500","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1519741800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>The Deputy knows how pensions operate and pensions law.  It is the trustees of the pension fund who make the decisions about the pension fund, not the employer or the members, subject to the rules laid down by the Pensions Authority.  A covenant or deed of trust will set out the obligations and rights of the employer and others.  Everything falls under trust law in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Trustees have a responsibility to pensioners and future pensioners to ensure whatever pension fund exists is solvent.  We could not have a situation whereby people would continue to pay into a pension fund, some people would get a full pension, but then, at a certain point when the money ran out, those retiring thereafter, having paid too, would get nothing.<\/p><p>That is not a situation that is right or fair.<\/p> <p> I agree with the Deputy that employers should not withdraw unilaterally from any discussion on amendments to a pension fund in resolving a pension fund issue.  We have mechanisms, including the Workplace Relations Commission, through which disputes such as this can be adjudicated on.  It may be an option in this case for it to be referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and have it resolved there without a strike.  If that is an option, I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that there should not be a strike until the matter has been considered by the Workplace Relations Commission.  If employers are going to make changes, they should give adequate notice of any change to the members.  The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, is working on laws to strengthen the protections for members of defined benefit schemes.  Work on it is advanced, although it does run into genuine difficulties.  One of the proposals made is to make employers liable for any deficit that may arise in a pension scheme.  The difficulty in doing so, of course, is that it might result in putting a company out of business which would cause unemployment.  Workers might receive their pensions, but they would lose their jobs long before they received their pensions.  As well as that, it could hobble other companies and put them at a disadvantage in dealing with their competitors.

Workers have paid &euro;20 million into the Pensions Authority for it to protect their rights and future pensions.  However, this means that they are not being protected.  When will the legislation be brought before the House in order that we can amend it to make it more robust?

That could result in the loss of jobs if it were to make a company insolvent or impose big losses on it.  In other cases, it could hobble companies.  For example, a company that has big investment plans - the Deputy referred to such plans - might find that it could no longer have those plans if its balance sheet was changed fundamentally from being one that enabled it to borrow to invest to one that did not enable it to do so because a pension liability had been included in it.

We entered the D&aacute;il knowing that the health service was in disarray, under pressure and bursting at the seams.  That is what led to the setting up of the cross-party committee that produced the Sl&aacute;intecare report last May.  However, there was no action following the report and no sense of urgency until, when under pressure on 12 January, eight months after the report had been produced, an announcement was made on a recruitment process.  Simultaneously, we were told about the results of the capacity review which told us what we all knew, that there was an urgent need for more beds.  Like me, none of my colleagues expected solutions overnight, given the long background of health service underfunding, but we certainly expected to see a sense of urgency.<\/p><p> I am asking the Taoiseach to come with me on a journey to Galway city in the next two minutes.  We had 46 people waiting on trolleys today and 52 yesterday, which was the second highest in the country.  Every second day we have the highest number in the country.  We know from Dr. Hickey and other very experienced clinicians that this leads to 350 to 400 deaths per year.  In Galway the hospital is at crisis point.  Lack of capacity is number one on the risk register.  There was a leak in its sister hospital in Merlin Park on 4 September 2017, which has been raised by me and other Deputies in the Chamber.  We were told repairs would take a few weeks.  On 13 September, there was a further leak and we were told engineers and architects had been appointed.  We were told it would only be a matter of weeks.  During that time, the hospital was told to look at alternative arrangements, including capacity, if any, in the hospital, which was already bursting at the seams, capacity in the private hospitals, or any other way it could source alternative care.<\/p> <p> It is now six months later and the two theatres remain closed.  They have been repaired.  However, a clinical review has told us they are no longer suitable.  The design is not compatible with modern standards.  Modular theatres are promised for next October, 13 months after the water first poured into the two theatres in Galway.  On average, 60 patients were scheduled and 160 have been seen in the hospital.  No other alternative arrangements have been made.  Just under 1,500 patients are waiting for knee and hip replacements and surgeries.  We have been told one solution and it has not happened.  We have been given various scenarios that have not happened.  We have had linguistic gymnastics while people awaiting hip and knee surgeries have no idea about gymnastics.

On the Order of Business, I put it to the Taoiseach that the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has called on all older people to stock up on fuel and leave the heating on 24 hours a day during the cold spell we expect in the next few days.  That is pragmatic advice.  During the flooding the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was asked to look at exceptional payments to help with issues arising from flood damage.  This is of a different scale and different type, but a number of people may be vulnerable, particularly older people and other people who may be on assistance payments and who may not be in a position to have heating on 24 hours a day.  I ask that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, through the local community welfare officers, would take a flexible approach to assisting people to fulfil the Minister of State's laudable objective in having full 24 hour cover.  Also, as was said earlier, all local authority schemes need to ensure that the heating systems are changed to ensure it is on for the full 24 hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700012#K00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1519743900,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I accept the Deputy's criticisms.

We are going to come back to crises where people will deprive themselves of essential heat unless a very clear instruction is given today to provide a payment for an additional week - that is all - for everybody in receipt of the free fuel allowance in order that there can be no doubt or ambiguity about his or her ability to afford to stay warm during this unprecedented crisis.  I ask the Taoiseach not to talk about the exceptional needs payment with which we have all dealt for years.  It is cumbersome and difficult.  Please do not talk about a discretionary payment because it depends on the community welfare officer with whom one is dealing.  We have all dealt with various community welfare officers.

One common thread to emerge from these conversations has been a fear that the excessively narrow focus on applied research for the purposes of State supports has been at the expense of basic research.  As anyone familiar with the wider research ecosystem will understand, discovery initiatives are frontier or first principles types of research that are applied across the spectrum and feed into applied research, the output driven and more commercial activities that come to market and are closer to product development and commercial applications.  While there is no doubt that both types of research are important, the wider research ecosystem must support activities across the spectrum if we are to retain our best researchers, punch above our weight in the international system and reward universities and innovations.<\/p><p>The concern from the sector is that the direction has been overly restrictive to the point that applied or commercial research is the only type of research now being supported by the State.  This has led to the loss or flight of human capital as some of our best researchers and academics leave the State and go elsewhere.  It also poses a threat to our commercial success because without upstream research, we cannot have downstream research.  It would be the equivalent of someone telling Newton in the orchard, when he was looking at the apple falling from the tree and thereby discovering gravity, that he would be better off studying the cider fermentation aspects of the apple trees rather than bothering with the idea the apple might fall and something might come of that.<\/p><p>The issue is not only one of funding.  Everywhere that any politician enters, there will be demands for funding.  It is important that current funding is rebalanced across the research spectrum to support the research pipeline. <\/p><p>Science Foundation Ireland is a fantastic organisation, which was established by my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, in the early 2000s when he was in government.  The agency has made a significant contribution to transforming the research landscape in Ireland, placing us on the global stage and making us a near world leader in this area.  However, during the recession, the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government took the unfortunate decision to rebalance Science Foundation Ireland.  In 2013, the then Minister with responsibility for science produced a new remit for the agency which was to manage applied and commercial research.  While this was justifiable at a time of recession, it is much more difficult to justify this approach today.  Even without a change in funding, a rebalancing of the funding landscape will be required.<\/p><p>The Bill examines the State agency, Science Foundation Ireland, and seeks to reorientate its focus across the research spectrum, including all the discovery and high end academic research that flows into applied research.  It aims to reconfigure the board of the agency, which in recent years has come to be populated almost exclusively by industrialists.  There has been a degree of mission drift as Science Foundation Ireland shifted from having a university and academic focus, with one hand in the academic world and another in industry, to one in which its focus has become almost entirely industrial.  The Bill proposes to have a quota of academics on the board to balance a quota of industrialists.<\/p><p>The Bill also calls, most importantly, for a review of the wider research system, including the role of the Irish Research Council, which is still in place but is not on a statutory footing, the programme for research in third level institutions, a critical fund for research activities, and Science Foundation Ireland and its activities.  It calls for a review at this point as the agency has been in place for 15 years.<\/p><p>We are, I hope, emerging from recession and greater things are possible.  We know there was mission drift and a Government direction to change focus during the recession.  A review is justified, sensible and prudent at this time.  The Bill contains all these measures and I hope it will receive the support of the House.  I look forward to debating the various Stages.<\/p><p>This is the fourth Private Members' Bill I have introduced since I was elected to the House two years ago.  One of my Bills proceeded to Second Stage, a second is before committee, a third is in the lottery and this Bill is before the House today.  Deputies are elected to this parliamentary assembly to legislate.  Money messages and other procedural devices are being used to slow down Bills as they proceed through the House, however.

We were joined in our meeting by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, and the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Karen Bradley.  In our discussions we assessed the state of play in the negotiations to restore the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly.  We agreed on the need to continue to encourage the parties to reach an agreement so that functioning institutions can recommence work in the interests of the citizens of Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>We also discussed Brexit and I made clear once again that we have to see the agreement reached in December reflected in the withdrawal agreement.  This means dealing with the Border, including spelling out &quot;regulatory alignment&quot; in detail as part of the backstop agreed in paragraph 49 of the December joint report.  This is to apply in the event that agreement cannot be reached on an alternative solution, options A and B.  This does not preclude exploring the other options proposed by the UK Government in parallel.  I made clear that we were open to that work progressing around option A in engagement with the Barnier task force.  I have consistently said that the best outcome would be a solution to the Border under the overall EU-UK framework, and we will continue to work on this resolutely.  We also discussed the importance of agreement on a transition period to preserve the <i>status quo<\/i>.  The UK Government has indicated a wish for a transition, or implementation phase as it describes it, of approximately two years.  The EU 27 proposed a period to the end of 2020, which is a 21 month period, thus aligning it with the EU's multi-annual financial framework.<\/p><p>I spoke again to Prime Minister May yesterday evening.  We again discussed Brexit and I reiterated our preference that a solution on the Border be found within the overall future relationship between the EU and the UK.  At the same time I pointed out the necessity from the EU side to have the detail of the backstop option spelled out in the draft legal text of the withdrawal agreement.  This to apply in the event that a better solution cannot be agreed.  We will continue to work with the Barnier task force and the United Kingdom to explore other options on the basis of whatever proposals the UK puts forward.<\/p><p>During my visit to Belfast, I also met representatives of Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party and the Alliance Party to discuss the negotiations on the restoration of the Executive.  I regret the fact that, in the intervening period, the talks process has stalled again.  Power-sharing and working together are the only way forward for Northern Ireland.  The Government has consistently stated that the restoration of the institutions is essential in the context of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government will continue to work very closely with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties to achieve this outcome.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste and I met the president and vice president of Sinn F&eacute;in on Monday, 19 February, to review recent developments in Northern Ireland and events leading up to the breakdown in talks on Executive formation last week.  I spoke to the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, later by phone that same evening.  I made it clear that as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, the UK and Irish Governments have a shared obligation to uphold and protect the letter and spirit of that agreement.  I emphasised the Government's full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, our determination to secure the effective operation of all its institutions and our opposition to any reintroduction of direct rule from London.  Finally, the next meeting of the British-Irish Council will be held in Guernsey on 21 and 22 June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700018#Q02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1519747500,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I wish the Taoiseach well in the negotiations over the next week in respect of Brexit as they are reaching a very serious point.  The Taoiseach visited Belfast on Monday, 12 February.  I do not know if he is aware that this is the 100th anniversary of women having the vote in Ireland and of Countess Markievicz's election.  I was shocked and disappointed in the Taoiseach, as somebody who is very modern and into communication, as we know, as the picture of the Irish delegation was of six men.  Perhaps the strategic communications unit was having an off-day.  I am sure the men are all estimable but it was odd when compared with the British delegation, which I am happy to report reflected both genders.  I do not know if the Taoiseach's normal focus on communication suddenly deserted him and he had a kind of tin ear, for want of a better term, to the fact there were no women in such an extensive delegation.<\/p>  <p>  Did the Taoiseach expect a deal would be struck before he went there?  Unless they are negotiators, principals do not go to such events until a deal has been tied down.  It felt like two people had showed up to a party where, notwithstanding the fact that the balloons were ready, everything had been called off.  Will the Taoiseach explain that to us?  The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste referred to the possibility of holding an intergovernmental conference as a way of progressing British-Irish issues in a way provided for in the Belfast Agreement.  If that is not to happen, why is the Taoiseach holding off on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700018#Q02200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1519747500,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Again, it is difficult to deal with 16 questions as they embrace both Northern Ireland and European matters.  It might have been more useful to keep them separate.<\/p>  <p>  We will have statements on Northern Ireland tomorrow, which is a week later than when the British House of Commons heard from the British Government about the political crisis in Northern Ireland.  This is the best forum for getting details on the matters.  It is a pity that the Taoiseach will not be in a position to address the House on this as his predecessors regularly addressed the House concerning talks in the North at critical junctures over the past 30 years.<\/p>  <p>  Everybody understands we have reached a very serious moment and some of the statements over the past week about the continuing commitment to the Good Friday Agreement are welcome, but they bring us in no way closer to an agreement or way forward.  As I will indicate at greater length tomorrow, direct rule would be a clear breach of the international agreement that we negotiated and which has been the bedrock of a process that has delivered major progress for this island.  The critical question is what can be done to break this logjam.  If we reflect on the matters involved, they come nowhere near the seriousness of issues that have been overcome in the past but there is a growing sense of a deeper crisis.  The draft agreement leaked to the media appears both reasonable and welcome.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach agree the time has come to change the dynamic that has so conspicuously failed in the past seven years to deliver functioning government in Northern Ireland?  Is it not time to return to a model of talks used for every substantive breakthrough in the process?  All-party talks with the active participation of the Governments are surely now the only serious option available.  Instead of allowing further entrenchment of views, why is that not being pushed now?  The negotiations currently exclude many people.  Over 40% of the electorate has been excluded so far from the talks in the North, with all the other parties not being a participant.  There has been a lack of urgency in that regard and I ask that both Governments engage with all parties in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  I tabled a question on the transition matter.  My sense is there is a process of kicking the can down the road.  We saw phase 1 before Christmas and I would like to think phase 2 might bring about a transition agreement before we get an overall trade agreement, which could be down the road again.  The British Labour Party's decision to move closer to a customs union is to be particularly welcomed.  Along the lines of a point I have made for quite some time, there is a need for both the Government and Oireachtas to engage very proactively with Westminster and the British Government with a view to applying pressure with respect to advising to stay in the customs union and the Single Market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700018#Q02300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1519748100,"counter":268,"content":"<p>The Deputy is way over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700019#R00100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1519748100,"counter":269,"content":"<p>All those who can influence an outcome in the British Parliament of avoiding an exit from the customs union would be well advised to reflect on it.

Has the Taoiseach anything to say on that?<\/p>  <p>  My colleague asked, in respect of the visit the Taoiseach made with the British Prime Minister to Belfast on 12 February, whether he was assured in advance of it that a settlement had been arrived at.

I was curious why, in response to the much more sane and sensible comments of Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, often accused of being a radical firebrand of the left, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, was less than enthusiastic about those comments but suggested words to the effect that the Labour Party in Britain had its own problems.  It seemed to be an implied dig at Mr. Corbyn's left wing policies when in fact he is leading the fight against the buffoonery of Mr. Johnson and indeed the anti-immigrant sentiment the most right wing element of the Tory Brexiteers are promoting.<\/p>  <p>  When we talk of the political logjam in the North itself, much of the commentary on the political paralysis of the institutions does not actually delve deep into the issues at stake.  It might be helpful in beginning to unlock the situation up there to talk about the actual issues at stake.  Why is the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, resisting any kind of agreement to restore the institutions?  It is because it does not want marriage equality or an Irish language Act, both things which people down here should support because they are about equality.

I was interested to read Mr. Mark Durkan yesterday make the point that the way the First Minister and deputy First Minister are appointed is sectarian in nature.  My colleague, Mr. Steven Agnew, MLA, has been very consistent in calling for a wider constitutional review of how the Good Friday Agreement and institutions are working.  It is a real pity the Government has not brought other parties into this whole process, including our own which has representation here, in the North, in Holyrood and in Westminster.

If some sort of proper relationship had been maintained, the Taoiseach would have been aware Ms Foster was not going to get support from within her party to get the deal she clearly got over the line.  What is the Taoiseach going to do to try to restore some of those political connections and understandings, so we do not make the same mistake again where everyone marches up the hill and then marches down again with no deal in sight?

It is my belief the Taoiseach travelled to Belfast on 12 February in good faith.  It is also my understanding that visit was initiated by the British side.  It is my clear understanding that at that point all of us understood we had a draft agreement, one that I would describe it as \"an honourable accommodation\".  It was open to critique as these things are but an accommodation none the less.  I reject this notion that somehow there was an intractable process with immovable parties and that resolution was not possible.  In fact, we demonstrated quite the contrary that we could arrive at the accommodation.  It is a matter of very deep regret that the DUP could not deliver on that agreement.<\/p><p>However, the net issue now is what happens next.  I strongly believe that the intergovernmental conference must be convened next.  Then we require a concrete plan of action within the framework of the Good Friday Agreement to give answers on Acht na Gaeilge and marriage equality and a quick answer on the British honouring a commitment to release legacy funding as identified by the Lord Chief Justice.  Answers to these questions are the route to getting back on a path to restore the institutions.  I understand the frustration of the Green Party, the SDLP, People Before Profit and other parties.  For our part, we have made efforts to keep people informed.  I know it was frustrating and I shared many of those frustrations, but we should be clear about this.  If the DUP refuses to move, then it refuses to move and, to be frank, I do not think it will make a great difference what process is entered into because this has always been a matter of political will.<\/p> <p> Finally, I was alarmed, having met Mrs. Theresa May last week, that it is clear the British have no concrete plan for how to move matters forward.  It appears that they are simply playing for time.  That is potentially a very dangerous strategy to adopt.  Matters are polarised in the North and we do not want to see that deepen further.

It is a serious situation and we need fresh thinking.  We must break this impasse in some way.  Would a third party intermediary be helpful, such as a US envoy as is being speculated in the media?  Perhaps the Taoiseach would respond to that.  We are approaching the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  It cannot be allowed to collapse.

It starts with the publication of the withdrawal agreement tomorrow followed by the speech of the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, on Friday.  There will be a further visit of Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, to Ireland and the European Council meeting will be held towards the end of March.  It will be a very intense couple of weeks with regard to Brexit so perhaps it is a good time for the parties in the North to pause for reflection.<\/p><p>No date has been set at this stage for the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, but it will meet at an appropriate time on the agreement of the two Governments.  In the meantime, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is in regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I am in regular contact with the Prime Minister, Mrs. May.  We have spoken on the telephone or met in person at least three times in the past week and a half, and I am sure we will again.  Of course, we talk to the five major parties in Northern Ireland and while we are open to having conversations with the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth parties one has to draw the line at a certain point.  We engage with all five major parties and, indeed, the leader of the SDLP will be in Dublin this week when I will meet him again.<\/p><p>It is worth putting on the record the general level of engagement the Government has with Northern Ireland affairs.  Deputy Eamon Ryan expressed the view that through engagement one can develop understanding and, therefore, agreement.  It is not that simple when positions are fixed and sometimes no matter what level of engagement there is positions remain fixed.  Since I have become Taoiseach I have visited Northern Ireland five times, which is roughly every six weeks.  Another visit is planned.  I have had three rounds of meetings with the parties.  As a Minister I was involved in a number of cross-Border projects which I will not outline now - I can do that at another time - and attended 20 North-South Ministerial Council meetings, including many with Arlene Foster as my counterpart for three and a half years.  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, has visited twice this year so far and in the last year the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy McHugh, has visited six times.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, is due in Belfast on 19 April, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, were there this month and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will be there next month.<\/p><p>I am due to meet a group of civic nationalists from the North, the people who wrote the letter to <i>The Irish News<\/i>, who will visit me in Government Buildings tonight.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has spent 34 days in Northern Ireland since becoming T&aacute;naiste, including 16 days this year alone.  There have been five phases of negotiations.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, spent 12 days in negotiations.  Some 30 days have been spent at the talks by officials.<\/p><p>Officials estimate that 80 days were spent at the Stormont talks, further to engagements with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  It is an enormous level of engagement.

However, during consultations with the Opposition parties last November my Department provided a tentative estimated final cost for the commission of between &euro;20 million and &euro;25 million, based on the current rate of expenditure, the extended timeframe for its work, the risk of further delays, as well as the significant third party legal and other costs that may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700021#T01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1519749300,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I understand the commission is completely independent in its work, which is right and proper.

The commission was originally intended to submit a final report no later than 31 December 2015.  That date was revised to the end of April 2016, then to the end of June 2016 and then to the end of October 2016.  We know that the commission's work during this period highlighted the need for the passage of bespoke legislation and an amendment to its terms of reference.  That was done.  At that point, we were told that its final report on the first module of its work would be completed by the end of 2017.  That did not happen and the Government has extended the timeframe until the end of 2018.

After much campaigning by mortgage holders, this was the impetus which forced the Government to produce legislation to regulate the middlemen in the deals at the time.  The issue has come to the fore again in recent weeks as a result of Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank flagging a massive sale of loans.  AIB is also likely to look to make more sales.  This all points to the banks consciously using vulture funds as a get-out clause and the Government refusing to shout &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  I have raised before with the Taoiseach the need to regulate the vulture funds.  I am not suggesting this is the silver bullet which would sort everything out.  Actually, a ban on the sale of domestic mortgages to vulture funds would be in order.  However, in the here and now, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, must tell the banks, as their main shareholder, that he will refuse to permit any sale to a vulture fund.

My Department has an administrative role but does not run the commission.  It is not operating as our creature in any way, so I am not in a position to answer questions that can only be answered by Mr. Justice Cregan, who is heading up the commission.<\/p><p>It is, as Deputies will be aware, investigating first of all the Siteserv transaction module which, to the best of my recollection, does not involve any mortgage.  The commission, when it was set up and as we will all recall, was very much a demand of the Opposition.  Government parties at the time warned about the difficulties that could arise from asking a commission of investigation to investigate commercial transactions.  The nature of asset prices, just like houses, just like shares and just like everything else, can go up and go down.  It will be very difficult to determine whether or not the best price has been secured for any asset.  Asset prices, by their very nature, fluctuate over time.<\/p><p>It is estimated that it may cost between &euro;20 million and &euro;25 million for the commission of inquiry to do its work.<\/p><p>In terms of the timeline, I will make inquiries into whether I can request an indicative timeline.  I do not see why it would not be permissible for me to ask that question, but I will ask it, if it is permissible for me to ask it.  Obviously, I cannot give any assurance to anyone on a timeline because that will depend on how the inquiry goes and it would be very much in the hands of the judge in that regard.<\/p><p>The commission has requested an increase in fees that it pays to its counsel.  Under the rates agreed by the Government for counsel engaged by any commission of investigation, a senior counsel is paid &euro;788.27 <i>per diem<\/i>and a junior counsel is paid &euro;394.14 <i>per diem<\/i>, excluding VAT.  The commission requested that the fees be almost doubled to &euro;1,500 <i>per diem<\/i>for a senior counsel and &euro;800 <i>per diem<\/i>for a junior counsel.  The commission maintained that the current rates were inadequate and becoming problematic for it, in that they were not sufficient to attract and retain counsel with the relevant commercial law experience and expertise to analyse the financial issues and enormous volumes of documentation involved in this complex investigation.  In support of its view, the commission drew a comparison with the higher rates that were paid to counsel currently engaged in the disclosures tribunal.<\/p><p>I consulted representatives of other parties in the Oireachtas about the commission's request at a meeting on 14 November.  At the meeting, concerns were expressed about the impact on the cost of this and the knock-on impact on the cost of other commissions of investigation if the request were to be granted.  Reflecting on the views that I heard at the meeting, my Department subsequently wrote to Mr. Justice Cregan and informed him that it was not intended to agree to his request for an increase in fees in light of the concerns about the impacts on cost.  I do not accept that the work involved in a commission is the same as a tribunal.  For example, a commission's hearings are held in private while a tribunal's are held in public.  That is a very different nature.<\/p><p>Since it was established to the end of January this year, the commission has spent &euro;1.23 million on legal fees in respect of two senior counsel and six junior counsel.  It should be noted that the counsel work for the commission as required rather than on a full-time basis.  As required under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, the IBRC commission's legal cost guidelines were prepared at the outset by the commission and the Taoiseach as specified by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in consultation with the commission.<\/p><p>In its fourth interim report last December, the commission stated its view that the guidelines were inadequate and there needed to be proper consultation between the commission, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order to establish supplemental guidelines to meet the particular needs of persons involved in the commission.  The commission also stated that various witnesses had made submissions to it and were concerned that they would be out of pocket in respect of the legal expenses incurred by them in order to comply with the commission's directions and protect their own good names and reputations.<\/p><p>My Department has recently offered to meet the commission to discuss its proposal for supplemental guidelines and understand what the implications might be.  However, reflecting the outcome of my meeting with the Opposition last November, it is not intended to agree to an increase in the level of fees payable to senior and junior counsel.<\/p><p>The commission is independent in its work and it would not be possible or appropriate for me to interfere with its work in any way.  However, my Department did convey concerns raised at the meeting with other political leaders and, in its interim report last December, the commission stated that it was open to discussion with the Department of the Taoiseach as to how to conduct its work in the most efficient manner possible, consistent with the applicable legislative and constitutional requirements of due process, and how the duration of its investigation might be shortened.  My Department, along with the Attorney General's office, has offered to explore these issues further with the commission.<\/p><p>In the fourth interim report in December 2017, the commission stated that it did not have details of the amount of third party legal costs incurred to date.  However, in view of the large and complex nature of the investigation, I think it can be assumed that the costs arising will be substantial.  To illustrate this point, I would point to the second interim report in April 2016.  The commission stated that the special liquidators had informed it that the costs incurred by them in assisting the commission were &euro;2.78 million, comprising their costs up to 31 January of &euro;2.3 million, exclusive of VAT, and legal costs up to 15 March of &euro;456,000.  The Department of Finance had informed the commission that its external legal costs were &euro;246,000.  Third party costs were also likely to be claimed by the former directors of IBRC and some other parties.  The costs are likely to have increased very substantially since that report in April 2016.  It will, of course, be a matter for the commission to make a determination on the validity of claims for third party legal costs at the end of its investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700022#U00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Priority Questions","time":1519750500,"counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700023#V00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Issues","time":1519750500,"counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700023#V00300"},{"type":"question","time":1519750500,"counter":326,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[9729\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700023#V00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the proposed powers and resources of the new national regeneration and development agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Overall, it is way ahead of target and while we all accept that it is not enough to deal with the homelessness problem, as a document, it is delivering and we will push it forward even more.  An additional 7,000 social houses not in use at the start of last year are in now use and this year there will be an additional 8,000 such houses.  They will be new houses under all of the different schemes and add to the houses we are renting under the HAP and other rental schemes.

There are different approved housing bodies drawing down funding in different ways to invent new models to attract money.  Credit unions met the Oireachtas committee on housing and homelessness.  It also met us on a few occasions.  I was involved with the credit union movement even before taking up this brief on the subject of allowing its members to invest in housing provision and provide loans for approved housing bodies.  We are all on the same page in wanting this to happen.  Many of the decisions to be made are outside the scope of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and proper to the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, but we have worked with them too.

These reports are based on data provided by housing authorities and produced through the pathway accommodation and support system, PASS.<\/p><p>The reports capture details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency homeless accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities.<\/p> <p> The report for January shows that a total of 1,517 families were using emergency accommodation during the survey period.  Of these, 700 homeless families were recorded as staying in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in the Dublin region.  Some 45% of these families had been resident in such accommodation for less than six months.  The Government is committed to addressing the use of hotels for emergency accommodation and we are working closely with the local authorities to secure the necessary alternative accommodation.  The delivery of family hubs has been an important response and there are now almost 500 units of family accommodation in these hubs.  These facilities offer a greater level of stability than is possible in hotels, with the capacity to provide appropriate play-space, cooking and laundry facilities.  In January, I held a second housing summit with the local authority chief executives at which I asked them to develop proposals for the development of more family hubs and, as far as possible, to locate these hubs close to the communities where families are experiencing homelessness.  My Department will fund and work with local authorities on the delivery of the hubs.<\/p> <p> Significant progress is being made on exiting people from homelessness.  Last month, in Dublin alone, 92 families exited emergency accommodation, including hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation and 70 families were prevented from having to enter homeless accommodation.  During 2017, a total of 1,263 families in the Dublin region were moved on from hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation arrangements into either independent tenancies or more appropriate hub accommodation.  Last year, over 4,000 exits from homelessness were achieved nationally, into sustainable tenancies in local authority and approved housing body housing and housing assistance payment, HAP, supported accommodation.  Every effort will continue to be made to achieve the maximum number of exits from homelessness this year, assisted by the recent extension to all local authorities of the homeless HAP placefinders service, which has been a key response in Dublin and in Cork since its introduction there last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700026#Y01600","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519752900,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Since I tabled this question, there was an alarming press release this morning from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation to say that babies in hotels are not reaching their developmental goals which is really worrying.  We were aware of the difficulties with young children not being able to run around, bring friends in and so on but this is really alarming.  If a child does not reach developmental goals at a very early age, that has a real effect on the rest of that child's life.  The Minister gave me figures for 700 families in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in the Dublin region.  He gave me a figure for less than six months.  That still leaves families in such accommodation for more than six months.  My question was specifically about cases of more than three months.  Will the Minister give me the information I asked for, which was about those resident in hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation for more than three months?  The Minister gave me figures for the Dublin region but I did not hear any for the rest of the country.  It is important that we get these figures.

That is what the family hub, initiated by my predecessor, Deputy Simon Coveney, is.  Over the course of the second half of last year, we rapidly increased the number of available family hub places to help families into hub spaces or as families present for emergency accommodation, to put them directly into hub spaces in the family hubs that we have.  At the second housing summit in January, I asked local authority chief executives to develop, with my Department, a rapid hub delivery programme because we need far more hubs than are currently in the pipeline.  We have 500 family hub spaces at the moment.  We hope to see the rapid family hub programme bring in at least an additional 400 spaces in a short period over the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  On the statistics the Deputy was asking about, in so far as the 700 families in hotels in Dublin at the end of January are concerned, I said that 45% were there for six months or less.  Some 22% have been there for more than six months but less than a year.  Some 15% have been there for between 12 and 18 months and 6% of families currently in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation have been there for more than 24 months.  That 6% represents 29 families.  On the point of the length of stay that some families are experiencing in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, we have to be very sensitive to individual families' needs.  Some families need a tailored approach depending on the size of the family.  There are not necessarily hub spaces currently available for larger families.  Some other families will have very particular needs.  As we work with our partner organisations to get families into more appropriate accommodation, we are sensitive to those needs and sometimes it takes longer to support those families to get appropriate accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700027#Z00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1519752900,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I accept that family hubs are better than hotels but we absolutely need targets for how long one can stay in a hotel or family hub.

With the placefinder service, they can give their first month's rent and the deposit.  If the homeless housing assistance payment is being used, there can be extra discretion with regard to rent.  We are seeing results from that.

The Minister is now saying that there are currently 700 families in Dublin alone.  That is an increase in the homeless figures that the Minister just announced of 329 adults and 188 children.

As I stated in my previous reply, more than 1,200 families exited hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in 2017.  Of course it is still a huge challenge for Government and society, with 700 families still in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  That is why we have initiated the rapid hub development programme for the coming months, for 400 additional family hub spaces, and that is why we continue to roll out the HAP placefinder service and the use of homeless HAP to help accommodate the other families who are still in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  On the increase in our figures of people experiencing homelessness in January, the increase of individual adults was anticipated to a degree because we brought more permanent and emergency beds into the system.  That brought rough sleepers off our streets and into services.  They are then counted as being in emergency accommodation and, importantly, are getting all the care and support they need to help to get them into secure housing.  We have now appointed a national director for Housing First and we hope to see great progress with that model over the coming year.<\/p>  <p>  Are we making a dent?  We are making progress.  When one looks at the rate of increase over the previous years, we are making progress and it is beginning to stabilise with regard to families.

When I talk about the progress in 2017, when one looks at the target that we had for increasing our stock of social housing and general social housing supports, we exceeded all but one of our targets.  We were only 8% off the one that we did not achieve.

I was more alarmed to hear what he said at the beginning of his reply.  He said priority should be given to making an affordable scheme available in Dublin, Cork and Galway.

The additional funding secured at the time of the last budget for the five-year capital plan we have for Rebuilding Ireland means that we can now meet the joint committee's recommendation that 50,000 new homes be added to the social housing stock.  The affordability scheme was stood down in 2011 because it was not necessary after the previous Government - prior to 2011 - had effectively destroyed the economy.  As we all know, there was a massive decrease in house prices.  That is why we had to stand down the affordability scheme.  At the time, affordability was not a problem.

There will be affordability where it is needed.  Every local authority attended the second housing summit, at which I spoke about our ambitions for the provision of affordable housing and referred to the affordable purchase, cost rental and Rebuilding Ireland home loan schemes.  Obviously, the challenge is greater in some areas than in others.  The Rebuilding Ireland home loan is available in every local authority.  We are seeing significant demand for the new scheme across the country.  I can give the Deputy a breakdown of the projects involving 3,000 affordable homes for which finance has been secured or plans are in place.  It will include a breakdown of from where they will come.  I note that the previous Part V affordability scheme in 2008 produced approximately 3,000 homes only.  One of the problems with the scheme under the 2009 Act was that because it allowed for a mix of social and affordable homes, there was a tendency to provide more affordable homes and fewer social houses.

This was evident in the social housing output indicative figures published last month, which showed that nearly 26,000 households had their social housing needs met in 2017.  In 2017 some 85,799 households in the country were assessed as being qualified for social housing support, which represented a decrease of 6.3% on the comparable figure for 2016.  This shows that small progress is being made in the right direction.  There will be no let-up in the Government's focus on the issue.  The resources provided through Rebuilding Ireland are allowing us to respond in a significant manner.  Over &euro;1.4 billion was provided for investment in housing in 2017.  The 2018 budget provides over &euro;1.9 billion to tackle housing matters.  Taxpayers' money is being spent to try to address the problem.  This investment will yield substantial delivery activity and ensure we make further significant progress towards meeting the overall target of delivering 50,000 social homes by 2021 through construction, refurbishment, acquisition and leasing.  That number is alongside an accelerated roll-out of the housing assistance payment scheme to meet the needs of 80,000 households.<\/p><p>New rapid delivery construction is a vital part of the programme and nearly 200 new homes were delivered in this way across the Dublin area in 2017.  An additional 20 rapid projects involving in excess of 500 new homes are being advanced, many of which are scheduled for delivery in 2018.<\/p> <p> The Deputy has issues regarding other types of housing and we are prepared to meet anyone for discussions.  We have met many people involved in different types of construction to discuss various types of housing in which we could invest, provided they meet regulations and are finished to a high standard.  New social housing construction schemes are being added continually to the pipeline, both through the local authorities and approved housing bodies.  More than 3,800 houses are under construction on approximately 120 sites, and a total of 12,000 houses are planned on 700 sites.  With sufficient drive, we will be able to deliver housing to help provide housing solutions every year.<\/p> <p> Last year, more than 4,000 people left homelessness.  We acknowledge, however, that this is not enough to deal with demand.  However, we are beginning to move in the right direction and houses are being delivered.  Last year, through the various methods of delivery, more than 7,000 new social houses were added.  Together with private sector support, this helped 27,000 people find housing solutions.  We will match and increase this figure in 2018.<\/p> <p> Notwithstanding the progress being made, we must continue to drive on the process.  We are allocating additional funding to do this in the coming years.

Under the Department's social housing capital programme, 208 rapid delivery homes were completed in schemes across the greater Dublin area by the end of 2017.  Of these, 22 were delivered in 2016.  This increased substantially to 186 social homes delivered last year.  During 2017, in the Dublin city area, four schemes amounting to 130 homes were completed, of which 38 were in Belcamp, 24 in Coolock, 29 in Cherry Orchard, 29 in Drimnagh and 39 in St. Helena's Drive, Finglas.  The remaining 56 homes were delivered in Fingal, of which 20 were in Wellview, Mulhuddart, and 36 in Hansfield, Ongar.  The allocation of these homes is a matter for each local authority and I am assured that arrangements are in place that resulted in them being occupied without delay on completion.<\/p>  <p>  An additional 20 rapid delivery schemes, set to yield in excess of 500 social homes, are at various stages of advancement.  Many of these are scheduled for delivery in 2018 and I understand seven of them in are in Limerick.  Further rapid delivery homes are being added to the construction pipeline regularly.  The Minister recently made clear to all local authorities that we want the rapid build approaches to be used to deliver social housing projects.  Not only do we want construction to commence on site as quickly as possible, but the quickest method offering the best value for taxpayers must be used to deliver housing.  Local authorities have been advised that rapid build approaches should increasingly become the norm for delivering social housing projects.  Ultimately, it is likely that we will reach a point where no differentiation will be made between traditional and rapid build approaches to housing construction.  It is important that units are being designed that can accommodate both types of construction.  Rapid build approaches offer significant gains and we are asking that they be adopted as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  To support delivery, the Office of Government Procurement put in place a framework of rapid delivery contractors in 2017.  This framework is available for all local authorities and approved housing bodies to use in the interest of accelerated delivery.  In this regard, the Department has organised information seminars for local authorities, as well as visits to rapid delivery projects under construction, factories and other premises.  Local authorities and approved housing bodies have also been asked to consider, in particular, schemes which are suitable for early commencement, particularly in terms of their approved planning status.<\/p><p>Updated details on this programme of rapid delivery projects are included in each social housing construction project status report.

The programme for Government states \"We need a dynamic and innovative education system that reflects the diversity of Twenty First Century Ireland.\"  It also speaks of a \"roadmap\" for a phased transfer of Catholic schools to new patrons.  The problem, of course, is that the Minister has not delivered and is not delivering on that commitment.  In spite of the worthy aspirations to diversity in the programme for Government, there has been an abject failure to follow through on the so-called patronage divestment process.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, this matter goes back to 2012 and the recommendations of the forum on patronage and pluralism in primary schools.  We know that through surveys it was established that there was evidence of parental demand for change in a number of areas of stable population, and that this would happen by the Catholic Church divesting patronage of existing schools.  The Department gave approval for Educate Together to proceed with opening a number of new multidenominational schools under this process.  Included in these were Trim, Tuam, Tramore, New Ross and Castlebar Educate Together schools.  Educate Together is adamant that at no stage in this process did it agree that these would remain as half-stream schools.  It indicates that principals and boards were appointed on the basis of these schools being allowed to develop and grow.  This is and always has been the basis on which Educate Together agrees to open new schools.<\/p>  <p>  All five schools are thriving and intended to take in full junior infant classes this September.  In spite of this, the Department has stepped in to stymie their development by severely limiting their intake to a half-stream of 13 children this September.  Parents in each of these areas are very upset and disappointed that their wishes and entitlement to send their children to a school with a patron of their choice has been completely disregarded and shown disrespect.  When this matter was highlighted in the media, the Department issued a factually incorrect statement.  It stated the level of potential pupil intake indicated a long-term projected size of up to half a single stream school, and this statement is erroneous.  In the majority of the five schools, the recommendation was for at least a half-stream school.  More important, the surveys of all five schools stated, \"Taking account of ... long-term requirements, accommodation options for a full stream of provision should be considered.\"<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of this process is that the Catholic Church is to reconfigure its own schools to free up existing accommodation for a new Educate Together school in each area.  The surveys for all five of these schools stated, \"The main patron (Catholic Archbishop) should now be asked to consider reconfiguration options that would provide accommodation for an Educate Together school in the area.\"  Did the Minister ask the main patron to do this and, if so, what was his reply?  Will the Minister now withdraw the Department's instruction to these five schools to limit their intake and allow these schools to develop and thrive in accordance with the wishes of local families?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700032#EE01400","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1519755900,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Shortall.  The matter was raised last week but she did not get a chance to be here on that occasion.  I am delighted to be able to respond today.<\/p>  <p>  The background to this is the 2012 report of the advisory group to the forum on patronage and pluralism in the primary sector, which recommended that demand for patronage diversity should be met in areas of stable population by divesting patronage of existing schools where there is evidence of parental demand for change.  In this context, in 2012 and 2013, my Department undertook surveys of parental preferences in 43 areas of stable population to establish the level of demand for a wider choice in the patronage of primary schools.  These areas were all stable in terms of population growth, so no new school places were required.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment and size of the schools indicated by the Deputy have origins in the report on the pilot surveys regarding parental preferences on primary school patronage and the report on the surveys regarding parental preferences on primary school patronage, which indicated a size of at least half a single-stream school, comprising four classrooms, being required to accommodate parental demand in the case of Tramore, Trim and Castlebar, and up to four classrooms in the case of New Ross and Tuam.<\/p><p>Under the patronage divesting process, a school could be opened where a school building became, or was due to become, available as a result of an amalgamation or closure of an existing school.  In some areas, in responding to demand for diversity, where existing patrons were unable to make school properties available, my Department included an examination of properties held in public ownership.<\/p> <p>All schools irrespective of their location have to operate within their available accommodation and manage annual pupil intake accordingly.  The initial establishment of the indicated schools as four classroom schools, and the need to be cognisant of managing the available accommodation, has been reflected in my Department's engagement with the patron body of these schools, Educate Together.  When one of the schools raised the issue of expanding its enrolment my Department invited Educate Together to submit a case to it in this regard.  The case has been submitted by Educate Together to further expand five schools under its patronage that opened under the patronage divesting process.  <\/p> <p> These are Educate Together national schools in Castlebar, New Ross, Tramore, Trim and Tuam.  A case for each of these schools is current under consideration.  My Department is carrying out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary levels to identify areas of demographic growth and determine where additional school accommodation is needed in order to plan for school provision nationwide.  This work is almost complete.<\/p> <p> In this context the outcome of the nationwide demographic exercises will have an input into the consideration of the case submitted by Educate Together.  In addition, I have announced a new patronage reconfiguration process which will accelerate the delivery of multidenominational and non-denominational schools to reach 400 such schools by 2030.  There have been previous efforts at transferring patronage but we must be honest and admit they have not worked.  Only ten schools transferred to multidenominational patronage as a result of the previous process set up by the former Minister, Mr. Ruair&iacute; Quinn, in 2012.<\/p> <p> The figure is lower than was hoped for.  The new process is designed to build on lessons learned from the previous process and deliver more multidenominational and non-denominational schools.  That is what we believe it will do.  Unlike the previous process, this plan will focus on live transfers so that a school that transfers under the new process will not be reliant on temporary accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700032#EE01500","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519756500,"counter":450,"content":"<p>The Minister is admitting divestment has not worked.

The former Minister, Mr. Ruair&iacute; Quinn's attempt was a genuine one to, as Deputy Shortall rightly said, get a school to close and amalgamate and to get a building released and for that become a new school.  Unfortunately, as the Deputy can see, the church schools, the ten that were opened here, were not always opened in church schools volunteering their buildings.  They did not emerge that way.  Other public buildings had to be used to supplement what was coming through from the church in those instances.  When those buildings were made available, they were made available and the school had a building within which it could expand.  They have made an application to my Department to see if we would consider allowing them go beyond the building in which they are operating in or the capacity that they have been assigned under that process and expand.

One of the significant things about that Topical Issue was we were not coming as a group of constituency Members lobbying for our own constituency.<\/p>  <p>  This school serves a very wide catchment area, not just central and west Dublin but also the counties of Meath, Kildare and elsewhere.  The school has 74 pupils.  Having been to the school on a number of occasions with Deputy Curran and others on a cross-party basis, the children and the parents in the schools are truly remarkable.  The children are not remarkable because of their disabilities but because of the way in which they are able to overcome the enormous obstacles put in their way by our society and by the education system.<\/p>  <p>  The building is simply unsuitable for any basic educational needs.  It is not just that it is overcrowded or that some of these children are in prefabs.  In one part of the school, it is not possible to close the toilet door.  The toilet facility opens onto a corridor which has an old fashioned screen.  The child, and possibly the assistant to the child, has to use this facility while other children, teachers, sometimes parents and Deputies, as was the case when we visited, walk down the corridor.<\/p>  <p>  We asked the Minister to prioritise the capital investment to allow this school building to go ahead.  He replied that information was being waited on from the school.  That information has now been provided.  We are looking for two things from the Minister.  The first is an update.  The answer to the parliamentary question the Minister gave last week was pretty poor in terms of additional information.  We are looking for an update on what is happening with this vital capital project.  However, we are also looking for the Minister to commit to prioritising this project so that this happens within the next number of years and not over the coming six-year period, as he indicated in his answer last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700033#FF01300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1519756500,"counter":463,"content":"<p>The Minister will recall the debate last September when we set out the conditions in the school which the 74 pupils are enduring.  All these pupils have a range of disabilities.  The school structure is simply not adequate to meet their needs.  I refer to their movements around the school, the size of the corridors, the classrooms and the toilet facilities.<\/p><p>All of these children require mobility aids of one form or another, but mainly wheelchairs, and it is simply not possible to move around the school.  We specifically asked the Minister to consider favourably fast-tracking this development and he indicated in his response that he would consider it.  He also said at the time that there were outstanding issues.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin and I are advised by the school that all the outstanding issues have been forwarded to the Department.  It is extraordinary to see the pupils and teachers surviving and thriving in this environment.  It is not an appropriate place where the most vulnerable in our society should be expected to go for an education.<\/p> <p> Incidentally, when we asked the Minister to consider favourably fast-tracking this we had no wish to jump a queue.  That was not the point.  As I pointed out on the last occasion, the whole school evaluation report, which was conducted eight years ago on 4 March 2010, highlighted all the issues we are bringing to the Minister's attention today.  Eight years ago the Department determined that the school was not fit for purpose.  We need assistance in bringing it up to date so it does not languish in some procedural black hole in the Department.  Frankly, we were concerned by the reply when we raised this issue, which simply stated that it is now in the six year construction programme.  That is not satisfactory.  The school has already spent eight years trying to get onto a programme.  Now it is told it is on a programme, but there is no plan or detail.  I hope the Minister can enlighten us and outline what practical steps can be taken to ensure the vulnerable pupils in that school are looked after in a timely fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700033#FF01400","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519757100,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this again.

According to the report, treatment for people with co-occurring disorders is complicated from a clinical service provision point of view due to the difficulty in ascertaining which diagnosis is primary, who takes responsibility, who holds the risk and who takes the lead in their care.  It cites case studies that were done in this regard when people were accessing services.  In one case study, the person would frequently be told by the mental health service that he would have to address his addiction issues before anything else could be addressed, yet community drug and alcohol services were not willing to see him due to his mental health symptoms and presentations.  The community mental health services did not have access to an addiction councillor in its team, and his non-attendance and disengagement with the mental health service further complicated management of his chances for recovery.<\/p>  <p>  The result of this is a blueprint, called \"No Wrong Door\".  The aspiration of \"No Wrong Door\" is to work with individuals in truly integrated ways.  Rather than care being provided by differing disciplines according to diagnostic groups this service meets the person where the person is, with dual expertise in order to assist in a positive change according to the blended problem presentation.  Obviously, that is the complexity here.  The \"No Wrong Door\" will provide a variety of services across a continuum from minimum engagement to intense therapeutic engagement.  There are a number of facets relating to a person's problem and the person's current position with it, and this is a system of integration whereby the person can interact with any part of it, be it high up or low down, at one or another side of the spectrum.  There is always a door by which the person can access it and the person is not turned away.  That is the kernel of this proposal.<\/p>  <p>  It arose from a study that took place in the mid-west and north Tipperary during 2013 and 2014.<\/p><p>The project included screening-triaging, assessment, motivational and a recovery-based group programme led by a counsellor and registrar, as well as psychiatric reviews, group evaluations and a peer support aftercare group.<\/p> <p> Waiting lists for addiction counselling were significantly reduced.  Access to and engagement in treatment improved.  Further integration of mental health and addiction treatment was established with positive results.  Service users got involved in planning and decision-making.  Good outcomes were identified in areas such as motivation to change, alcohol and drug use or both, overall well-being, self-esteem and confidence, social isolation and anxiety, sense of purpose and managing difficult emotions.<\/p> <p> Respondents informed the report's authors that the best parts of the group programme were meeting new people without having a drink and being able to talk to people experiencing the same difficulties.  They also spoke about openness, feeling of safety, a sense of it being non-judgmental and good people in the group, which made them look forward to it every week.  They also said the doctor and addiction counsellor were easy to talk to and it made them happy.  This social interaction and social integration helped.  Service provision can be at a social level where people might want to dip in and out of the service.  Patients spoke about how it made them feel normal, they deserved to be there and how the other group members helped their confidence and self-esteem.<\/p> <p> This model, recognising the myriad difficulties experienced by people, allowed them to integrate at whatever level they required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700034#GG00700","speaker":"1328","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519757700,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this important issue.  I also want to use the opportunity to commend his work on mental illness and substance misuse.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has recognised the need for a clinical programme for dual diagnosis to respond to people with concurrent mental illness and substance misuse issues.  Budget 2018 allocated an additional &euro;35 million to develop mental health services in 2018, which has helped facilitate programmes such as the clinical programme for dual diagnosis.  The aim of this programme is to develop a standardised evidence-based approach to the identification, assessment and treatment of co-morbid mental illness and substance misuse.  This includes increasing awareness of the frequent co-existence of mental illness and substance misuse; ensuring there is a clear clinical pathway for management of people with such a dual diagnosis, including when they present to emergency departments; ensuring a standardised service is provided throughout the country; and ensuring adolescents are also included within the scope of this clinical programme.<\/p>  <p>  Work has already taken place to progress this aim.  This includes the appointment of a programme manager and national clinical lead, the commencement of a literature review and clinical service mapping exercise and the establishment of a national working group.  The purpose of the national working group is to develop a national model of care for specialist dual diagnosis services for adults and adolescents which is person-centred, ensuring people get easier access to the right treatment at the right time and in the appropriate setting.  Towards this end, the group has initiated a work plan to develop a model of care based on a programmatic approach to service improvement and development.  The working group held its first meeting on 19 October 2017 and has met each month since.<\/p>  <p>  The national working group recognises the need to hear from other service providers and support organisations on the needs of this particular client group.  The group plans to host a forum to link in with this aspect, as well as discussion on possible care pathways during the development of the model of care.  An integral part of the dual diagnosis programme will be to devise a model of care that will ensure all adolescents and adults suspected of having a moderate to severe mental illness, co-existing with significant substance misuse, have access to a timely mental health service nationally.  This is to be delivered on a community health care organisation, CHO, basis.  The service will be provided in an integrated manner across the primary care division and the mental health service.  This will ensure there are close working relationships with the relevant specialties in the acute hospital groups which would deal with any medical co-morbidities which may occur, particularly in those with alcohol misuse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700035#HH00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1519757700,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's statement.

Turkey is also implicated in this, given that it has invaded northern Syrian to serve its cynical desire to crush the Kurdish movement.  We should be consistent across the entire region and call out, for example, the Saudi regime, which is backing militias in the area, and other external powers like the US that are inflaming a disaster in Syria for their own cynical interests, but let us start with the Russian ambassador by calling him in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700036#JJ00800","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1519758900,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy the Russian authorities are in no doubt of Ireland's position but I will pass on his suggestion to the Minister.

While it is a comparatively short Bill and quite technical in nature, it will regularise matters in the area of radiological protection by amending certain sections of the Radiological Protection Act 1991 and to effect the transfer of radiological functions from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment as directed by the Government when the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment was established.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also includes amendments relating to ministerial powers to make regulations to establish and maintain regulatory oversight of practices involving radiation sources.  These amendments will enable the transposition into law of certain articles in Council Directive 2013\/59\/EURATOM laying down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation.  The Bill also transfers the functions currently vested in the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment under the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Act 2003, which implements the State's obligations under the UN Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  The Bill further provides for an administrative appeals process and the right to appeal to the courts to challenge decisions made by the Environmental Protection Agency on registrations or licences for the carrying out of activities involving radiation sources.  This brings Ireland in line with international best practice and addresses the recommendation made by an integrated regulatory review service mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency to Ireland in 2015 to \"ensure legislation provides for appeals against the decisions of the regulatory bodies in relation to radiation safety\".<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will additionally provide that a function under the Harbours Act 1996 requiring the consent of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to exempt certain vessels carrying nuclear material otherwise prohibited from entering an Irish harbour will also be transferred by the Bill to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment as it is appropriate to that Minister.  Finally, the Bill will provide for amendments to update the terminology in the 1991 Act to account for developments since that Act came into effect.<\/p>  <p>  Before speaking on the details of the Bill, I will outline by way of background the functions of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in regulating this area.  The EPA is responsible under the Radiological Protection Acts for providing advice to the Government, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and other Ministers on matters relating to radiological safety including monitoring developments abroad relating to nuclear installations and radiological safety; monitoring, measuring and assessing radioactivity contamination of the environment, including the seas around Ireland; controlling by way of licence the custody, use, manufacture, importation, transportation, distribution, exportation and disposal of radiation sources; informing the public on any matters relating to radiological safety and supporting the development and implementation of national plans for nuclear and radiological emergencies.  The EPA has a role as regulator in ensuring that acceptable standards of practice are maintained.<\/p>  <p>  Sections 8 and 9 of the Bill will provide the legal basis for the evolution of a one-size-fits-all system of licensing currently operated by the EPA to a risk-based graded approach to the regulatory control of radiation sources, making it a far more streamlined and appropriate system.  The provisions on a graded approach to regulation are in line with the requirements of Council Directive 2013\/59\/EURATOM, referred to as the Basic Safety Standards Directive, which lays down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from ionising radiation and with international best practice in the field of radiological protection.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions also address the recommendation made by an integrated regulatory review service mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency to Ireland in 2015 to introduce a graded approach to the regulatory control of radiation sources.  The new graded approach to authorisation of practices involving the use of radiation sources will provide a new system of registration for low-risk activities resulting in a reduction of the regulatory, financial and administrative burden for practitioners and companies engaged in such practices.  It will also allow for a more efficient use of the EPA's regulatory resources.<\/p>  <p>  Section 10 of the Bill amends and clarifies the Minister&rsquo;s powers to make regulations to give effect to obligations imposed on the State under European legislation and to regulate activities involving the use of radiation sources.  Specifically, the amendments provide that the Minister may make regulations for a registration and licensing system to be established and maintained by the EPA to regulate radiation sources based on the magnitude and likelihood of exposures resulting from the intended practice.  Further to this, the Minister may make regulations setting out safety and security requirements and conditions that must be met by the applicant seeking a registration or a licence; the procedures to be followed in the application process for the grant, renewal or amendment of a registration or licence; an administrative appeals process to ensure that clients can appeal decisions of the EPA without the expense of having to go to court to make such a challenge as is currently the case; and for the fixing of fees payable in respect of the application process.<\/p>  <p>  Sections 11 and 12 clarify the consultation process on certain matters to account for the change in ministerial functions arising from various Government decisions since the enactment of the 1991 Act.<\/p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Bill provides for the transfer of functions under the Radiological Protection Acts and the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Act 2003 from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and consequential amendments to ensure the orderly transfer of associated administration and business.  These are technical amendments and constitute no policy change in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Part 4 of the Bill transfers a function under the Harbours Act 1996 requiring the consent of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to exempt certain vessels carrying nuclear material otherwise prohibited from entering an Irish harbour to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment as it is appropriate to that ministry.  This is a technical amendment to account for a transfer of a function and does not constitute any change in existing policy.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, the Bill will complete the transfer of functions related to radiological protection to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and will establish the legal basis for Ireland to fulfil its international obligations to ensure robust and reliable regulatory oversight of radiation sources in Ireland.  Additionally, the risk-based graded approach to regulation underpinned by the provisions in this Bill will provide for a simpler, less costly and less administratively burdensome regulatory framework for both the regulator and practitioners engaged in activities involving radiation sources.<\/p><p> My Department will be providing funding of &euro;70,000 for a detailed survey of approximately 1,200 households to examine behavioural factors in radon testing and remediation.  This will help to inform how a future financial incentive scheme might operate.  Principles of and policies on a financial incentive scheme for radon may be included in future legislation.  The study will be managed by the Environmental Protection Agency will start next month.<\/p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700037#KK00600","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519759500,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Bill which is a common-sense and prudent safety measure and an important step in strengthening Ireland's protection against nuclear and radiological threats.  Fianna F&aacute;il has always been opposed to any form of nuclear development within Ireland and is conscious of the threat from nuclear developments in other places and the possibility that it may impinge on our borders or pose a threat to the State.  We must remain vigilant and the measures proposed are necessary and proportionate.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill advances a risk-based approach, which is very sensible, and replaces the outdated one-size-fits-all approach.  I am aware of the Mulcreevy judgments.  This is not be the first time and it will not be the last responsibilities have fallen through the cracks when one Department is transferred to another, or a Minister changes portfolio.   The programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, is one recent example, but there are many areas where initiatives do not make the cut in such instances.  The intention of the Bill is to ensure public consultations, statutory instruments or secondary legislation which the Minister wished to invoke will be subject to scrutiny.  This makes a lot of sense.<\/p>  <p>  Council Directive 2013\/59\/EURATOM is also pertinent and a main driver behind the Bill.  EURATOM is the main organisation in Europe for the management of nuclear energy, better safety mechanisms and research in nuclear technology.  The Bill is the right place in which to include relevant measures.<\/p>  <p>  I note the risk posed by the Brexit decision in the United Kingdom.  The United Kingdom which is a nuclear power in the areas of defence and energy is subject to EURATOM safety standards, as is Ireland, but it will no longer be subject to its stringent regulations when it leaves the European Union.  This is a source of serious concern.  Those of us living on the east coast are always conscious of the risks from our nearest neighbour, Sellafield and other plants.  Deputy Timmy Dooley raised this issue last October with the Minister who at the time had not interacted with his opposite number in the United Kingdom on the issue, but I he has since had a chance to do so and will press it.  It is of great concern to Fianna F&aacute;il, as I imagine it is to all Deputies, that the safety standards will continue to apply post-Brexit.  Will the Minister tell us what the new arrangement will be?<\/p>  <p>  The Bill brings to mind issues to do with energy security.  We recently had a debate on emergency climate measures.  I identified the risk in closing down non-renewable resources in Ireland and importing them from elsewhere, as may be happening.  What steps are being taken to deal with the possibility of nuclear energy being included in the mix in such a scenario?  The interconnector across the Irish Sea allows energy supplies to be swapped with the United Kingdom, but there is a need for the Celtic interconnector, while there are discussions on connecting Ireland and France in order that Ireland will remain in the EU energy market and promote and sustain its energy security, as well as possibly in the future contribute with exports of renewables should we make sufficient progress in that field.<\/p>  <p>  The Mulcreevy decisions dealt with the issue of primary versus secondary legislation.  The principle is a common-sense one, but it is important that it be reiterated that it is up to this House to pass legislation.  No directive, statutory instrument, regulation or ministerial ruling can or should ever overrule an Act of these Houses.<\/p>  <p>  This is an important Bill for safety reasons and to tidy up a number of other Acts, as well as to deal with some issues that emerged from European directives, EURATOM and the Mulcreevy decisions.  Therefore, we welcome it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700038#LL00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1519759500,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I will share time with Deputy Louise O'Reilly.  <\/p>  <p>  We welcome the contents of the Bill, although we may table amendments on Committee Stage.  The Bill contains many technical changes in regard to the responsibility for radiological and nuclear safety.  We know how important safety is in this area.  We realise also this stems from the transposition of EU legislation into Irish law, which will be followed by regulations.<\/p>  <p>  Nuclear power poses an immense threat to society when things go wrong.  We hope the State will continue its resistance to its use as a source of energy or the creation of a nuclear industry.  Nuclear power is used by many states as an answer to emissions reductions, but this is not the way to go.  Instead, we need to show vision and use and grow the wide portfolio of renewable energy resources available to us on this island, with the aim of being self-sufficient in electricity production.<\/p>  <p>  At a committee meeting this morning I spoke about our 2020 renewable energy targets and stressed the need not to put all of our eggs in one basket, as we are doing in relying on onshore wind enegy.  Instead, if we are ever to replace fossil fuels, we need to develop a wide array of renewable energy resources such as biomass, biogas, offshore wind energy, solar energy and microgeneration.  There is no solar energy after 6 p.m., while there is no wind blowing on a frosty night; therefore, having energy resources that complement the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy is vital.  On nuclear power, we cannot take the moral high ground, as some Members of the House do.  On the one hand, we say we are nuclear-free on this island, but, on the other, we freely use the electricity generated at nuclear power plants in Britain that is supplied through the interconnector.  There is no morality in that regard.  We should have the interconnector and create the proposed interconnector with France.  I had the pleasure of meeting the French ambassador to discuss this subject last year.  We can drive around in electric cars and have energy-efficient homes, but many of them are powered by nuclear energy supplied from Britain and energy produced from coal which is a very dirty fuel.  The interconnector should be seen as part of the wide number of renewable energy sources we can develop.<\/p><p>It is estimated that we have one third of Europe's offshore wind resources.  We need to see ourselves as being in a position not just to satisfy our own needs but to be able to export some of that energy.  We are the only country with an Atlantic coast in Europe that has no offshore wind farms.  Portugal, France and the UK have them but we do not.  We are the only country facing out into the Atlantic that does not do that.  We need to look seriously at that.  Some countries bordering the North Sea are ahead of us when they do not have the wind advantages we have.  Some Deputies have put forward this proposal on relying on another states for nuclear power.  That is fine.  I do not agree with it but we must accept it as part of the mix coming into us.  However, we should aim to become a net exporter, which would mean that we would not be using nuclear power.  One is either for or against nuclear power.  We need to work on that and turn the tide around in terms of becoming a net exporter of electricity.  <br\/><br\/>With regard to nuclear safety in this State, with which this legislation is concerned, we also need to be aware of nuclear safety <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>our neighbours.  Ultimately, in the event of ongoing environmental damage or an outright nuclear accident, borders will not be relevant.  Some of these plants such as Sellafield are very close to us.  What happens in one state will affect its neighbours.  Nuclear fallout and pollution spread.  We saw some terrible examples over the years.  We are all aware of the ongoing issues that occur with Sellafield.  There are also issues with the first new nuclear power plant to be built in Britain for 30 years.  This nuclear power plant is currently under construction in Somerset on the south-west coast of England.  That is just 240 km from this State.  The Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee made recommendations concerning environmental impact assessment relating to the Hinkley Point nuclear reactor in the UK.  Many Irish environmental NGOs, most notably An Taisce, have raised concerns over the implications the development could have for Ireland.  I have submitted parliamentary questions on this issue but have received no clarity about what this Government has done or plans to do with regard to the building of the plant and the British Government's requirement to consult about the environmental implications.  The Minister might come back to me with a more substantial response on that.  There will now be a public consultation, which has come about after a five-year legal battle.  The case taken by An Taisce argued that the UK Government's decision to approve the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant without first consulting the public in Ireland was contrary to international, EU and English law.  It subsequently lost this case.  It was pressure from Germany, Holland and Denmark and not, it seems, pressure from the UK's closest neighbour, Ireland, that finally opened up the avenue of consultation which opened this week.  If we are going to take the issue of nuclear power seriously, we need to consider this State's environmental measures in which this State does not seem to have taken much of an interest up to now.  There have been reports about the use of parts of this island, particularly the Six Counties, for the disposal of nuclear waste.  This also needs to be a major concern for us.  We do not want nuclear dumps anywhere on this island.<br\/><br\/>There are many aspects to this Bill and many technical elements.  Radiological safety involves the transposition of the directive and regulations will follow from this Bill.  There is a proposal in the Bill for registration with regard to dealing with radiological equipment.  In terms of the registration, there will be changes to accession to the upcoming European Union (Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Dangers from Medical Exposure to lonising Radiation) Regulations 2018.  Myself and other Deputies have been contacted directly by chiropractors regarding future regulation that will stem from this Bill.  I raised the matter with the Taoiseach two weeks ago.  Chiropractors have called for their inclusion under the regulations.  The Minister for Health has said that the statutory instrument transposing the EU directive will designate those who may refer for radiological tests, those who may carry them out and other functions.  In this regard, we should look at including other medical professionals such as nurses, doctors, dentists, chiropractors and so on.<br\/><br\/>The issue of radon is of concern to me.  There are maps of Laois, Offaly and Westmeath that show where a high risk of exposure to radon exists.  We know exposure to radon is a cause of lung cancer.  Many of us stopped smoking years ago to lessen the risk of lung cancer but we might have radon in our homes.  I listened carefully to what the Minister had to say about this.  People in the midlands, in counties like Laois, Offaly and Westmeath, want to know about this.  We do not know if there are radon barriers in houses built in the past 15 years.  I live in a house that was built ten years ago.  I do not know if it has a radon barrier and I would like to know.  If there is no radon barrier in it, I would like to put one in and I am sure my neighbours would like to do so as well.  If it needs to be done, it would be good if we assisted homeowners in this regard.  I know there are competing demands but this is a fairly strong public health issue that affects where families live, eat and sleep.  If there is a high risk of exposure to radon in midland counties like Laois, Offaly and Westmeath along with Kildare and other areas, we would like to see it tested.  The local authority in an area where there is a high risk of exposure to radon should be able to say that it is a condition of planning permission that a radon barrier is installed when a house is built.  It is a form of sheeting that goes under the floor.  This must be a condition of planning permission.  We introduce measures relating to road safety and fire safety when houses are being built and that is all right and good but we should look for radon barriers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700038#LL00300","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519760100,"counter":493,"content":"<p>It is in existing regulations for all new houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700039#MM00200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1519760100,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Is that for every new house in the State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700039#MM00300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1519760100,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700039#MM00400","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1519760100,"counter":496,"content":"<p>When did that start?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700039#MM00500","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1519760100,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700039#MM00600","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1519760100,"counter":498,"content":"<p>What I am saying is that everything that was built during the noughties, including my tig&iacute;n-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700039#MM00700","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1519760100,"counter":499,"content":"<p>By all accounts, it is not a tig&iacute;n.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700039#MM00800","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1519760100,"counter":500,"content":"<p>It is a three-bedroom terraced house.

There is a particular risk in the midlands.  I do not want to scaremonger but if there is a high level of radon in family homes in the midlands and there is unclear information about whether or not there is a barrier in these homes, we should be able to establish that.  In the absence of information from developers, most of whom are AWOL, is there a simple way of finding out without turning the house upside down whether or not there is a radon barrier in the house?  I welcome the fact that it is included in the new regulations.  That is good news and a very progressive step forward.  It was a very good move on the part of the Department.  We must look back at the 500,000 homes that were built during the boom, or false boom, to see what the situation with those homes is and whether or not they contain barriers.

I have a few questions on the Minister's speech.  The Bill provides that the power to exempt certain vessels carrying nuclear material otherwise prohibited from entering an Irish harbour will be transferred to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  When such exemptions are given, is it a matter of public knowledge?  If it is not a matter of public knowledge, is there a process by which such exemptions could be made public?  If they are not public knowledge, there may be a legitimate reason for that, but I would like to know.<\/p><p>I wish to raise an historical issue.  I have information dating back to 2011 when the management of radioactive waste was the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in conjunction with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  Information on radioactive waste in the country's education sector indicated that 2,037 sources were held at 17 institutions in dedicated storage facilities.  I take it that information is now out of date.  The Minister or his officials might correspond with me on the matter.  I could table a parliamentary question to that effect.  In replying to the debate the Minister might indicate if there is an updated register of the sources held at the 17 institutions.<\/p><p>I presume that the existing law will also transfer over.  It is a licensing requirement that an application to acquire new sealed sources is accompanied by a take-back agreement whereby the supplier agrees to take back the source when it is no longer required.  Given that provision in law, I imagine the figure of 2,037 sources has probably not increased considerably since 2011.  I seek further clarification on that.<\/p><p>In 2011 there was material in storage at University College Cork.  It did not come from a nuclear reactor, as was suggested at the time.  I understand it was originally incorporated into a device called a sub-critical assembly used in laboratory-like conditions.  I understand that became obsolete and that University College Cork no longer had use for that material.  A response to a parliamentary question from the then Deputy, Senator Humphreys, on Tuesday 4 October 2011 stated:<\/p><blockquote>UCC is hopeful that a resolution can be achieved shortly.  It is too early to assess the costs that will be associated with disposal at this time. <br \/><br \/>The components of the SCA were last inspected by the European Atomic Energy Community on 6th October, 2010.  The nuclear material is securely stored at UCC in a proprietary radioactive waste store built to a design approved by RPII.  <\/blockquote><p>What is the status of that waste at present?  Does the <i>status quo<\/i>pertain or will this material be disposed of responsibly at some stage in the future?  I know at the time the Government made funding available for the safe disposal of material of that nature.<\/p><p>The response further stated, &quot;The material is held at UCC under licence from the RPII whose Inspectors regularly inspect this store in addition to inspections by the EU and by the IAEA.&quot;  Given that we are now transferring powers - I know everything transposes as seamlessly as possible - I want to ensure a consistent monitoring of that material and that the Minister is aware of its existence.  It may have been disposed of in the meantime, but I wish to ascertain the status of that material.<\/p><p>Many Deputies have been in contact with the chiropractors.  What is the status of their interaction with Government?  Perhaps in his own constituency, the Minister has had contact with chiropractors.  I understand their case is made via the Minister for Health and the Department of Health.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Naughten, in his role as a Cabinet Minister to have regard to their position.  They are reputable and responsible practitioners.  I hope the Government can devise a process to ensure that chiropractors have access to X-rays.  On a Second Stage speech we have a certain degree of leeway.  Technically speaking it does not come under the ambit of the Bill, but the material with which they are dealing arguably does.<\/p><p>We give our support to the case they are making, to find some process to ensure that they are not without the facility of X-rays in the future and that their position would be given some consideration.  I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for the Bill digest.  Although the briefing is extremely technical, a very comprehensive brief has been provided for us.  I, like my colleagues in this House, have an interest in parliamentary procedure and ask the Minister to come back to us with his own explanation of the Mulcreevy-type legal issues that exist with the transfer of responsibility from one Department to another.  I will quote from the report that we have been given by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service:<\/p><blockquote>&ldquo;Mulcreevy type&rdquo; legal issues arose in the Supreme Court case Michael Mulcreevy v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which involved the construction of the M50 and its potential impact on the archaeology of Carrickmines.  This case involved a transfer of functions which resulted in the Minister effectively having to consult with themselves rather than consulting with fellow Ministers as was the aim of the National Monuments legislation.  The effect was that the number of bodies that had to be consulted with before a decision was made was reduced from three to two.  The case hinged on whether primary legislation could be amended by secondary legislation.  The Supreme Court found it could not.<\/blockquote><p>Perhaps the Minister will outline the consultation process that existed when the decision was made to transfer powers from another Department to his Department and whether that is a seamless transition.  Are guarantees in place to ensure that it does not become subject to further scrutiny in the courts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700040#NN00200","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519761300,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I have a speech here but would like to address as many of the questions that were raised as I can.

I have been very conscious of the issue.  The difficulty with radon gas is that it is a naturally occurring radioactive gas which originates from the decay of uranium in rocks and soils and is colourless, odourless and tasteless.  People do not know that there is a build-up of radon in their homes.  After smoking, it is the next biggest cause of lung cancer in this country and is responsible for approximately five cases of lung cancer in Ireland every single week.  That is a pretty serious statistic.  Deputy Stanley is right that there is a problem with it right across the middle of the country.  I, as Minister, have been very conscious of it since my appointment and taking over responsibility for this area.  I wanted to try to move on the issue of radon gas.<\/p>  <p>  The big barrier that I have come up against is that there is already a legislative scheme in place.  Something that I learned is that having primary legislation already in place is a barrier at the moment to addressing this issue.  I have spent a considerable amount of time over the past 12 months trying to have this problem addressed.  The current legislation is unworkable in the present format.  Realistically, we will not know what type of scheme works until we start to apply it on the ground and tweak it to meet needs but we cannot do that without first putting the scheme in primary legislation.  It is a chicken-and-egg situation.  I had hoped to delete the existing provisions and bring it in by statutory instrument, which would be the normal course, but I was told I could not do that because I would be taking away powers that are already within the Parliament here.  I then suggested that we bring forward a statutory instrument that would require the approval of Parliament, but I am told that is not feasible either.  That is why I have announced today that we are running a pilot scheme in six locations, looking at how this should work, how we would need to tweak it and then putting it in primary legislation and allowing for a scheme to be introduced.  I intend to do that because I am very conscious of it.  Approximately &euro;75,000 is being set aside for the pilot scheme, and once we can tweak that, we can amend the primary legislation and put a proper programme of work in place.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Stanley asked about existing houses and how one knows if the radon barrier is in place.  It is in place now for new houses as part of the building regulations that were put in place relatively recently.  If a property is being sold, there are questions on the conveyancing form asking if a house has been tested and-or remediated against radon.  As houses are being sold and the transfer of ownership is taking place, this will come up as an issue, but as I say, I intend to bring forward legislation in this area to put a proper, robust scheme in place.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Sherlock asked me about the Mulcreevy-type issues.  How did it arise with regard to this issue?  The defects relate to references to various Ministers within Acts not being updated to keep in line with the changing functional areas of various Departments over the course of several Government formations.  With regard to the Radiological Protection Acts, the Mulcreevy-type issues first arose in 2002 with regard to section 30(1), section 30(2), section 30(8), section 31(1) and section 31(2) of the Radiological Protection Act 1991.  The relevant functions were, on the enactment of the 1991 Act, in the remit of the Minister for Energy.  Since the making of SI 303 of 2002 on 18 July 2002, those functions have resided with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, now the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, essentially requiring that over the intervening period to date, the said Minister had to consult himself or herself.  This anomaly must be rectified to enable the transfer of relevant functions under the 1991 Act to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  These issues are not confined to the Radiological Protection Acts.  A Mulcreevy-type issue has also been identified with regard to section 54(2) of the Harbours Act 1996.  I am sure others will be identified as we go through legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Stanley raised the issue of energy policy.  Ireland currently meets its electricity requirements from a combination of thermal and renewable energy sources.  While Ireland has chosen not to develop a nuclear power industry and the Government has no plans to change this policy, we acknowledge the right of states to develop their own energy mix.  Where a state chooses to develop a nuclear power industry, this is done in line with the highest international standards with respect to safety and environmental protection.  I am not sure of the recent figures because I do not have them to hand but I know that through much of 2017, Ireland exported electricity to the UK, not the other way around, because we have more than sufficient capacity here in power generation and the UK is very stretched.  That is simply because of the number of gas-fired power stations in Ireland.<\/p><p>There is an abundance of power capacity in Ireland.<\/p> <p> Issues were raised in regard to Brexit and what that will mean in terms of nuclear safety.  The United Kingdom remains a member of EURATOM and the UK nuclear industry is still subject to oversight by the EU institutions.  It is likely that the UK will remain subject to such oversight during the transition phase, which is projected to last for at least two years following the exit day in March 2019.  Post-Brexit, the UK will continue to be a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, which establishes and monitors adherence to standards on nuclear safety, security and safeguards.  Through the various conventions, partnerships, agreements and inter-governmental treaties under the auspices of the IAEA, Ireland will continue to play a role in directly analysing and peer-reviewing UK nuclear safety procedures and ensuring the UK meets its international obligations in that regard.<\/p> <p> There are several significant hazards on the Sellafield site and these are recognised by the industry, its regulators and the Irish authorities.  Sellafield has the largest inventory of radioactive waste in Europe, some of which is stored in ageing facilities.  This situation is acknowledged by the UK authorities as requiring active hazard reduction programmes.  In light of long-standing concerns about the potential for an incident at Sellafield and its impact on Ireland, the Government commissioned a team of international nuclear experts to undertake a probabilistic risk assessment, PRA, of Sellafield.  The assessment looked at a wide range of events, including operator error, earthquakes, fires, floods, meteor strikes and terrorist attacks.  The assessment included incidents caused by internal events such as a fire within the facility, as referred to in the BBC \"Panorama\" programme.  The PRA found that while internal events such as a fire could lead to significant releases within the site and surrounding area and potential injuries to, or deaths of, site personnel, they would not lead to significant contamination reaching Ireland.  The PRA also considered more severe external events, such as a meteorite or an aircraft crashing into a facility and causing the dispersion of radioactivity into the atmosphere.  The assessment concluded that such events would not lead to high enough contamination levels in Ireland to cause observable health effects but could require the introduction of food and agricultural protective actions here, which would have significant socio-economic impacts.  Ireland has in place a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents which is designed to deal with the consequences of such events and includes arrangements for introducing appropriate protective actions for people and the food chain.<\/p> <p> At a governmental level, there is a formal agreement between the UK and Ireland for the early provision of information in the event of a nuclear accident.  There are also regular meetings of officials from Departments in both countries to discuss nuclear issues.  At a technical level, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, meets at least annually with the UK nuclear regulators, the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the Environment Agency and maintains regular contact with them in the case of incidents or other developments of interest at nuclear sites in the UK.  The EPA will be discussing the contents of the \"Panorama\" programme at its planned meeting with the UK nuclear regulators in November and in the meantime has been in contact with the Office for Nuclear Regulation to get its views on the safety concerns raised in the programme.<\/p> <p> As regards geological disposal facilities, functions in regard to the management of radioactive waste in the United Kingdom are devolved from the United Kingdom Government to the devolved administrations.  In addition to an area having the right geology, community acceptance is also required.  Previously, a site identified in Cumbria in England was rejected as it did not have the support of the local council.  In Northern Ireland, a decision to host a geological disposal facility would be for the Northern Ireland Executive, taking into account planning and environmental considerations.  There are no current plans to site a geological waste facility in Northern Ireland.  The UK consultation notes that such a decision would take 15 to 20 years.<\/p> <p> The issue of chiropractors was raised.  I stated in my opening contribution that we are introducing a new graded approach to the authorisation of practices involving the use of radiation sources, which will provide a new system of registration for lower risk activities and result in a reduction of the regulatory, financial and administrative burdens on practitioners and companies engaged in such practices.  The intention of the legislation is to make registration simpler and easier, in line with best international practice.  We currently have a one-size-fits-all system.  We will introduce a graded system with registration at high, medium or low risk levels.  Under the legislation, it will be easier for people to comply with the regulations.  There is no specific provision in the legislation in regard to chiropractors.  The enactment of the Bill will not impact on the ability of chiropractors to take X-rays of their patients or refer them for X-rays.  It will make matters simpler rather than more complicated.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, as part of the transposition of Council Directive 2013\/59\/EURATOM laying down basic safety standards for protection against dangers arising from exposure to an ionising radiation, intends to recognise certain professions, namely, doctors, dentists, nurses and radiologists, as competent to take and refer X-rays.  The proposed designation of relevant professionals is based on patient safety and public health considerations as reflected in the advice of the chief medical officer.  Any decision regarding who is designated will be made by the Minister for Health.  It will be easier for practitioners to comply under this legislation, so we are lowering the bar in that regard and streamlining the process.  It is for the Minister for Health as to what professions he designates to comply with this lower threshold and that should be taken up directly with him.  I have received representations on the issue and I appreciate the concerns raised by Members but it is a health matter based on advice from the chief medical officer and is not within my competency.  It is for the Minister for Health to bring in the statutory instrument in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700041#OO00400","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519761900,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Has the Minister discussed it with the Minister for Health?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700042#PP00200","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1519761900,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I have discussed it with him.<\/p>  <p>  There will be no change in policy regarding nuclear vessels.

I strongly support the thrust of the Bill.  Some small issues still remain to be dealt with concerning craft beer, for example, because that industry does not have the advertising power to do the damage alcohol does in society.  I am not against making minor changes to the legislation but we cannot pull back in terms of the big import of the Bill.  We all heard reports in the past week of what happened in Bandon where young people went to a non-drink disco totally tanked up and a field hospital had to be set up to deal with them.  I am not against people having a drink and I am not against people having a good time but to me that was neither; it was a total abuse of alcohol.  To say that advertising, availability, and the society we have created has nothing to do with that is to deny reality.  Let us be honest about it; drinking habits have changed dramatically over the years.  There was a time when young people in particular tended to drink beer and they thought they were big people doing that.  Now it seems that the drink of choice is hard spirits in a totally unregulated situation, often outside of places where there is no control whatsoever.  Therefore, anything that can be done to control such drinking should be done.<\/p>  <p>  There are powerful industries out there that always promote their side of the argument with powerful money.  They say it is good for the economy and they also say they have drink awareness programmes to try to discourage people from over-abusing alcohol.  The reality is the drinks industry is about selling drink and it focuses on young people in particular.  A lot of advertising is about glamorising drink and much of it is ruthless and focused.  The notion that such companies spend millions of euro on the promotion of alcohol and that they are not aware of the harm it does is absolutely false.  We also hear the argument that the purpose of advertising is a brand competition and that they are not trying to encourage people to drink or to drink more is also false.  We know there is a huge problem with alcohol in society.  It is an attitude problem.<\/p>  <p>  We hear time and again about the problems in hospitals.  Anyone who examines the admissions to accident and emergency units at weekends, in particular, or when young people or adults are out \"enjoying\" themselves must recognise that alcohol is a major cause of the problems in hospitals.  We are storing up a massive problem for the future due to the increased habit of drinking hard drinks to excess.  Many young people who think they are healthy will wind up with drink-related conditions affecting the liver, for example, later in life.  The prospect is absolutely frightening.<\/p>  <p>  When I was a Minister of State with some of the same responsibilities as the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, I had many meetings with Sr. Consilio and I visited Cuan Mhuire.  It is only when one listens to people like her or those involved in Hope House that one realises the damage done by alcohol in society.  The people in such places are the ones who seek treatment.  One could ask how many people do not seek treatment.  We know of the damage that is done in families by drink.  We know of the violence that is associated with drink and how many innocent people get hurt by drink.  Despite all of that the drinks lobby tries to lure us into a state of denial and tells us we do not have a problem.  Therefore, the Bill is very timely.  In fact, it is fair to say that it is a pity it has taken so long.<\/p>  <p>  The off-licence industry is a problem.  Anybody who tells me it is not does not know what is going on.  We see young people with massive amounts of drink who are consuming it without any control from parents or from a publican, if they were in a public house or members of the public in the public house.  They have to get the drink somewhere and it tends to be in off-licences.  Therefore, anything we can do to make it more difficult to access drink must be taken on board.<\/p><p>I accept that there are different ways of doing that, including ways that are more or less expensive for the shop owner.  Amendments were made during the debate in the Seanad to cut down on costs, but not to cut down on the effect of the Bill, which has to be to try to make alcohol less visible, less attractive and less normal.<\/p> <p> I wonder what effect it would have on our society if we could reduce the abuse of alcohol by a quarter, which we might think would be a fairly modest target.  What effect would it have on the number of court cases going to court?  What effect would it have on the number of young people getting in trouble with the law for doing absolutely crazy things while drunk and getting criminal convictions, where they should have none, as a consequence?  What difference would it make to the health services?  We are always complaining that health services do not get enough money, but we never ask ourselves how many people add unnecessarily to the cost of providing such services through totally irresponsible behaviour that is encouraged by a very powerful industry.  It is only when all of these factors are weighed up that we realise we need to tackle this issue.<\/p> <p> It was very interesting to listen to the radio the other day and to the two doctors who spoke, who were very reasonable.  The interesting fact that came out was that very few drinks are spiked and that the main spiking of drinks is just adding more and harder alcohol, including spirits.  That is what is happening and we can delude ourselves as much as we want that it is something more sinister.  Usually, the explanations are simpler.<\/p> <p> We must also recognise that this is a very sensitive subject.  Statistics show us that alcohol has been a contributor to suicide in certain cases.  It is something that is very difficult to talk about because so many families have been hurt by suicide.  Currently, there is much talk about reducing the number of car accidents and car fatalities, which, thanks be to God, is well under 200.  However, what we totally ignore is that more than 500 people die by suicide every year and that in an appreciable number of cases alcohol has been a contributory factor.<\/p> <p> The Committee Stage of this Bill will deal with the smaller points by way of minor amendments.  It is a good idea, which I always support, that Bills get a thorough airing and that they are looked at in some detail to see that one is not doing something which will have no benefit.  The labelling of craft beer is an obvious example.  That is not the kind of market to go for anyway because it does not engage in mass advertising.  We must make sure we do not dilute the main and powerful thrust of this Bill.<\/p> <p> I could never understand when in government that we could not seem to introduce minimum pricing.  Arguments were put forward that EU law would not allow it but I understand that has been overcome in Scotland which went ahead, faced it head on and took on the challenge.  That is the most powerful deterrent one could introduce.  Some people will say this will impact the poor but I do not believe that will happen because people have a fixed amount of money and, therefore, it could help them substantially because it could mean less consumption, less damage and a more justifiable reason for not over-indulging in alcohol.<\/p> <p> I am pleased that this Bill has eventually been brought before the House.  We have to face up to the society in which we live and face up to the fact that by standing back we are hurting so many people, both young and old in our society.  We have to stop glorifying as a rite of passage the kind of abuse of alcohol we have seen in more recent decades.  I believe that has to change.  One of the small benefits that came from the downturn was a reduction in alcohol abuse, but that is quickly disappearing again.  We have a major problem with drugs in this country - it is a problem in Dublin and it is now a problem in Galway - but the most pervasive drug that does serious harm in our society is alcohol.  The targeting of where alcohol is available without supervision has to be key to the future.  I spend my Saturday afternoons visiting country pubs.  I am often in pubs for meetings at night.  I can honestly say I do not believe the major issue arises in the supervised and controlled setting of the public house.  Most people will not do in public what they will do in private.  We have many cases of this.<\/p> <p> Many women will accept that a great deal of violence against women is caused by intoxicated men.  That is something we can never forget.  Many of us have come across people in our lives who have been assaulted and worse.  In many such cases, one of the contributory causes has been that the men involved have literally drunk themselves stupid.

When this Bill started off, people were looking to curtail binge drinking and provide for minimum unit pricing.  Those were the objectives, but the Bill has strayed now.  To be honest, it has gone haywire.  The notion of introducing a cancer warning label that would cover one third of the packaging of alcohol products was added to the legislation before Christmas.  I have nothing personal against the Minister of State - I have nothing at all to say to her - but I wonder whether those who make such proposals really know what they are talking about.  Small distilleries and little brewing companies around the country are employing people.  They are giving good employment and competing on the world market with Scotch whisky and other different whiskeys from around the world that do not need to have these cancer labels.  I am pro-jobs.  I do not intend to support this Bill because it will hurt people who are employed in parts of County Kerry like Killarney and Dingle, where they are doing great work.  I believe these measures will do more harm than good.  No other country in the world has introduced mandatory cancer warnings on alcohol products.  We really needed to see if we could reduce binge drinking and reduce the minimum pricing.<\/p><p>However, this is not being done.  If we go back 20 or 25 years, young fellows used to go to a bar with older brothers, parents or uncles and were trained how to drink two or maybe three pints.  They enjoyed the banter and communication with people from the parish or locality.  This no longer happens because young people now drink on one or possibly two nights at the weekend.  It was different in the past because the same closing time applied to all licensed premises.  Nowadays, later closing times apply to a small number of venues in cities and large towns where youngsters and inclined to go for a late drink.  They are not among their own, however, and meet many different people who they do not know.  They are losing out because going out is now an anonymous activity, whereas in the past people went out for the banter and to talk about football or what was going on in the locality or on the local farms.  I do not know how we can get back to that but if we were try to do so, we might achieve something. <\/p> <p> The Bill is being proposed when the Irish beer and whiskey sectors are experiencing a period of promising growth.  They stuck with it for the past eight or nine years and survived.  Now that they are coming out the other end, they are about to be blown out of existence by the proposed cancer warnings on alcohol product labels.  We have a great distillery in Dingle and the Killarney Brewing Company on the Muckross Road.  The brewery's visitor centre attracts tourists every day during the summer and is an attraction for the town.  This Bill will hurt companies such as this.  How can producers compete with producers from countries such as Scotland where cancer warnings are not required on labels for Scotch whisky?  A requirement to place cancer warnings on alcohol product labels will have a damaging impact on small distilleries and breweries that are bringing new products to the market.  The notion that producers should be required to produce a label for the Irish market only will create additional costs for them, particularly small craft brewers and whiskey distillers.  If they are in a position to export, they will have to produce one label for Ireland and another for the rest of the world.  Redesigning labels has associated costs which will add yet more to the costs incurred by small drinks companies that support and create local jobs.<\/p> <p> We must remember that Friday evening does not take long coming for people who have staff to pay.  I know what it is like to be an employer because I have been employing people for years.  Friday evening comes very fast. <\/p> <p> Will the cancer warning labels work?  It is worth considering whether the introduction of such labels will solve our problems with harmful and underage drinking.  We must also balance this with the harm they will do to the industry.  I do not believe they will have any effect on young people because they will soon find out that the product is the same as it was before the label was placed on it.  The measure will hurt exporters, however.<\/p> <p> Focusing on only one health issue is confusing for consumers.  I suggest the Department of Health roll out an education campaign informing people of the recommended drinking guidelines, rather than placing cancer warnings on bottles because the measure is unlikely to work.<\/p> <p> If we removed alcohol completely, people would turn to something else.  They are already turning to drugs.  I wonder if cancer labels are put on drugs in the places they come from.<\/p> <p> The Bill will introduce new rules on alcohol advertisements, including where they can be shown, which is a ridiculous provision.  If people know a bottle of whiskey or wine is behind a curtain in a shop, it will not make a difference but it will harm small shops because they will have to implement the measure in the small space available to them.<\/p> <p> The proposed measures will prevent alcohol companies from including a storyline in advertisements.  This is too strict and will negatively impact the drinks industry.  It means small producers will not be able to gain market share or grow to a sufficient size to export their products.  The advertising restrictions will also make it more difficult for new entrants to bring products to the Irish market.  Evidence shows that these restrictions will cost Irish media &euro;20 million per annum in lost revenue.<\/p> <p> I feel for the businesses that are providing jobs.  Visitor centres attached to whiskey distilleries are an attraction.  I am particularly concerned that the Bill spells trouble for Irish whiskey tourism.  The new measures will impact on advertisements for whiskey distillery visitor centres that contain the name of the brand.  Visitor centre advertisements will not be allowed to contain images of people or use storylines.  Advertisements will be prohibited from train stations and bus stops and from within 200 m of schools and cr&egrave;ches.  I ask the Minister to give special consideration to the impact of the Bill on visitor centres.  I am worried about businesses that are trying to get off the ground and those that have stuck it our for the past eight or nine years and are trying to provide jobs.<\/p> <p> The Bill has strayed from its original purpose.  It has gone off the rails altogether and is losing support for that reason.  We all want to tackle the problems of harmful and underage drinking but extreme legislation is not always good legislation.  I ask the Minister to consider the points I have raised and identify what small changes could be made to the Bill to address these concerns.  Nobody is interested in scuppering the legislation.  The issue is one of making sensible changes that will create balance.  For this reason, I ask the Minister to revisit the Bill.  If the Government were to stick to the original intention of introducing minimum pricing and if it tried to address the issue of teenagers being lured into a small number of large, open venues, we would achieve a better outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700044#RR00200","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519763700,"counter":526,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Motor Insurance: Motion [Private Members]","time":1519763700,"counter":527,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700045#SS00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1519763700,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>recognises that:&mdash; it has been 19 months since the Government first established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and there has been no tangible progress in reducing insurance premiums;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; there are several barriers to obtaining motor insurance in Ireland;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; vehicles that are ten years old, but with a valid National Car Test certificate (NCT), are being deemed uninsurable;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; returning emigrants have difficulty obtaining insurance as driving experience from foreign countries such as the United States of America, Canada, Australia etc. is not taken into consideration;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; drivers with five penalty points are deemed uninsurable by a number of insurance companies, even if the points were gained over a three year period;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; insurance premiums are higher because of insurance fraud, which costs the industry over &euro;200 million every year;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; since Insurance Confidential was established in 2003 by Insurance Ireland, over 9,000 new cases of suspected fraud have been received and investigated to date; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the total amount paid out in motor claims by Insurance Ireland members increased by 23 per cent from 2011 to 2016, while in the same years the amount paid out by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) across all classes of insurance increased by 50 per cent; andcalls on the Government to:&mdash; ensure that the motor insurance sector does not discriminate against individuals with older vehicles that hold a valid NCT, by providing reasonable quotations;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure that the motor insurance sector does not discriminate against returning emigrants by accepting foreign driving experience as valid experience;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; make it mandatory for insurance companies to provide cover to people who have five penalty points or over, as insurance is a legal requirement for all drivers;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; allow people access to the European Union market for insurance that will be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; work towards eradicating the culture of insurance fraud in Ireland, by introducing stricter penalties for those found to be pursuing fraudulent insurance claims;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; introduce an independent assessment board as a means of dealing with claims assessments, to prevent exaggerated and misleading claims being pursued and settled;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure that when accessing claims\/awards, reference is made to best international practice guidelines; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; deliver real transparency on how premiums are calculated and why quotes are refused, with access to a robust independent insurance appeals process.&quot;<\/blockquote><p>I will share time with Deputies Michael Healy-Rae and Harty.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the motion before the House and compliment my colleagues on tabling it.  We could spend the day discussing insurance, including developments in motor and business insurance in recent years.  Motor insurance costs remain at an unacceptably high level and the motion has been tabled by the Rural Independent Group in an effort to secure Government action on several key areas that could go a long way towards improving the picture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700045#SS00400","speaker":"1313"}]
