As Senator Craughwell knows full well, those of us, including the Acting Chair, who are on the transport committee have dealt with this Bill extensively to the point where we have re-engaged again since the Bill began to make its way through this House.<\/p> <p>On the question of expertise, we have engaged with Jim Gavin, who is the director of safety regulation in the IAA.  He presented a series of briefings to us.  He gave us a series of informative and substantive insights into the Bill around the capacity of the IAA, again acknowledging the issue' of peer support and the stakeholders' forum.<\/p> <p>I will refer later to the matter of the vesting day.<\/p> <p>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, the Minister of State and the Members of the House had Kieran Mulvey get involved in the whole process.  That was an important part of engagement with staff.  We were in Shannon.  I could not stress enough my complete admiration for the staff in the aviation centre in Shannon.  The level of pressure and stress and the competence of the staff is mind-blowing.<\/p> <p>To respond to Senator Craughwell's point, we have a body of people who feed into the Department and advise the Minister through various mechanisms.  They informed the Department, the Minister and the Government in arriving where we are today.  The Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA, has also been very engaged with all of us and has made very pertinent points, as have other stakeholders in the whole process.  Therefore, a huge degree of competence and a huge amount of information has gone into producing this Bill.  For the Senator to ask about the competency or advice given to the Minister is a moot point.  If I am wrong I will be happy to retract, but my understanding is that the Department of Transport has a pool of knowledge, including experience-based knowledge.<\/p> <p>We went to the IAA in Shannon, as the Acting Chair knows.  The level of competency at that meeting was quite substantial, to my mind.  The ability to communicate and to inform us on that day could not be questioned.  Is Senator Craughwell saying that the people in the IAA are not qualified or are not competent?

With respect to Senator Buttimer, of course the air traffic control people were excellent.  We are separating them out.  This is part of what is happening in the Bill.  I do not have a problem with what takes place in Shannon.  It was highly expert.<\/p> <p>There are two things that are troubling me today.  The first of these is that I was approached by the very organisation the Bill will cover to lobby me to have the Bill passed.  The AAIU has recommended to the Minister that the Minister separates everybody so they have their own independent aviation experts.  This recommendation was made on 5 November 2021.  The expert is not the IAA.  It is that body which we are trying to regulate.  One of the key findings in the report is the lack of oversight by the Department of Transport of the IAA.  Whether we like it or do not like it, this is the key issue in the AAIU's report.<\/p> <p>Another recommendation is that the Minister for Transport institutes a detailed review of the IAA regulatory and oversight mechanisms to ensure that they are sufficiently robust and comprehensive and that the interface and delineation of responsibilities are clearly defined and understood by the IAA and the entities it regulates.  It is the job of the Department of Transport to regulate the IAA.  It is the job of the IAA to regulate the industry.  We cannot have collusion between the Department and the IAA in order to pass the Bill.  I asked at the outset who in the Department is the qualified aviation expert advising the Minister.  I do not accept that the IAA, which will be regulated by the Bill, can advise the Minister on anything to do with the Bill.  This is not the function of the IAA.<\/p> <p>There is good legislation in the Bill and it is needed.  The point behind it is the debacle that led to Rescue 116 and four brave people being lost at Blackrock Island in County Mayo.  They were lost because of a number of failings.  Those failings occurred right across the system, from the Department to everybody involved in aviation.  The Minister of State was not in position at the time and she holds no responsibility for it.  I am sorry the Bill has taken as long as it has to go through the House.  Surely the Minister of State can see the point being made by the AAIU.  She should have her own independent aviation advice.  I ask her again whether there is an aviation expert on the staff in the Department of Transport.<\/p> <p>I do not doubt any of the things Senator Buttimer referred to with respect to experiential learning and experience with respect to drafting legislation.  What I do have a problem with is that we had an accident that cost four people their lives.  Following that accident 44 recommendations were made.  I have just addressed two of these recommendations.  I am deeply uncomfortable with the fact that I was lobbied by the organisation we are trying to regulate in order to get the Bill passed.  Am I alone in this?  Am I the only person in the room who sees something wrong with this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#C00400","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>On a point of order, and I do not want to have a row-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#C00500","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>It probably is not a point of order but go ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#C00600","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>The Acting Chair is probably right.

The amendments the Government has brought forward are welcome.  There has been a significant shift in thinking, which is helpful.  It might not go as far as I would like but there is an improvement.  I want to put on the record too that I met the Irish Aviation Authority.  I found it a helpful dialogue.  I am not sure it would say anything different.

I am conscious of that report in regard to the tragedy off the Mayo coast and the recommendations there.  I hope that will be dealt with appropriately at a later stage because we must be mindful of all who have lost their lives in this context.  It is also important that the Irish Aviation Authority has the requisite experience, expertise and redress.  It seems to me that the expertise in the Department is more about, or should be more about, oversight, the following of process, auditing and ensuring that the procedures and processes as set out in legislation are followed to the nth degree and that where it exists, best practice from peer review internationally is also brought to bear.

I want to now when I board an aircraft in Dublin Airport that I have a good chance of arriving where I want to go.  I want strong legislation.  This legislation is strong.  We are down to a number of small areas that are delaying this legislation.

Genuinely it was one of the weirdest meetings that I have ever been at.  Literally the representatives of the IAA were trying to convince me that they did not need further regulations or the ability to regulate an industry for which the authority is responsible.  The letter I received from Jim Gavin this week was one of the most bizarre letters I have ever received from a State agency representative in my 14 years as a public representative.<\/p> <p>I wish to speak to amendment No. 1 first, and then separately to amendment No. 2.  This proposal is to ask in legislation to adopt a licenceholders' forum which is distinctly different from a stakeholders' forum.  Let us be clear about it.  The licenceholders are the people in this country who have to go through major professional training to make sure that they are licenceholders and that they have the authority, expertise and professionalism to be able to guide the aviation industry and carry out its functions.  What they are trying to find is a space where in law they have a forum that will allow them to discuss the ongoing issues they have with regard to safety in the Irish aviation industry, to discuss collectively as licenceholders and those responsible for it how they will address those issues to make it compelling for every licenceholder to attend those meetings.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That includes the IAA representatives, our airlines, unions and every licence holder with a stake in ensuring our aeroplanes and helicopters fly under the safest possible conditions under legislation.  We have been talking about this for many months because the IAA does not want to put the stakeholder or licence holder forum in legislation.  It attempted to convince us that it would have the meetings anyway and that there was absolutely no need for compellability.  To my mind, we have had in the past ten years an industry that has conducted meetings, albeit very rarely.  That serious major players in the Irish market choose not to attend those meetings means one is talking to oneself.  If there is no compellability applying to everyone with a serious stake in the industry, I do not know what we are at.<\/p><p>We as legislators are attempting to give a regulatory authority, a State agency whose sole job is to ensure the safety not only of service providers in the industry but also the 2 million-plus Irish citizens who will use the services of the industry this year, powers of regulation.  It does not seem to want to have the laws to regulate the industry; it wants to be able to do so on a wing and a prayer - excuse my pun.  I find that really worrying.  That is why I believe it is really important for us to talk about putting on a statutory footing a licence holders forum that compels attendance on the part of those responsible for the safety of aviation.  I am talking about sitting at the table with the regulatory authority responsible for ensuring safety legislation is adhered to and about everyone operating openly and transparently in front of each other, with each other and for each other.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1 sets out the mechanism for the licence holders forum exactly as we would like to see it.  It specifies who should attend, how often meetings should be held and how often and where the minutes should be published.  This is so everything discussed and proposed by the airlines, unions and anybody with a licence and vested interest in ensuring the safety of our aviation industry, including the IAA, will be dealt with openly and transparently and not on the basis of a wing and a prayer and a nudge and a wink indicating there might be a meeting this year or as soon as we can get around to it, having regard to the language and the amendments from the Government.  I ask the Minister of State and, indeed, the officials who have been advising her to seriously respect the merits of this amendment and think seriously about those who are genuinely seeking to be assured, be they workers and regulators in the industry or ordinary pundits like me who will be getting on an aeroplane at some point soon, so those responsible for keeping us safe will be integral to that task and do their job in the open and in the public eye.  That is what the first amendment is about.<\/p><p>My second point is about the licence holders charter that will arise from a number of meetings and govern how everybody must conduct themselves and their business.  Attendance by everybody at the forum is so important in the first place because, if people are not in attendance, they will not have an input into the charter.  In that case, they will have a get-out-of-jail clause implying they do not actually have to adhere to the charter.  As proposed, there would be nothing on a statutory footing and those who did not attend would not know what was said of them.  The regulatory authority is not looking for any regulatory powers to enforce what is decided at the forum through the charter.  I have believed from the very beginning that we need to put the licence holders forum on a statutory footing.  More important, we need to ensure that the licence holders charter is a living, breathing document that can be amended at every single meeting of the forum and that new ideas can be suggested to ensure we are safe every single time we go up in a helicopter, aeroplane or other such aircraft.  We must ensure everybody is compelled by law to live up to the standards therein.  The only way we can do that is by putting both of these amendments on the legislative footing and guaranteeing that the IAA has the authority, teeth and backbone to ensure all our airlines do exactly what they are advised and what they are obliged to do. Every other union or licence holder would be singing off the same sheet.  If we cannot achieve this in a public and transparent way, we must question why we are doing any of this at all.  At present, there is no compellability, and there are no licence obligations if there is no legislation to empower any airline or licence holder to do what the IAA tells it if they do or do not show up to a meeting.<\/p><p>We are either serious about safety in aviation or we are not.  What we do today in considering this legislation is a marker to show we should be serious.  If we do not do what I say, I really wonder about the point of having a regulatory authority that does not want to have the legal status to regulate an industry that is so crucial.  As Senator Craughwell has said, it literally comes down to the difference between life and death.  We are mourning four people, and their families will never get over their loss.  What we do today and in this legislation should be a mark of respect for the service those people gave to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#D01400","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I would like to hear the Minister of State's views on putting compellability on a statutory footing.  The IALPA position on meetings has validity.  The Joint Committee on Health has quarterly meetings with the Minister and HSE.  These are to be built into its work programme.  Therefore, one knows there is a meeting every quarter.  Why is there reluctance to commit to the meetings in the case in question?<\/p> <p>I derived great hope from the correspondence we received from Mr. Jim Gavin, particularly on the commitment to fostering the development, maintenance and improvement of aviation safety and supporting the development of a positive aviation-safety culture within the aviation community.  That should not be lost.  I appreciate that we are all coming to this with the best motivation.<\/p> <p>Let us consider the example of the European aviation market and the way it has been transformed, thanks in the main to Mr. O'Leary of Ryanair, which has made flying cheaper predominantly.  In this regard, the Leader has rightly spoken about her ability to go up in a helicopter or aeroplane.  Maybe I am wrong but I believe our record on air-travel safety stands up.  Given that we have opened up air travel, the world is now much smaller place for us as an island nation.  The whole issue is that there is a commitment in the context of the aviation authority.<\/p> <p>With regard to the licence holders and stakeholders forum, the Minister of State might tease matters out again.  To give her and her Department credit, they have moved.  Senator Dooley spoke about the path that the legislation took.  One would have to give the Minister of State credit in the context of the engagement.  I have no issue with IALPA, the IAA or the Department of Transport briefing and engaging with us.

If one peruses the air accident investigation reports on any air accident one will see that the level of detail that is available is incredible.  I mean if a part is replaced on any aircraft that flies then one can trace it all the way to the very machine that made it, which gives people confidence.  I have no difficulty with the Irish Aviation Authority briefing us.  Indeed, the IAA has a statutory obligation to advise the Minister but I am not sure that it goes as far as telling the Minister how to write legislation or what legislation should be written.<\/p> <p>I believe these amendments will do two things.  They will ensure that meetings take place and are scheduled and will provide us with written reports, which I hope that the public will have access to, and overall will increase the level of confidence that we have in the aviation industry.  I ask the Minister of State to look at the amendments from that perspective.  It means that someone like herself who flies can have confidence knowing that the licenceholders meet on a regular basis, their issues are taken on board and the minutes of the meetings are available, which all gives confidence that the system is going right.<\/p> <p>I accept the bona fides of Captain Jim Gavin.  However, he may take up another job tomorrow, so the commitment that he gave would no longer be relevant so who will take over?  I give that as an example of why we seek this provision in legislation.  If we get that in legislation, then we are sure this will always happen.  It has been said that if the same system that operates in aviation was applied in an operating theatre then fewer people would die.

As others have asked, if personnel change will we still have the same guarantee?<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 2 concerns the licenceholders' charter, which I do not think is addressed in the Government's amendments.  I understand that when anybody raises a concern there is no prescribed formula for how it will be addressed.  We gave the example of one incident where IALPA reported a concern to the Irish Aviation Authority but did not get a response, was not told when it would get a response and there was no interaction.  IALPA compared that situation with what happens with its British counterpart where a response is given within two weeks and there must be a response.  We can learn from best practice in other jurisdictions.  The reason we mentioned issues concerning the licenceholders' charter was that it would mandate the way the IAA interacts with IALPA, ensure there is proper consultation on proposed new regulations and queries would be answered.<\/p> <p>The Government's amendment does not specify the right of a licenceholder to get an answer to a technical query or to be given an explanation of an interpretation of a regulation.  My understanding is that the right to a response is limited to licensing issues.  The letter from Captain Gavin refers to the licenceholders' ability to submit specific queries to the IAA but his letter does not confirm that they have a right to get a reply, which is an issue that has been raised by many of us.  We can all raise concerns until we are blue in the face but if one is not going to get a response then that is problematic.  I ask the Minister of State to explain why the scheduling of meetings, and the interaction with IALPA and the IAA cannot be put into legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#F01000","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I will try to answer all of the queries and I will go into some of the other details after so ask everyone to please bear with me.<\/p><p>I cannot<b><\/b>accept Amendments Nos. 1 and 2.

However, as Senators are aware, there has been an extensive dialogue with Senators, the IAA and the pilot's union, which is IALPA, on these and other amendments.  Having taken the views of the Senators on board, I propose Government amendment No. c4a, which I hope addresses the concerns raised in respect of the establishment of a forum and licenceholders' charter.

The purpose of the aviation stakeholders' forum will be as follows: to promote the sharing of best practice aviation safety initiatives; to engage with the IAA on matters relating to the regulation of aviation safety; to elicit views on proposals for EU and national regulatory changes in terms of aviation safety; and to enable the sharing of aviation lessons learned, best aviation practices, aviation safety performance indicators and the provision of information on specific aviation safety risks.<\/p> <p>The Government amendment requires that the IAA publishes a licenceholders' charter that sets out the standards of engagement that will be undertaken by the IAA with the holders of the licences.  The new aviation regulator has acknowledged the need to provide a forum and a licenceholders' charter for the licensing community, and the aviation regulator is fully committed to same.  Additionally, under section 77 of the Bill, whenever requested by a committee of one or both Houses of the Oireachtas, the aviation regulator can be called to account for the performance of the IAA's functions, and have regard to any recommendations made on such, including in terms of these measures.<\/p> <p>In bringing forward this amendment I am making a very significant concession in light of the issues that have been pressed.  I think that we can all agree that there is no difference in substance between us in these matters.<\/p> <p>The aviation stakeholders' forum will provide a means by which any safety relevant issues can be brought forward for people's attention, and teased out in a consultative and collaborative manner.  This includes the issues relating to crew peer support programmes, which is important to IALPA.<\/p> <p>In conclusion, Government amendment No. c4a will address the substantive issues that have been raised by Senators and IALPA, which feels that in the past their members' voices were not heard by the IAA.  I, therefore, hope this proposal can be accepted.<\/p> <p>An issue arose concerning the distinction between a licenceholders' forum and a stakeholders' forum.  I will expand on the matter because it will clarify the need for a stakeholders' forum.  This was a substantive issue that was raised by Senator Doherty's amendment.  It is that distinction between an aviation stakeholder as opposed to a licenceholder.<\/p> <p>Under the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, regulatory safety system, which concerns Regulation 2018\/1139 and associated implementing rules, there are a number of identifiable stakeholders.  I will cut to the chase before going into great detail by saying that the term \"licenceholder\" would lead to the membership of the forum being too narrow and exclude, for example, airlines and airports.  The identifiable stakeholders are as follows: licenceholders, which mean individual pilots, air traffic controllers and aircraft mechanics; certificate holders, which are organisations that have been audited and deemed to meet the safety regulatory requirements, such as airlines, EU certified airports such as Cork, Shannon and Dublin Airports, maintenance providers and approved training organisations; and declared organisations, which are organisations that make a declaration to the IAA that they comply with specific rules such as declared training organisations, non-commercial complex aircraft operators, and special operations like aircraft used for specialised activities such as agriculture or surveying.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In addition, under national regulations, other terms, such as \"permissions\", \"approved organisations\" and \"people operating under permits\", are used.  By using the term, \"licence holders forum\" in primary legislation, we may inadvertently limit participation to just pilots, air traffic controllers and mechanics, with no scope for others who would have an important input into and roles to play in respect of aviation safety.<\/p><p>I consulted with the IAA, and my expectation is that the membership of the aviation stakeholder forum will be drawn from: recognised aviation sector trade unions, for example, IALPA and F&oacute;rsa; certified aviation organisations, such as air operator certificate holders, certified airports, approved training organisations, and certified maintenance organisations; representative bodies, such as the Federation of Aerospace Enterprises in Ireland, FAEI; recognised aviation stakeholder groups, such as the International Air Transport Association, IATA, for airlines, and the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations, IFALPA, and the European Cockpit Association, ICA, for pilots; declared organisations, which are those organisations that make a declaration to the IAA that they comply with specific rules; and other interested parties, such as the Air Accident Investigation Unit, AAIU, AirNav Ireland and EASA.  As the focus of the forum is on aviation safety, the inclusion of representation from the areas of the travel trade, tourism, hotels and passenger rights is not envisaged.  I hope this provides some perspective on this issue.<\/p><p>While I cannot accept the amendment, I will reflect on the points raised before Report Stage.  There were questions regarding the scheduling of meetings.  The Government amendment states that the IAA determines how often this forum will meet.

I am 50 years old and I have never in my lifetime seen a regulatory authority refuse powers in the way we are seeing the IAA refuse powers in the context of this legislation.  It is astounding.  The Minister of State said that she wanted the forum to be broader than just licence holders and she suggested some people whom she thinks should be there.  To my mind, they would dilute the conversation and the charter that would arise from it.  Therefore, I would like the Minister of State to reiterate exactly who she would like to be there and what input she thinks they would have into a safety charter for the licence holders to operate under.  <\/p> <p>I would also like another explanation.  The Minister of State also referred almost to a separate entity.  I refer to a situation where if we do not have what we have been seeking in legislation, in respect of there being transparency and the ability to compel compliance with the legislation, that either or both Houses of the Oireachtas could compel representatives of the IAA to come before us in a committee to allow us to ask questions at any stage.  Given, however, that the IAA does not answer the questions posed by the people it is regulating, and ignores them, I would like to know on what basis or in the context of what legislation it will be possible for either House of the Oireachtas to compel representatives of the IAA to come before us to answer questions and to be responsive to the Members of both Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#G03500","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Returning to the stakeholder forum the Minister of State spoke of, if we were to call a meeting of that group we would probably need a hotel to accommodate the representatives from all the different agencies mentioned.  The key thing is that pilots have concerns about lighting at airports when they are landing and taking off, as well as concerns about various other things.  The Minister of State will also recall the destruction of a Concorde aircraft as it attempted to take off from an airport in Paris.  A piece of metal on the runway apparently punctured the fuel tank and caused that aircraft to be lost.  Regarding pilots and mechanics, the forum we are recommending in amendment No. 1 deals specifically with those working at the coalface in this regard.  I have no difficulty with the Minister of State setting up a separate stakeholder forum that would allow for much broader discussion, but the licence holders forum is a key part of any safety mechanism.  I am not going to harp on about the lack of expertise in the Department, but it would be good if the Minister of State just said she did not have anyone who is a qualified expert in the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#G03600","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Regarding the forum, what is required here are people who have expertise in aviation safety.

It provides that the body of the licence holders forum would include any air carrier holding an air carrier operating licence; any recognised trade union or recognised stakeholder group - which would include IASA - representing 50 or more persons authorised to hold a commercial pilot's licence or airline pilot's transport licence; any recognised trade union or stakeholder group representing 50 or more persons licensed or authorised by the IAA other than holders of commercial pilot licences or airline transport pilot licences.

We know that since the Germanwings murder-suicide crash in 2015, it is recognised that pilots need to be provided with support programmes to deal with personal and mental health issues, and this requirement is mandated by the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, and came into force in February 2021.  IALPA has provided pilot support programmes since the 1970s, which aim to help pilots keep their licences while supporting the pilots and the airlines to resolve difficult personal issues.  However, this group only operates under Aer Lingus.  Some other airlines have been setting up their own programmes but they are not all conforming to the same standards.<\/p><p>Our amendment is looking to have a single national peer support programme forum under the aegis of the IAA.  One of the key differences between our amendment and the proposal by the Government is the particular language under the proposed new provision in paragraph (iv) at section 65B(1)(d)(iv).  The Minister of State might clarify a question on the &quot;promotion, by accountable managers of recognised organisations of aircraft crew members, of the use of the programme and trust in it&quot;.  Who are these accountable managers?  Are they the managers of pilot unions or the managers of the airline?  Another issue on which we would like clarification is the review.  Pilots have the right to access a peer support programme even if it is not a peer support programme within their own airline, and that is provided for under the EASA regulations.

Part of the rationale behind a peer support group is that people are dealing with others of similar qualifications to themselves and dealing with people who can treat them in a confidential manner, and they can deal with people who are one step removed from the management of the organisation.  Let us consider a pilot who is suffering a particular mental health issue.  How comfortable would any of us be if we had to pick up the phone this morning and say &ldquo;I really cannot fly today.  My state of mental health would not facilitate that.&rdquo;  How many of us would be willing to ring, knowing we were going to speak to a member of management to tell them that?  In these circumstances, people need to be in a protected zone, in a zone where people of similar qualification and similar employment to themselves can understand the issues.  Our amendment is very clear about providing all of the supports that are required.  People need to know that whatever they say to their peer support group, it is not going to be transmitted to management and that help will be found for such a person and he or she may be put in the direction of psychological support and so on.  To go back to Senator Boylan's point about accountable managers, the managers have no place in the peer support group, none whatsoever, as far as I am concerned.  This is about employees at the same level dealing with employees, dealing with their issues and making sure we do not have a situation where they put people's lives at risk.<\/p> <p>Yesterday we had the T&aacute;naiste in the House to speak about the Sick Leave Bill, which he introduced in the House.  One of the points made yesterday was that people went to work during Covid-19 purely because they were afraid they would lose their income or afraid of the damage it would do to them and, in so doing, they risked other people's lives.  A pilot who feels, for one reason or another, that he or she cannot take to the skies today needs to have a safe space where they can talk through their issues and explain their problems.  They then need to know that they will not be required to fly, their job will not be at risk and, ultimately, their colleagues will cover for them and make sure they are given time and space to deal with the issues that they feel prevent them from flying safely.<\/p> <p>Let us remember that when one of these things takes off, there are several hundred people whose lives depend on two people up in the cockpit who are awake and who are cognisant of all of the dangers that are involved when an aircraft is in the sky.  These things fly at several hundred miles per hour.  During our trip to Shannon, as Senator Buttimer will recall, we all took a stab at being air traffic controllers.  At the speed these things fly, a split second can cause a disaster.  From that point of view, I am really strong on the issue of peer support not having any relationship to management, other than to be able to say to them that, for example, Gerard Craughwell will not be flying today.

The whole purpose of us doing this legislation, apart from splitting the functions of the IAA, is to try to make aviation safer.  It does not sound like rocket science.  An enormous part of making the world of aviation safer is to make sure the people who actually run it are mindful of their responsibility.  One of the tragedies we saw in Europe a number of years ago gave rise to the need for EU Regulation 2018\/1042 to be implemented by the European Commission.  I am relating this part of my contribution because it concerns me that a written communication from the Department tells us the reason the Department does not feel that crew peer support should be in primary legislation is because it is already regulated by EU Regulation 2018\/1042.  The understanding of the Department is that airlines are responsible for putting in place peer support programmes for their own flight crew.  However, when we actually read the regulation, it states that an operator shall enable, facilitate and ensure access to a proactive and non-punitive programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#M00600","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655368200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655368200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an Seanad ar fionra&iacute; ar 11.30 a.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ar me&aacute;n lae.<br \/><br \/>Sitting suspended at 11.30 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1655368200,"counter":169,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#Q00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re arrangements for the sitting of the House on Tuesday, 21 June, Wednesday, 22 June and Thursday, 23 June 2022, without debate; No. 2, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Bill 2022 &ndash; All Stages to be taken at 1.15 p.m. and to conclude at 3.15 p.m. and the proceedings on Second Stage shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 58 minutes with the time allocated to the opening remarks of the Minister not to exceed eight minutes, all Senators not to exceed six minutes and the Minister to be given no less than eight minutes to reply to the debate, Committee and Remaining Stages to be taken immediately thereafter and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.15 p.m. by the putting of one question from the Chair which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by Government; No. 3, motion regarding the Earlier Signature of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Bill 2022, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 2 without debate; No. 4, Planning and Development (Built Heritage Protection) Bill 2022 - Second Stage, to be taken at 3.15 p.m. or on the conclusion of No. 3, whichever is the latter, with the time allocated to this debate not to exceed two hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#Q00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach.  At this time of the year we are regularly approached and briefed by non-governmental organisations, unions and so forth.  Two very important engagements took place yesterday.  One was with the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO.  We all know the sacrifices teachers and young people made during the pandemic.  One of the legacies of the pandemic should not only be a properly funded health system but also a properly funded education system.  The INTO made a number of very solid proposals on class sizes and on the restoration of posts of responsibility.  A moratorium was introduced in 2010 in respect of posts of responsibility and the appointment of new such posts within schools.  We all know how important administration work is these days because it takes up so much of all of our time.  It is high time that moratorium was lifted and that a proper restoration takes place of the necessary supports that schools need.  The INTO also has some very interesting proposals in the whole area of mental health.  I call, therefore, for a debate on education at some stage, if possible this side of the summer recess.<\/p> <p>There was also a very important briefing in the audiovisual room which many colleagues attended yesterday afternoon given by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland on the need for nurses, whether that is for multiple sclerosis, MS, or Parkinson's disease, and for those nurses to be available to advise people on living as full and as healthy a life as possible.  There is a very significant deficit in respect of the number of nurses in those areas that are available on the ground to visit people at home, to take phone calls and so on.  A very powerful presentation was made by a 22-year-old girl who suffers from epilepsy on how such a resource would make a very significant difference to her being able to live a proper, independent life.  Some 30 nurses are being asked for but more than 100 are needed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to make a significant dent in that and in the upcoming budget I sincerely hope we see specific funding for neurology nurses so they can carry out there jobs.<\/p><p>As a final point, it is great news University Hospital Limerick is going to have a proper diabetic clinic with properly-trained staff to carry out the necessary work.

It is a very important day in Dublin, Ireland and indeed across the world now.  The final life-affirming words are not \"... yes I said yes I will Yes\" but in fact \"Trieste-Zurich-Paris 1914-1921\".  The most Dublin of Dublin novels was actually written on the Continent and as we know Joyce was very deliberately European and a very proud European.  He lived on mainland Europe for most of his life and was very much influenced by European writers and indeed European politics.<\/p> <p>The question of what it means to be European is a theme that is going to be explored during the Irish presidency of the Council of Europe.  On that note, it was great to see the bureau of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, CLARA, meeting in Tralee in the Cathaoirleach's home county earlier this week at the invitation of Councillor Jimmy Moloney, Mayor of Kerry County Council and head of the Irish delegation to the CLARA.  I had the opportunity to join the attendees on Tuesday night and can attest to both the hospitality and the organisational skills of Kerry County Council and the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG.  Well done to all involved.  The 24 international visitors went back with a very positive view of Ireland, and of course, of Kerry.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise an issue relating to J1 visas.  I never had the opportunity to avail of one myself but younger brothers and sisters did and I have always been jealous of that fact.  It is the chance of a lifetime for young students.  They are able to go to America to work, live, experience another culture, have fun and of course to explore and travel there.  There are different ways of getting the J1 visa but many students opt to go through USIT.  A quote on its website says: \"It can be difficult trying to get all the paperwork before you go, but USIT take all the hassle out and keep things smooth\".  That is absolutely not happening this year.  It is a disgrace to hear what young people are being subjected to.  One young person I know has changed flights four times, has paid accommodation and still does not have that because when they had their appointment with the US Embassy, USIT had not sent on the paperwork.  The visa was subsequently refused.  I am not blaming the American Embassy for that because obviously that is completely outside our jurisdiction but there are many hundreds of young people who have been completely let down by USIT.  We need to call it out and we need to be in contact with the company.  Maybe that is something the Deputy Leader can do because at this stage summer has started for the students.<\/p> <p>Briefly, I have a brief point to make on the short hop zones for commuter areas such as Newbridge.  I have raised this before.  It concerns the price differential between Newbridge and Sallins.  The price is &euro;3.60 from Sallins and &euro;10.60 from Newbridge just to go in to Heuston Station.  When we are talking about euro per kilometre or indeed the amount of minutes spent it is obviously ridiculous.  It costs the same to go to Mullingar or Carlow as it does to go to Newbridge.  We need to have a Leap cap, a fare cap and we also need a situation where the short hop zone is extended, or indeed a medium hop zone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#R00200","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a number of issues.  This week the Women's Aid Annual Impact Report 2021 was published.  I find the contents of it shocking.  Its findings are deeply disturbing.  We have a persistent and profound problem in Ireland with violence against women.  I will quote some of the statistics.  According to Women's Aid, 33,831 disclosures of abuse were made during 2021.  This represents a deterioration on previous years and may be associated in some way with Covid.  It means there were 100 cases of domestic abuse every day.  Every 15 minutes a domestic abuse incident takes place.  That is 24-7 and 365 days a year.  In 28,096 cases the targets of this abuse are women.  That is one per hour.  Every hour, 24-7, a woman is abused or targeted in some way in this Republic.  There were 5,735 cases of violence against children.  That also represents approximately one per case per hour on a 24-7 basis.  I am sorry, it is one assault on a woman every 15 minutes and one assault on a child every hour.  We have a major problem with the way we treat women and children.  We have a history of it going back to the mother and baby homes.  We treat our citizens with contempt.  This is something I will return to next week in relation to the broader issue of abuse and harm to children in this country.  We also had more than 400 disclosure of rape to Women's Aid during 2021.  That is, every single day in this Republic a woman is raped in the home, which is supposed to be a place of safety - for those who have homes.<\/p> <p>In that context, I return to a subject I also find very disturbing.  That is the broader societal context.  It has come to my attention that the Defence Forces, under the Defence Act 1954, continue to investigate and try cases of sex assault.  I got a clarification that in sex assault cases where both the perpetrator and the victim are Defence Forces members and the alleged offence occurred on military property, under the Defence Act 1954, the perpetrator is usually tried by court martial.  That is completely unacceptable.  That is akin to the system in which the church dealt internally with its own abusers and rapists of children.  We cannot allow the Defence Forces to investigate themselves in that matter.  I am aware of many cases of serious sex assaults on both male and female members where the charges are broken down into lesser section 168 charges under the Defence Act and these are minor administrative charges.  As a consequence, they are masking and concealing the actual level of the problem within the Defence Forces.  This also has the effect of sex offenders in our armed forces then not being subject to the provisions of the Sex Offenders Act.  I would therefore like a debate in the House.  I would like to know how many sex offenders tried by court martial in our Defence Forces over the last 22 years since I drew attention to this have been notified to the sex offenders register because I am also aware of rapists in the Army who were not properly dealt with and then went on to rape women in the broader community.<\/p> <p>The Defence Forces purport to defend the State against external and internal aggression.  If it is not a safe place for 51% of the population it is not fit for that purpose.  We really need to draw attention to this.  In conclusion, I raised 22 years ago that all matters of sexual assault within our Army, Naval Service and Air Corps should be investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I raised this 22 years ago and it has not changed.  They are still doing it internally and still covering it up.  This is not just a case of \"me too\", but a case of \"we too\".  In the context of the broader societal problem and in the specific case of the Defence Forces, each of us has a responsibility to bring pressure to bear on the Minister for Defence, the Secretary General of the Department and the General Staff to straighten up and fly right in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#R00300","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I agree fully with Senator Clonan's remarks and especially his closing ones.

Members will know this is a long-term call that has been made since well before my time in the Oireachtas, and it has been led by civic society in the North but also by diaspora groups and networks throughout the world.  It is also a programme for Government commitment, and the Government said just a number of months ago that it planned to hold that referendum before its term ends.  If it is serious about that, I encourage it to introduce this legislation, whether in this House or the Lower House.  There is nothing negative or regressive about enfranchising citizens with the most basic of entitlements, and that is an entitlement to vote for the President.<\/p><p>I always find it deeply frustrating when, every St. Patrick's Day, Government representatives travel the world and rightly acknowledge our diaspora and encourage further investment from diaspora networks around the world, yet will not enfranchise them with that vote, when they have the ability and the opportunity to do so.  I again call for that legislation to be moved.<\/p><p>Alongside that, given the pandemic and everything else, we have not had statements from the Minister with responsibility for the diaspora in this House in this Seanad.  I believe it would be timely, right and appropriate that we would hear about supports for our diaspora community, particularly older and more vulnerable Irish citizens, as communities emerge from isolation and from the pandemic.  Diaspora networks and community centres are vital in the work they do and we support them.  I would like to hear what the Government is doing in that regard.<\/p><p>In closing, I call for statements on Palestine.  I attended a very hard-hitting briefing hosted by Senator Frances Black yesterday, with Hagai El-Ad, who is the executive director of B&rsquo;Tselem, Israel's premier human rights organisation, and Raji Sourani, who is a director of the Palestinian Center for Human Rights in Gaza.  Unfortunately, I was not able to attend all of it.  We say very often in regard to Palestine and the apartheid regime that is being implemented against Palestinians that we could not help but be moved, but there is a part of me that is tired of being moved about this and tired of having to extend my sympathies and solidarity.  As individual parliamentarians but, more importantly, collectively, as an Oireachtas, and in particular with the Government&rsquo;s position on the UN Security Council and the limited time it has left, we want to hear from the Minister for Foreign Affairs what the Government is doing to support Palestinians who are suffering and enduring apartheid.  We want to hear what it is doing to challenge the brutality of the Israeli regime on the world stage, when it is so flagrantly implementing that apartheid regime and so flagrantly in breach of international law and all accepted conventions.  I call for that and I have no doubt Senator Black will elaborate on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#R00400","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I sympathise with the colleagues and friends of Jo Cox, whose sixth anniversary is today.  A quote from Jo Cox before she was tragically and brutally murdered by a fascist was, &ldquo;We are far more united and have far more in common than that which divides us.&rdquo;  We all know and understand that whipping up fear and hate in a political context can lead to tragic consequences.  On the sixth anniversary of her death, when the British Government is trying to do something very similar to distract from parties during lockdown, it is important that we remember her.<\/p> <p>I want to raise a very important issue that is affecting a number of people in Dublin city, which is the lack of taxis at night-time and in the evening.  It is estimated there are 20% fewer taxis on the road and reports are coming back of people being unable to get taxis at night when walking home in very dangerous conditions, with women walking home by themselves because they have not been able to get access to taxis at night-time.  Taxis are an essential part of our public transport and public service infrastructure.  At the time of the fuel crisis, we gave hauliers &euro;100 per week to help with fuel costs under the emergency support scheme for hauliers.  We have no scheme in place for the rising costs associated with driving taxis to the extent that we see many people leaving the industry.  This is having a knock-on effect on our nightlife within Dublin city.  I would also like to see the extension of 24-hour buses and bus routes.  In lieu of that, taxis are an essential public service for people getting home safely at night.  It is reaching crisis point.  Something is going to happen to somebody in the evening or the night-time because of the lack of taxis on our roads.  I call for an emergency debate to see what the Government can do to financially support taxi drivers coming back into operation with their taxis, thereby ensuring that people are able to get home safely in the evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#S00200","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I thank the Oireachtas Members who attended a briefing I hosted yesterday with two of the most experienced and courageous human rights defenders in Israel and Palestine.  I was delighted to see so many people there.  We had Hagai El-Ad, the executive director of B&rsquo;Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and Raji Sourani, the director of the Palestinian Center for Human Rights.  They both travelled to Ireland to speak about the ongoing Israeli assault on Palestinian human rights and Israel&rsquo;s criminal practice of apartheid.  I want to give huge thanks to Tr&oacute;caire and Christian Aid for making their trip possible and for their diligent work on this issue.<\/p><p>Both men spoke powerfully about their vision of Ireland as a global icon of resistance to colonialism and as a champion of human rights.  The identification between the Irish and Palestinian people is potent and beautiful.  However, they did not mince their words.  Because of Ireland&rsquo;s history and its professed position as an advocate for the rights of small nations, particularly on the UN Security Council, they expect a lot from us.  I really believe that we are letting them down.  The silence is deafening.<\/p><p>They spoke about their desire to see the occupied territories Bill pass and for Ireland to use its position on the world stage to describe Israeli human rights abuses adequately and accurately.  While last year&rsquo;s motion condemning the <i>de facto <\/i>annexation of Palestinian territory was a welcome first step, it is time for Ireland to follow the established consensus of the international human rights community and recognise Israel as an apartheid state.<\/p><p>We have had this conversation before but Government figures remain elusive and defensive.  They are keenly aware that the Government&rsquo;s muted approach to this issue is sharply out of step with Irish public opinion.  The Government might need to keep an eye on public opinion because it is not listening to the people on this issue.  The Taoiseach, when pressed, declared that it was &ldquo;unhelpful&rdquo; to use the term &quot;apartheid&quot;.  This was roundly rebutted by Hagai El-Ad, who said it is actually unhelpful for the Taoiseach to undermine the experiences of Palestinians living under Israeli apartheid and the work of human rights organisations on these issues.  I ask the Taoiseach, with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, whether they will consider this use of language in light of this critique from one of Israel&rsquo;s most eminent human rights experts and the growing research produced by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and B&rsquo;Tselem that unequivocally proves the existence of apartheid in Israel-Palestine.<\/p><p>A crime against humanity is being committed in plain sight, enabled by a conspiracy of silence among Western nations.  Will Ireland lead on this issue and live up to our history and our stated values, or will we ignore the Palestinian people when they ask us to stand up for their rights and their humanity?  This is a moral and political test that we cannot afford to fail.  The Government must listen to the Irish people going forward or it will be in trouble.  An anti-apartheid campaign will happen but the Government is not listening to what the people are saying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#S00300","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I agree with everything Senator Black has just said.

Today, the streets of Glasthule will be closed down for Cavistons and other businesses in the area like the Wilton Gallery, Mitchell &amp;amp; Son, 64 Wine and the restaurants to put on great festivities and readings from <i>Ulysses<\/i>.

To return to my point, part of the President's comment was very welcome and part of his comment the bishop described as far-fetched and unhelpful.  When I spoke to the bishop, he was very generous about President Higgins and said &ldquo;I do not really blame him.&rdquo;  However, the Nigerian Government is pushing an analysis that seeks to portray these atrocities as happening in the context of disputes between tribal people over land.  As the bishop pointed out, every month Catholic priests are being kidnapped and it costs a fortune to ransom them back.  It is not happening to imams.  There are, of course, issues that are fite fuaite.  Frequently, disputes over land resources and disputes between tribes cotton on to religious differences but, at the end of the day, and here is the point, if we describe people as victims as well as perpetrators of atrocities in the same breath, then our words lose the power to condemn and bring about change.<\/p> <p>The bishop also said he would be only too delighted if the President and his advisers wanted to get into some kind of dialogue where the context could be explained.  I can tell the House that Christian leaders in Nigeria are very worried that the Government in that country is looking the other way and perhaps even facilitating armed extremist Muslim terrorists, who may have land interests but are also motivated by religious hatred.  That issue needs to be opened up, just as much as we open up the horrors that are going on in Ukraine.  Just because it is Africa, just because it is further away, we must be not be ignorant, vague or bland in our assessment of what is going on.<\/p> <p>In conclusion, I will say this.  Our President makes fantastic comments from time to time and he did so again on housing, but when he or, indeed, his predecessor, Mrs. McAleese, gets it wrong, there needs to be something better coming from the press office than a doubling down.  If an error is pointed out in good faith, it is great leadership if we show the capacity to say &ldquo;Yes, I did not get that quite right and I am willing to amend my hand.&rdquo;  Our President does well.  He would do even better if he was capable of doing that from time to time and, indeed, so would all of us.<\/p> <p>I conclude my intervention by asking for a debate.  This is not having a go at anybody.  I want a debate about what is happening in Nigeria.  I want a debate about the persecution of Christian and other religious minorities but, in particular, the horrors of what is going on in Nigeria at the moment must be ventilated.  We must get our embassies putting pressure on the Nigerian Government to talk honestly about what is going on and to hear our representations about what it needs to do in order to protect religious freedom and protect people from tribes that are out to ravage them, burn people and kill people in their churches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#T01100","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Yesterday, I attended Mental Health Reform&rsquo;s online publication of a report, My LGBTI+ Voice Matters.  It is an extensive piece of research which looks at the experiences of the gay, lesbian and trans community within our mental health services.  One statistic that certainly stands out is that 19% of those who access mental health services in Ireland identify as lesbian, gay or trans, so one in five of our mental health service users identify as LGBT.  The report makes a number of recommendations around improving mental health services but in particular around building the LGBT capacity of those who work within mental health service providers.  It is a very useful report.  This being Pride month, the whole question of mental health supports for those who are members of the LGBT community is important.  I recommend that the report would contribute towards that broader debate around how we engage with our mental health services.<\/p> <p>The Schools of Sanctuary programme has been operating in Ireland since 2017.  It is where schools all around the island of Ireland are identified as safe and welcoming environments, particularly for those from different ethnic minorities.  It talks about the value of inclusion.  The newest school to be designated as a School of Sanctuary, I am glad to say, is Creagh College in Gorey, which amazingly now has 49 nationalities in the school and, apart from Irish and English, 23 languages are spoken among the students.  I hope other schools take up the opportunity to become a School of Sanctuary.  Further, I would like to extend congratulations to the principal, Paul Glynn, the deputy principal, Janet Wallace, and all the students and staff who have achieved that title of School of Sanctuary for Creagh College.

Equally, if we want people to drive safely, we also want people to drive in safe cars and they need to be tested to make sure that they are operating appropriately and safely.  If it is taking that long, people's insurance is possibly compromised if they are driving a car that has not been passed.  Technically, cars are not supposed to be on the road with an NCT that is out of date.  Perhaps a blind eye is being turned to that, but we do need to have a system that is fit for purpose.

It goes back to when the contract was put together.  The absence of aviation expertise in both the Department of Transport and the Irish Coast Guard are serious failings that have yet to be addressed by both agencies.<\/p> <p>During the inquest, evidence was given into the problems that occurred that night.  One of the problem that occurred was the getting of top cover.  As we know, once an aircraft goes beyond a certain distance, it loses communications with the mainland and it requires top cover in order to act as a rebroadcast station.  Because the contract and the setting up of the search and rescue for the ten-year period did not mandate the Irish Air Corps to have aircraft available all of the time, frequently, those called out on a search and rescue mission have to search around to get top cover.  On the particular night in question, the Air Corps was asked if it had somebody available and it did not.  The next port of call was the Royal Air Force, RAF.  This lays bare the lack of aviation experience on that particular night.  In evidence to the inquest, the Coast Guard said it contacted the RAF and sought a Nimrod to carry out the job of top cover.  The Nimrod was taken out of service seven years before that fatal night.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

Especially after the lockdown and Covid-19, people have been coming back to visit many of our heritage sites all around the country.  Although we can travel now, there is still much to see in our local areas.  The Battle of Aughrim was a historic battle that took place in 1691 between Williamites and Jacobites.  In this visitors' centre, people can see what it was like.  It was the single largest loss of Irish life on Irish soil in a battle.  When you go to this visitors' centre you can understand what it was like.  You can see the costumes the soldiers wore.  You can feel the muskets.

Senator Conway kicked off discussions and he spoke about some of the briefing he attended yesterday.  In particular, he referred to the briefing held by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO.  I think many Members of this House attended it to hear some of its requests which, from my perspective, were very reasonable.  It is looking to reduce class size numbers by two, which would bring us in line with other European countries.  It made a novel, interesting recommendation or suggestion that there would be ringfenced funding of &euro;20 per child for mental health services.  I think we would all agree that this is vitally important.  I know the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and her Department have been engaging with the INTO.  They are looking seriously at these requests from the INTO.  I thank the INTO for the facilitation yesterday in briefing Members of both Houses.  It is important, particularly when there is so much going on, that Members have that opportunity to focus in on an issue.  These briefings are of huge benefit to Members.  I thank the organisation for that opportunity yesterday.<\/p> <p>Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin started her contribution by acknowledging that today is Bloomsday, as did many other Members of this House.  It is an important day, in particular some parts of the country where there are strong links to that festival.  She also spoke about the ongoing issues with USIT and with US visas for students.  Many of us will have received representations on that issue.  Many students are missing out on flights and accommodation.  They have made plans in the summer that they have not been able to fulfil because of the difficulties in obtaining their visas.<\/p> <p>The Senator also spoke about the short-hop zone and the difference in the price of a ticket, that is, between getting a ticket in Newbridge and getting a ticket in Sallins to travel into Dublin city.  The cost for Newbridge is &euro;10.60, whereas for Sallins, it is &euro;3.60.  This is a considerable difference.  The Senator has advocated for that short-hop zone to be extended and that we look at the cost of fares from different locations and to make sure they are fair and equitable.  It is reasonable to acknowledge that since April, there has been a 20% reduction in all public transport fares and 50% for students aged between 18 to 22.  We have seen an increase in passengers on public transport, which welcome for many reasons.  It is great to see that public transport is being utilised when it becomes more affordable.<\/p> <p>Senator Clonan spoke on two important issues, one of which was the Women&rsquo;s Aid report, which presented really shocking statistics.  It has been discussed by other Members as well.  We have a significant problem when it comes to violence against women.  There are commitments from Government and from the Minister for Justice to tackle this issue in a serious way.  We have a long way to go.  We fall well short of our commitments under the Istanbul Convention in terms of refuge places.  This is not just a case of having a safe space to go.  There are financial issues as well when people try to leave the home.  There are issues around children.  There are legal issues as well, such as supports to go through the court system.  There is a whole suite of supports needed in order to assist predominately women who are fleeing domestic violence situations.  We must also acknowledge some men also experience violence and, of course children, do as well.  It is an epidemic in this country and we have to get to grips with it.  We are a long way behind some of our European neighbours.<\/p> <p>The Senator also spoke about the ongoing issues of sexual offences and the way  they are dealt with in the Defence Forces.  I agree with his comments that it is wholly unsatisfactory that the organisation would investigate itself in matters of this nature.  I do not have an answer for the Senator on how many of those who have been accused of sexual offences have gone through courts martial and how many of those have ended up on sex offenders' register.  It is a specific question, so I suggest the Senator table a Commencement matter to try to elicit a response from the Department on that.  We might take it from there to see if further investigations are required through a more substantial debate in the House.  However, given that the question is specific, it would be suitable for a Commencement matter.<\/p> <p>As he has often done, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile spoke about the referendum presidential elections.  It is a commitment in the programme for Government to hold a referendum to extend the franchise for voting to citizens beyond the island in presidential elections.  I do not have a time yet as to when the legislation will progress.  It is separate from the Electoral Commission that is dealing with other aspects of elections in the country.  I do note the Senator comments.  He has also asked for statements from the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora.  I think that he is correct in saying there have not been statements in the House on that issue, so we will request that debate but it is unlikely to happen before the summer recess.  As Members will see from our schedule, even for next week, it is extremely busy with the huge number of Bills that we must try to pass in the coming weeks.  We might look for that debate in the autumn session.<\/p> <p>The Senator also requested statements on Palestine.  Again, it may not be possible to facilitate that in the next four weeks, but certainly we can facilitate that debate in the autumn session.<\/p> <p>Senator Moynihan drew the attention of the House to the fact that today is the sixth anniversary of the murder of Jo Cox, MP, in England.  It is a sad day for politics, not just in England and in the UK, but on this island too.  There are increasing tensions.  It is becoming a more difficult job to be a public representative.  We have to watch out for that here as well.  I do not think we are in that space, but we could be in that space at some point if we are not careful.  We want to ensure there is respectful, dignified and safe political discourse on the island.<\/p> <p>The Senator also spoke about the lack of taxis in Dublin city, which is a problem.  Some figures suggest that we are down by 20% on pre-Covid-19 levels.  My colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, has called for a commission to look into this, to work with taxi drivers and to see if we can put together a better deal for drivers to encourage them back into the sector.  That is a sensible solution.  However, I take on board the Senator's comments.  It is a particular concern for women who are trying to get home at night.  If they do not have a taxi, it could be the difference between them going out and participating in the night-time economy or not going out.<\/p> <p>Senator Black spoke about the briefing yesterday.  I apologise that I did not get to it as there was a lot going.  It was great that the two individuals were facilitated in having the briefing in the House.  This is an issue Senator Black consistently raises on behalf of many groupings.  She is always keeping that issue on top of the agenda of the House, which is appreciated by many of us.  A debate has been requested on Palestine by a number of Senators.  As I said, it is unlikely to happen in the next four weeks, given the demands on the schedule of the House.  However, we could look to get that debate at the earliest opportunity in the autumn session in order to keep that issue at the top of the agenda and to give Members an opportunity to contribute to the ongoing debate on that issue.<\/p> <p>Senator Ward spoke about that issue.  He also spoke about Bloomsday and the unique connection between his area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Joyce.  I concur with Senator's remarks in that regard.  <\/p> <p>Senator Mullen spoke about a particular issue.

He spoke in particular about the loss of life in St. Francis Catholic Church in Nigeria.  I send our sympathies to the families and the community there.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke on a couple of issues.  He referred to the Mental Health Reform report that was published yesterday and the briefing he attended regarding the LGBTQI+ community.  He drew our attention to some stark figures, including that 19% of those accessing mental health services identify as members of that community, which is one in five individuals.  That is a very strong statistic which shows that there is a great deal of work to be done in that space.  He also spoke about the Schools of Sanctuary programme, schools that are operating a very inclusive policy, and drew our attention to Creagh College in Gorey which has just been admitted to that programme.  It has been acknowledged as a very inclusive school, now accommodating 49 nationalities and 23 languages.  We wish Mr. Paul Glynn and Ms Janet Wallace, the principal and deputy principal, well and congratulate them on that achievement.<\/p><p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about women's sheds.  They are a fantastic initiative.  This started with men's sheds and women's sheds are now taking off all around the country.  They provide a nice space for people to connect, meet up, have friendships, learn new skills, to contribute to their communities and to try to tackle the ongoing issue of isolation and loneliness, particularly in rural areas.  That can be a killer and is devastating for many people.  It is a great initiative and it is nice to have some good news being raised on the Order of Business.<\/p><p>Senator Horkan raised road safety and asked for a debate on that issue.  We will request that debate.  It will likely be held in the autumn session, but we will request it at the earliest opportunity.  The Senator is right about the delays with testing.  That will have a knock-on impact so it is important to address that.  They are unacceptable delays for something that is a requirement to drive a vehicle.  The State should be providing that service.  There is quite a disparity as well in how long people have to wait across different areas in the country.  Some areas are better served than others.  There should be uniformity across the board as to how long one should have to wait.  I will ask for that debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#V00700","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>With regard to the NCT, it is illegal to drive a car that does not have an up-to-date NCT.

The Bill, which I am proposing today on behalf of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, is necessary to address an urgent lacuna in the law regarding the legal basis for Garda court presenters.  The circumstances that the provisions are designed to address are of an exceptional nature.  They arise from a judgment in a case stated from the District Court to the High Court that found there to be no legal basis underpinning the system of Garda court presenters.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can prosecute offences in the District Court under section 8 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  In practice many of the important procedural matters in prosecutions are dealt with by court presenters, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who specialise in court work in the District Court.  The approach taken is to restore the system of court presenters which existed prior to this judgment.  The provisions will clearly establish a right of any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to conduct a prosecution, whether or not that member initiated the prosecution.  It will allow the District Court to function effectively and address the needs of accused persons and victims to have their cases heard.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As of this morning, Thursday, 16 June, the High Court granted leave to appeal and a stay until the first return date on appeal.  The decision to appeal is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  The amendment will come into effect on enactment and applies to prosecutions currently in progress as well as future prosecutions.<br\/><br\/>I will now outline the background to this short Bill.  On 31 May, in a judgment in a consultative case stated from the District Court in the case of DPP, at the suit of Garda Liam Varley, <i>v<\/i>. Ciar&aacute;n Davitt, the High Court found there to be no legal basis underpinning the system of Garda court presenters.  Court presenters are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who specialise in court work in the District Court and who deal with important procedural matters, including evidence of arrest, charge and caution in first appearances in court, remands, bail applications, presenting a summary of evidence in guilty pleas.  The practice of allowing separate Garda members to perform these roles is well established and widely relied upon.  It enables a more efficient use of case resources by reducing the need for individual garda&iacute; to attend court to prosecute every criminal case or offence they detect.  These prosecutorial functions are carried out on behalf of the DPP under section 8 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  Section 8(1) of the 2005 Act actively removes the right of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prosecute as a Garda informer and section 8(2) supports this by providing that garda&iacute; may bring summary prosecutions only in the name of the DPP.  Section 8(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 states: &quot;Subject to subsection (3), any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may institute and conduct prosecutions in a court of summary jurisdiction, but only in the name of the Director of Public Prosecutions.&quot;<br\/><br\/>In the judgment in the Davitt case, the High Court held that the ordinary and natural meaning of the word &quot;and&quot; in the phrase &quot;institute and conduct&quot; in section 8(2) is that the word must be read conjunctively.  In other words, the same Garda member must perform both actions of initiate and conduct.  Accordingly, a Garda member has a right of audience to conduct any proceedings that he or she has instituted, but the section does not confer right of audience on a garda in any other proceedings.  Given the interpretation of section 8(2) of the 2005 Act, the court held that order 6, rule 1, of the District Court rules, which confers a right of audience on all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and not just the garda who initiated the prosecution is an impermissible amendment to the 2005 Act, concluding that the rule is <i>ultra vires<\/i>of the enabling legislation and could not be relied upon by the District Court judge in affording a right of audience to a garda who had no involvement in initiating the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>The net effect of the judgment is that no garda acting in a case other than one where he or she is the named complainant may address a court as presenter.  This includes bail applications and guilty pleas.  The court presenters, therefore, are now no differently positioned than civilians when dealing with a court.  In such circumstances the presence of a solicitor or counsel, or the actual prosecuting garda is a prerequisite in all District Court cases for the time being.  On 2 June, the High Court clarified that the judgment does not take effect until the final orders are made and the case was adjourned until 16 June.<br\/><br\/>I now turn to the impact on the actual workings of the District Court following the judgment.  The ruling has immediate and serious implications for the conduct of criminal prosecutions in the State as the system of Garda court presenters is well established and widely relied upon across the State.  The contingency measures put in place after the judgment issued and prior to the clarification made by the judge as to the effect of the judgment, and the ensuing disruption in that period, give an indication of the impact the judgment will have if remedial legislation is not enacted before the judgment comes into effect.<br\/><br\/>In Dublin, the DPP had to arrange for court solicitors to be present at all sittings of the 13 District Courts and instructions issued to State solicitors outside of Dublin to cover courts, where possible.  The instituting Garda member was also to be present wherever possible.  Further mitigating measures were also considered including the use of counsel from the DPP's High Court bail panel to cover the Dublin District Courts, with ongoing liaison with Garda headquarters to ensure that Garda directives were in line with the approach being taken by the DPP.<br\/><br\/>On 2 June, in a single day, 2,131 cases were before the District Courts across the country, and notwithstanding the measures outlined above, hundreds of cases had to be adjourned.  In one court alone, 130 cases had to be adjourned.  Once the judgment comes into effect, this impact will be magnified for each District Court, in each county, for each day that the legislation is not amended.  In addition to the substantial impact on the work of court solicitors, State solicitors and prosecuting garda&iacute;, the adjournment of cases has caused significant distress and upset to victims and accused persons.  These cases will be added to the already lengthy backlog of cases in the District Court.  There will be knock-on delays in preparing books of evidence in other potentially more serious trials, work that would ordinarily be undertaken by deployed staff from the DPP's office.<br\/><br\/>The judgment also gives rise to a risk of Article 40 applications by persons remanded in custody or refused bail in the District Court where the DPP was represented by the court presenter and not the prosecuting Garda member.  Article 40 of the Constitution permits persons to apply to the High Court for release on the basis that they are unlawfully detained.  Mitigating arrangements cannot be sustained over the long-term from a cost and effectiveness perspective and there remains a risk of Article 40 applications to the High Court.<br\/><br\/>By means of the short, three-section Bill before the House, it is proposed to amend the phrase &quot;institute and conduct &quot; in section 8(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 in order that it reads &quot;institute or conduct &quot;, providing that the prosecution may be conducted by the instituting Garda member or any other member.  The amendment will come into effect on enactment and applies to prosecutions currently in progress as well as future prosecutions.  The legislation is in response to an emergency where a failure to act would deny access to the District Court for accused persons and victims, incur greater costs on the State and prolong the period of uncertainty for all involved.  I believe it represents a necessary, proportionate and carefully balanced response to the current situation and will allow the District Court to function as intended.  Further consideration is being given to appealing the judgment, which is a matter for the DPP.  I look forward to hearing Senators' comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#X00300","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his very comprehensive summary of the position we find ourselves in.

The Bill is designed to protect in principle and in law a very important and long-standing function carried out in District Court sittings by members of the Garda, known as Garda court presenters.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When a case comes before the District Court, it is handled by a court presenter &mdash; for the most part by a local sergeant.  The court presenter will detail the offence committed, including details of arrest, charge and caution, and outline the circumstances of the offence.  Due to the minor or moderate offences which are prosecuted at District Court level, this is a system that has always allowed for the State prosecutor to focus on more serious cases at a higher court level.  This is a well-established system across the State and has been for many years.<br\/><br\/>On 31 May, the case of Garda Liam Varley <i>v<\/i>. Ciar&aacute;n Davitt came before the High Court.  The judgment in that case determined that there is no legal basis underpinning the system of Garda court presenters at District Court level.  The effect of the decision is that no Garda other than a prosecuting Garda can present a case in court.  The ruling ended the ability of Garda court presenters to present and has immediate implications for the system.  To restore the legal basis of the Garda court presenters, the Minister for Justice has introduced this emergency legislation.<br\/><br\/>Due to the emergency nature of this legislation, Sinn F&eacute;in did not object to a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny at the meeting of the justice committee without sight of the Bill.  Having since examined the Bill, as the Minister will know from contributions by my colleagues in the D&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in submitted an amendment yesterday to ensure that Garda court presenters would not be below the rank of sergeant.<br\/><br\/>The handling of the Bill so far has unfortunately been somewhat unsatisfactory regarding how to do business, especially regarding the prosecution of those before the courts.  While Sinn F&eacute;in did not oppose a waiver at pre-legislative stage, it is disappointed that the Bill does not limit Garda court appearances to sergeants or those above that rank.  As I have said, we have introduced an amendment in that respect.  It is important that the Minister accept the amendment because the unintended consequence of the Bill as it stands is that probationary garda&iacute; will be given the ability to act as court presenters, an outcome we would have serious concerns about.  I hope the Minister can accept the amendment and that colleagues can support it.  I assure the Minister of our broader support for this Bill and what it is trying to achieve.

As he says, the purpose of the Bill is to amend section 8 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  As it did in the Lower House yesterday, the Labour Party welcomes this legislation and will be supporting it.  There was, however, a worry articulated in the debate yesterday.  The Minister of State mentioned it again today.  It concerns a letter from the Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee, to the Ceann Comhairle stating that on 2 June more than 2,131 cases were before the District Court throughout the country.  Notwithstanding contingency measures put in place, hundreds of cases had to be adjourned.  In one court alone, 130 cases were adjourned, which, of course, caused distress and worry among all those involved.<\/p> <p>The court presenter case underpins this legislation, which is to support the processing of the large number of cases coming through our District Court and to allow as many of them to be heard as possible, having regard to Covid restrictions.  The cases that have backed up have been added to the already lengthy backlog arising from the Covid disruption.  The recent ruling by the High Court necessitated action by the Government.  We support that action today.<\/p> <p>The recent ruling should concentrate Government minds on how our District Court operates.  We have received a number of calls from those working in the system about the lack of judges and how this is causing delays.  Given the ruling that has highlighted a practice that has assisted the working of our District Court system over many years but does not have legislative underpinning, the fundamental question arises as to whether there are other practices within the District Court system that could also be struck down.  I am sure the Minister, the Department and the Attorney General have regarded the need to rush emergency legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas as a flag prompting them to carry out a review of all such practices within our District Court system to avoid a recurrence of what is happening today.<\/p> <p>I thank all the garda&iacute; who assist us all throughout our communities day in, day out.  Their job is not an easy one, as we have all said before in this House.  We must carry out and use every opportunity to thank them for the work they do for us.  On a personal note, I thank the garda&iacute; in my area, south Kildare, for their assistance with so many queries about matters that I continue to come across in my work as a public representative.  As colleagues have done, I call for additional garda&iacute; for south Kildare.  It does not come directly under the Minister's remit; however, given the additional work so many garda&iacute; are doing in my part of the country, this debate gives me an opportunity to call for additional resources.  All those involved would support that call.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister and Minister of State, both of whom have been present during my speech.  That is the first time that has happened.

The Upper House of the Oireachtas should acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>The Minister will know full well what I am going to say next.  It is now incumbent on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, working with the Department of Justice, to have a very high level of Garda visibility on our streets, especially in our capital city and Cork city.  I spoke earlier about the rise of antisocial behaviour, the incidence of public order offences and violence against people.  It is important that the Government and Members of the Upper House stand with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I remember the joint policing committee when I was in Cork City Council.  We need to see more garda&iacute; on the street.  It is critical.  The level of antisocial behaviour in parts of Cork and Dublin is unacceptable.  We can blame it on a myriad of factors and put forward excuses, but we need a strong Garda presence on our streets.  I realise I am digressing a little but I believe this is important.

It is important the message go out from this House that we fully support our garda&iacute; in everything they do in trying to keep our streets and communities safe.  There is an element of parts of urban areas, in particular, that are not quite no-go zones but are heading in that direction, whereby people do not feel comfortable sometimes even in daytime but especially in the evening and when it is dark, if not so much now then at least during the winter.  It is important that we re-establish in those areas, given that many areas are very safe, a significant Garda presence and let the message go out regarding this kind of menacing and antisocial behaviour and these elements of gangland-type activity, which often involve young people who may see it as some kind of fun activity or whatever.  That menacing presence in parts of our cities emerged earlier during Covid when there was much less passive surveillance on the streets.  Pubs were shut and retail had to close early, and an awful lot of the streets effectively became empty and, therefore, playgrounds for people to do things they would not normally have been able to do.<\/p> <p>Some of that activity has continued, and it is important that this House send out the message that it is not okay and that we need to resource the Garda appropriately.

Moreover, the Commissioner has given a commitment that from September, 200 recruits will begin training in Templemore every 12 weeks, which is a very welcome development.  The introduction of the new operating model is key in ensuring those garda&iacute; who should be on front-line duty and on the beat are where they are.

What we would get is a very accurate street map but with almost no description of architectural frontage whatever so that part of it is not accurate.<\/p> <p>I thank Ms Karin O'Flanagan and the Mountjoy Square residents' association because they provided me with the Bill and the explanatory memorandum on which I will rely.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Planning and Development Acts to improve the level of protection afforded to Ireland's built heritage.  The Bill will ensure that such protection and the expertise available to support it are based on the existence of effective expertise within planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This is obvious.  If we having planning situations, we must have people with the expertise to deal with them.  The Bill also aims to strengthen the protection afforded by the architectural conservation area designation and to increase the enforced mechanisms and penalties for breaches of planning legislation leading to damage to built heritage.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The provisions of the Bill are perfectly standard.  Part 1 is preliminary and general provisions.  Section 1 contains the Short Title.  Section 2 contains the interpretation.  This is all absolutely standard. <\/p><p>Part 2 contains provisions relating to the role and function of architectural conservation officers in both planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to facilitate the protection of built heritage.  Section 3 sets out the minimum qualification requirements for architectural conservation officers.  Section 4 requires all planning authorities and the board to have a conservation architect with the experience of building conservation practice and requires planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to have a sufficient number of such practitioners available to fulfil their statutory functions.  The section also requires that any person performing position of head of planning within a planning authority should have suitable qualifications in planning.<\/p><p>Section 5 requires all planning authorities have regard for the observations of architectural conservation officers in relation to their planning activities within their functional area.  A similar obligation is imposed on An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Section 6 sets out the functions of architectural conservation officers in both planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to the planning function.  Section 7 permits an architectural conservation officer to raise specific concerns about specific structures with the CEO of the planning authority.  Section 8 requires each CEO of a planning authority to publish an annual report dealing with the conservation and management of the built heritage within the functional area.<\/p><p>Section 9 requires the appointment of a national built heritage conservation officer to advise the Government generally on the provision of architectural conservation services for the State and to provide advice and support to the Minister on such issues.  <\/p><p>Part 3 contains amendments to Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Section 10 allows the planning authority to add a structure to the record of protected structures, RPS, or designate it as a proposed protected structure even though the existing planning permissions may attach to the structure where the structure is deemed to be of special architectural importance.  The section also contains a provision for a planning authority to issue an interim designation order for a building that is in imminent threat of damage to the fabric or integrity of a building that would be eligible for inclusion in the RPS.<\/p><p>Section 11 introduces a new requirement to list the name and address of the legal owner of a property in the RPS and for a notification of the change of owner to be made to the RPS within 30 days of completion.  Section 12 broadens the nature of the guidelines that the Minister can issue to the planning authorities concerning architectural conservation areas, ACAs.  Section 13 removes the discretion of planning authorities to comply with the recommendation made by the Minister in relation to including properties in the RPS for the area.  Section 14 requires the deletion of a property from the RPS by a local authority to have secured the consent of the Minister before having effect.  Section 15 strengthens protection for heritage properties by extending the limit on exempt development status to properties within ACAs and by requiring works on all heritage properties covered by the section to seek a declaration confirming that the works would not materially affect the character of the structure in order to secure exempted development designation. <\/p><p>Section 16 removes the power of a planning authority or the board to permit the demolition of a heritage property.  If such a property is to be demolished, it must first be removed from the RPS through the process set out in the legislation.  Section 17 redefines the basis on which a retention permission can be granted by a planning authority or the board for works on a protected structure by inserting some conditions that need to be met in order for such permission to be granted.  This includes compliance with an enforcement notice or confirmation that the works were necessitated to preserve the building.  It clarifies that the carrying out of works to protect or safeguard a building following a breach of the Planning Acts shall not prejudice the legal rights of the planning authority concerning the structure concerned.<\/p><p>Section 18 extends the scope of existing section 57 declarations to the exempted development provisions under section 5 of the Planning Act.  Section 19 reduces the statutory defences against the prosecution for damaging a structure where the person acted recklessly or failed to engage with the authority.  Section 20 changes the title of &ldquo;development plans&rdquo; to &ldquo;development and management plans&rdquo; to clarify that the statutory plans are not just about creating new developments, but also about managing existing developments and land.  <\/p><p>Section 21 requires the professional advisers engaged in the transfer of a property to notify the purchaser or lessee of the heritage designation of a listed property or a property within the ACA.  Section 22 imposes an obligation on planning authorities when making a development and management plan to actively review areas within their functional area to be designated ACAs.  Section 23 contains an obligation on planning authorities to include an objective in statutory plans to preserve the character of areas of special interest or value, as defined, or which contribute to the appreciation of protected structures and which need to be preserved.  Section 24 reinforces the protection afforded by ACA designation for properties in public realm within ACAs.  <\/p><p>Section 25 provides that permission should be refused by a planning authority or the board for works on structures within an ACA if the proposed development is contrary to the conservation objectives of the ACA.  Section 26 strengthens the protection afforded the buildings within an ACA by requiring the planning authority to have regard for the authenticity of the surviving built fabric.  Section 27 provides that the de-designation of an area such as an ACA can only take place with the prior written consent of the Minister.  It also prevents an application for retention where the provisions of an enforcement notice have not been fulfilled.  There are also additional powers granted to planning authorities to intervene to stop unauthorised works within ACAs and to confer similar powers as exist for protective structures for buildings within ACAs.  <\/p><p>Section 28 extends the power of section 22 of the Act of a planning authority to acquire a structure within an ACA where it appears necessary to do so for the protection of the structure.  Section 29 compels the planning authority to actively manage the ACAs.  It also requires property owners within ACAs and owners of properties on the RPS to actively maintain their properties and not to allow them to suffer dereliction or damage.  The section also requires owners of properties within ACAs or properties on the RPS to notify the planning authority of their ownership of the property within 90 days of the commencement of the section or 90 days of the acquisition of the property, whichever is the sooner.  This section also requires persons carrying out works to an RPS or a property within an ACA to provide the planning authority with a conservation report when submitting a planning application for such works.<\/p><p>Section 30 requires someone applying for planning permission for works on a property on the RPS or within an ACA to specify that the property carries such a designation on any planning notice.  Section 31 tightens the exempted development provisions as they apply to properties within an ACA or properties on the RPS.<\/p><p>Part 5 contains provisions relating to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Section 32 increases the number of ordinary members of the board from seven to eight.  Section 33 provides that one member of the board must be a grade one conservation architect.  Section 34 expressly requires the board in the performance of its functions to have regard to policies and objectives of public authorities, including those concerning the conservation management of areas.  <\/p><p>Part 6 contains provisions relating to enforcement.  Section 35 amends section 152(2) by removing the discretion of a planning authority not to issue a warning letter where an enforcement issue arises in an ACA or concerns a building on the RPS.  Section 36 reduces the time limit for issuing a warning level from six weeks to three working days- which is very severe - recognising the challenges involved in protecting conservation properties.  Section 37 gives the power to ensure enforcement concerning a building on the RPS or within an ACA on the conservation officer of the local authority.  Section 38 introduces a new provision compelling a local authority to send the conservation officer to a property within three working days where a complaint has been received that the original fabric of the building is at risk of loss due to unauthorised development.  <\/p><p>Section 39 reduces the period within which a local authority must take enforcement actions following a warning letter.  Section 40 makes it an offence for a person, when acting as the agent, the owner or developer of the property, not to disclose the existence of an enforcement notice or failure to comply with an enforcement notice.  Section 41 requires planning authorities to maintain a register of warning and enforcement notices against properties which should be placed on public display.  Any agent acting for a person selling, renting or developing the property will be on notice of enforcement issues on the register.<\/p><p>Section 42 increases the penalties arising from convictions concerning properties in an ACA or on the RPS.  Section 43 is a new provision requiring a court to have regard to the extent of loss of a reasonable built fabric of a building and the willful nature of such damage when inserting the appropriate penalty to be imposed on conviction.  Section 44 amends section 164A of the Act by providing that criminal prosecutions under the Act are taken by the Director for Public Prosecutions, DPP.  It also includes a provision allowing the Criminal Assets Bureau to assist in such criminal prosecutions, including assisting in the recovery of assets.<\/p><p>Section 45 creates an obligation on each planning authority&rsquo;s CEO to publish an annual report on the steps taken by the authority to safeguard built heritage in the preceding year, including development, management and development control initiatives.<\/p><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#KK00600","speaker":"1675","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, Senator Norris.

I thank the Cathaoirleach for the role he played as chairman of the portraits and arts committee here in respect of the hanging, dare I say it, of the portrait of Senator Norris today in the House.  It was a very moving and special moment.  I know the important role the Cathaoirleach played.  He made a very convincing case.  It was not difficult to make that convincing case on behalf of Senator Norris but the Cathaoirleach made that case to the commission, which agreed to it.  It was a great day for all of us today that a portrait of Senator Norris hangs in the central hall of Leinster House, of our Parliament.  No doubt, he will be the subject of conversation of many people who will pass through these corridors in the years to come.<\/p><p>I also welcome the Minister of State, who has significant commitment and lives in the wonderful county of Kilkenny, which is full of protected structures.  It is important to point out that local planning authorities are required in law to maintain a record of protected structures known as the RPS.  That must be part of the county development plan process.  There is extensive public engagement in respect of that.  In simple terms, a protected structure must fit a number of criteria, specifically architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social and technical interest.  They are the strict criteria for a protected structure.  I think it is important that we do not suggest that because somebody likes the colour or shape of a building, it should be designated a protected structure.  This is very strongly rooted in conservation and heritage protection and is also addressed in a number of conservation guidelines by the Department.  I also acknowledge the enormous work of the Department in this area, the conservation officers that do exist in some local authorities and the councillors who are constantly promoting the inclusion of a number of buildings that meet the criteria for protected structures into the RPS.<\/p><p>This Bill attempts to increase the number of conservation officers per the number of protected structures.  Dublin city, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and Cork would be at the top of the pyramid.  Already the architectural inventory is doing work.  It has not been completed in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  It is very significant there, as it is in Dublin.  This Bill seeks to address the role of architectural conservation officers, the qualifications of architectural conservation officers and the role they will play between planning and architecture because many local authorities run a separate architectural department.  There needs to be a greater synergy between town planning, landscape, biodiversity, heritage and culture.  They are all intertwined and we need greater synergies between them.<\/p><p>I also acknowledge the significant and successful work of Kilkenny County Council, which is one of the leading councils with regard to heritage.  Why would it not be with such a wonderful city?  We want the placing of architectural conservation officers to be central as part of this legislation, the creation of possibly a State conservation officer to co-ordinate, resource and upskill architectural conservation officers in the future and a review of the planning legislation.  What a timely opportunity in this legislation when the Attorney General is considering extensive law reform and proposals that I know the Minister of State is very much involved with in terms of a new planning Bill and the consolidation and streamlining of a planning and development Bill.  This is very important.  The proposals in this Bill will hopefully guide and influence some of that consideration.  We know a number of local authorities have outstanding legal issues that they have not closed off with regard to protected structures and that there is an issue with resources and employment.  Over decades, we have seen that many protected structures have been undermined and in some cases, demolished and people have not been taken to court successfully in some cases.  I acknowledge the importance of what this Bill is attempting to do.<\/p><p>In summary, our Bill seeks to strengthen the protection of our built heritage and ensure that planning authorities have the necessary powers, functions, resources, finances and expertise to act quickly to protect protected structures.  We want to support the local authorities that have architectural conservation officers and to see an architectural conservation officer in every local authority.  We acknowledge the work they are doing under very difficult circumstances and do not doubt the CCMA's commitment to heritage protection.  I thank Senator Norris for his enormous work in the protection of Georgian Dublin.  I thank the Dublin Civic Trust and An Taisce for their enormous work.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, who announced the other day that he had boosted the budget of the Irish Environmental Network from &euro;1 million to &euro;1.7 million.  For those who do not know, the Irish Environmental Network distributes that funding to 34 environmental groups, of which An Taisce is one.  I want to put on the record that An Taisce does enormously good and positive work yet has been the subject of bad press in certain parts of the country.  What I like about the maturity of the Government and the Minister is that they accept that it is a critical component of consultation in planning and the Government has funded it.  There is a real role in terms of partnership with the Irish Environmental Network, An Taisce, the Irish Georgian Society and the Heritage Council, which the Minister of State has done a lot of work with.  Our Bill wants to strengthen and resource the conservation officers and educate, assist, support and protect unique heritage buildings be they protected structures, buildings in conservation areas or buildings in architectural conservation areas.  I commend this legislation.  I thank Senator Norris and the rest of my colleagues for the work they put into it and the support of An Taisce, the Irish Georgian Society, the Dublin Civic Trust and others.  I hope this will be the basis of a discussion.  Yes, we do not have everything right in this legislation and there may be a need for improvements but we can work out something with the Department and officials that can strengthen the protection of our unique, special and treasured built heritage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#LL00300","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the role of the Cathaoirleach in Senator Norris's portrait being displayed in Leinster House.

It is well deserved given Senator Norris's time, service and dedication to the public over a long period of time.  As someone who is a relatively new Senator, I know from other colleagues from all parties that we always find it a privilege to be a colleague of Senator Norris.  I wish him well and acknowledge his work on this Bill.  I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State as well.  I have found him to be incredibly supportive in the past two years.  There have been issues in my county he has led on and aided.  Knocklofty House is one of these issues.  I know we are talking about built heritage but I have not yet had the opportunity to thank the Minister of State for that support.  There is a real history with that building and the Minister of State's support and commitment to it is very much appreciated.<\/p> <p>Senator Cummins could not be here today.  He would have been leading on this.  Fine Gael will not oppose this Bill.  There are obviously concerns from our side about staffing issues and the chief executive having control of staffing issues, although it is nothing that could not be worked out.  When Senator Norris goes through the Bill, it is clear that an awful lot of it is just common sense.  It is really important to have stronger protection for that within local authorities.  If we can work through issues, we can reach a middle ground.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan spoke about reviewing planning legislation.  We are at the stage where we really should be doing this.  Many things get held up.  One of the things I hear quite a lot, certainly in Tipperary, is that it takes the same length of time to go through the planning process if you are building a 5,000 sq. m house as it does when you are building an extension.  Things have not been updated in quite some time.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Garret Ahearn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would therefore support a review of that planning legislation.<\/p><p>I commend all the Senators involved on getting the Bill to this point.

I know that this is an area of great personal interest to him.  I join others in complimenting Senator Norris.  Today is Bloomsday.  One of the lines in <i>Ulysses<\/i>reads: &quot;The supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring.&quot;  The work of art that is the portrait of Senator Norris springs from a very deep life, and this legislation, as a very practical piece of work, springs from a very deep knowledge and understanding of heritage issues and the cultural, architectural, social and environmental importance of our built heritage.  The legislation is really important.  It is timely.  It should and must be strongly reflected in the new building guidelines that have been brought through.  In the limited time I have, I will highlight a couple of aspects of the Bill that are important.<\/p><p>We sometimes get the idea that architectural heritage is nice but that we have other priorities against which we need to balance it.  I wish to be very clear that a stronger focus on our built and architectural heritage is, in fact, complementary to our other priorities.  I am a member of the climate committee, where over recent months we have had a series of hearings on the renovation wave across Europe and different sustainable approaches to building.  One thing that comes across again and again is that the most sustainable building is the one that already exists, that is renovated and that maybe sometimes is extended or changed.  A new tower may happen to have a renewable energy source built into it.  Restoring buildings and bringing them back into use can be incredibly powerful and is one of the most significant ways to address the challenges we face.  That has been highlighted at European level.  A European Commission has spoken about it.<\/p><p>We need to be extraordinarily careful about demolition.  In that context, I welcome the aspect of the Bill - I think it is section 15 - which states that there should not be a short-circuiting on demolition.  Not solely for the benefit of heritage but in general, demolition should become the absolute exception rather than the rule, given that heritage experts and environmental experts have told us that it takes up to 60 to 70 years to come back from the massive amount of emissions that come from unnecessary demolition, particularly in these early years of our climate action.<\/p><p>I make these points because they highlight the fact that there is a complementarity.  There are all those strong cases that have been there before but there are also new cases and new social, environmental and heritage-related arguments for architectural preservation and the building of skills.  The climate committee has discussed that also.  When we have referred in our reports to just transition, new skills and climate skills, we have emphasised that it is not just about new technological skills and other new skills.  Some of the really important things for climate resilience and restoration are those repair skills, the kinds of heritage skills and the apprenticeships we need in restoring shutters, bringing buildings back into use, managing the built fabric we share across the country and our extraordinary built heritage, and the old practices of salvage.  Those practices are crucial and central to the new renovation wave.  The climate committee has discussed that.  I wanted to say that in order that when the Government goes into these building regulations, these really practical, strong and clear proposals from Senator Norris, they are not left as a wish list or a thing we would like to keep but seen as core to plans that will work.<\/p><p>I will highlight one other aspect of the Bill that is particularly strong and important, namely, the removal of defence in cases of reckless action.  We have all heard the stories about the building knocked down or the wall damaged on a bank holiday Sunday to a point at which the building becomes unsavable.  There should not be defences of those kinds of actions because we know that they are reckless and that there are intentional actions whereby it is considered better to apologise afterwards but to move on.  That is the idea.  That is where there should be a real strengthening of powers, including powers of prosecution and the potential involvement of the Criminal Assets Bureau, which I really welcome.  If our shared heritage is damaged, we need to make sure that persons do not profit from it and that it becomes a matter in respect of which the State can intervene.<\/p><p>This Bill comes from somebody who knows heritage in all its possibilities and in every obstacle it encounters.  That it is why it is a lengthy Bill.  It is detailed.  It goes to each of the levers and points in the system.  I urge the Minister not just to embrace the Bill as a lovely idea but also to let us build this proposal into our new planning framework for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#NN00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House. I thank and commend Senator Norris for this legislation, which I, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in the Seanad, will support.  I urge the Minister of State and the Government to support and to adopt it.<\/p> <p>This Bill is a labour of love.  It comes from the heart.  It is not dead or boring legislation or just words on paper.  It really comes from a person who not only knows our city and our heritage but who also absolutely loves, values and cherishes it.  In this legislation Senator Norris, I believe, is seeking to get the State to demonstrate the same passion, commitment and love for our built heritage.  He comes from my part of the world, central Dublin, specifically the north inner city and, more specifically, North Great George's Street, where he lives.  He is sandwiched right between Parnell Square and Mountjoy Square.  We have five Georgian squares in Dublin, but Mountjoy Square is architecturally the most perfect of them.  It is equal in length on each of its four sides.  It stands at a height above the Custom House and is linked to the Custom House by Gardiner Street.  I know that it is at a height because when I try to cycle there from out here I feel it, but I am getting better at that.  Luke Gardiner, who conceived the idea of Mountjoy Square, if he were alive today, would be pilloried as a developer and a builder and would draw the wrath of the populace.  Mountjoy Square dates back to 1790.  It is a gem.  It is not just architecturally a gem but also a living gem in the context of its biodiversity, human activity and human diversity.  The nations of the world meet on Mountjoy Square.  This Sunday is Super Soul Sunday, when gospel choirs from all over the city will converge on Mountjoy Square.  That will be another reason to visit.<\/p> <p>To return to the legislation, I do not say this just to point the finger at Dublin City Council or other authorities, but we as a city need to be honest about the fact that we could have done a lot better in protecting our built heritage.  We can do an awful lot better at protecting our built heritage, not just conserving it but also ensuring that it is sustained into the future for future generations to experience.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Our architectural and built heritage is what makes Dublin city unique.  While I spend most of my time urging new building, in particular the building of new homes that must be built to modern standards, our rich built heritage is so precious and fragile and, in far too many instances, it has been neglected.  The neglect is due to myriad reasons, some of them unique to each individual built property.  It can be to do with ownership, the financial situation of the owners or myriad other issues.  If we truly believe that our built heritage is of value and we truly want to demonstrate as a country and a nation a commitment to it, then we need to legislate to protect it, conserve it and ensure that it is sustained into the future.<\/p><p>I apologise as I was not present for the Minister of State's opening remarks, but I presume he will advise the House that there is a bigger piece of work - a review of the overall planning structures.  I accept and support that, but when the Government deals with the review and reform of our planning processes and structures, it needs to take a very distinct look at the conservation of our built heritage and ensure actions are specified in that regard.  It needs to ensure experts empowered to use their expertise and knowledge to serve all of us and to preserve our built heritage.  It must ensure powers are in place to enforce the protections and to prosecute those who abuse, vandalise and destroy because there are far too many of those experiences out there.  I look forward to the remarks of the Minister of State.  I urge him and the Government to accept the Bill, to support it and to bring if forward and make it a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#NN00300","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I thank the Independent Members, in particular Senator Norris, for bringing forward this Bill, which is comprehensive, wide-ranging and contains stick measures in it as well for failure to protect the built heritage.  I am very pleased the Bill is before the House and we are strongly supportive of it, as well as of a review and consolidation of wider planning legislation that the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage has been examining.<\/p> <p>The Bill tackles a number of different issues, many of which have needed to be addressed for a long time.  We have all seen the impact of failing to properly protect our built heritage in the situations that have emerged.  I refer in my area in particular to the wanton destruction of the Iveagh Markets and the Iveagh building, which have been in the possession of a developer for the past 20 years.  It is falling apart.  We are still in negotiations on what will happen to the building, but it will never be the same again.  It will require tens of millions of euro to bring it up to the standard at which it was handed over when it was operational as the dry market in the city at the end of the 1990s.<\/p> <p>Another building I wish to highlight is the Player Wills factory, which I fought very hard for many years to get added to the Record of Protected Structures, RPS.  The initial planning applications that came in from the developer, Hines, involved essentially just keeping the facade of the building.  It is a very good example of not just Georgian and Victorian architecture, which many people value, but also 20th century modern architecture and industrial heritage that we must value as an important part of our built heritage.  It does not get the same fame or attention, but it is important to the city.<\/p> <p>Failing to adequately protect our built heritage has impacts that go far beyond dilapidation and planning compliance and goes to the very core of our architectural and social history.  I am pleased that the Bill provides for the introduction of architectural conservation officers, together with restrictions on situations in which a building can be removed from the RPS.  That is often done to suit new planning applications as they come in.  As it stands, it is far too easy for planning authorities and developers to simply gloss over or ignore the fact that a building is a protected structure.  The RPS has no teeth at the moment, and it is time to ensure that it does what it is intended to do, that is, to protect our built heritage and not simply for buildings to be recorded on a page while they fall into dilapidation.<\/p> <p>I know from personal experience how long the process can take to get a building entered on the RPS, but I also know that the power is with the local authority managers in terms of protection and putting something on the RPS.  I ask that we look in more detail at it becoming a reserved function of councillors on local authorities, as long as it is backed up by valid architectural reasons a building should be on the register.  In the past two years, the reports of this happening have been relentless.<\/p> <p>The former Player Wills factory on South Circular Road is of great historical significance, particularly in the industrial heritage of Dublin city.  It is important that such buildings are protected for future generations and for the character of the city and country.  It is possible to build and develop areas significantly while keeping the historical integrity and architectural history of areas intact.<\/p> <p>The treatment, or rather lack of it, of the Iveagh buildings in the Liberties encapsulates how badly we have failed to protect our built heritage.  A historic building, which should be the jewel of the south-west inner city has been left vacant and in ruinous condition for far too long.  It was built in 1902, is situated on Francis Street in Dublin 8 and it has fallen into severe dereliction.  An Taisce has it on a list of the top ten endangered buildings.  The building is overgrown, there is extensive water damage, and it is essentially being used as a car park for vans owned by a pub in Temple Bar.  It has so much potential and yet here we are in this situation.  It should never have been allowed get to the situation where the building has been allowed to be hoarded and to fall into such disrepair and dilapidation that it requires tens of millions of euro worth of work.  In that regard, I am very pleased section 43 will require a court to have regard to the extent of loss of the original built fabric of a building and the wilful nature of such damage when assessing the appropriate penalty to be imposed on conviction.<\/p> <p>There is a list of protected buildings in the city and country, yet people are deliberately allowing them to fall into dereliction and are being facilitated to do so to put in more extensive planning applications.  The Bill is very strong, and it will go some way towards tackling these problems.  We are very supportive of the Bill.  I know the Minister of State, who has been working hard on these issues and has a particular gr&aacute; and feeling for it, will incorporate these elements of this Bill into the overall consolidation of planning legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#OO00200","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>As one of the co-sponsors of this Bill, I thank Senator Norris for his initiative in bringing this legislation before the House.  I also thank those who inspired him to do so, in particular the Mountjoy residents' association and other conservationists in Dublin.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  A few points have occurred to me regarding the conservation of our heritage.  One relates to something Senator Fitzpatrick mentioned, namely, Mountjoy Square, which is an area I have a connection with, in that my father was born in one of the houses on the square at the time it was beginning its nosedive into neglect.  He was born in 1912.  By the 1960s or 1970s, one side of the square was in a state of ruin and had collapsed completely.  Happily, at that time, it was considered perfectly right to reinstate the facades so that at least the integrity of the square was recreated.  There was not any pointy-nosed blather about pastiche architecture or whatever else; it was just done.  I agree with Senator Fitzpatrick that the result is extremely pleasant now that the square itself has been revitalised.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am talking about the open ground in the middle of the square.  It is now a place which is up and coming and its future is now guaranteed.  However, I remember when I was a student, looking around it and thinking it was a disaster.  It looked more like a part of east Berlin, rather than anywhere else.<br\/><br\/>While we are on that subject, the ESB buildings on Fitzwilliam Street are an improvement on what was there before.  However, it is a pity that Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's proposal that the facades be reinstated was not implemented.  Although Grafton Architects have done a very good job at recreating some echoes of the street's Georgian past by using brickwork and the like, the modern bits of the buildings, which are internalised courtyards, are the most disappointing.  It would have been better to learn from the Mountjoy Square experience.  The ESB could have built a very impressive headquarters facing on to James Street East and undone the damage its predecessors did at an earlier stage.<br\/><br\/>Today is Bloomsday.  I think Usher's Island is in Senator Moynihan's constituency.  It is interesting that the house where <i>The Dead <\/i>is located is sitting there and was in danger of being redeveloped in the most inappropriate way, with structures out the back of it, to be a student hostel.  We could do James Joyce some greater honour than to ruin that building.  Curiously, there was a twin house right beside it.  All that is left of it is the ground floor.  I know an enlightened Dublin City Council would think of a scheme to acquire both of those properties, bring them back to a decent state of repair and do honour to James Joyce in that way.<br\/><br\/>Conservation architecture is important.  I knew of one individual, a near neighbour of mine in Ranelagh, who had a preserved structure.  When he went to do a major job to bring it back into very good repair, the conservation architects from Dublin City Council told him that a major joist, which ran from the front to the back of the structure, could not be removed and replaced by a new wooden or steel joist enclosed likewise in the floor.  It had to be kept in place, although it was rotten, with plating on all sides.  The point I am making is that this joist is hidden in the floor.  Nobody can see it.  That is the kind of excessive zeal which means that people will run away from conservation structures when they are told they cannot do what is sensible to keep a building functional, in proper condition and usable.<br\/><br\/>When I say that I support this Bill in its spirit completely, I will make one point clear.  One can have overzealous conservation approaches.  I notice there was a programme on RT&Eacute; about houses.  The owner of a house near the Royal Canal bank was told that she had to keep a window frame which was set the wrong way round, as an economy measure, in the 1950s.  She had to keep the sash window on its side because the conservation architect thought that was a condition to allowing her refurbish the house which was falling down in its entirety.<br\/><br\/>Having said that, I am very much a fan of conservation of buildings and planning authorities taking their job seriously and remedies being there.  I take all of the points that have been made in this debate thus far, but I do not want to bring into being a regime in which the rules are so stacked against people that they run away from conservation and find better things to do with the rest of their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022061600002#OO00300","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655368200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I commend Senator Norris and the Independent Group on bringing forward the Bill.  I also welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I will make a couple of points.  I have been a member of the culture committee for years and heritage was taken away from us by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I welcome the increases that have been given to the Heritage Council by the Department.  I think it was given &euro;14 million in recent times.  That figure had lingered at around &euro;1 million, &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million from 2009 to 2018, the last time I collated the figures.  It is a significant increase.<\/p> <p>For years, F&aacute;ilte Ireland was probably the body funding heritage.  That is problematic in its own way because communities had to justify their heritage projects on the basis of their tourism offering.  That being the value we place on heritage is kind of twisted in a way.  It is great to see the Heritage Council get its funding back to those levels.  It would also be good for the House to have statements on Heritage Ireland 2030 at some point but, for now, I welcome this Bill and commend An Taisce and the Dublin Civic Trust on their work on it.<\/p> <p>Some of the tenets we support include mandating the employment and increasing the number of conservation officers per number of protected structures in local authorities; prescribing the role of conservation officers; making the architectural conservation officer central to the formation of built heritage policy and planning enforcement in local authorities; significantly advancing planning enforcement powers, reporting times and actions required; clarifying and enhancing protections of architectural conservation areas; and increasing criminal penalties for damage to built heritage.<\/p> <p>I cannot allow this debate to pass without expressing regret and sadness at the demolition of the O'Rahilly house but today, I welcome the Bill.  I commend Senator Norris.  I was expecting to have to commend his work over many years.  It is a difficult job to do as a gay man.  It is more of a feeling of respect and admiration.  It is a privilege to have been able to work with him, especially in the last term, and to have had him co-sign my legislation on LGBT rights and to have co-signed his motions and work.

It is a great privilege to be here to take this Bill this afternoon and to be present for the unveiling of the beautiful portrait of the Senator.  He is an absolute hero of mine, for many reasons, heritage being one of them.<\/p><p>I will give a response to the contributions and then the departmental spiel on it in a moment. I found an article entitled &quot;David Norris on 40 years of saving North Great George&rsquo;s Street&quot;.  It is reflected in the points made about Mountjoy Square.  Sometimes it takes positive contagion and for one premises owner to be a champion.  It then spreads out across a street.  Senator Norris said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn the mid-1970s I was running a gay disco on Parnell Square.  Numbers began to fall dramatically and it turned out that two enterprising capitalists had opened a commercial disco just around the corner.  I had never heard of North Great George&rsquo;s Street but I went round to case the joint. Once in the street I fell in love with it and decided to purchase a house, which I did in the autumn of 1978. <\/blockquote> <p>That began his love affair with Georgian Dublin.  I am sure it was a love affair he had for many years.  He met with other residents, Brendan and Josephine O&rsquo;Connell, who were repairing a house.  Residents received a small grant from the Heritage Council which they wanted to put it into individual grants.  Senator Norris said, &quot;No&quot;, and that they should blow it all on an exhibition, which they did.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That really highlighted the chronic crisis that had taken place around the decay.  It was so forward-thinking for that time, and so visionary from Senator David Norris to bring us from that time in 1978 to today, in 2022, when he has brought forward this really fantastic legislation.<br\/><br\/>Senators will also have received correspondence from Geraldine Walsh and Graham Hickey of the Dublin Civic Trust, and from Ian Lumley of An Taisce.  This correspondence says:<\/p><blockquote>\tOver the past decade we have witnessed increasing numbers of protected structures and properties within architectural conservation areas being damaged through unauthorised development, including the removal of original fixtures and fittings and inappropriate replacement of historic features, and occasionally wholesale demolition without any recourse to the existing provisions of Part 4 of the Act.  Some cases involve speculators acquiring properties from vulture funds or distressed loan sales, while others consist of old fashioned gutting for substandard residential sub-division. <\/blockquote><p>The letter goes on to outline why the Dublin Civic Trust feels it is hugely important that this Bill is supported.  Before I respond to the Bill formally, I give the commitment that we will be taking the Bill and this correspondence from the Dublin Civic Trust to inform the planning review.<br\/><br\/>In their contributions a number of Members mentioned Mountjoy Square.  I was fortunate to meet with Mountjoy Square residents last year.  We had a fantastic day there with the Dublin Civic Trust.  There is a Kilkenny connection.  The railings that were conserved around the square and two of the glass-blown lanterns around it - I believe there were 26 originally - have been reinstated.  Both of these projects were carried out by Kilkenny companies: the ironmonger in Castlecomer, and Jerpoint Glass which carried out the glass blowing.  There is a great connection there with the point raised by Senator Higgins on traditional skills.  This is not just a twee side event: built heritage should become central to what we do with our housing policy, housing solutions, climate solutions and social cohesion solutions.  This is why the Bill is hugely important.  Senator Fitzpatrick also mentioned Mountjoy Square. I would love to be able to get up to that event on Sunday but unfortunately I will not be able to do so.<br\/><br\/>I will also outline a number of initiatives that have taken place in the context of the enabling.  We are looking at the carrot and stick.  Over the past months we have launched Places for People - The National Policy on Architecture.  This is a vernacular strategy to conserve our traditional buildings and, in particular, thatched buildings.  We have set up a working group to look at the issues around thatched buildings.  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage is still informing the record of protected structures for local authorities.  I believe that more than 1,400 such structures were submitted to Dublin City Council in the last tranche.<br\/><br\/>I pay tribute to our built heritage section in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and our local authorities' conservation officers.  We also run a number of really good grant schemes including the built heritage investment scheme; the historic structures fund; and the historic towns initiative, which is run by the Heritage Council.  We also support the Irish Georgian Society, the Follies Trust, the Heritage Council and the Irish Landmark Trust.  There is a broad range of actors in this space that are working collectively to really bring about cohesion.  We do need to look at the grant schemes in particular to see where they could be more effective.  We need to ramp up significantly the support for the owners of heritage properties to enable them to put them back into productive use.  We are also participating in the New European Bauhaus around European architecture.  There are a lot of really positive elements happening.<br\/><br\/>I support the points raised by Senators Moynihan and Higgins against demolition, and particularly of our industrial heritage.  We are losing some really fantastic 20th century buildings.  I do not know the reason for this.  They could all be repurposed.  I thank Members for their contributions.<br\/><br\/>It is a great privilege to be here on behalf of the Government to speak to the Bill brought forward by Senator Norris and co-sponsors.  I will take this opportunity to commend Senator Norris on his long-standing commitment to built heritage.  I share the Senator's commitment to the conservation and protection of Ireland's built heritage, and as such I am always open to proposals that further this shared cause.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Planning and Development Acts to improve the level of protection afforded to Ireland's built heritage.  This is an aim which is aligned with the commitments of the Government.  For this reason, the Government has agreed not to oppose this Bill.  The Bill seeks to ensure that the protection afforded to Ireland's built heritage and the expertise available to support that protection are based on the existence of effective expertise within planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<br\/><br\/>The Bill also aims to strengthen the protection afforded by architectural conservation area designation and to increase the enforcement mechanisms and penalties for breaches of planning legislation leading to damage to built heritage.  While agreeing broadly with the intentions behind the Bill, I would like to note to the Seanad that these areas are currently under examination through the comprehensive review and consolidation of planning legislation that is under way.  The review is being led by the Attorney General and it is intended to be completed by September to allow the revised legislation to be enacted by the end of the year.  This review is the most comprehensive review of planning since the Act was first drafted.  Its key aim is to ensure that the provisions align with policy and are more accessible and streamlined from a legal perspective.<br\/><br\/>The Planning and Development Act passed in 2000 has been amended many times, and as a result, can be somewhat impenetrable for the public and practitioners alike.  The review will therefore bring: increased clarity and streamlining of the legislation; a chronological format for processes with clear signposts to other sections or legislation; improved coherence and usability of procedures; completeness of transposition of EU directives; and adherence to constitutional requirements.  These aims will be achieved while also respecting the key role of public participation in the planning system.  I am aware Senator Boyhan shares my very strong desire to see this happen.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is fortunate to have a planning system that enables considerable public participation, but we need to build on that to ensure our planning legislation is fit for the modern era.  Through this review we want to ensure that the major debate is focused on the plan-making rather than the planning application stage, to facilitate greater clarity and long-term visibility in planning outcomes.  Adequate account must also be taken of the needs of the future population of new and expanded communities, as well as the needs of existing communities.  We must also take account of the nature of planning decisions, which require careful balancing of public policy, public participation and environmental issues.  To this end, the working group appointed by the Attorney General is currently examining all the provisions in the Planning and Development Act, including those relating to architectural heritage, in consultation with the Department, and will then draft revised and updated provisions.<br\/><br\/>In this context, colleagues in the Seanad should be aware that the issues addressed in Parts 3, 4 and 5 of Senator Norris's Bill are also being examined under the review.  For example, as part of this work, the Attorney General's working group is considering the recommendations of a review of Part IV of the 2000 Act, which was undertaken in 2016 by the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Included in the recommendations are provisions relating to architectural conservation areas and the register of protected structures.  The working group will, where appropriate, incorporate them into any revised text.<br\/><br\/>The planning review is also examining the legislative provisions in relation to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, enforcement and development plans.  As part of the review, my Department is engaging with stakeholders on the review and in this regard has established a planning advisory forum consisting of representatives from a broad range of sectors, including the public sector and the business, environmental, social and knowledge-based sectors.  The forum members have the opportunity to discuss issues arising from the review.  With regard to architectural heritage, the Heritage Council is represented on the forum and officials from my Department have also consulted the council directly on emerging issues.<br\/><br\/>Part 2 of the Bill contains provisions relating to the role and function of architectural conservation officers in planning authorities, including minimum qualification requirements for the post.  It provides that planning authorities must have regard for the observations of architectural conservation officers in relation to their planning activities and permits them to raise specific concerns about specific structures with the chief executive of the planning authority.  It requires the chief executive of a planning authority to publish an annual report dealing with conservation and management of the built heritage within its functional area.  It also provides for the appointment of a national built heritage conservation officer to advise the Government and the Minister on architectural conservation issues.<br\/><br\/>I would like to take this opportunity to note that further consideration should be given to these particular proposals.  It should be noted in relation to local authority staffing matters that there are already provisions in the Local Government Act 2001 for the setting of qualifications for the local government sector, and the power to set such qualifications is assigned to the appropriate Minister.  It would not be appropriate to create a separate process to set qualifications for architectural conservation officers, to set educational requirements for specified directors of services, to take that power from the appropriate Minister, or to enshrine specific qualifications in primary legislation.  The 2001 Act also provides that the chief executive is responsible for staffing matters.  The provisions proposed in the Bill would seek to take that role as it relates to architectural conservation officers and the envisaged new role of buildings-at-risk officer.  I have met with the Association of Architectural Conservation Officers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am of the view that the association must be given recognition.  It is not formally recognised by the CCMA and I want that addressed.  We also have different grades of architectural conservation officer in local authorities, some at senior executive grade and some at executive grade.  We need to have them at senior executive grade.  We need architectural conservation officers in every local authority, not just the handful we have.  That must be addressed.  There is a suite of policies that complement their work, such as town centres first, Housing for All, places for people, Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe and Heritage Ireland 2030.  It is critically important that these officers are front and centre of the decision-making process.<br\/><br\/>I again thank Senator Norris for proposing this Private Members' Bill and reiterate that the Government does not oppose the Bill or its intentions.  I reassure Senators that we will be taking the provisions set out in this Bill under consideration as part of this planning review, as well as the correspondence from Dublin Civic Trust and An Taisce.  We want to ensure we take informed views on the review to make it fit for purpose.  We need strong and rigorous enforcement but also an enabling capacity to support premises owners and to support and enable our built heritage and conservation to be brought up to a high standard.  We should see them as productive buildings, rather than heritage for heritage's sake.  They should be a central component of our housing policy and addressing issues around housing, as well as central component of our cultural well-being and sense of place.  That is critically important, not just in Dublin but right around the country.  Our Irish towns are also hugely important.  I recall Paddy Shaffrey's 1975 book, <i>The Irish Town: An Approach to Survival<\/i>, in which he spoke about the heritage-led regeneration of our towns.<br\/><br\/>The timing of this Bill, in tandem with the review that is taking place, could not be more appropriate.  It is also appropriate that it is Senator Norris who brought the Bill to the House.  I thank all the Members for their work on it and all the conservation organisations that have inputted into this important Bill.<br\/><br\/>Before I sit down, I welcome the pupils in the Gallery.

We have had a good and positive debate.  It is a start.  It is a conversation.  One of the things I like about our engagement here today is that everyone across the House got involved.  I thank the Members who came to the House today to participate and gave up their time for this important legislation.  I thank the Minister of State for his understanding.  I said at the outset that this Bill is not perfect and is not our full recommendation.  It is about getting a conversation going and engaging.  It is about collaboration.  We have to progress.  My colleague Senator McDowell made a very good point.  We want to encourage people into ownership of protected structures.  We need to look at our vernacular and industrial architecture.  Indeed, we need to look at our marine architecture, which is very significant on the island of Ireland.<\/p> <p>It is very important that we support conservation officers.  They have a meaningful role.  In the council where I live, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, there are architectural conservation officers tied in with the architects department, which is separate from the planning department.  We need to break down those demarcations because architecture, town planning, conservation and heritage, culture and biodiversity have to interplay and there has to be a greater synergy between them all.  I am delighted with the Minister of State's commitment to look at extending this and his belief that we should have a conservation officer everywhere.<\/p> <p>I thank everyone who has participated in the debate on the Bill.  As Senator Fitzpatrick said, we are working extensively in the committee, as is the Government, on reform and consolidation of the Planning Acts.  The Attorney General is doing a lot of work with all the Ministers in the Department.  That is progressive.  Hopefully a lot of this will inform and contribute to that debate.<\/p> <p>There is one point we did not discuss today, namely, information planning, IT planning and e-planning.  It is very onerous for an owner of a protected structure or a building within an architectural conservation area in some cases.  They must furnish up to ten sets of plans and colour drawings to the planning authority at great expense.  If Covid has taught us one thing, it is to embrace technology.  There are local authorities in this country that do not even have colour scanners.  If we want to modernise our planning system, we have to embrace technology.  One of the best organisations in this country, the Irish Architectural Archive, is located in an amazing building at the end of Merrion Square, which can be seen directly out this window.  I regularly bring planning applications and protected structure conservation drawings to that organisation and it welcomes them.  Yet local authorities all around the country are throwing them in the bin.  We have an issue there.  We should have one repository for all this information.  The Irish Architectural Archive acts as that.  We need to look at that issue.<\/p> <p>This has been a good day.
