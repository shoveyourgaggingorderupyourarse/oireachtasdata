As a small open economy, Ireland is supportive of international trade deals.  However, I am concerned about the impact elements of the deal could have on the beef sector.  At a time when the beef sector in Europe is facing significant uncertainty because of Brexit, the agreement includes a significant tariff rate quota for South American beef.  Over the full 20-year history of the negotiations, we have worked closely with member state colleagues and engaged directly with the Commission to make concerted efforts to minimise the EU offer on beef.  While evidence of these efforts appears to be reflected in the final offer, I am deeply concerned about the potential impact on the beef sector.  There may be opportunities for other parts of the agrifood industry such as the dairy sector and the drinks industry, but we will need to examine the text carefully to assess the full impact.  It is worth noting that the agreement will not come fully into effect for some years.  First, it will go through a process of legal scrubbing, which could take up to two years.  Subsequently, it will be put before the EU Trade Council for ratification by qualified majority vote before being put before the European Parliament.  If the agreement passes these hurdles, it is expected that the trade elements which fall under the competence of the Commission will be phased in over six years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300005#C00700","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1562143800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I have sympathy for the Minister because he is trying to defend the indefensible.

They play an important role in combatting illegal burial or the dumping of fallen stock, and are a vital conduit between the herd owner and the Department for traceability of all fallen bovines by their submission of documentation to the animal identification and movement system.  They also serve as centres at which my Department can carry out statutory BSE and TSE sampling on cattle and sheep which serves to underpin Ireland's bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, TSE, status and is a necessary part of the surveillance needed to ensure compliance with EU rules.<\/p>  <p>  Official controls are carried out in the knackeries by veterinary personnel of my Department to ensure compliance with the EU and national animal by-product regulations and also compliance with the specific operational conditions laid down for category 2 intermediate plants.  The Department carries out, on an ongoing basis, audits and routine and-or unannounced inspections at the category 2 intermediate plants.  In addition, Department inspectors take samples from dead cattle and sheep at knackeries for the purpose of disease surveillance under EU Regulation 999\/2001. <\/p>  <p>  As part of their conditions of approval, knackery operators are required to keep an up-to-date electronic intake register, completed appropriately, in chronological order.

The submission made by my Department to the EU Commission in request of the aid package is available on my Department's website: <\/p><p>I confirm to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that it did not request in any way, shape or form a reduction in suckler cow numbers.<\/p><p>This exceptional aid has been granted by the European Commission on the basis that the Irish beef sector is heavily reliant on export markets and is uniquely exposed to shifts in the UK market, in particular.  Additionally, Ireland's extensive beef system, with its comparatively long production cycle, presents challenges in responding to market shifts.  The Commission has also recognised that it is in the interests of the market stability of the EU beef sector to avoid a situation where downward price pressure on Irish beef spills over to other member states.<\/p><p>This temporary exceptional aid provision is given effect through a Commission implementing regulation.  This regulation, the draft of which is available on the Commission's website, will be published soon.<\/p><p>Article 1.3 of the implementing regulation provides as follows:<\/p><blockquote>The measures taken by Ireland shall be aimed at reducing production or restructuring the beef and veal sector and one or more of the following objectives:(a) implementation of quality schemes in the beef and veal sector or projects aiming at promoting quality and value added;<br \/><br \/>(b) boosting market diversification;<br \/><br \/>(c) protecting and improving the farmers&rsquo; environmental, climate and economic sustainability.<\/blockquote><p>Ireland must notify the Commission, no later than 31 July, of the measures to be taken in accordance with the regulation.

We will then put together the necessary administrative arrangements to invite applications, a closing date, processing of applications, a payment system and the back office requirements in terms of systems to support the payment and processing of all those applications.

My Department is the consent authority for the issuing of felling licences and does so in accordance with detailed procedures that take account of relevant environmental regulations and the principles of sustainable forest management.  There are certain exemptions under the Forestry Act, including, for example, felling in urban areas or felling of individual trees in certain circumstances.<\/p><p>The number of felling and thinning licences issued since 2014 is as follows.  In 2014, 2,390 licences were issued; in 2015, 2,518 licences were issued; in 2016, 6,514 licences were issued; in 2017, 3,003 licences were issued; in 2018, 3,603 were issued; and to date in 2019, 2,948 licences have been issued.  It is not possible to give a precise estimate of the number of trees felled in any one year under licence as this will depend on the area of the forest being felled, the species being managed, the age of the crop and the type and nature or cycle of the silvicultural interventions.  This is influenced by whether it is a first, second or later stage thinning or clearfell and-or whether the forest is managed under a continuous cover management system.<\/p><p>The licensing process makes it obligatory to replant a clearfelled site in forests in all but the most exceptional cases.  This avoidance of deforestation is essential in terms of meeting our climate change objectives.  The climate action plan 2019 recognises the key role afforestation has to play in climate change mitigation particularly through carbon sequestration.  Under current rules agreed as part of the EU effort sharing regulation, forestry can contribute some 2.1 million tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>per annum of carbon towards Ireland's emissions targets under the next climate mitigation period 2021 to 2030.  The climate action plan now sets a target of an average of 8,000 hectares of new planting per year.  While this will mostly yield benefits in the longer term post-2030, it will also contribute to our 2030 target through carbon sequestration.<\/p><p>My Department has approved an average of 9,000 hectares for new planting each year for the last three years.  This means that there are almost 10,000 approved and shovel-ready hectares available to the forestry sector that could be planted today.  The challenge is to ensure that all of the effort that goes into securing and approving new sites results in those sites being planted if planting levels are to increase and the target of 18% land cover is to be achieved.  I am committed to working towards this target through the continued provision of generous grants and premiums, engagement with a range of stakeholders from farmers to public bodies and a dedicated promotion and communication campaign and by examining ways in which farm forestry can be better integrated into the new CAP.  Knowledge transfer programmes and other initiatives that raise awareness of the economic and ecosystem benefits of forestry will continue to play an important role in tackling some of the barriers to planting.  Hedgerows are an important landscape feature that have been supported by various agri-environment schemes over the years.  In fact, my Department has facilitated the planting of around 11,000 km of new hedgerows and the rejuvenation of some 6,000 more under successive agri-environment schemes.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>These hedgerows could possibly represent a significant carbon sink and could potentially be used as a mitigation option.

That is a particularly challenging starting point.  Those countries, namely, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Austria, take a polar opposite view to us.  We have argued that in many ways, the CAP is a template that could be usefully emulated in other areas where the EU faces other big challenges such as in the areas of migration and security.  Those challenges are not a reason to raid the CAP budget, and the Taoiseach has been quite strong on this in the context of his address to the European Parliament in early 2018, when he clearly stated our willingness to pay additional money into the European Union, but on the basis that it supports programmes that are important to us.  This is a really difficult challenge on the basis that unanimity is required.  We remain steadfast in our view that the budget should be protected.

First and foremost, it is important to acknowledge how vital international trade deals are for Ireland.  As a small, open, export-led economy we very much support balanced international trade.  The key word is \"balanced\".  As a Government, we need to go through this deal in detail to see whether it strikes the right balance for Ireland.  As somebody who lives on a beef farm, I absolutely recognise and appreciate the very genuine concerns expressed by our farming community in relation to the Mercosur deal.  I say very clearly to farmers that the Government hears their concerns and understands them.  It is important to recognise that there are positives in this deal for Ireland and significant benefits for Irish exporters in sectors such as business services, chemicals, the drinks industry, machinery, medical devices and the dairy industry, with the reduction or elimination of tariffs and barriers to trade for these sectors.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, Ireland exported almost &euro;2 billion-worth of goods and services to the Mercosur region.  Trade with the region has grown by almost one fifth in the period from 2010 to 2016.  Against this level of export trade from Ireland to the Mercosur region, we anticipate that the EU-Mercosur agreement will allow Irish exporters to expand faster and take advantage of new opportunities.  Analysis by my Department estimates that a potential doubling of annual goods and services exports from Ireland is possible over the period to 2030.  The deal ensures that Irish whiskey and Irish cream liqueur are protected under the EU's GI scheme.  It is also important to point out the special provisions for SMEs in the agreement.  SMEs benefit most from the simplification of exporting and customs procedures, as the savings accrued are proportionately greater for them.  There are also positives for the dairy sector, with tariffs on 45,000 tonnes of product, including cheese, milk powder and infant formula, moving from circa 19% to a zero tariff over a ten-year period, presenting significant opportunities for the sector.  <\/p>  <p>  Those are some of the benefits from this deal and it is important that I put them on the record.  However, I am not going to stand here and say that this deal is perfect.  As I said at the outset, I absolutely recognise the concerns of our farmers.  While beef has been in the headlines in recent days, there are also very real concerns in relation to the poultry and pig sectors.  Sometimes, it is easy to stand on the opposite side of this House and criticise the Government and play politics with an issue like this.  I am from a rural community and have lived all my life on a farm.  As a Government, we absolutely fought to achieve the best deal possible for our farmers.  <\/p>  <p>  This deal was negotiated at EU level.  As a member state, Ireland has raised serious concerns over a long period in relation to beef access.  For my part, I raised these concerns at every opportunity at European Council meetings on trade.  I also raised concerns directly with the Trade Commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m.  As recently as 31 May, I wrote to Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m to once again highlight our serious concerns, particularly given the current challenges and uncertainty facing the Irish beef sector in the light of Brexit.  There has been a sustained effort across Government in relation to this, with both the Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Taoiseach raising it at the highest levels. <\/p>  <p>  Initially, the South American countries were looking for a beef quota of 300,000 tonnes.  The deal on the table offers 99,000 tonnes, and while that is still higher than we would want it to be, it is important to remember that it is less than one third of what was originally sought.  That reduction is due to the active efforts made by Ireland and other member states.  That 99,000 tonnes will be split between 45% frozen and 55% fresh and is carcass-weight equivalent; this is the whole animal and not just prime cuts.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement ensures that there will be equivalent standards.  EU SPS standards will not be relaxed in any way and remain non-negotiable.  The highest EU standards will be applied to all imported goods, especially food, so no hormone beef or GMOs will be allowed.  I assure farmers that equivalent standards are an integral part of this agreement.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to concerns regarding climate change and deforestation, the Mercosur countries, including Brazil, will have to fully implement the Paris Agreement as part of this deal.  If they do not, the deal is void and will fall. <\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that when this deal was announced last Friday, it understandably struck fear within the farming community.  It is important to remember that it is far from a done deal.  This is an agreement in principle and has to go through a legal process, which could take up to two years.  The deal then has to be voted through by a qualified majority on the Trade Council and go through the European Parliament, where the outcome is far from certain.  After all that, it is highly likely that more than 40 Parliaments, including this House, will have their say on it.  The quota for beef would be on a phased basis over five years, so we are talking about a deal that might not be fully felt until 2028.  Meanwhile, we are staring down the barrel of a possible no-deal Brexit on 31 October, which could deliver a serious shock to our economy and in particular have damaging consequences for the agricultural sector.  It is in the context of serious challenges such as Brexit that we need to step back and look at the bigger picture.  In conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, my Department will proceed to ensure that a comprehensive independent economic assessment is carried out on the Mercosur deal.  We have the time and space necessary to do that.  The shape that Brexit takes and the impact that has for the agricultural sector will be a key consideration of this economic assessment.  <\/p>  <p> The Taoiseach has made it very dear that the Government has an open mind in relation to this deal.  As I have outlined, there are benefits in certain sectors but there are also negatives.  We need to determine whether overall this will be a win or a lose for our economy.  We should not lose sight of the fact that in recent years, we have had EU trade agreements with Japan, Vietnam, Singapore and Mexico, which are very positive for our agricultural sector and provide for the export of 105,000 tonnes of European beef.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300012#K00400","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1562148000,"counter":130,"content":"<p>The Minister must conclude.

As per the Order of Business yesterday, it is essential that further time is set aside next week to thrash out this dangerous deal for the Irish agricultural sector and ensure that there can be proper examination and questions.  As a party, Fianna F&aacute;il believes that trade is good for the country and has been very supportive of the recent Canadian and Japanese deals.<\/p><p>When we look at this deal, and the impact it will have on the beef sector in particular, there is no doubt it will not benefit the Irish agricultural sector.  It represents a tremendous political failure by our Government.  It has not ensured that this deal is a balanced one from our national perspective.  It is certainly is not that.<\/p> <p> We are different from many other European countries in that the domestic agricultural sector, and the beef sector in particular, plays a significant part in our economy.  It plays a disproportionate and exceptionally valuable part in our economy, unlike in other European countries where the agricultural sector is much less significant.  I welcome the representatives here today from the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, the deputy president, Mr. Richard Kennedy, and the livestock chairperson, Mr. Angus Woods.  They are here because, as the Minister, Deputy Creed, heard over the last few days, they are extremely worried about the impact this deal will have on the future livelihoods of the farmers whom they represent.<\/p> <p> I know the Minister indicated this morning that this deal will have to go through legal processes and will then have to go before the Trade Council for qualified majority voting.  There is no doubt, however, that what is on the table now is almost 100,000 tonnes of beef.  That would have a massive impact on our agricultural sector.  This agreement has been delivered at a high political level between the European Commission and its counterpart in South America.  The Irish Government representative on the Commission, Mr. Phil Hogan, was a key part of that process.<\/p> <p> I know the Minister will tell us that he has made representations in recent times about the threat this deal poses.  From the questions we asked here in the past, however, there is no doubt that it was clear that the Government had accepted the suggested figure of 70,000 tonnes for beef imports that was on the table until some months ago.  The answers to the questions we asked clearly show that was something that the Government had accepted.  We now see that what is finally delivered is 100,000 tonnes of beef imports.  The EU's own impact assessment, which was published in 2016, shows that the impact of beef trade deals would lead to a hit of some &euro;5 billion on the EU beef market and a cut of up to 16% in European beef prices.<\/p> <p> The farmers here today and those all over the country who have been expressing their concerns in the last few days will tell the Minister very clearly that this is a hit that they simply cannot take.  This situation has to be examined in the context of Brexit as well.  European consumption of beef is relatively static and Ireland supplies 102% of the Europe Union's beef needs.  If we take Britain out of that equation, then that figure would go up to 116%.  We know what that would mean in respect of the pressure on farmers and the downward spiral in beef prices that would cause.  <\/p> <p> The other key issue which makes no sense is the impact of this deal on climate change.  This deal has been the subject of negotiations for 20 years and it predates many of the climate change targets and the threats that will result from the effects of climate change.  This deal, however, has come up with an offering that involves taking beef from South America.  In Brazil, for example, beef is produced with four times the carbon footprint that it is in Ireland.  This is at a time, as we heard earlier, when the European Commission is providing funding aimed at reducing domestic beef production in Ireland.<\/p> <p> The beef offering within this deal is something that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, have to resist at all costs.  They have to bring about some change in that part of the deal because our agricultural sector cannot take such an impact.  It is a tremendous failure that we have found ourselves in this position.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300012#K00700","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562148600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>The Minster's opening statement definitely did not fill me or any other beef farmer with confidence.  I am a dairy and beef farmer and I know full well the major economic pressure that our sector is under.  The Minister also referred to the fact that other trade deals have been made in recent years.  It is the case that numerous markets have been opened up for Irish beef.  We have sold very little beef into those markets outside of the EU, however.  The Minister stated that we have to look at the bigger picture.  I interpret that as meaning that the Minister is stating that he is going to sacrifice our beef industry for the sake of other sectors.<\/p>  <p>  He also asked if this deal represented a win or a loss for our economy.  Ireland's rural economy cannot survive without our beef industry.  It is the cornerstone of rural Ireland.  If this going to be another occasion when something adjudged as good for the Pale is also seen as good for the rest of Ireland, then this Government will be neglecting rural Ireland.  Our poultry and pig sectors will also come under pressure as there are concessions regarding those areas in the deal as well.  We are going to be 116% self-sufficient in beef production in Europe when Brexit happens.  It is incomprehensible that anyone would contemplate allowing beef from South America to enter the EU market in this context.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy McConalogue mentioned climate change.  This is the issue that is really annoying Irish farmers.  They are prepared to adapt to climate change and they know that that adaptation will increase their costs of production.  They are, however, prepared to do that because they recognise that climate change is a fact of life.  What farmers cannot understand is this two-timing that the Commission is engaged in at the moment.  It is agreeing a deal that will help the large industrial powers in Europe and that will be good for the Germans, the French and the Italians as it will allow them to sell their industrial goods in South America.  We in Ireland, however, will be asked to tackle climate change while farmers in South America will be able to go ahead and do whatever they want.  <\/p>  <p>  There has been much publicity in the past concerning production standards in South America.  We are told that there will now be an insistence on adherence to certain standards.  A significant amount of South American beef is already entering Europe.  This deal will put the final nail into the coffin of not just the Irish beef industry but the European beef industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300013#L00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1562148600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>The real issue with the Mercosur countries, as both of the Ministers are aware, is that they have a much lower production cost for beef than we do in Ireland or anywhere else in Europe.  Standards in South America are much lower, however.  That means that beef can be produced at a lower price compared with EU farmers and as a result South American farmers can undercut the market.  The market is what all of this is about.  There are also consumer protection issues with this deal in respect of the hormones and pharmaceuticals used in the production process in South America that are banned in the EU.<\/p><p>The problem we have is that the model of farming in the South American countries is entirely different from the model of farming that we have in Europe generally and that we certainly have in Ireland.  Livestock farming in Ireland is a managed process.  Farmers work with their cattle every day and know them.  In Argentina and Brazil, beef farming is based on a ranching model where thousands of cattle are spread over a huge area that is probably the size of a county.  In Ireland, we are talking about farms with an average size of 30 ha to 80 ha.  It is entirely different.  That means that cattle in South America are allowed to roam free.  There are no tags, no traceability and no disease prevention.  The animals there are treated for various diseases, mainly coming from mosquitoes and other things,<i>en masse<\/i>with pharmaceutical products that would be banned in Europe.  South American beef farmers do not have to register or tag their cattle until 90 days before they are ready to be slaughtered and exported.  <\/p><p>That gives us the context of farmers in Ireland compared with those in South America.  That is the situation that we have to understand.  It is clear that the farm organisations in Ireland and most other European countries oppose this deal with Mercosur.  It will allow a sharp increase in the production of Brazilian beef and its importation into Europe with preferential tariffs.  The reality is that that will throw the EU beef sector over a cliff.  This deal is bad for European consumers because Brazil and other South American countries fail to meet EU standards.  The key issues involved are traceability, food safety, animal health and environmental controls.  Research conducted by the European Commission Joint Research Centre suggested that if imports of beef from Mercosur countries into Europe were to rise dramatically that would drive EU beef prices down by 16% and would cost the EU beef sector as much as &euro;5 billion in revenue.  <\/p><p>The potential impact on Irish beef farmers could be a loss of between &euro;500 million and &euro;750 million.  The Minster, Deputy Creed, has already stated that this is a very disappointing deal for Irish beef farmers.  The deal is coming at a time when 300,000 tonnes of beef exports into Britain annually are under threat because of Brexit.  The Minister has also welcomed the deal and said that it removes tariffs of 28% on Irish dairy products going into the Mercosur countries.  The reality is that our dairy industry is already at top capacity.  It is already doing very well and there are already major export markets available in places such as China.  We do not need to export our dairy products into Latin America, even at reduced tariff rates.  The Minister is not comparing like with like and that also has to be part of this context.<\/p><p>In a recent interview in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, the Minister also stated that the beef agreement was the sweetener in this deal.  I know he was putting that aspect into context, but that tells us where we are regarding the Irish beef sector.  <\/p><p>The Irish beef sector, which is on its knees, is being used as a sweetener to achieve a deal that will allow cars and pharmaceuticals to be sold to Latin America.  The use of these pharmaceuticals would probably not be allowed in Europe.  That is the position.<\/p> <p> As has been mentioned, one of the biggest impacts this agreement will have is on the environment.  The rainforests in Latin America comprise half of the world's remaining rainforest and represent the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world.  It is under threat as it has never been before.  This deal will facilitate the aims of a right-wing Brazilian Government which denies climate change and is in cahoots with Donald Trump.  It says that it wants to continuously expand into the rainforest and does not want to conserve the environment or protect the native people who live in those areas in any way.  The President of Brazil is on record as saying he wants to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change.  This Mercosur deal involves many contradictions.<\/p> <p> The Minister stated that EU standards \"will not be relaxed in any way\" and that \"they remain non-negotiable\".  That position does not stand up to any logical consideration when dealing with Latin America and the current President of Brazil in particular.  Nothing we see coming from that country suggests it wants to meet EU standards.  In fact, it is saying it wants to move in the other direction by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and increasing the size of its already expansive cattle herd.  It wants to cut down the rainforest to do this and continues to do so apace.  In the month of May alone, an area the size of County Leitrim was cut down to make space for cattle ranching.  The situation in this regard is absolutely dire.<\/p> <p> The Minister also mentioned that the 99,000 tonnes of beef is one third of what had originally been sought, which was 300,000 tonnes.  What else would one expect?  Parties negotiating a trade agreement always set their targets much higher than what they expect to achieve.  I am quite sure the Latin American parties to the agreement were more than happy to get 100,000 tonnes of beef into the European Union.<\/p> <p> Another issue which comes into play is the manner in which this trade deal will be ratified.  As we know, it will be another two years before it goes through and it must first go to the European Council of Ministers.  Will our Minister vote against it?  Will the Irish Minister work with ministers from other countries that have expressed doubts about this deal, such as Poland, France and Belgium, to build a bloc large enough to prevent it going through?  If it goes to the European Parliament, will Government and Fianna F&aacute;il MEPs vote against it?  I assure the Minister that Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs will vote against it.  Will the D&aacute;il vote on this issue and, if not, why not?  Is it because of the Lisbon treaty or the Nice treaty?  We need to make that clear.  <\/p> <p> We need to understand where we are in this regard and make a very firm political choice.  Are we going to stand up for the Irish farming community and the environmental lobby around the world or are we going to stand for big business?  That is the choice.  At this time in the development of global capital, we must state clearly whether we are going to stand with big capital against the environmental lobby and the farming community in Ireland because that is what we are talking about doing.  This choice lies with the Government and its Ministers in Europe as well as those political parties which have MEPs.  We have to make that choice.  <\/p> <p> I appeal to the Government to stand firm and to understand that, if the future is to be worth anything for the generations to come, any trade deal must be measured against the 17 sustainable development goals.  People all over the world are talking about climate change while we are talking about allowing a trade deal that flies in the face of the sustainable development goals to which this Government and all governments around the world have signed up.  This particular trade deal flies in the face of more than half of those goals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300013#L00300","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562149200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I have already indicated that this deal will have a significant impact on rural Ireland.  It has taken 20 years to get the EU-Mercosur deal to this stage and we now have agreement in principle.  There may be many a slip between the cup and the lip, as they say.  It must be approved by the European Parliament and by a qualified majority of the Council of Ministers.  That is a worry.  While we can talk about vetoes and so on, our vote may well have little impact on the overall result.  We have to see this as an opening shot.  We can try to amend and improve this deal.<\/p>  <p>  I have been here for longer than some of those who have spoken.  I remember the guts of 20 years ago people were talking about between 70,000 and 75,000 tonnes of beef.  That was the idea at that time, as I recall very well.  It will be another five to seven years before any of this deal will be implemented so there is lots of time and considerable scope to make changes.  There will have to be changes and I look forward to some emerging from the proposed economic assessment. <\/p>  <p>  I will make four short points.  It is unfortunate that this whole issue has emerged just before Brexit is finalised.  We need to know where we stand with Brexit because, with the way it is heading, there will be significant problems ahead.  We know what will become of the British market.  The market will be oversubscribed and saturated and there will be less consumption because the British market will not be available.  Britain will also bring in goods to replace those supplied by our market.  There will also be an impact on the Common Agricultural Policy arising from the loss of Britain's contribution of between &euro;10 billion and &euro;12 billion.  These are all serious issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party has never advocated free trade.  We are in favour of fair trade.  There is a significant difference.  Conversely, many of those involved in industry, particularly the agriculture industry, are firm proponents of free trade.  They have taken issue with me many times because we have always advocated market intervention at various points, much to the chagrin of many of those people.  Some recent deals have resulted in significant benefits.  We have to acknowledge that.  If a trade deal is well regulated, it can raise the living standards of workers and consumers not just in Ireland, but across Europe and in the countries with which the deal is made.  That has to be taken into consideration.<\/p>  <p>  I am always concerned by the strategy pursued by the United States of America.  We now have a man tearing around the world tearing up international agreements.  It is time for us in Europe to show that making deals is better for workers and the environment than protectionism.  That is what we are seeing and it is the reason I do not believe anything coming from the US.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister outlined, parts of the economy, including the dairy and pharmaceutical sectors, would benefit from this deal.  Not all sectors will benefit, however.  In my area, the beef and pig industries will be particularly affected.  It is clear that the deal is bad for Irish livestock farmers and the wider meat industry.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has admitted that.  It is as simple as that.  We all know that bringing beef into a saturated market will present a problem.  <\/p>  <p>  Spokespersons have been jumping up and down trying to outdo one another in saying how bad the deal will be for farmers.  It will be bad but in addition to roaring and shouting we must have solutions.  I told the Minister he should oppose the deal, which is grand but, when he opposes it, where will it go?  He will have to work with others to deal with the qualified majority vote, about which I am very worried.  The agreement will go through regardless of our opposition because it seems President Emmanuel Macron is happy with it, which is something of a change on his part.  This deal must be subject to critical review, analysis and assessment in order that we can see where positive changes can be made.  We have to look at the rest of the deal.  What alternative will deliver higher wages for workers and lower prices for consumers?  What alternative will save the rainforest?  We need to get into the detail of the agreement and next week's debate will be very important in that regard.  We must get down to the minutiae of the deal.<\/p>  <p>  The inclusion of 99,000 tonnes of beef in the deal is a serious problem for Ireland because we export nine out of every ten animals we produce.  The Minister has said that imports under the Mercosur deal will have to meet EU food standards so there will be no access to Europe for beef from animals treated with hormones, for example.  That is a concern.  Deputy Martin Kenny is right.  I was in South America and I saw the ranches that produce this beef.  How can we ensure these standards are met?  The European Food and Veterinary Office is based in County Meath.  It will be responsible for ensuring that low-standard food does not enter the European market.  Phytosanitary controls and so on are of great concern.  Will they be implemented in time?  <\/p>  <p>  The cost base for Mercosur farmers is much lower than that for Irish farmers.  I saw that in the ranches where production is extensive.  This will make it impossible to compete at market level.  Will this 99,000 tonnes comprise premium steaks?  Will it be frozen or fresh meat?  These are all issues.  Will the beef be hormone-free?  If it was made up of steak, the industry could close down.<\/p><p>That would wipe it out altogether, which be unacceptable.  Can we modify that part of the deal?  Quite apart from quantity, can we deal with the issue of quality?  The bottom line is that either we achieve changes to the trade deal to protect our meat industry, which has to be our first priority, or we will have to have a very serious conversation with our farmers on financial systems to allow the meat sector to diversify and secure alternative markets.  Seeking alternative markets is not easy.  When one sees 25,000 tonnes going somewhere, one thinks it is great, but four times that amount is coming in here.  We might well see changes to beef production in other EU member states to try to create more space for our beef.  I would not rule this out because grass-fed Irish beef has a lower environmental impact and is better quality.  It is hormone-free, green and fresh and other member states may well, in light of their industrial bases, see benefits of giving ground to Ireland in that regard.  We should try to secure that.<\/p> <p> Calling for the scrapping of the deal is great.  I am calling for it myself.  However, we should be clear and we should not be trying to fool anyone.  That is just populism and grandstanding, which are things of which I am sick.  One has to get in there to see whether one can make effective changes because if one works global rules right, they will bring significant benefits.  I hope, therefore, that what emerges is positive action on the part of our Government to achieve significant changes that will benefit Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300014#M00200","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562149800,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Penrose for sticking to the time limit.

This might just be the EU's worst trade agreement for the climate\".  That is the view of Perrine Fournier, a campaigner with the forestry NGO, Fern.  Every time these free trade agreements, FTAs, are negotiated, the real character of the European Union is exposed as an organisation which exists to promote the interests of big business within Europe and which pays lip service to human rights, sustainability and the environment, all of which it is willing to sacrifice on the altar of profit.  It is an organisation which engages in trade negotiation behind closed doors, with privileged access for big corporations while even governments fail to get access.  Just recently, the French Government complained that it did not have access to the latest papers in these negotiations with Mercosur.<\/p>  <p>  A couple of years ago, the EU pledged that it would halt global deforestation by 2020.  In the Trade for All strategy of 2015, the EU stated, as it has on multiple occasions, that trade would be used as a lever to promote sustainable development and human rights.  All of that is to be sacrificed, however, in the interests of, on the one hand, the big car companies in Europe and, on the other, big ranchers in Mercosur countries, particularly those in Brazil.  That is the way these deals work.  They can only be derailed by a mass movement from below of people who stand for a very different model of trade based on solidarity, mutual assistance and co-operation.  This is a complete disaster for the environment and the halting of deforestation.  In the context of the latter, the Bolsonaro Government has put indigenous lands demarkation under the jurisdiction of the agriculture Ministry deliberately to pave the way for the cattle and soy agribusinesses to accelerate their sweep through the Amazon.  This deal makes the EU complicit in the extensive attacks on human rights the Bolsonaro Government is carrying out.  During the election campaign, Bolsonaro promised to end all forms of activism in Brazil and he has begun to implement that promise since he came to power.  This is a disaster for the indigenous people in Brazil in particular because at least 14 protected indigenous territories are reported to be under attack from invaders.  In many cases, those invaders are sponsored by the big corporations that want them off the land so that they can raze the forests and use the ground for ranching.  The Bolsonaro Government has also abolished 35 national councils of social participation involving indigenous people.  That is the logic of the model of trade pursued by the European Union.  It is a logic accepted by the big parties, including Fianna F&aacute;il, when it comes to most trade agreements, and it must be resisted from below if it is to be stopped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300015#N00300","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1562149800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>This deal should be opposed completely.  The Government should oppose this deal if it cares at all and if there is any meaning to its concerns about the environment, the protection of human rights and the protection of the interests of farmers.  Any equivocation about that exposes whose agenda this Government and the EU are really championing, namely the agenda of big business and major corporations which could not give a hoot about climate change, the environment, the struggle of our farmers to maintain a livelihood or the struggles of indigenous people and small producers in the Mercosur countries themselves.  All of those will lose out as a result of this agreement.  That is extraordinary when all of the debate in this country and globally is about the need for emergency action.  The Government says it is interested in the climate emergency yet it wants to sign off a deal under which we will export fossil-fuel-guzzling German cars to Mercosur countries in order that they can send us beef which is produced by cutting down thousands of square km of rainforest.  Goods will travel thousands of miles to Europe, leading to more greenhouse gas emissions being pumped out, while we send manufactured cars over there to pump out more.  This beggars belief.  The irony is that the entire country has been gripped by the fear of Brexit but this agreement is Brexit writ large and on a scale ten to 15 times greater in respect of the race to the bottom these deals promote.  It is truly shocking.<\/p>  <p>  The Government states that it will carry out an economic assessment of how the deal will impact on our economy.  I say, \"Farmers of Ireland, beware; the sell-out is coming\".  Just as the fishing industry was sold out to Europe, farmers will now be sold out for the benefit of certain manufacturers, particularly in the pharmaceutical and medical instruments industries.  Farmers across Europe are about to be sold out for the benefit of the German car industry.  It is not just about that, however, it is also about the globe.  It is about the planet that the Government states it cares so much about.  In the past ten years, rainforest covering the same amount of land as Portugal has been cut down.  Bolsonaro is stating unequivocally that he is a climate change denier.  He does not give a damn about the climate and he is waging a war against the indigenous people, small farmers and small producers, crushing their human rights and cutting down these forests to produce cheap, lower-quality beef for the benefit of the ranchers and major agricultural producers of Latin America.  This deal should be opposed root and branch.  Anything less is a sell-out.<\/p>  <p>  My final point is a bit of an \"I told you so\" but it has to be made.  This deal is the reason the left opposed the Lisbon treaty and the other treaties that introduced qualified majority voting on global trade deals.

I will begin now with those general points.  The first relates to trade agreements generally and the need to proof them against climate change and the undermining of workers' rights.  Free trade agreements include the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, which we have debated on many occasions.  It is a system which threatens public budgets and the environment.  At the heart of ISDS is a mechanism for foreign investors to sue national governments.  Recent examples include two oil firms which used ISDS to avoid paying tax in Vietnam and a similar case in Croatia.  There was also an example in France where a company was able to weaken a climate change law by threatening an ISDS suit.  ISDS is biased in favour of the interests of investors at the expense of the public interest because the public cannot sue the companies involved on human rights grounds.<\/p><p> I would like to mention another aspect of Mercosur to which I drew attention last week.  Recently, representatives of over 350 civil society organisations sent a letter to the EU asking it to halt the negotiations on the basis of the deteriorating human rights and environmental conditions in Brazil.  In April, 600 scientists and representatives of more than 300 indigenous groups called on the EU to support human rights and sustainable development in light of increased human rights violations and threats to indigenous peoples and their lands in ecologically valuable areas.  Civil society in Brazil is under severe threat because of President Bolsonaro's campaign of ending any form of activism.  Under a plan he is implementing, the Brazilian Government has the power to supervise and monitor the activities and actions of international agencies and non-governmental organisations in Brazil that are drawing attention to these matters.  It is telling that the Brazilian foreign affairs and environment ministers are global warming deniers and the Brazilian department of climate change has been abolished.<\/p> <p> We debated climate change last week.  Is there any realisation that massive numbers of cattle in Brazil need grazing land?  Some of this land is being provided by taking lands belonging to indigenous people and removing forests that are valuable from a biodiversity perspective.  At the same time, Irish farmers are being asked to grow more trees.  The irony is just in the middle of it.  It is totally illogical because we are not being loyal to what we have been saying about climate change recently.<\/p> <p> It is incredible that it has taken almost 20 years to get to this point.  It is still not right.  Twenty years ago, there was little or no discussion about climate change.  This is the first area that must be re-examined because of what we now realise.  The second area is human rights and labour rights, which should be central to trade agreements.  A new business and human rights committee has finally been set up with a chairperson and a meeting is planned.  Will that committee have a role in examining the Mercosur deal from a labour rights perspective?  That is what the committee is supposed to be doing.<\/p> <p> We know what is involved in this deal.  The EU is Mercosur's largest trade and investment partner and second largest business, trade and goods partner.  The EU is the biggest foreign investor in the area.  Mercosur is a major investor in Europe.  In the middle of all of this, a trade war is taking place between the US and China.  Venezuela was suspended from Mercosur in 2017.  We can see that there is a political aspect to this as well.<\/p> <p> We are all very concerned about food safety.  We do not know enough about what is being fed to cattle in Mercosur countries.  The details we have are very disturbing.  We know it is going to be challenging for Ireland and for agriculture here.  The Irish beef sector is dominated by big farmers.  We are conscious of how cattle are fed.  It is good to see movement among small farmers, who are becoming more proactive in taking on the big farmers in terms of the kind of meat they are producing.  It is possible that there are opportunities here.  There is space for the smaller farmers.<\/p> <p> The Mercosur deal has been seen as a landmark decision and a truly historic moment.  We know that tariffs for the Mercosur countries have been eliminated.  There will be increased access to the EU market for agricultural goods from those countries.  There will be an improved export environment for the EU.  There is a perception that agriculture is the trade-off to facilitate the gains being made elsewhere.<\/p> <p> If the forthcoming Argentinian elections bring change, it is possible that Argentina will not stay in Mercosur.  The opposition leader, Alberto Fern&aacute;ndez, has said that there is nothing to celebrate in the agreement, but lots of things to worry about.  As we know, there are concerns throughout Europe.<\/p> <p> Many advocates of trade deals use all the usual clich&eacute;s in pointing to the liberal economic agenda, referring to trickle-down economics and suggesting that growth equates to prosperity.  We know trade deals like this one prioritise the interests of large multinational companies above all else.  That is essentially what this deal is doing.  It is disappointing that it has taken a trade deal that affects agriculture in this country to bring about a reasonable conversation on the merits of trade deals.  This issue had gone off the agenda.<\/p> <p> It has been suggested that the German car industry is at the centre of this.  There is a belief that this deal is a back door for EU cars to get into South American countries.  Much more scrutiny is needed in this regard.  The number of people working in the lobbying industry in Brussels is 30,000 and counting.  According to one critic, it is like an invasion from the corporates there.  We know how much influence this &euro;1 billion industry is having on legislation.  We need to be aware of all the lobbying that is going on and of whose interests are being looked after and whose services are being paid for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300015#N00500","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562150400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Michael Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300016#O00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1562150400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

He did this in his answers to Deputies Miche&aacute;l Martin and Mary Lou McDonald, as well as myself and others, from the moment he stood up until the moment he sat down.  He said many times that the deal had to be looked at \"in the round\".  He said that the deal had positive aspects, but I do not believe that to be the case.  It is a negative deal for our farming community.  It is wrong for an Irish Government to try to promote such a deal by suggesting it has positive aspects.

I am worried he will take the Government line, which is that there are positive aspects to the deal and that it has to be examined.  It is rubbish to talk about evaluating it.

Farmers are in a trap or vice because of Brexit, the Mercosur deal and the activities of the factories.  They are facing extinction.

They are facing a wipe-out if the Minister does this and allows beef in from South America where they are cutting down the rainforest.<\/p> <p> Commissioner Hogan and, I believe, the Minister mentioned that farmers must cut production and plant forestry.  Forestry will wipe out the rural communities forever because when 1 acre or 100 acres is planted there is no life in that side of the country.  To think that the Minister is even dreaming of doing this is terrible.  The Government is already making farmers feel guilty for producing beef.  The Taoiseach has said he is doing his bit to reduce the carbon footprint.  We can prove that our animals are reared in green grass up to their eyes.  In Brazil and Argentina they have humps on them and are in dirty dusty yards with troughs around them.  We are doing it the right way. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300016#O00500","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562151000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>In its programme for Government this Government promised to ensure the national interest would be protected in any future trade discussions with a particular focus on beef and safety standards.  This Government has failed on both counts in the Mercosur deal which looks like it will allow 99,000 tonnes of beef into the EU each year from the Mercosur countries.  My concern is that if we use beef from these countries, where already there are traceability and safety issues and the environmental standards are below EU standards, the beef industry will face decimation and the safety of the public will be at risk.  If this Government agrees to a Mercosur deal, it will wipe out beef farmers throughout Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  My calls for stand-alone Ministers for agriculture and the marine, respectively, have been criticised by the Government.  Both it and the European Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, are asleep at the wheel.  Apart from kicking the can down the road past the next general election, what concrete steps will this Government take to protect the beef industry and the public?  My colleagues in the Rural Independent Group are calling on Fine Gael to table a motion on this deal next week.  Irrespective of whether this happens, we will be calling on Fianna F&aacute;il to immediately bring down the Government.  It has to fall because if rural Ireland is to be saved from further ruination under the most arrogant and anti-rural Government this island has ever seen, this is the only way out.  Next Wednesday, the Beef Plan Movement, which has 20,000 members, will lead a protest to Leinster House.  These are beef and suckler farmers who are on their knees.  Despite having 20,000 members, the movement feels it has no voice.<\/p>  <p>  I asked the Minister last week about the &euro;100 million to be spent.  He has spoken to the affected farmers previously but he told me he had spoken to them about how the &euro;100 million that is coming will be spent.  He needs to correct the Official Report in that regard.  These farmers have not spoken to anybody and they have asked me who, if anyone, the Minister spoke to about this funding.  The importation into Europe of 99,000 tonnes of beef from the Mercosur countries is a public safety issue and I am calling on the Government and Opposition parties to ensure that all beef on sale in Ireland and the rest of the EU meets current EU standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300017#P00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1562151000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>The announcement on Friday last of an EU-Mercosur trade agreement marks the end of 20 years of negotiations between the two blocs.  While I acknowledge the importance of balanced international trade deals for Ireland's economy, including its agricultural sector, I am disappointed that the agreement includes a significant tariff rate quota, TRQ, that would allow the importation of beef from Mercosur to the European Union at preferential tariff rates, at a time when the beef sector in Europe is facing significant uncertainty because of Brexit.  I and my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, along with others, have worked hard with colleagues in other member states to mitigate the potential impact of a Mercosur-EU agreement on European agriculture.  While the outcome is disappointing, the length of time it has taken to arrive at this point is at least in part due to the concerted efforts over many years and by many governments of Ireland and other like-minded member states to protect the European Union agriculture sector to the maximum extent possible.  In addition to pointing out the considerable difficulties that the concession of a significant beef tariff rate quota would create for the Irish beef sector over a period when the EU beef market is likely to continue to be very delicately balanced, and against the backdrop of a potentially very damaging impact from Brexit, Ireland repeatedly called for a coherence between the European trade policy's objective and its climate change responsibilities to be demonstrated by not extending more favourable conditions to beef imports from trade partners that are producing in a less environmentally sustainable manner.  We have focused not just on these market impact and sustainability aspects but also on the size of the quota, the technicalities associated with quota management and the cumulative impact of potential concessions under the range of current and future negotiations in order to mitigate the outcome of these negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The beef TRQ agreed is considerably less than had been sought by Mercosur countries, which at one point were demanding a quota of 300,000 tonnes.  In addition, the TRQ is split between fresh and frozen and will be phased in over several years.  As such, if the agreement were to be implemented, its full impact is unlikely to be felt for a considerable time.  We must also acknowledge that there may be some opportunities for other sectors, including the dairy and drinks industry.  In addition, our colleagues at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation estimate that a potential doubling of annual goods and services exports from Ireland is possible over the period to 2030.  <\/p>  <p>  It is early days yet and there are still several steps to be taken before the agreement can be implemented.  It will first be put through a process of legal drafting and translation which could take several years.  It will then be submitted to the Council for approval by a qualified majority vote and then to the European Parliament for its consent.  If provisionally applied at that point, it would still take several years to come into effect.  The Oireachtas and other national parliaments will also have a role in ratification.  We will examine the text carefully to assess its impact on the Irish economy and on the agrifood sector generally and reflect on the appropriate next steps in terms of engaging further with member state colleagues and examining ways to diminish the potential impact of the agreement.<\/p>  <p>  This is an agreement between an outgoing Commission and Mercosur countries.  It is a deal that has not been ratified by any member state or government, the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament or any state parliament.  There is some considerable distance to travel, as Deputy Penrose reflected quite accurately.  Members have rightly alluded to the environmental concerns around our systems of production relative to those of South American countries and in particular Brazil and the Bolsonaro government.  The very fact that within this agreement there is for the first time in a trade agreement a chapter that makes environmental standards a critical issue is an opportunity for us.  We can use that and in the intervening period ensure the drafting of the agreement double-stitches that in and so thwarts the ambition of those countries if their environmental standards do not meet the standards required of European farmers.  It is a deal breaker.  While I do not wish to celebrate the lack of environmental ambition or commitment in those countries, that this is an issue we can use to our advantage should not be overlooked.  No agreement has been ratified by anybody yet.<\/p>  <p>  From an agricultural point of view, I consider the deal to be deeply disappointing.  I acknowledge that there are opportunities in other areas, including in some respects the drinks industry and dairy sector, but overall in terms of the rural economy and the impact on the beef sector and the 100,000 who gain some element of their income from that sector, it is deeply disappointing.<\/p>  <p>  There are Members in this Chamber who have consistently opposed every trade deal while, at the same time, refusing to acknowledge that the European Union has been a champion of environmental standards and workers' rights.  This deal, which is the first that has included a specific reference to environmental standards, may well be an opportunity for us.  There is a considerable way to travel and, as Minister with responsibility for agriculture, I will exhaust all opportunities.  We are not without friends in this debate.  Other member states have expressed serious concerns.  The French, in particular, who have concerns about beef, have expressed reservations about sugar and ethanol.  We will forge alliances and work to ensure that in the intervening period we salvage the best possible outcome from what is proposed.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate Deputy McConalogue's point about Commissioner Hogan.  In all my dealings with the Commissioner, I have found him to be an ally in trying to mitigate the worst excesses of this deal.  I remind the House that working collaboratively with him, the lead negotiator, the Commissioner for Trade, is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, which is aligned with Fianna F&aacute;il. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300017#P00300","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1562151000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I thank the Members for their contributions.

The cost of housing is growing at twice the rate of average earnings across the country.  Rent prices have soared by 8% nationally.  In Dublin, the cost of rent makes up more than half of the minimal living costs.  At 68%, which is a stark number, the rate of home ownership is now the lowest since 1971.  The younger generation, essentially, have been locked out of home ownership and have lost confidence in ever being able to afford to buy a house.  Thirty five years of age is now the new average before people can buy a house.  In the 1990s it was 26 years of age.  When Deputy Varadkar become Taoiseach two years ago the number of children homeless was at 1,881.  Today, the figure is over double that at 3,794.  I recall the then Minister for Housing, Deputy Coveney, promising in June 2016 that child homelessness would be over by the end of that year.<\/p>  <p>  This, by any yardstick, is a litany of failure.  Plan after plan has been produced and they have not worked in accordance with the targets set in each plan.  There was an over-reliance on the free market, the private market, to solve all the issues.  I suggest that over-reliance has backfired and failed.<\/p>  <p>  There have been attempts to engineer a change from home ownership to rental.  The current budget alone in terms of rental schemes is anywhere up to &euro;900 million, an extraordinary figure.  It is in the billions of euro when one goes back over the last five or six years.  In terms of house building, either council houses or affordable houses, it has dwarfed any of that.  That was a clear policy to engineer and to contrive people to move away from ever owning homes to renting.  All the initiatives that were announced from rapid build, the affordable rental schemes, the repair and leasing scheme to the home loan scheme have failed spectacularly in the targets they set.  They have not reached their targets.  They have been bedevilled with bureaucracy, lack of urgency and delayed delivery.  Rent pressure zones have now been extended to 19 areas but rents continue to sore.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach answer clearly when does he expect we will have a situation where children will no longer have to live in hotel rooms or emergency accommodation and will have access to public housing?  When will we see meaningful progress in the provision of affordable homes for people?  Does the Taoiseach accept that home ownership is no longer attainable for young people under the current policies and that they have no confidence in ever being able to buy a house?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300018#Q00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1562151600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>The Government acknowledges the enormous challenges we face as a country when it comes to housing.  All of us feel particularly strongly about the fact that there are families living in emergency accommodation.  While the family hubs are much better than hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation they are by no means a long-term solution.  It is our objective to reduce the number of families experiencing homelessness, living in emergency accommodation, month on month, year on year.  There was a slight fall in the number last month but we want to see it continuing to fall very month into the future.  We want to minimise the number of people who end up in emergency accommodation and, if people end up in it, we want to make sure it is for a very short period of time, for weeks or maybe a few months but certainly not for years.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think it is possible for anyone to say there will never be anyone who has to go into emergency accommodation.  There always have been a certain number of people in emergency accommodation for one reason or another, particularly people who become homeless suddenly who were not on the housing list, but it should not be the type of figures it is now.  We want to make sure it starts falling and continues to fall.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to housing, I am somebody who is very committed to home ownership.  This Government believes in home ownership.  As the Deputy pointed out 68% to 70% of people in Ireland own their own home, which is much higher than in most European countries.  I know others prefer a European housing solution based on renting for life, a public housing and social housing based solution.  I believe in home ownership and that people should be able to own their own home, that that is a socially desirable thing.  In order to deliver high levels of home ownership, we need the private market and the private sector because it has never been the case that Governments build houses for people to own.

As to what are we doing about it, there is the help-to-buy scheme which has already benefitted 10,000 people, mostly people in their 20s and 30s, helping them to get a deposit to buy their own home.  It will help many more people in the future.  Approximately 1,000 more people have been helped with the Rebuilding Ireland home loan to get a low interest rate home loan to be able to buy their own home.<\/p>  <p>  The other area is supply.  In the past 12 months, 22,000 new homes have been added to our housing stock.  That is 22,000 new houses or apartments.  We are meeting our targets in terms of supply.  If there was a way to do it quicker I guarantee the Deputy we would do it.  Given from where we have come with a collapse in the financial and construction sectors, we can only ramp up supply so quickly.  This year we will see between 22,000 and 25,000 new homes built, with next year probably hitting higher than that again, and we will get to the point where the additional supply is meeting the demand.

He said there was a slight fall in the number.  I am not talking about the situation we had in the past where a very small number of people were homeless for a variety of reasons.  We are talking about families who ordinarily in previous times would have had access to a council house within a reasonable period of time but who are now living in hotel accommodation for a prolonged period of time.  We know the psychological impact of that on children in terms of their development.

That is the reality.  Despite what the Taoiseach said in terms of his stated position, the reality is there was a significant shift in the past five to six years towards the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme model and various rental approaches which have absorbed huge amounts of money with less emphasis on house building, particularly the building of council houses in terms of broader social housing areas.

They have found that the living wage - the rate of pay that a full-time worker requires in order to enjoy a socially acceptable standard of living, in other words, an income floor of such a level as to allow him or her not to live the high life but, rather, a decent one - has risen to &euro;12.30 an hour.  The increase is of the magnitude of 40 cent per hour and is largely accounted for by increases in the cost of living in particular and in the cost of housing and, more especially, because of runaway rental costs.  The Taoiseach will be aware that the living wage - now set at &euro;12.30 - is considerably more than the minimum wage in this State which stands at &euro;9.80 an hour.  The gap between the two is sizeable.  Workers deserve to be treated fairly and paid fairly for their work.  People who are at work have every right to expect that they can have a decent standard of living.  As a result, it is not acceptable that tens of thousands of workers and their families endure poverty, uncertainty, stress and substandard living conditions as a result of low pay.  We are not talking about a small number of people.  According to the most recent figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, 140,000 individuals are in receipt of the minimum wage.  The majority of those 140,000 are women, and the vast majority of them work in the services sector.<\/p>  <p>  There is also another big group of people who earn just above the minimum wage.  Their income lies between the minimum wage and what the living wage ought to be.  All of these are hardworking people.  They are childcare workers, members of the Defence Forces, hospitality workers and shop assistants.  They are people with whom we interact and on whom we rely on a daily basis.  The situation of poverty at work in which they find themselves is simply not acceptable.  We need to start moving to ensure that all workers in the public and private sectors are paid the living wage.<\/p>  <p>  The State should lead from the front on this matter and that the Taoiseach should introduce the living wage for all civil and public servants.  The latter has been a pre-budget proposal from Sinn F&eacute;in for many years.  Last year, it would have cost just in excess of &euro;35 million, as per costings provided to us by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is a minor and modest sum in the greater scheme of things, particularly when one considers the benefits that it would bring to workers and their families.  Will the Taoiseach move to ensure that the State is a living wage employer in the next budget?  When will the Government legislate for the living wage?  When will it legislate and ensure that workers can enjoy a wage that will afford them a decent basic standard of living?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300019#R02600","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1562152200,"counter":184,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300019#R02700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1562152200,"counter":185,"content":"<p>We are well behind the curve.

Even when one accounts for the fact that we have a high cost of living, we still have the sixth highest minimum wage in the world.  We are well ahead of the curve, not behind it.<\/p>  <p>  The living wage to which Deputy McDonald refers is drawn up based on research by NGOs without any input from employers and business.  The Vincentian Partnership for Justice does good work.  I have studied much of its work over the years.  I studied it when I served as Minister for Social Protection.  One of the interesting aspects of its research is that were it not for housing costs or rental costs, it would be proposing a reduction in the living wage because they state that the cost of living, other than that part of it relating to housing, has decreased in the past five years.  The research assumes that everyone is paying rent.  Of course, most people do not pay rent.  Most people pay mortgages or own their own homes outright.  In many cases, those who are on the minimum wage are students or those who are bringing a second income into their homes.  That also needs to be taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission, the Government body that draws up the national minimum wage, takes into account the need to ensure that people get a decent wage.  However, it also takes into account the views of businesses and employers.  That needs to happen we do not want a situation whereby businesses close.  Those in the Border region would be the ones most at risk in this regard given the much lower living wage that exists in Northern Ireland.  We do not want to end up in a situation where workers lose their jobs or lose hours, thereby ending up worse off.  That is why we have a system that works.  It is headed up by the Low Pay Commission, established by the Fine Gael-Labour Government, and it takes into account the bigger picture and the need for people to get decent wages.  It listens to employers and unions and recommends an increase every year that will push up wages but that will not cost jobs or cause workers to lose hours and thereby ending up worse off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300019#R03300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1562152200,"counter":191,"content":"<p>The Low Pay Commission should be looking at a living wage, not the minimum wage.

I detailed the outstanding work of our schools and a wide range of Dublin Bay North community bodies in fields like employment and enterprise, childcare and elder care, youth work and sports and drug rehabilitation.  At that time, many community leaders who admired the Mulvey report on the north inner city, Creating a Brighter Future, believed that a similar programme and implementation board should be established for Dublin Bay North.  The north inner city initiative, which my colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, was heavily involved in bringing forward, includes tackling crime and drugs; maximising education and training; integrating social services; and improving the physical landscape.  There is a strong belief that we need a co-ordinated response involving all the existing local agencies, perhaps led by Northside Partnership, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin City and Fingal County Councils and key Government Departments.  It should be fully resourced to tackle all the issues which gave rise to the recent upsurge of crime.<\/p>  <p>  Is there a case for a national programme of support?  Seven or eight of the 40 constituencies are particularly badly affected; the Taoiseach's own constituency is one of them.  Will he launch a new national strategy to support investment in all areas experiencing cumulative disadvantage, perhaps led by a high-level interdepartmental group?  I know that Departments are engaged on their own in carrying out important work.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is carrying out a major reform of youth services but funding in the sector for most of our constituency was less than &euro;2 million in 2018.  The Department of Rural and Community Development, whose Minister is seated beside the Taoiseach, runs the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  However, as the Minister knows, the community enhancement programme only allocated &euro;700,000 for Dublin.  There is also continuing criticism of Seetec in respect of employment and youth employment.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to legislation, after eight and a half years the Government has not brought forward the housing (regulation of approved housing bodies) Bill or reformed the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 to strengthen estate management.  Despite the &euro;1.76 billion 2019 Garda budget, people still feel generally that there needs to be much greater visibility of garda&iacute;, especially in the evenings, with a doubling of community garda&iacute;.  When is the Government going to publish the long-promised policing and community safety Bill?  The national recorded crime statistics for quarter 1 of 2019, which are statistics under reservation, show shocking increases across a whole range of crimes, including sexual offences, attempts or threats to murder and assault, kidnapping, robbery and extortion, fraud and deception, and controlled drug offences.  All these are happening on the Taoiseach's watch and affecting all our constituencies, rural and urban, with seven or eight constituencies particularly badly affected.<\/p>  <p>  What is the latest position with regard to the report of the working group chaired by Mr. Justice Sheehan?  It is considering decriminalisation in respect of small amounts of drugs for personal use, which would allow the Garda to focus on very serious crime and drugs pushing.

In respect of legislation, we would expect to have the public and community safety Bill next year, which will bring into law many of the recommendations made by Kathleen O'Toole in the commission she led on the reform of policing.

Ideally, I would like to have the heads of a Bill this year and the legislation published and enacted through the course of next year.<\/p>  <p>  On the housing Bill the Deputy asked about, I do not have a timeline but will ask the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to communicate with the Deputy and update him on it.  I do not yet have the report from Mr. Justice Sheehan.  I have not seen it.  I know it is quite advanced and once I get it and have a chance to read it, I will bring it to Cabinet and publish it thereafter.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is examining whether we should change our approach to dealing with drugs, moving away from one that is founded on criminal justice and enforcement to one that is more based on treating it as a health issue.  I look forward to receiving that report once it is ready.<\/p>  <p>  Our response to crime has to be twofold.  As a former British Prime Minister once said, we need to be tough on crime and also tough on the causes of crime.  We are tough on crime by increasing Garda resources.  There are unprecedented resources now for the Garda and they are continuing to increase all the time.  Additional garda&iacute; were allocated to the Dublin stations quite recently, as the Deputy will know, reflecting the need for that to be done given the high levels of crime in Dublin.  There has also been investment in ICT and equipment and vehicles, which will continue into next year and into the future.  In terms of being tough on the causes of crime, that means tackling some of the underlying issues that cause people to choose a life of crime when others may not.  Those are issues particularly related to social and educational disadvantage.  We are doing that as well.<\/p>  <p>  The north-east inner city initiative is a very good one.  We have yet to see whether it has had good outcomes.  What has been done has been very good.  It is probably too early to judge whether the outcomes have been good because we cannot assess that at the moment.  Unfortunately, as is often the case with a very targeted, very specific initiative, it would not be feasible to do that nationwide.  We just would not have the capacity, the people, or the finances to do that in the ten or 20 other places that have been proposed, including places in my own constituency.  Perhaps we can do something similar in those areas of deep disadvantage, including in the Deputy's constituency and in mine.  We do have the community enhancement programme.  One of the things we are examining is whether we should relaunch something similar to the revitalising areas through planning, investment and development, RAPID, programme which existed in the past, and identify ten or 20 areas of particular disadvantage around the country on an evidence basis and target them to do something similar to but not the same as the north-east inner city partnership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300020#S01800","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1562152800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, the Taoiseach is not tough enough on crime or on the causes of crime.

There is also &euro;2 million set aside in the new GP contract to provide extra resources for the first time to GPs who are working in areas with high levels of disadvantage.

Even if all of these posts were filled we would still have the lowest number of consultants <i>per capita<\/i>in the OECD.  Downstream there are also more serious problems that need to be addressed very soon.<\/p><p>Ireland trains high numbers of doctors at very high cost.  The vast majority of these doctors emigrate.  In 2014, for example, there were 684 medical graduates, 627 of whom left Ireland.  In 2017, 700 medical graduates who left the country.  A key contributor to the deplorable waiting lists is the shortage of hospital doctors.  Nearly 1 million people are waiting on hospital care of one kind or another.  In the last few days we heard that 30,000 women are waiting for gynaecological hospital services.<\/p><p>It is also a major contributor to the dysfunction within our health service.  There are many reasons why Ireland cannot hold on to its hospital doctors.  The unmanageable workloads and the inevitability of burnout is a key factor for a lot of doctors.  There is also the hierarchical nature of the career structure for consultants and the lack of career prospects.  Pay is undoubtedly an issue and the two-tier health system, as in many other careers, is hugely damaging with regard to hospital doctors and should be addressed urgently.  The convoluted two-tier recruitment system in operation is also inexplicable.  There is a lack of reform of the health service.  Hospitals are stressful places for doctors to work and there is no indication that the Government is serious about a reform programme.<\/p><p>Getting timely access to care has a significant bearing on this because it means there are increasing difficulties for patients.  This is also depressing for doctors.  Knowing that delays have resulted in conditions becoming more serious for patients, knowing that treatment is less successful due to those delays and knowing that the system is failing patients, with doctors constantly having to apologise, is very stressful.<\/p><p>On top of all these issues is the recent HSE report that has pointed to serious problems around the importation of doctors with many doctors coming from developing countries, with questionable practices in relation to whether that is ethical or not, issues about the qualifications of those doctors, inadequate clinical oversight of those doctors and the transient nature of those foreign doctors, who are basically propping up our health system currently.  We know that 50% of the non-consultant doctors are now called &quot;non-training scheme doctors&quot;.  This is a new category.  Non-training scheme doctors are mainly foreign doctors and in some hospitals 80% of the non-consultant hospital doctors fall into this category.

The Government very much acknowledges that we have real difficulties in our health service when it comes to recruiting and retaining staff, not just doctors but also nurses, midwives, therapists and others.  Notwithstanding that, it is not acknowledged, and it should be acknowledged, that there are more people working in our health service than ever before.  There are 115,000 people now working in our public health service, which is 10,000 more than three years ago.  The impression is sometimes created that more staff are leaving than are joining but that is not the case.  It is not the case for the health service in general and it is not the case when it comes to doctors.  There is a record number of doctors now working in our public health service.  We have never had more doctors working in our public health service than today and there have never been more doctors registered in Ireland.  The Deputy just needs to check the register of the Medical Council if she does not believe me.  This is the true picture.  Yes there is a real problem around recruitment and retention but never were more people working in the health service and never had we more doctors working in Ireland or on the Medical Council register.<\/p><p>The Deputy referred to 450 consultant post vacancies but this figure is not verified.  The Pubic Service Pay Commission examined that and was not able to verify the correct, exact number of consultant vacancies.  Often when the term &quot;vacancy&quot; is used the impression is created that nobody is doing the job but very often there is and the role is filled through a temp or locum doctor, which in some cases are long-term temps or locums.  Last week I checked on <i>publicjobs.ie<\/i>and saw there were only 20 vacancies being advertised.  I appreciate that the voluntary hospitals advertise positions in a different way but there are only 20 vacancies advertised.  It begs the question whether there are jobs that historically have not been filled and will never be filled, and whether we need to take a more comprehensive look at what positions will actually attract staff and applications.  I am aware of many registrars and doctors who are waiting for a job to be advertised.  They are very keen to work in a particular area or hospital but the advertised jobs are in branches of medicine they do not want to be in, or for places they do not want to work.  It is difficult to grasp that nettle but we do need to grasp it and advertise positions that will get applicants, rather than advertising for positions that, sadly, we know will not.<\/p><p>Deputy Shortall spoke about medical graduates emigrating.  It is important to bear in mind that a very large number of medical students in Ireland are from overseas.  When they emigrate they are actually emigrating back to the country which they came in the first place.  That was always their intention.  A very large number of Irish medical graduates who were born and brought up in Ireland leave and come back.  Not as many come back as used to but going away for experience is not a bad thing.  It is a good thing.<\/p><p>Reference was also made to non-training scheme doctors.  It is true there are a lot of doctors working in peripheral hospitals, what were called county hospitals, throughout the State who are not in training schemes.  They are not on training schemes because the medical colleges no longer recognise those hospitals as being training or teaching hospitals.  In the past we were able to attract people to work in those hospitals from Ireland and overseas because it counted towards their training.  Medicine has moved on, however, and those hospitals are no longer recognised for training purposes and may never be again.  We must also face up to this.

This has been going on for quite a number of years and there has been advanced stage preparation, but we are not getting any clarity or transparency in regard to the project.  Can the Taoiseach shed any light on why there has been a delay in awarding this contract and getting the project under way?

The sale is only possible because the Government has given political cover and support to vulture funds.  Fine Gael is as responsible for this sale as Ulster Bank.

The fund sent letters to loan owners to tell them that they had to clear all of their loans, the &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000, within 30 days.  Banks do not do that.  Vulture funds do because they only have a short-term interest.  The Taoiseach said that he cannot dictate the pace of my legislation, the No Consent, No Sale Bill.

I salute the work of the team in the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers for all its guidance and helpful suggestions on the draft.  I salute, in particular, Ms Sinead Beirne, who was the point of contact for my office.  I thank David Mullins in my office and my own staff.  I welcome to the Visitors Gallery Ms Anne-Marie O'Brien and her father, Finbar.  I offer a special mention to Anne, who is watching at home.  Anne-Marie has been a champion in the cause of her brother John since that fateful day almost a decade ago.<\/p><p>The Bill itself is short and technical.  It sets out to amend the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000, to revise the requirements for the composition of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, and to provide for related matters.  In many ways, however, the Bill is an attempt to draw some good out of a tragedy that befell two families in my constituency on Sunday, 23 May 2010.  On that day, on a beautiful sunny afternoon, John O'Brien and his good friend Patrick Esmonde went fishing off Helvick Head, County Waterford.  Tragically they never returned to their loved ones.  Since then, I have worked closely with John O'Brien's sister Anne-Marie to have a full, open and thorough investigation to establish the exact cause of death.  The fight will continue.<\/p><p>What this Bill seeks to do is rectify the bizarre circumstances whereby there is no legal obligation whatsoever on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport or his agents to ensure that members of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board have maritime or marine-accident experience.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will understand that being from a sea-fishing county.  It is a vital component, by anyone's yardstick.  This has always been a major issue for the two families, who have never accepted the official outcome of the investigation into the deaths on the summer's day.  If this Bill is accepted and passed, it will strengthen the onus on the Minister and his agents to ensure that qualified and suitable candidates are selected for the membership of the board.  Maritime experience should be a prerequisite.  It is a fair and reasonable requirement given the gravity of the cases that may need to be investigated.<\/p><p>It stands in stark contrast to the equivalent board in the United Kingdom, where marine casualty investigation experience is a prerequisite and a requirement.  We must have a similar situation in this jurisdiction in order to protect the integrity of the process and ensure that no stone is left unturned for the loved ones left behind in cases involving marine accidents with fatalities.  They happen, unfortunately, and it is a tragedy but we need to have the fullest possible investigations as well as expertise on this board which sadly we do not have.<\/p> <p> I want to express my heartfelt admiration to the O'Brien and Esmonde families, who have persisted in their campaign for answers for almost a decade.  It is so harrowing.  In particular, I want to mention John's sister, Anne-Marie, who is with us here today with her dad, who has never given up the fight for justice and who looks after the late John's children every second weekend and is a great source of strength.  We have young families left without a dad and no proper answers.  John and Anne-Marie's families and the family of Patrick Esmonde can rightly be proud of the work Anne-Marie has done and will continue to do.  I thank other colleagues who have supported her.<\/p> <p> I am hugely disappointed with the Garda investigation, or lack of one.  I want to thank the Minister, Deputy Ross, of whom I am often critical, as he visited Anne-Marie in her home, listened to her and is interested in making changes here.  I certainly hope the Bill can be accepted by the Government and can be dealt with sensitively and appropriately.<\/p> <p> I also want to welcome the Killilea family here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300026#Y02400","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562157000,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300027#Z00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1562157000,"counter":384,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300027#Z00300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562157000,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1562157000,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300027#Z00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1562157000,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300027#Z00600","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562157000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy","time":1562157000,"counter":389,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300027#Z00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1562157000,"counter":390,"content":"<p>We will move to expressions of sympathy on the death of our former colleague, Mark Killilea.

He was born into an intensely political family, a family that believed in developing an inclusive Ireland and a society that afforded opportunities to all, and he loved his country.  He often spoke fondly of his late father who was also called Mark, who as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said was first elected as a Deputy in the 1920s and served right up to the late 1960s, which was an extraordinary career in itself.  Mark's father was an extraordinary man.  He was a farmer and was an active member in the War of Independence and a founding member of Fianna F&aacute;il.  He was a person from that great generation that laid the foundations of the State.<\/p><p>It is not surprising then, given that public service ethos in the family and that commitment to country, that Mark himself would enter the political arena.  Prior to politics, he too was a farmer, a beet grower, an auctioneer, an agricultural contractor and an extraordinarily multi-talented individual.  I have listened to some of his interviews.  He started out as a councillor, became a Senator in 1969 and a Deputy in 1977.  He was a very effective Minister of State with responsibility for posts and telegraphs and he was a Member of the European Parliament from 1987 to 1999.<\/p><p>He too believed in public service and was a member of many organisations and had a particular love of the Gaelic Athletic Association and his beloved Corofin GAA club, which has achieved so much.  Mark was a very gregarious and charismatic person and politician and drew people towards him.  One of his great friends in politics, Ray MacSharry, summed up Mark very well when he said: <\/p><blockquote>Markeen was friendly, humble, sharp, alert and confident.  He was always a family man, a community man, a sportsman, and a great public servant.<\/blockquote><p>As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said, it was Mark who, when describing Fianna F&aacute;il supporters, because the interviewer at the time had asked who were these people, said he represented the people who ate their dinner in the middle of the day.  When one met Mark, one always remembered his relaxed witty and straight talking ways.  When I became leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, he was not slow to pick up the phone to give me advice on potential candidates, strategy and so on.  He give it to one straight because he had a passion about renewing and recovering the party.<\/p><p>Over the last few days I listened to his interviews.  In his early days, as a councillor, he chaired the health board.<\/p><p>He initially ran for the D&aacute;il in 1973.  In his own style, he said he was nicked of that seat when the Roscommon boxes came in.  He lost by just 140 votes.  In the great election victory of 1977, he won a seat.  He was influential in the election of Charles J. Haughey as Taoiseach in 1979.  He was then appointed as a Minister of State and worked brilliantly with his senior Minister, Albert Reynolds.<\/p> <p> Many among our younger generations will find it difficult to comprehend how hard it was to get a phone into a house in the late 1970s.  There were extraordinary delays of months.  Between them, however, Mark Killilea and Albert Reynolds took the country by storm in terms of getting rid of the waiting times for telephones.  That strategy transformed Ireland and prepared it for the subsequent economic development that took place.  It was pivotal in attracting a great deal of inward investment.  As Mark said, they went about it with energy and commitment.  It came within budget as well.  I will not mention broadband or anything like that but I suspect that if we had had Mark Killilea and Albert Reynolds around, we might not have been waiting so long.<\/p> <p> The early 1980s, when I was a student in UCC, were a traumatic and difficult time for politicians.  There were three elections in 1981 and 1982.  It was a time of great instability and trauma for political families.  Think about it - three general elections in 18 months.  Mark was successful in two out of three of those, but alas not in the last one.  He was subsequently re-elected to the Seanad.  He was quite witty in his observations on the differences between a Seanad election and a D&aacute;il election.  He developed a great respect for councillors and their professionalism on the basis, he said, that they knew how to cod you.  He said that, if one were to believe all those who said they would vote for one, one would end up with three quotas, but it never quite turned out that way.<\/p> <p> In 1987, Ray MacSharry returned to Ireland from the European Parliament and Mark got his opportunity to become an MEP.  He was returned to it in subsequent elections.  It is fair to say that he saw his membership of the Europe Parliament as his favourite period of his political career.  He was influential across the European Parliament, influencing much of the policy that emanated from it and elsewhere in the EU, particularly in the context of small and medium-sized farmers.  He ensured that regional and technical colleges received EU social funding to commence research.  At that time, universities were leading in that regard.  He negotiated the western package, which allowed farmers from Donegal to Kerry to create vital farm infrastructure.  He also helped to design the LEADER programme, which became a model for rural development.<\/p> <p> I mentioned that he was a gregarious individual.  He developed great friendships in politics across all parties.  That is a trait of parliamentarians that we sometimes understate.  It is important to be able to cross the floor and work alliances to get policies through.  His friendship with former MEP Barry Desmond, for example, facilitated the socialist group supporting the Common Agricultural Policy reform deal when it was going through the European Parliament.  He was particularly friendly with Ian Paisley.  Interestingly, that was the experience of many of our MEPs.  Mark would say that the image of Ian Paisley in the North, with all of his hardline rhetoric, did not quite materialise in the European Parliament context.  He said that the late Ian Paisley often asked him for advice on the CAP reform package and was particularly praising of Ray MacSharry's lead in reforming CAP while a Commissioner.  According to Mark, Ian Paisley would say that in Parliament only months after \"he tried to run the Pope from [the same] Parliament\".  Mark was elected as a quaestor by his fellow MEPs.  That was a significant election, as it showed the respect and esteem in which he was held across the Parliament.  It illustrated the different perspectives from which Mark and Ian Paisley came.  Mark organised a minor celebration in the bar with some colleagues.  Notwithstanding the late Ian Paisley's puritanical attitude to alcohol-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300027#Z01400","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562157600,"counter":397,"content":"<p>The devil's buttermilk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300028#AA00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1562157600,"counter":398,"content":"<p>-----Mr. Paisley shouted in, \"Will you give up drinking that devil's buttermilk?\"  Undaunted, Mark responded, \"Come in and have one [yourself].\"  That was the nature of the banter and relationship between the two.<\/p>  <p>  Mark always said that he could never have become a politician without his friendship and partnership with his beloved wife, Anne.  They worked extremely hard as a team for their community.  At times when elections did not work out for them, they worked even harder and kept going with the support of their large and extended family.  Mark and Anne would canvass as two separate teams in some respects.  We know the feeling.  Anne would take her team to different parts of the constituency.  They believed in knocking on doors and meeting people.  Mark was unlucky with boundary changes, with his constituency changing three times, which posed significant electoral challenges for him.  He and Anne were always best friends in that regard.  He spoke on radio about this support during their 53 years of marriage.  He said how he \"would of course get the odd dressing down but overall our marriage was very satisfactory\".  They met and married at a young age and had eight children: &Eacute;id&iacute;n, Niamh, Deirbrin, Niall, Donagh, Medbh and Eimh&iacute;n.  Of course, we remember that Mark and Anne lost their son, Mark, who was taken from them in a tragic car accident.  I remember Medbh describing her father as a man who taught them all to love politics, farming and food, that last being particularly important.  He also taught them how to \"live life with great common sense, a positive attitude and a twist of humour.\"  I am delighted to hear that the wife of Councillor Donagh Killilea, Mark and Anne's son, of whom Mark was particularly proud, gave birth to a baby yesterday.  He has been named Mark.  It is good to know that the dynasty continues.<\/p>  <p>  All of the Killilea family will remember Mark as a great husband, a devoted father and grandfather, and someone who brought great love and fun to their lives.

Paying tribute to honourable servants of our country like Mark Killilea sweeps away some of that cynicism and reminds us of what unites us all in politics instead of focusing on differences.<\/p>  <p>  Mark devoted his life to helping others and to helping the country, and by honouring him and others like him, we remember why we became involved in politics in the first place and are inspired to try to do better and try to do more.<\/p>  <p>  Bh&iacute; an-ghnaoi agus an-mheas ag an bpobal ar Mark Killilea mar pholaiteoir a rinne f&oacute;namh d&aacute;r dt&iacute;r mar chomhairleoir Contae, mar Sheanad&oacute;ir, Mar Theachta D&aacute;la, mar Aire St&aacute;it, mar Fheisire de Pharlaimint na hEorpa agus mar chaest&oacute;ir.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-&eacute;asca d&oacute; cairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh le daoine ar chruthaigh s&eacute; nasc in Eoraip leo ar bhain &Eacute;ire tairbhe go buan astu.  Ba pholaiteoir &eacute; a chreid go n-itear an dinn&eacute;ar i l&aacute;r an lae.  Mar Aire St&aacute;it, chuir se feabhas ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; cumars&aacute;ide in &Eacute;irinn agus d'fh&aacute;g s&eacute; oidhreacht shuntasach ar sheirbh&iacute;s poibl&iacute; d&uacute;inn.<\/p>  <p>  In many ways, Mark Killilea epitomised the spirit of public service.  His father, also Mark, was a founding member of Fianna F&aacute;il and served as a Deputy for almost 34 years.<\/p><p>Markeen, as he was known to many of his friends, inherited a belief in helping others as well as a love of community.  He served the people of Galway and our country with distinction.<br\/><br\/>As Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin mentioned, when Mark became a Deputy in 1977, the waiting list to have a phone line connected to one's house was legendary.  Indeed, it was one of the queries most frequently received by Deputies.  As Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs from 1979 to 1981, he oversaw a revolution in our communications network which ensured that the problem was eventually fixed.<br\/><br\/>Mark made many telling contributions in the House, but perhaps most effective were the heckles he deployed against members of my party.  He famously described Professor John Kelly as a pitch and toss merchant.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reports that Mark had the ability to halt an entire debate in its tracks with his interruptions.  Indeed, we are told he bashed the Opposition's record on everything from security to potato plants.  As an MEP from 1987 to 1999, he had many achievements, most notably working on reforming the Common Agricultural Policy such that small farmers would be able to prosper.  Everyone liked and trusted Mark and he was able to make alliances and friendships, including with Ian Paisley.  He often attempted to bring together countries that were arguing with each other and sometimes did so with success.<br\/><br\/>He loved sport, especially his beloved Corofin GAA club, fishing and horse racing, and won many prizes playing golf.  Whether as a farmer, businessman, auctioneer or politician, he lived a life of hard work and integrity.<br\/><br\/>I offer my condolences and those of Fine Gael to his wife Anne, their children &Eacute;id&iacute;n, Niamh, Deirbrin, Niall, Donagh, Medbh and Eimh&iacute;n, and all of their family and friends.  We also remember their son, Mark, who died tragically in 2009.  Donagh has continued the family tradition of public service as a councillor representing the people of Tuam and I know Mark's daughter, Medbh, as a result of her excellent work for the Government Information Service, following on a proud family tradition of service to the State through politics and the Civil Service.  Mark did the State much service.

As has been stated, Mark had a very long and, indeed, distinguished career in public office.  I am sure his clan are extremely proud of that.  He served as a member of Galway County Council, as a Member of the D&aacute;il on behalf of the people of Galway, in the Seanad and, of course, at the European Parliament with great distinction.  He also served as Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It seems his record there is a matter of legend in the context of telephone connections in the early 1980s under the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, whom he, as a member of the so-called gang of five, backed during the Fianna F&aacute;il leadership context in 1979, something which, I am sure, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle recalls.  I will not elaborate on that, but I wish to recall, as others have, that he coined the famous phrase that the ordinary people of Ireland are those who eat their dinner in the middle of the day.  If ever there was a political concept or phrase that will resonate down the generations, that for sure is it.<\/p>  <p>  I did not know Mark, but he was evidently extremely in tune with the people of his constituency and this country.

I send the condolences of my party to Fianna F&aacute;il as well as the Killilea family.  The Taoiseach is correct that it is important to take time out of the normal business of the House to reflect on colleagues who have passed on.<\/p>  <p>  One of the words used in respect of Members of this House is \"patriot\".  Various Deputies would define that word in different ways.  I regard Mark Killilea as a patriot.  He genuinely loved his country and was passionate about it and his personal beliefs.  I did not agree with much of what he espoused.  Mark and I came into the Seanad at the same time in the 1980s.  I was delighted to be there, but I am not sure he was quite as happy to become a Senator, having previously served in this House and as a distinguished Minister of State.  He was a very careful thinker with a clear vision of politics.  Many people underestimated him, but he understood what he wanted to achieve and worked very hard on his objectives.<\/p>  <p>  I had occasion to meet him outside the Houses once or twice in the Thomas Moore Tavern, a place of imbibement in my home town of Wexford, where he told me he was related to a person with whom I worked very closely for a very long time, namely, my special adviser, Anne Byrne.  I did not quite work out the relationship between them, although I may figure it out over the course of the day.  Anne certainly believed they were close relatives and was always in very close discussion with Mark when he visited.<\/p>  <p>  Reference has been made to his passion for agriculture and rural life, of which he was a great defender, as well as his service in terms of telecommunications.  In many ways, his time as a Minister of State, in combination with the senior Minister for telecommunications, allowed us to move on from the farcical situation whereby people were waiting for two years for a telephone connection.  Everybody in need of a connection went to their local Deputy to make strong representations to get it, which was very bizarre.  I am not sure whether it is true, but I was told that Mark always had a number of telephone devices in his car which he would give to constituents.  They would still have to wait two years for a connection, but it gave them hope that they were closer to getting a connection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300029#BB00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1562158200,"counter":405,"content":"<p>They were halfway there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300029#BB00400","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1562158200,"counter":406,"content":"<p>His service as Minister of State facilitated the leap from analogue to digital technology.  In many ways, we moved very quickly from a very Third World telecommunications infrastructure to what was a First World infrastructure.<\/p><p>There are many stories about his passionate support for Charles Haughey.  Many people think this D&aacute;il is bizarre, but it is calm in comparison with some of the D&aacute;ileanna of that era.  The <i>Irish Independent<\/i>referred to his role in the election of the Taoiseach in 1982:<\/p><blockquote>Killilea would again come to Haughey's rescue, although he had lost his seat in Galway in 1982, having switched to a new constituency because of boundary changes.  When it came to a crucial vote for Taoiseach in the new government, Killilea was among those who thronged Leinster House to see whether the hung D&aacute;il would vote Haughey or his nemesis Garret FitzGerald into the Taoiseach's office.<br \/><br \/>The vote was so tight nobody really knew the outcome - and it seemed to be swinging away from Haughey when a farcical situation developed as three Workers' Party TDs, who had pledged to vote for Haughey, were hampered by the crowds on the main staircase from getting into the chamber before the division bells rang and the doors were locked from the inside, leaving them stranded.<br \/><br \/>Killilea's experience of the layout of Leinster House was invaluable.  &quot;This way, lads,&quot; he shouted and led them through a doorway to the press gallery, from which the three TDs were able to jump into the Distinguished Visitors Gallery - to the surprise of Maureen Haughey and various ambassadors seated there - and then into the chamber.<br \/><br \/>They were then able to vote for Haughey, who was elected Taoiseach...<\/blockquote><p>To Mark Killilea's great satisfaction, Charles Haughey was elected Taoiseach.  A Deputy needs guile, wit, knowledge and wisdom to operate well in this House.  All of those attributes were amply demonstrated during Mark Killilea's honourable service here.  It was my privilege to have known him.  He has served our nation with great distinction.<\/p> <p> I did not mention his European service, which was even more renowned.  He served in the European Parliament.  To be elected one of the five quaestors of the European Parliament is important because they look after the affairs of the MEPs.  MEPs are rather discerning about who they trust to look after their own affairs.  This is clear from the fact that only five are elected, while this week we are going to elect 14 vice presidents of the European Parliament.  Those from the entire body across all the nations trusted their well-being and welfare in the hands of Mark Killilea.  That speaks greater volumes of praise than I can muster.<\/p> <p> I offer my condolences to Anne and Mark's children, Eid&iacute;n, Niamh, Deirbrin, Niall, Donagh, Medbh and Eimh&iacute;n, as well as to his sisters Brid and Vera.

The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Canney, cannot be here today.  He is caught up with ministerial business and he asked me to pass on his apologies.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words about Mark Killilea on behalf of the Rural Independent Group.  I had the pleasure of knowing Mark.  The first time I met him was in the 1980s.  I was a member of &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il and of the comhairle d&aacute;il ceantair for Fianna F&aacute;il.  We were at a meeting in Flannery's Hotel after the local elections.  We were waiting for the results of the council elections to see what had happened.  The make-up of the council at the time was tight.  The door burst open and in came Mark.  He was absolutely fuming.  They had lost the vote for the chain of office of Galway County Council that day.  Two councillors who were members of Sinn F&eacute;in switched and voted with Fine Gael.  Mark gave a memorable speech that night.  I will not repeat any of it here.<\/p>  <p>  My late father, Peter, was a great supporter of Mark.  He canvassed for Mark during many elections.  Deputy Howlin touched on the story of the telephone lines.  I remember my father coming home one night when he was fuming.  He said that if he saw another telephone handed or bought into a house he would be mad.  People would point to the telephone and say that Mark gave it to them and told them they would have the line within three or four months, but they did not get it within that time.  My father was getting abuse from the odd house.  I am delighted to say the people did get the line eventually and the telephones began working.<\/p>  <p>  He was a keen golfer.  I often met him out in Ballyconneely when we had our Oireachtas outings.  Mark was president when I was captain.  People never really see Donie Cassidy losing his cool as secretary of the Oireachtas golf society but I remember the day I was captain.  I was hosting the captain's prize.  We allocated two hours in the morning for Mark from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.  Oireachtas Members then had from 10 a.m. to noon and then the guests had time.  It was a bad wet windy morning but the weather was to clear at 10 a.m.  Mark told all his guests and friends who were playing to turn up at 10 a.m.  There was utter chaos.  The Taoiseach at the time, Deputy Enda Kenny, came to play.  He was supposed to be playing at 10.30 a.m.  He did not get out until 11.15 a.m.  Donie Cassidy lost it.  There was chaos on the tee box.  No one could find Mark.  He eventually arrived at 11.30 a.m. or so with a smile from ear to ear.  He told Donie to calm down and that it was alright because everyone had got out onto the course.  I will not repeat what Donie said.<\/p>  <p>  Mark had many highs in his life and many lows.  I remember calling at the house at the time when his son, Mark, died tragically.  It was a tough time and a sad time for his wife, Anne, and the Killilea family.<\/p>  <p>  Mark had a long and distinguished carrier in politics.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v might touch on the story told in Galway County Council.  When the agenda came out, Mark would look at it.  If there was nothing exciting or nothing to have a row about, he would contact John Donnellan, the Fine Gael councillor.  John was another avid golfer.  They would arrange among themselves to have a blazing row in the council chamber so that they could grab a headline.  Perhaps Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v might expand on the matter, but that was the story we were told.<\/p>  <p>  Mark had a long and distinguished career in politics.  He was from a great political family.  He served in the Seanad and D&aacute;il.  He was a Minister of State and a member of the European Parliament.  On behalf of the Rural Independent Group and on my behalf I wish to offer my sympathies to his wife, Anne, following her loss.  I also wish to offer my sympathies to Eid&iacute;n, Niamh, Deirbrin, Niall and Donagh.  I congratulate Donagh on the birth of the child.  It is great to see the name Mark continuing the legacy.  I hope Donagh will have a long career in politics and that Mark will follow suit.

To the best of my knowledge, we never crossed paths.  I did not serve with him and I did not serve with Donagh.  I had left the council before he joined.  Of course, I know the Killilea name and I know Mark Killilea by reputation and by the regard with which he was held in Galway.  I know him from the stories in the <i>Connacht Tribune<\/i>when I was a young person reading about politics.  I know him as a larger than life figure.  The best know stories have all been repeated here today, including Deputy Howlin's comments about the vote for Charlie Haughey and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's comments regarding the telephones and eating dinners in the middle of the day.  Those are the three things that jump out in terms of the folklore that has gone down about Mark Killilea.<\/p><p>Like any politician, especially one who has served at county council level and as a Deputy, Senator and MEP, Mark did not get there by accident or chance but as a result of hard work.  We all know that.  Anyone who has served in those positions has a reputation for hard work.  Mark had that reputation too.  Many people have faced difficulties when boundary changes arise.  He was between east and west Galway.  He was around Galway at the same time as some big figures in Fianna F&aacute;il politics, including M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, Frank Fahey, Bobby Molloy and others, and, for the Labour Party, the current President.  It was a tough area before the young whippersnapper, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, came along later in that period.  There were large figures within Fianna F&aacute;il politics in that area.  Mark was part of that and went on to serve as a Deputy, Minister of State, Senator and MEP.  This shows the regard with which he was held and the reputation that he had for hard work.

The biggest tragedy in Mark and Anne's lives was the death of their son Mark, which happened very suddenly, just ten years before Mark's own death.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh s&eacute;.<\/p>  <p>  The Killilea family history in politics goes back a long time, to the foundation of Fianna F&aacute;il in 1927.  I am delighted that my colleague, Deputy Haughey, is beside me because he is a grandson of Se&aacute;n Lemass and our three families go back to those founding times.  I knew Mark well because we shared a constituency, though Mark had been in politics a long time before I started and was in what was then the Galway East area.  Galway West was initially a three-seat constituency, which incorporated Galway city and Connemara.  Mark represented east Galway well in this House, having been elected to the D&aacute;il in 1977 and having served in the Seanad before that.  When the constituency review took place, Galway West became a large five-seat constituency stretching from Clare right up to Mayo, and the east of the city was added in as well.  To say that constituency was competitive, especially within Fianna F&aacute;il, would be the understatement of the year.  Three elections were held between 1981 and 1982 and while Mark was elected in 1981, he lost out in 1982.  Those were tough times for politicians, as they had to fund three elections only to find out at the end that they had lost their positions as Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la.  Mark was then elected to the Seanad.  Those were difficult times for politicians and their families, particularly for those who won some elections only to lose in the later ones.  We should never forget the challenges they faced.<\/p>  <p>  While our political careers overlapped, the only election I contested with Mark was in 1987.  There were four Fianna F&aacute;il candidates on that ticket, namely, Frank Fahey, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, Mark Killilea and I.  I came up the rear in fourth place and unfortunately for Mark, while he came in third, Fianna F&aacute;il only won two seats.  That was after Bobby Molloy had joined the Progressive Democrats.  Shortly after that election, a rumour went around that Mark Killilea was about to return to Irish politics.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle can correct me but I recall that there was two people ahead of Mark on the list, namely, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Noel Treacy, and Mark was the third substitute.  When Mark was asked about Europe he said he had not heard anything and did not know whether he would fall into that position but if he was called to go to Europe, he would drive off so fast people would hear the pebbles hitting the windows of his house.  He had a fantastic turn of phrase for every situation and other phrases of his have been quoted here today.  He had a fantastic way of relating to everyday things.<\/p>  <p>  Mark went to Europe and although he had been a successful politician on the national stage, what he achieved in Europe may have surprised those who did not know him.  The impact he made in the European scene was extraordinary.  He sat in the European Parliament from 1987 to 1999 and could have gone on longer if he had so chosen.  One of his greatest abilities was his ability to relate to ordinary people and their day-to-day problems.  He spoke plain English and could translate complicated concepts in such a way that the listener of a radio or television programme could understand them.  He did not engage in hyperbole or beat about the bush.  I remember how well he explained the changes that were taking place during the MacSharry reforms, when agricultural payments were first introduced.  Those reforms changed the face of agriculture in Ireland, the west in particular.  Mark Killilea was a legend, both in Fianna F&aacute;il and in politics in the west of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I was not on the council at the same time as Mark Killilea and John Donnellan so I do not know the full story, but they often had public rows.  However, it was always like cath na mb&oacute; maol, or the battles of deer horn cows that never harmed anybody.  It certainly did not harm the two protagonists, as both of them were fairly well met when it came to debate.<\/p>  <p>  Fear m&oacute;r, gr&aacute;&uacute;il agus c&aacute;irdi&uacute;il a bh&iacute; i Mark.

Mark Killilea was affectionately known to us in Galway East, and probably to many more across the country, as \"Markeen\", or if one was bold about it, one would ask, \"Where's Killilea?\".  Mark was a legend.  His name and deeds went before him and the tales we have heard today are all true.  I was only a child when there was talk of the telephones Deputy Grealish referred to, but people were lucky if they got a telephone because then they knew they were in with Mark.  That telephone gave them great hope.<\/p>  <p>  Mark Killilea was friendly, popular and well-respected across all parties.  He was a giant, not only in Galway politics but nationally and internationally.  He held positions across the political spectrum, from councillor on Galway County Council, to Deputy, Minister and MEP.  He always brought the same level of enthusiasm and dedication to all his work.  As a public representative, he always worked hard for the people he represented or, to borrow the famous phrase, the people who ate their dinner in the middle of the day.<\/p>  <p>  He did not have a Facebook or Twitter account during the many elections he contested.  It was the family members, connections and respect he built up over the years that elected him.  It is not easy to go out and get elected, particularly as he and Anne had eight young children at one time.  The length of time he served at various levels has to be respected.  Many of us would love to mirror that in our political careers.  Now that we have Facebook and Twitter, we have a short pass to getting elected in some regards but Mark had to do it the hard way, as did many of his colleagues.<\/p>  <p>  Mark was integral in reshaping the Irish telecoms network following his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs under Charles Haughey.  I am sure he would have some interesting words to say on the broadband fiasco today.  As a farmer, beef producer and silage contractor, Mark knew the many challenges facing farmers around the country, and he brought his experience to bear on the European stage when elected MEP for the Connacht-Ulster constituency.  Mark played a key role in reforming the Common Agricultural Policy, ensuring small farmers received greater and fairer payments.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Mark's private life, we heard earlier about his love of golf but he also had a great love for Ballyconneely.  He loved the Ballinrobe races and, above all, he loved Corofin GAA.<\/p><p>That is where he spent time with his family and where many of his family memories were created and they are still talked about to this day.  His young grandson, Shane, talks about going to Ballyconneely and he asked my son to join him for a weekend there to do some swimming.  That is what memories are about.  There was also talk about Ballinrobe races.  Shane is not joining us here today but I hope later in Irish college they will listen to what Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, our leader, said.  The teacher might test them on translating it very well.<\/p> <p> Not only is Mark greatly missed by his wife, Anne, and his family he is also missed by the Fianna F&aacute;il organisation in Tuam where he spent a long time and spoke great words of wisdom and offered direction.  I was one of the people who benefited from Mark&rsquo;s words of wisdom.  I visited him about three and a half years ago in Caherhugh House, where he sat me down and gave me a cup of tea.  When Mark gave you a cup of tea he also gave you words of wisdom, and you listened eagerly because he was setting you on the right path.  That half day I spent with him in Caherhugh House where he gave me direction set me on the right road to contest a general election.

As our party leader pointed out, Mark originally came from Ballinamore Bridge in east Galway, which is now part of my constituency.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome Anne, his wife, many members of his family, many of his grandchildren and friends who are here today.  I first met Mark when I was appointed chairman of &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il in County Roscommon, which is a good few years ago now.  I always remember him for his enthusiasm.  He always struck me as being very confident, astute and good at organising politics, canvasses and people.  I believe it is accepted by everybody, regardless of what side of the House one is on, that Mark, as a junior spokesperson in the then Department of Posts and Telegraphs, along with Albert Reynolds revolutionised telecommunications at that time.  If he was still with us together, I have no doubt that he and Albert Reynolds would find a way around the difficulties we have with the provision of broadband.<\/p>  <p>  We should never forget the role he played in Europe, which was quite remarkable.  Specifically, I mention the Common Agricultural Programme, CAP, and his many valuable ideas and contributions towards the framing of it.  Also, in education, he played a major role in securing finance from Europe for a regional technical college, which was vital for young people particularly in many towns in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  When I was in &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il we were at a meeting and referring to the CAP and people were saying there would be millions for this and for that but Mark said to me, \"Gas&uacute;r, never mind talking about the millions, have you sheep farmers living close to you?\" to which I replied I had and he said: \"Tell them it will mean they will make IR&pound;10 a head extra on their ewe\".  He broke it down like that in a practical way for people. <\/p>  <p>  It was good to know him.  I always loved his company.

I welcome also his grandchildren.  I welcome Mr. Tom Craven, as a representative of the many tens of thousands of people who supported the Killilea family and politics through the generations, as others have said.  He was not only a great loyal friend and supporter of Mark Killilea who we are discussing, but of his father, the original Mark, and he is key to Donagh&rsquo;s political career as it continues.  He is a most appropriate representative of all who supported the Killileas through the year.  Tom is very welcome here.<\/p>  <p>  Family and loyalty was everything to the Mark Killilea that I have known all my life.  It epitomised all his work and actions.  It did not require a report from PwC or KPMG or consideration by a sub-agency: Mark Killilea was guided by the people.  The Taoiseach alluded to the fact that there is coarseness in politics now.  While we may have developed that coarseness, what we have truly lost is the fact that giants of the tradition of public representation like Mark Killilea were guided by the people.  That was in every single thing that he did.<\/p>  <p>  Mark mentored many in their political careers, some of whom went on to be Commissioners, taoisigh, leas-cheann comhairl&iacute;, Senators and TDs, including myself in my own political career which started in 2002.  Much of that mentoring took place - the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will not mind me mentioning this - in 30, Clareville Road, Harold&rsquo;s Cross in an era when public representatives in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad were not resourced in terms of expenses to be able to say in hotels, as we are lucky enough to be able to do today.  In terms of TDs and Senators, the originals were Mark Killilea, Ray MacSharry, Pat the Cope Gallagher, the late Flor Crowley and former Senator Bernard McGlincey.  If only the walls of No. 30 could talk, there was much wisdom imparted by Mark Killilea to other people who went on to have very successful carers in their own right.  While they were the originals, later there was the former Minister, John Browne, and the former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, who all went there.<\/p>  <p>  As alluded to by others, and I have the express permission of the author, Mark Killilea&rsquo;s fingerprints were all over the CAP reforms of the 1990s.  Its passage and commentary through the European Parliament, as alluded to by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, was at the hands and behest of the extraordinary ability that Mark Killilea had to bring people with him.  He was a giant in the tradition of public representation, a man who was all graces and no airs.  While those of us who entered public life and are in it after he is gone would seek to try to walk in his steps, nobody will ever fill his shoes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300032#EE00500","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1562160000,"counter":418,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, has retuned from his ministerial duties.

This is a step forward in benefitting hundreds of thousands of people by reducing the cost of healthcare for them.  On 11 June, Government approved the general scheme of a Bill to change how productive assets are treated under the nursing home support scheme or fair deal.  This will positively affect families who have family farms and businesses but now require nursing home care.  An agreement has been reached with the Irish Medical Organisation on a major package of GP contractual reforms which will provide a 40% in resources for general practice, benefitting patients and make general practice a more attractive career option for doctors.

The Taoiseach might be able to explain the contradiction between the two Ministers in that regard.  The Taoiseach might be able to indicate what he believes the full year outcome will be in relation to the health Estimate.  Does the Taoiseach also believe that there will be no question of a Supplementary Estimate being required?  He might clarify that for me.<\/p>  <p>  I note that up to 2012 the HSE demonstrated a strong ability to deliver within budget but that changed due to a new political approach to service plans introduced by the Cabinet.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has said that ministerial and governmental decisions in demanding services but not providing the funding at the start of the year have directly added to the end of year Supplementary Estimates - in other words, at the beginning of the budget year every year the Government knew full well that what was provided for in the service plan could not have been met by the Estimate that was provided and that there would inevitably be a Supplementary Estimate.  That has been an issue for quite a number of years.  Does the Taoiseach accept this, or is that another recommendation of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council which the Taoiseach will ignore?<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that whereas he talked about Sl&aacute;intecare and some of the issues around thresholds, etc., that are doable, at the essence of the health service at the operational level are fundamental difficulties with access to the health service as manifested in overcrowding in accident and emergency departments and excessive deaths as a result.  Much of that is contributed to by the deficiencies in step-down facilities, nursing home beds, rehabilitation beds and facilities, and facilitating efficient discharge from acute hospitals.  In my view, the demographic realities of health have not been provided for in recent times.  As a people, we are living longer.  That is a good development but the numbers of people who attend the services, particularly emergency departments, for example, those over 65 years of age, is quite significant.  The issue around care of the elderly, be it home care packages or, as I said, the various facilities required once discharge takes place, have not been provided for in budgetary terms by the Government and have been fudged year after year.

We now have one of the lowest numbers of doctors per head of population in the EU.  At the same time, we are increasingly relying on the recruitment of doctors trained outside of Ireland and coming to this country.  Within a few short years, the service has become dependent on a category of junior doctors, most of them foreign trained and on the lower rungs of their medical careers.  Ever more healthcare is delivered not by consultants or trainees who are in secure career structures, but by an ever-growing army of non-training scheme doctors.  This is unfair to those in the medical profession who want to work as doctors and who have a completely uncertain career path, so much so that many of the foreign doctors ultimately end up going to the UK or other countries where, having gained experience in Ireland, they can get a career path in those countries.<\/p>  <p>  My understanding is that there is a draft Health Service Executive report on this problem of recruitment which ties in with all the other problems the health service is experiencing but has a significant impact on patients and their families in terms of their access to care, waiting times, appointments, etc., in hospitals and service facilities around the country.

This is getting to be serious because the senior consultant is about to retire.  There is great concern that it will be impossible to recruit a senior consultant without having a cath lab.  It is a serious problem and needs to be resolved as quickly as possible.  I know the HSE capital plan is soon due to come out and we are very much hoping that a permanent cath lab for Sligo will be in that plan.

On the possibility of the need for a supplementary estimate for the health service, I have not seen the precise comments of the Ministers, Deputies Harris and Donohoe, so I am not <i>au fait<\/i>with exactly what the difference is.  It will not surprise anyone in this House that it is often the case that a supplementary estimate is required for health.  That was the case long before 2012.  It is not a recent development.  It often arises because extra costs arise during the course of the year.  One of the extra costs that has very evidently arisen during the course of the year is the cost of resolving the nurses' dispute.  We are not going to fund that from cutting services so there are areas where we may need to provide supplementaries later in the year.  In the meantime, the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are working very hard to ensure that the HSE comes in on budget while still accepting that there may be additional costs that arise during the course of the year which will have to be funded.<\/p><p>As to what coming in on budget means, it is important to get this message across if I can.  Coming in on budget in the health service this year means spending no more than &euro;1 billion extra compared to last year.  It means keeping the increase in spending to about 6%.  A &euro;1 billion or 6% increase more than provides for demographics.  Perhaps they were not provided for adequately in the past but they are more than provided for this year and last year.  The population is growing by less than 1% per year.  The population is aging but not to the extent that it should require an increase of greater than 6% in any one year.  The increase for this year is &euro;1 billion.  It is what people protesting on the streets demanding.  It was done.  We need now to try to come in on budget while allowing a degree of flexibility to provide a supplementary for additional costs that may arise during the year that we are not going to fund by cutting back services elsewhere.<\/p><p>Deputy Martin mentioned that up to 2012, there were never supplementaries in health.

The Deputy is correct that we have one of the lowest numbers of doctors per head of population in the OECD.  Ireland has a relatively low ratio of doctors to patients.  In contrast, we have one of the highest ratios when it comes to the nursing profession.  We are in the top three, four or five in terms of the number of nurses we have per head of population.  I agree that we do not have enough doctors working in our public health service but we do have more than ever before.  This often does not come across but there are more doctors now working in our public health service than ever before and more doctors are registered with the Irish Medical Council than ever before.  Sometimes the impression is given that there are more doctors leaving the public health service than are joining it but that is not correct.<\/p><p>There are more joining it than leaving.

One of the reasons we have overruns in the health service is the recruitment surge rather than the recruitment crisis and the fact that extra people are hired every year beyond what is provided for in budgets.<\/p> <p> On the number of consultants working in the public health service, as I said, this continues to grow year on year.  The number increased by 109 in the past 12 months.  There are, however, significant recruitment and retention challenges, especially in certain specialties such as psychiatry where we need to move to a more psychology based model.  It will not be possible to find the number of consultants needed using the current model.  In certain locations - some smaller hospitals - particular posts are no longer recognised for training purposes and probably never will be.<\/p> <p> The HSE recently prepared a report in response to a request from the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Department of Health to consider the issues raised in the judgment of Mr. Justice Kelly and given the current recruitment challenges.  I understand this report and recommendations were submitted to the Department of Health on 13 May and are currently receiving consideration.  They will be published as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> Several initiatives are being pursued by the HSE to advance consultant recruitment and retention, including improvements to the recruitment process, which is very cumbersome; offering contracts to the hospital groups rather than individual sites; and focusing on more family friendly arrangements such as job sharing and part-time contracts.  The HSE has also established a tripartite working group, including the Medical Council, the forum of postgraduate medical training bodies and the HSE's national doctors training and planning unit, to examine posts where consultants are not on the specialist register and recruitment and retention challenges exist.<\/p> <p> While several hundred consultant posts are difficult to fill at present, only 20 are currently being advertised.  The reason is that many of the posts are filled on a locum or temporary contract basis to ensure the delivery of essential services.  While we describe the positions as being vacant, they are not actually vacant in the sense that the job is being done by somebody on a temporary or locum contract rather than someone on a permanent contact.<\/p> <p> On the issue of new entrant consultants' pay and the proposals of the Public Service Pay Commission, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has said that outstanding matters will be given full consideration by any pay review mechanism agreed by the relevant parties in the context of the next round of pay talks.  In the past few months, we secured a new contract for staff nurses and staff midwives, with pay increases and changes to practices and terms and conditions.  We have also successfully agreed a new contract with general practitioners to increase funding for general practice by 40%.  In return for that, there have been agreed changes such as the adoption of new technology and GPs taking on new work, especially around chronic disease.  In negotiations with consultants we will need to adopt a similar approach in which, in return for equalising pay, we ensure it is not just more pay for the same outcomes and changes are made that are patient focused.  It must also deal with some of the very difficult and problematic issues around the mix of public and private practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300034#GG00700","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562161800,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Can I just get my question answered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300035#HH00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1562161800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I asked about healthcare assistants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300035#HH00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1562161800,"counter":444,"content":"<p>There will not be a third round of questions.

This is not done by private health insurers or the private sector but by public bodies, as it should be.  The European Medicines Agency and the Health Products Regulatory Authority decide whether a medicine should be licensed in the State and for what purpose.  The HSE, acting on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, then decides whether a medicine should be reimbursed.  Some 30 medicines have been approved this year by the HSE for reimbursement but others have not.  If they are not reimbursed, it is often for very good reason.

The Cabinet committee last met on 27 May.  The next meeting of the committee has yet to be scheduled.  There is significant work under way across each of the areas covered by the committee through Government Departments, agencies and a range of interdepartmental groups such as the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board.  These matters are also regularly considered at meetings of Government and in bilateral meetings with the relevant Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress is being made on the implementation and delivery of Project Ireland 2040 and projects promised for many decades ware now well under way.  Through the national planning framework, it sets out our strategic 20-year vision for Ireland&rsquo;s future, balancing rural and urban development and linking it with the national development plan, which encompasses &euro;116 billion in investment in public infrastructure over the next ten years to meet the infrastructural needs of our growing population.  In May last, the Government launched the first annual report for Project Ireland 2040 and it is clear it is already delivering better transport links, building new schools, facilitating better health and environmental outcomes and yielding more housing.  For the first time in decades, for example, three new hospitals are under construction, while 11 primary care centres will open this year and another 26 are in development.  By the end of the year, some 410 school projects will have been completed or will have started construction, providing 40,000 extra or replacement school places, 200 modern science laboratories, 48 new or upgraded physical education halls and the replacement of 600 prefabricated buildings.  In addition, work is under way on several long promised projects, including the upgrade to the N4 in Sligo and the new north runway at Dublin Airport.<\/p>  <p>  The four funds launched under Project Ireland 2040 have a total of &euro;4 billion to invest across the areas of rural and urban regeneration and development, climate action and disruptive technologies.  The first round of funding allocations under these funds, amounting to just over &euro;300 million, has been announced.  These funds will leverage further private sector investment in innovative and targeted projects that deliver on the aims of Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency, another cornerstone initiative of Project Ireland 2040, was established on an interim basis in September 2018 and is working to ensure the optimum management of State land through strategic development and regeneration, with an immediate focus on providing new homes, including social and affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  Housing continues to be a priority for the Government and we have seen strong growth in housing completions and leading indicators such as planning permissions, commencement notices and housing registration.  Last year, more than 18,800 new homes were built, an increase of 25% on the previous year.  More than 2,600 homes were brought out of long-term vacancy and almost 800 dwellings in unfinished estates were completed, meaning the number of new homes available for use increased by more than 22,000 last year.  This does not include student accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  There was also strong delivery of publicly funded social housing in 2018.  We are aware of significant challenges in meeting housing demand and tackling the ongoing failures in the housing market.  For this reason, budget 2019 provided an increase of 25% in the housing budget which, at &euro;2.6 billion, is the biggest ever.<\/p>  <p>  Delivering on our EU climate commitments for 2030 and transitioning to a competitive, low carbon, sustainable economy by 2050 are also priorities.  We are investing &euro;22 billion in climate action through the national development plan to ensure that our future growth is regionally balanced and environmentally sustainable.<\/p><p>On 17 June, the Government published the climate action plan, which aims to give Irish people a cleaner, safer and more sustainable future.  This far-reaching plan sets out the actions across electricity, transport, heat, agriculture and other areas that we need to take to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, give us cleaner air and warmer homes, and create the jobs of the future.  The plan has a strong focus on implementation, including actions with clear timelines and the steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery.  Delivering on the plan will require a deep level of collaboration across Government, and the plan sets out governance arrangements, including the establishment of the climate action delivery board, overseen by my own Department, carbon-proofing of policies in general, the establishment of carbon budgets and a strengthened Climate Change Advisory Council, as well as greater accountability to the Oireachtas through the Joint Committee on Climate Action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300035#HH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562162400,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Can we have a detailed, published set of commitments in regard to capital spending for the rest of this year, next year and the year after?  That is not a big ask.  We are asking to see the capital plan in detail for the forthcoming period.  Ironically, we are in a position, as a country, where, technically, we have a capital plan for 2040 but we do not have published capital commitments for the rest of this year and next year.  How ridiculous a situation can we have?<\/p>  <p>  I want to ask the Taoiseach about two specific areas in regard to our constituency.  First, in general, for women in Dublin and the rest of Ireland, where stands the national maternity hospital?  We know there have been dreadful cost overruns and planning failures in the execution of the national children's hospital, resulting in what any chief executive in any organisation would call a complete mess and a complete cost overrun.  The Government has put its hands up and acknowledged that.  What is the knock-on implication of the enormous cost overrun on the children's hospital for women in Ireland who expect to use the services of the national maternity hospital in a new hospital quite soon?<\/p>  <p>  Second, the master of the Rotunda Hospital, Professor Fergal Malone, wrote a heartbreaking article recently about the pressures under which staff in the Rotunda Hospital, in the centre of Dublin, are working to try to deliver the best services for mothers and babies.  As the Taoiseach knows, the Rotunda is meant to move to Blanchardstown.  What has happened?  We have no idea.  The Rotunda itself has no idea what is happening.  Is the Blanchardstown move still on?  It makes excellent sense but where is the capital plan that would show what is likely to happen.  I understand the Rotunda has resources to commit but the State would also need to commit to this.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to another of our maternity hospitals, the Coombe hospital also wishes to see additional investment and, in the context of the children's hospital, the Government has promised a new maternity hospital in respect of the Coombe.  Where is that?  We have a growing population, which is something to celebrate, but our maternity services are not keeping pace with what is happening in terms of the on-the-ground development of new maternity services for this century for the women of Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300036#JJ00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1562162400,"counter":464,"content":"<p>In his statement, the Taoiseach referred to climate change and the climate change actions that are taking place.  I want to specifically ask in regard to clean energy, which is one of the core issues.  When will we see an end to the use of coal and gas in power stations?  Is there a target for when that will happen and how will it happen?  At the moment, we are importing coal from Colombia to burn it in Moneypoint, which is a ridiculous situation, even if there was no climate change aspect.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to transport, we need to see additional money being placed in the hands of local authorities to upgrade roads, particularly in rural Ireland, and that needs to happen as quickly as possible.  We also need to see infrastructure being built around our rail network, given the many problems, particularly for people coming from the west on the Sligo to Dublin rail line.  I was talking to a man the other day who had decided not to drive and to take the train, but he said it was the last time he would take the train because he had to stand the whole way from Leitrim to Dublin.  That is a problem we hear all the time from students and other people in the north west, namely, there are not enough trains or carriages and there is no space for passengers.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the western rail corridor, an issue I have raised previously, it is clear a time is coming when we have to look at the idea of electric rail as one of the solutions from a climate change perspective.  This would enable us to move people who commute, for example, from Galway and other areas in the west and north west.  It is logical, particularly in regard to the movement of freight.<\/p>  <p>  There is the old chestnut which comes up all the time and which needs to be re-emphasised, and that is the issue of broadband.  Whatever company decides it wants to do it, or whatever bid it wants to put in, I keep hearing that it is always next year or the year after.

As if that is not bad enough, I am not exaggerating when I say that when I tell people there is going to be a private section to the national children's hospital, they do not believe me - they do not actually believe it.  They are absolutely scandalised by the thought that, having paid for this hospital, there will be two tiers of child healthcare.  It is outrageous, especially from a Government that says it is against two-tier healthcare, that we are building a state-of-the-art hospital where two-tier healthcare for children is going to be institutionalised.<\/p>  <p>  When I have asked about this, I have been told it is because the consultants' contracts are public-private contracts.  I have a solution to this for the Taoiseach.  Every paediatrician in the country is going to want to work in the national children's hospital.  If they are not in there, to be honest, they are not at the races.  Therefore, the Taoiseach has a simple opportunity to resolve this and to remove the two tiers in the hospital so it is single-tier, universal healthcare for our children.  He should tell any paediatrician or consultant who wishes to work there that they will only work in that hospital on a public-only contract, which, by the way, is the only sort of contract the State should be giving out for consultants, in my opinion.  Will the Taoiseach do that and at least eliminate this scandal in regard to the national children's hospital?  It really is a shocker.  There are still a lot of people who do not know this but when they hear it, they are utterly disgusted. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300036#JJ00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1562162400,"counter":466,"content":"<p>When the national development plan was launched early last year, it had already been the subject of the most sustained pre-publicity in our history.  The work for the plan was completed about six months before the Taoiseach took up office and, indeed, its details formed a core part of his leadership campaign.  Over the following six months, extra years were added to the plan in order to allow more claims to be made, and millions were provided for a marketing campaign.<\/p>  <p>  At the core of the national development plan was a promise that everything was costed and would be delivered within budget, and there would be full transparency.  This was going to be assured by actions such as the regular oversight of the Cabinet committee on infrastructure and the real-time updating of information on costs and timescales.  That has not happened and there has not been real-time information on costs and timescales.  It now turns out some costs in the plan were little better than thinking of a number and hoping to be right.  Massive overspending and excessive costs compared to the original estimates are clearly evident and basic information is being withheld.  The Cabinet committee last met one month ago and the real-time provision of information stopped as soon as any overspend materialised.<\/p>  <p>  The simple fact is the Government wants to continue advertising its original claims and does not want to acknowledge the impact of major overspending.  There is a complete and irreconcilable gap between the reality on the ground and what has been claimed.  The children's hospital is now well on its way to hitting the &euro;2 billion mark, which the Taoiseach told us was a conspiracy theory, and the broadband plan is tracking to a &euro;3 billion figure, which was also dismissed until it was exposed.  The national development plan is simply not credible until these extra costs have been factored in.<\/p><p>Last year, the Taoiseach was able to issue detailed tables of cost for projects on a regional and national basis.  Why is he refusing to update these tables?  There is a need for honesty with the public in terms of the impact of the billions of euro in overspend on the Government's plans and projects.  Earlier, I asked the Taoiseach about the Dunkettle interchange.  I appeal to him not to be petty, silly and idiotic in terms of his response by asking whether I am for or against the Dunkettle interchange.  The procurement process is completed.  This project was meant to be up and running in early 2018, in terms of construction, with works to run from 2018 to 2022.  The indicative cost for this project of &euro;100 million has increased to &euro;115 million.  According to the Taoiseach, it was meant to go to construction in early 2019.  It is now June 2019.  I am hearing rumours that the costs are way ahead of &euro;115 million.  Nothing is happening on the site and people are mystified as to what is going on.  <\/p> <p> With the greatest of respect, people are fed up hearing about 2030 and 2040 and that the Government is going to do this and that.  Many projects have been announced for the Cork region.  The joke around town is, \"Sure, we can't get past the Dunkettle roundabout\".  That project was to happen years ago.  There is need for a reality check in terms of the national development plan, NDP.  The Taoiseach mentioned the new children's hospital.  The national paediatric model references three regional paediatric facilities at Cork University Hospital, CUH, University Hospital Limerick, UHL, and University Hospital Galway, UHG.  These projects are at preplanning stage but we cannot get any information in regard to how much money has been or will be provided for them.  The language we are getting from the Department is obfuscation after obfuscation.  I am seeking clarity from the Taoiseach on the specific projects I have mentioned.  Also, will he commit to update the detailed tables of cost on projects under the NDP for the next four years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300036#JJ00500","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562163000,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I am always amused and bemused that Deputy Martin likes to accuse me of being partisan and personal yet, as evidenced by his name-calling today, he is very capable of being partisan and personal himself.

This means the budget for health is double what it was for the previous ten years.  Less than 20% of that budget is for the national children's hospital, allowing more than 80% of it to be spent on other healthcare projects in Dublin and throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies will have noted, the summer economic statement provides an extra &euro;200 million in a capital reserve for 2020.  This is an increase in the capital ceilings for next year of &euro;200 million.  It is being provided to meet the increased cost of the national children's hospital and the national broadband plan.  Other projects will not now be affected because the overspend is covered in the &euro;200 million capital reserve that is being provided for next year.  What might affect other projects are issues related to those individual projects, be that planning permission, a judicial review or tendering coming in over budget.  We are all aware that construction inflation has driven up the cost of building just about everything in the State at the moment.  That is not unique to the public sector.  It is a feature of the private sector as well.<\/p>  <p>  The capital plan is set out in the national development plan.  Deputies will be aware that in 2018 no annual plan was published yet lots of projects were constructed, including primary care centres throughout the country, hospital developments such as the new wings at Clonmel and Limerick hospitals and the Dunmore ring road in Waterford.<\/p>  <p>  On the national maternity hospital, Ireland's first national maternity strategy, Creating a Better Future Together - National Maternity Strategy 2016-2026, was published in January 2016.  It represents a significant development in the delivery of national maternity policy that will fundamentally change how maternity care is delivered.  This is coupled with the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, national standards for safer, better maternity services and the first ever bereavement care standards.  On the development of the national maternity hospital, the Department of Health continues to engage with the national maternity hospital and St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to develop a legal framework to protect the State's significant investment in the new hospital on the campus at St. Vincent's in Elm Park.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has agreed in principle to provide the State with a 99 year lease of the land upon which the new maternity hospital will be built.  This will allow the State to retain ownership of the new facility.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has sought and received the agreement of both the national maternity hospital and St. Vincent's Healthcare Group that the board of the new NMH Dac will be competency based and will include a public interest representative.  The Religious Sisters of Charity have resigned from the board of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and their shareholding is to be transferred to the new company, St. Vincent's Holdings, CLG.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of progress on the relocation project, work has already commenced on the new pharmacy and the extension to the car park.  This work commenced in February and is required to clear the site where the new hospital will be built.  It is anticipated that the main project will go to tender in the next few months.<\/p>  <p>  On the Rotunda, it is a longer term project.  As everyone will know, the Rotunda hospital is moving to the Connolly hospital campus.  We are seeking development funding to allow the planning and design phases to begin within the next few months as well.<\/p>  <p>  On the use of coal and gas, it is planned to take coal off the grid in 2025.  We would like to do it sooner but at the moment the ESB cannot assure us that it can be done safely sooner because of the risks of brown-outs and blackouts.  I do not think anybody wants the type of climate actions that results in brown-outs and blackouts.  If it can be done sooner, it will be done sooner but the target that I have is 2025.  It is taken offline from time to time already.  It was offline for several weeks last year but the ESB is not able to assure us that it is safe to take it offline entirely now.  We are not going to impose brown-outs on people.  We are going to do this right.  Peat 2027-2028 is the plan to take peat out the system.  <\/p>  <p>  On natural gas, it is impossible to say.  As I said before in this House, it is likely that we will use natural gas as part of our energy mix for the foreseeable future, certainly into the new few decades.  When it comes to renewables, we can get to about 70% by 2030 in terms of electricity generation but as things stand there are times when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine strongly enough.  The storage technologies do not exist yet to allow us to store power in the way that we need to.  We will need to continue to use natural gas.  Absent going nuclear, which we are not going to do, we need to continue to use natural gas as part our energy mix for the foreseeable future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300037#KK00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1562163000,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300037#KK00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1562163000,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I did not get a response to my questions, again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300037#KK00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1562163000,"counter":471,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach did not respond to my question regarding the Dunkettle interchange either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300037#KK00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562163000,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Written Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1562163000,"counter":473,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300037#KK00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1562163000,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Frank O'Rourke - to discuss the provision of dental and occupational therapy services in Celbridge and Maynooth; (2) Deputy Pearse Doherty - to discuss redevelopment of St. Joseph's and Ramelton community hospitals in County Donegal; (3) Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v - to discuss provision of a permanent Coast Guard base at Cleggan, Connemara, County Galway; (4) Deputy James Lawless - to discuss the strain on the Courts Service and administration of justice in the Kildare district; (5) Deputies R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall and Dessie Ellis - to address the funding issues at the Finglas centre; (6) Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n - to discuss ways to address the commuter crisis throughout Ireland; (7) Deputy John Curran - to discuss speech and language therapy access for young children in west Dublin; (8) Deputy Martin Kenny - to discuss the provision of diabetes pump therapy at Sligo University Hospital; (9) Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin - to discuss the crisis in Naas General Hospital; (10) Deputy Niamh Smyth - to ensure information is provided on the health impact of 5G roll-out here; (11) Deputies Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Thomas Pringle and Joan Collins - to discuss trade union recognition in the health service; (12) Deputy Michael Moynihan - to provide an update on safety works to a road in County Cork; (13) Deputy Alan Kelly - to discuss providing support to school principals; (14) Deputy Louise O'Reilly - to discuss the provision of a primary school on a temporary basis in Swords, County Dublin; (15) Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin - to discuss the need for reform of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011; (16) Deputy Aindrias Moynihan - to discuss an upgrade for Crossbarry wastewater system; (17) Deputy Mattie McGrath - to discuss the need for an inner relief road for Tipperary town; (18) Deputy Noel Rock - to address the issue of noise pollution from Dublin Airport and the effect on the local communities; (19) Deputy Peter Burke - to discuss the delay in the delivery of Holy Family primary school, Mullingar; (20) Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett - to discuss the interest paid by the State on its loans over the past ten years; and (21) Deputies Gerry Adams and Imelda Munster - to discuss ongoing drug related criminal activity in County Louth and its impact on the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300037#KK00700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562163000,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.15 p.m. and resumed at 4.15 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1562163600,"counter":476,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300038#QQ00025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","time":1562163600,"counter":477,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300038#QQ00050"},{"type":"speech","time":1562163600,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, for coming in to take it.  This is about dental services and occupational therapy in Celbridge and the surrounding area.  I will deal with dental services first.  I was contacted by numerous parents in Kilcock, Maynooth, Leixlip and Celbridge who have concerns about access to dental services in local communities.  They have been told that the service will be moved to a central location, namely, the new primary care centre in Celbridge.  They do not typically have an issue with that but they are concerned about when this will happen.  While they were given information, no detail has been provided.  I tabled a parliamentary question and contacted the HSE via the Deputies' line in order to ask for this information so that we could give it to parents, schools and the public in general.  Although it is a priority for community health organisation, CHO, 7, I was informed in April that, alarmingly and astonishingly, there is no date or plan to put it in place and to commence provision of those services in Celbridge for the wider area.  I hope the Minister of State will have some different information for me.  Dental services are not even available in Celbridge at present.  Parents who take their children to the dental service in Celbridge have been asked to go to Naas for the last weeks.  Naas is approximately 30 to 40 minutes away by car.  If one wants to go by public transport, one has to get a taxi or train to Sallins and then a taxi from Sallins to Naas.  It is not straightforward logistically and there is a financial implication.  It causes much difficulty and hardship for families, and a lot of stress because they do not know what is happening.  When will the dental services be in place in Celbridge for Celbridge, Kilcock, Maynooth and Leixlip?  Does the Minister of State have a date and a plan?<\/p>  <p>  Occupational therapy services are not currently available in the Celbridge primary care centre for children over 16 years of age.  They have to go to Clane for that service.  Again, there are logistical problems, such as for families who do not have two cars.  Someone who needs occupational or physical therapy may be a child with special needs or someone with a particular challenge, so it is not that simple or straightforward to commute with him or her by public transport or by taxi to Clane, which is nearly 15 minutes away.<\/p><p> We have a wonderful primary care centre in Celbridge.  On Leaders' Questions earlier, the Taoiseach advocated for primary care and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, did so at Question Time yesterday.  We all advocate for primary care because if it is financed, resourced and staffed properly, it can be a great front-line service to communities and can ensure that people can avoid having to travel long distances for care and stay away from accident and emergency units.  The problem we have in some cases is that the basic services, such as occupational therapy, physiotherapy and dental services, are not in place.  We must examine how they can be resourced better so as to play a more integral part in the community and to provide the service we all want them to provide.  I would very much appreciate some information from the Minister of State on those services and when they will be in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300038#QQ00100","speaker":"1324","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562163900,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for the opportunity to address the matter of dental and occupational therapy services provided by the HSE in Celbridge and Maynooth.  The public dental service of the HSE treats children up to the age of 16 and persons of all ages with special needs at its dental clinics.  This is an operational matter for the HSE, which has advised that a modernisation plan for the dental service in CHO 7 will create a larger, modern and more appropriate dental location for north County Kildare, based in Celbridge.  The new location will service the current Maynooth and Celbridge clinics and the previous clinic in Leixlip, which is now closed.<\/p>  <p>  The Celbridge clinic closed in June 2018 for refurbishment in order to enable it to comply with new regulations.  The refurbishment is on the HSE capital programme and is a priority for CHO 7.  The contract for the refurbishment work was put out to tender and tender returns are currently being reviewed by HSE Estates.  The HSE capital plan for 2019 is being finalised.  Funding will be dependent on the capital available and competing priorities.  Currently, the Maynooth clinic is operating five days a week.  The dentist in the surgery is due to retire in September.  The HSE is engaged in recruitment to replace dental staff.  It is intended that the services provided in Maynooth will be relocated to Celbridge after the clinic in Celbridge is refurbished and reopened.  There will be no loss of service to patients as a result of the move.  While the dental clinic in Celbridge is closed, all patients are being offered services as close as possible to Celbridge.  Routine dental services are being provided in the HSE dental clinics in Naas while emergency services are available from all HSE dental clinics located across the dental area, as per normal.  The HSE is actively monitoring this service and will ensure that all patients will continue to be offered appointments.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to occupational therapy, OT, services, I can assure the Deputy that both the adult and paediatric services continue to be based in Celbridge and Maynooth primary care centres.  The HSE advises that all priority 1 adult cases are seen within five days in both Celbridge and Maynooth, although there is an accepted need to do more to reduce waiting times for children both locally and nationally.  Service improvements in occupational therapy delivery include a number of health promotion groups running in Celbridge primary care centre, while staff from the OT department are working closely with parents in a new three-tiered approach which involves more parent coaching sessions.<\/p>  <p>  In Maynooth, the OT department is reviewing the model of service delivery to include consultation, universal education and support, including drop-in clinics and home programmes, where appropriate, and a targeted approach for children where individualised intervention is indicated on assessment.  I can advise the Deputy that there is a funding allocation in 2019 for the recruitment of 170 community nursing and therapy posts.  Included in that, are 40 occupational therapy posts.  The allocation of the posts will be determined following consultation with the CHOs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300039#RR00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1562163900,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  What was missing is a date for the opening of the clinic in Celbridge.  I accept that the clinic had to close for the refurbishment.  It is a positive development that the new primary care centre is coming to Celbridge, because the centre was built and developed to provide the services for Celbridge and the wider catchment area.  That is all positive, but the Minister of State will understand the difficulties experienced by parents in Celbridge who are trying to get a service for their children.  The closest service is in Naas and everyone is being directed there, despite what the Minister of State said to the effect that patients are being offered services as close as possible to Celbridge.  That is not the case.  Naas is 30 to 40 minutes away and it is not logistically possible to get to it directly by public transport.  The situation is not as straightforward as has been presented.<\/p>  <p>  Given that the refurbishment work has gone to tender and the tenders are being reviewed there must be an indication of the cost involved.  When will the work start to bring the new dental service to Celbridge and when will it be ready for children to access the dental services they need there.  I have been trying to distil the information for the past six months.  I accept that the Minister of State is trying to help but the crux of the issue relates to when the service will be up and running in Celbridge for local children and the children of Kilcock, Maynooth and Leixlip.  That is the critical issue.  If the Minister of State is not able to provide a definitive timeframe today, I hope he can do so within the next week before the D&aacute;il rises so that we would have some clarity.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State indicated that occupational therapy services are provided in Celbridge but that is not the case with physiotherapy.  In addition, unfortunately, patients are not being seen in five days.  Children with special needs have particular challenges and an assessment of needs sets out what they require but after the assessment has been carried out it can take between six and 12 months before they get into a programme of treatment.  Unfortunately, that is the reality on the ground.

Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte provides the guiding principles to transform our current oral healthcare service over the next eight years.  Under the policy, all children up to 16 years will receive eight oral healthcare packages, including examinations, assessments, advice, prevention interventions, emergency care and referral as appropriate.  Oral healthcare packages will also be provided for medical card holders over 16 years.  The packages will be provided in a primary care setting by oral healthcare practitioners contracted by the HSE.  In 2020, the introduction of packages of care for children under six years of age will be prioritised.  In addition, there will be a focus on enabling vulnerable adults to access their local dentist as a first point of contact and ensuring that they are referred to the HSE community oral healthcare service or other appropriate service, if required.  In total, 41 actions have been identified and implementation will take place over the next eight years.<\/p>  <p>  Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte provides the groundwork to transform oral health services.  It embraces the same ideals as Sl&aacute;intecare with the needs of people at the core and where the provision of services in the local community is paramount.

Despite repeated assurances from the Government, including from the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, that the projects would be financed, but that has not happened.  We even had an announcement by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, that the funding was allocated.  Oireachtas Members have been told that everything will be fine, that detailed design will take place in late 2019 and that planning will occur in early 2020.  Despite the assurances given to Members who wish to save those vital services, however, we know that not a red cent has been allocated to date.<\/p><p>Just last week, senior officials from the HSE confirmed to us at that forum that they have not received formal approval for either project yet despite their repeated requests.  That leaves them in a position whereby, if nothing happens to these hospitals by 2021, HIQA will close the beds down.  That is basically it because there will be non-compliance.  Given the current position on the commitments made heretofore, to the effect that significant works would be carried out at the hospitals to the value of over &euro;300 million, the HSE now has to consider plan B.  Plan B is to carry out minor works by 2021 to make sure the hospitals are in compliance with HIQA standards.  This is to prevent HIQA from coming in to close the facilities down.  That means some <i>en suite<\/i>facilities will have to be added to rooms and that the dignity of patients will need to be preserved, but it is another example of the HSE squandering money and waste within the public service.  It is another example of everything that is wrong with this Government and with planning.  What should happen is that the project should be given the green light this year, as committed to.  It makes no sense to carry out minor works on the hospitals only to have to carry them out again when doing the major works.  The Government will probably tell us again it is committed to this work.<br\/><br\/>I will focus on the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, personally.  He sat with me, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Pringle, the current Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, and the committee members who travelled a long distance from Donegal to come to the Oireachtas on 7 November 2018.  The Minister of State told us, along with senior officials from the HSE and the Department of Health that the project was going ahead.  He told us there would be a detailed design in 2019.  He told us there would be an allocation.  He told us planning would proceed in early 2020 and that there would have to be sequencing in terms of patient transfers between Ramelton and Letterkenny while the works were ongoing.  That is now not happening.  The Minister of State's promise has been broken.  There have been deep suspicions among members of the community and the activists about what the Government has been telling them because they have heard all this again.  Last week, a statement was made to us categorically, in black and white.  It is nothing but another set of broken promises because the Government has not given the go-ahead for the project to commence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300039#RR00600","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562164500,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to provide an update to the House on the development of community nursing units at St. Joseph's Community Hospital, Stranorlar, and Ramelton Community Hospital, County Donegal.<\/p>  <p>  The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  The standard of care delivered to residents in public units is generally very high but we recognise that many of our community hospitals are housed in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context.  Without them, though, many older people would not have access to the care that they need.  It is important, therefore, that we upgrade our public bed stock, and this is the aim of the capital investment programme for community nursing units that was announced in 2016.  This provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities, as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including the facilities at St. Joseph's Community Hospital, Stranorlar, and Ramelton Community Hospital, County Donegal.  The HSE has advised that the capital programme provides for the retention of services at St. Joseph's Community Hospital, Stranorlar, and Ramelton Community Hospital, with a requirement for refurbishment of both centres.<\/p>  <p>  Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance and registration with HIQA.

Now, as just confirmed in the Minister of State's response, this is not happening.  A sum of &euro;2.75 million was the allocation for St. Joseph's, and there was &euro;1.5 million for Ramelton.

He can continue to call me a liar, do all he likes, stoke up fear and engage in whatever form of politics he wants but I am not interested and I am getting a bit bored by it.

Tomorrow, a protest rally will take place outside of this parliament building from 12.30 p.m.  Why has the Minister for Health failed to instruct the HSE to engage with the PNA under the facilitation and oversight of the WRC?  This is a shameful situation where the State and its agencies are refusing to recognise the fundamental right of workers to join the trade union of their choice.

That is totally wrong in this day and age.

This group has engaged in industrial action on seven dates since the action initiated on 22 January 2019.  The last date NASRA members engaged in industrial action was for a 24-hour period on 31 May.  It is regrettable that this week it has announced a further date of 24-hour action due to be held between the hours of 2 p.m. on Friday, 19 July and Saturday, 20 July 2019.<\/p>  <p>  By way of background, members of NASRA represent approximately 350 front-line ambulance personnel out of a total National Ambulance Service work force of 1,800.  I understand that they are mostly based in Cork, the south east and Tullamore. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE and the National Ambulance Service have confirmed that again, robust contingency arrangements were in place to ensure that there was no risk to the health and safety of our health service users during the industrial action.  The HSE has confirmed that full emergency cover was provided.  This means that all emergency calls were responded to. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the National Ambulance Service, NAS, put robust contingency arrangements in place to provide additional emergency cover.  The Defence Forces have also been on stand by with a number of crewed ambulances.  The intention, as previously, is to minimise any disruption and to ensure that patient safety is not compromised.<\/p>  <p>  During the industrial action, National Ambulance Service management closely monitor service demand and delivery.  NAS has confirmed to us that during the dates of action there has been no negative impact on the ability of the service to provide patient care and service delivery.  What this means is that there were no adverse incidents.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be clear again on what the actual position is in relation to this dispute.  The National Ambulance Service Representative Association, which is affiliated with the PNA, is a group which is not recognised by the HSE and therefore does not have negotiating rights.  The PNA also does not have negotiating rights for ambulance personnel.  The legal position is very clear.  The HSE and the National Ambulance Service have no obligation to recognise NASRA or the PNA for ambulance personnel.  The PNA, which is a non-ICTU affiliated union, has negotiating rights for nurses working in psychiatry and intellectual disability sectors.  The main union which is recognised by the HSE for ambulance front line grades is SIPTU.  F&Oacute;RSA and Unite also represent ambulance grades.  The HSE deducts subscriptions at source for those ambulance staff that are members of SIPTU, F&Oacute;RSA and Unite.  This is consistent with the fact that these are the unions that  are recognised as representing ambulance grades.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE does not carry out deductions for subscriptions to NASRA, as it is not recognised.  It should be noted that facilitating deductions at source is not a legal right, rather it is a concession granted to recognised unions.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, individuals have a right to membership of any trade union. However, they do not have a right that such membership is facilitated or recognised by their employer.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies, at this stage I note, are asking what progress has been made between the Department of Health officials and the HSE on exploring various options to see how a resolution to this dispute can be reached.  I can assure the Deputies that we all want to see a resolution to this dispute.  I can also advise that the discussions, as suggested by the Minister, Deputy Harris, have been held but an appropriate solution has not yet been identified.  Deputies must be aware that industrial relations policy has had a long-standing objective of avoiding fragmentation in worker representation in public sector employments and the trade union movement generally to facilitate the orderly conduct of bargaining and other aspects of industrial relations.  However, as of today, the fact remains that the PNA does not have negotiating rights for ambulance grades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300041#TT01300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1562165100,"counter":506,"content":"<p>First and foremost, the Minister, Deputy Harris, should be here to answer this issue.

Given that there are already three unions representing workers, the HSE is slow to recognise a fourth union.  It would mean that every time there was a change, four different bodies would have to be consulted and the representation of the workers would be fragmented.

The relocation of Curraghmore national school in Mullingar should be a good news story for the locality.  However, it has become frustrating for pupils, teachers and parents.  Breaking point is long past for all those involved in the process.  There have been nine revised programmes of works and nine false dates for the completion of delivery, including September 2018, October 2018, December 2018, April 2019, June 2019, July 2019, September 2019 and now October 2019.  Each date brought a false dawn.  Parents must now put in place contingency measures because they are being advised that the school will not be delivered for new students in September 2019.  Of the 287 pupils, 47 are going off site.  Those going to Kinnegad have special needs and are some of the most vulnerable children in society.  The programme changes are causing their parents frustration at a time when certainty in their daily lives is being cried out for.<\/p>  <p>  Some &euro;7,500 per month is being spent at Curraghmore national school on ten portakabins.  The Department is renting out the St. Loman's Mullingar GAA club to accommodate children.  There is also a cost associated in going to Kinnegad.  What of the human cost?  Some parents must pay for additional afterschool care because, even though they already have children attending the school, their children who are new students are being moved to a different site.  This is adding to the pressure of getting students to school, which is wholly unacceptable in light of the series of completion dates.  To be fair, the school's delivery has been managed in an appropriate manner by Westmeath County Council.  Mr. Murty Hanly, who is the school's project manager, has worked day and night to deliver it, often at the expense of his personal time, including family holidays.  He has gone step by step to try to deliver the school on time.  The principal, Mr. Michael Molloy, and the school's staff are also frustrated.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Minister on visiting Mullingar and meeting the board of management in an attempt to progress this issue, but we must pursue the developer morning, noon and night for the project's delivery.  There is a national outcry because a number of school projects are late owing to a gap in tender law.  We must examine the legislation.  When a new tender is drafted, a company that is consistently late with its projects can still apply for it.  We need a traffic light system whereby past performance in projects is measured.  As legislators, we must ensure that the system is up to the mark.<\/p>  <p>  Speaking as someone who has followed this project for more than a decade, the series of bumps in the road have been frustrating.  Now that the school is at a stage of 80% completion, there is a further delay.  My colleague, Councillor Andrew Duncan, has secured this issue as a permanent item on the agenda at Mullingar municipal district meetings, with councillors getting updates for the parents, pupils and staff on a monthly basis.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister to keep the pressure on the developer.  I cannot express enough the frustration and outcry in my community concerning what should be a brilliant news story, namely, the delivery of a new state-of-the-art 16-teacher school for Westmeath, which will be a major asset to the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300042#UU01500","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speech","time":1562165700,"counter":523,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta f&aacute;choinne an &aacute;bhair seo a ard&uacute; inniu.  &Aacute;bhar iontach t&aacute;bhachtach at&aacute; ann.

I am conscious that this new school building project was in gestation for many years before it went to site in 2017.  The project, which has been devolved for delivery to Westmeath County Council, will provide a new school building comprising 16 classrooms and a special needs unit.<\/p>  <p>  It is in the nature of any building project that difficulties can arise.  The objective always is to deal with these as efficiently as possible in order to minimise delays as well as costs.  However, these difficulties can lead to some additional costs by way of request for change orders by the contractor and can arise during the construction period of any building contract.<\/p>  <p>  The initial delays with this school project arose primarily because the contractor encountered bad unforeseen ground conditions together with severe weather events.<\/p><p>In addition, as with any building contract, issues may arise that form disputes between the design team and the contractor.  There is nothing unusual about this and the public works contract provides dispute resolution mechanisms to deal with such matters.  A number of issues of this nature have arisen on the Holy Family project and these have been referred to conciliation in accordance with the contract.  Most of the matters are still being considered within the conciliation process, so I am limited in what I can say in that respect.<\/p> <p> Let the House be in no doubt that I consider that the delays which have arisen in recent months are completely unacceptable for all concerned, particularly as the school will have to continue to operate from unsatisfactory conditions with an increasing number of enrolments until its new building is ready.  The programme provided by the contractor which had indicated a completion date in July was most recently changed to provide for a completion date in October.  Westmeath County Council has expressed to the contractor its disappointment with the level of resources on site and the slow progress of the construction programme.  However, I can inform the House that the council reported to my officials earlier today that there has been a significant improvement in the activity on site.  The project is well over 80% complete, with only the installation of doors remaining to make the project fully protected against the elements.  On that basis, I am hopeful that the project will be completed in October as now planned.  I am conscious that lists of dates have been previously mentioned and that we are now giving another date, this time in October.  I am also conscious of the deep frustration of parents and the board of management and I wish to acknowledge the various stakeholders who have been persevering with the project.  Deputy Burke cannot be accused of ignoring this issue.  He keeps raising it with me formally and informally and I know that is something that will ensure that we can meet the October deadline.<\/p> <p> In the meantime, my Department has met and worked closely with the patron and school authorities of Holy Family in order to put in place contingency arrangements to ensure that the needs of the school for the coming academic year are being met.  It is unfortunate, given that the building will not now be ready by September 2019, that these plans will have to be activated.  As already stated, the school authorities and the patron of a school in Kinnegad have kindly agreed to provide temporary accommodation for a number of special needs pupils as an alternative to home tuition for those children.  The Department will be providing the funding needed to facilitate this arrangement.  I wish to express my thanks to the patron and school management of that school and the personnel, including the clerk of works, whom I met in a portakabin on the site when the Deputy and I visited it.  I thank them for their efforts to ensure that we will achieve this timeline in October.  One of my team members is from County Westmeath and very aware of this project, which he raises on a weekly basis.  Decanting from the old to the new school will not be a problem because the new premises is only around the corner.  We will keep it on the agenda and I have no doubt that the Deputy will keep me up to date over the summer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300042#UU01600","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562166300,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his detailed response.  I am heartened that the project is more than 80% complete and that activity on site has increased.  However, we need to keep pressure on day and night and move mountains to ensure that the project is delivered by October.  I am thinking of the children with special needs who will be upset at being moved to Kinnegad, their parents and all those affected.  It is not good enough that they are upset because when the Department commits to a school being ready and provides funding in its capital budget to deliver the school, that commitment should be met.  Through the history of this project, I have dealt with a series of boards of management.  The only person who has been consistently involved from the start in the push to relocate the school is its principal, Mr. Michael Molloy.  I appeal to the Minister to expedite the delivery of the school.<\/p>  <p>  The equipment in the school has depreciated over a number of years.  I appeal to the Department to look favourably on providing upgraded equipment for the new school.  That is the least we can do in light of the circumstances everyone involved has faced in the course of the project.<\/p>  <p>  We must bear in mind that legislative change in respect of tender law in this country is required in order to bring in a traffic light system for new projects such that past performance is taken into account before a contract may be awarded.  We need to protect ourselves.  For me, there is nothing worse than walking into a room in front of 40 new parents and them asking what I can do about this.  The worst part is that procurement law cannot be overridden in terms of the contract that was signed with the contractor.  We must accept that.  However, we need to pursue the contractor to deliver the project and ensure the October deadline is met.  That must be cast in stone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300043#VV00200","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speech","time":1562166300,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I will not repeat myself.

The news came as a bombshell to the workers.  Some had taken out mortgages on the strength of their wage packets from the centre.  More than one worker went home crying in their cars that night.  An Post stated that the closure is inevitable and that the demand for An Post letter delivery services is down 7% year on year.  However, the decline in demand for letter delivery is only part of the story.  Demand for An Post parcel delivery services is up 60% in the past two years.  This is part of a global phenomenon.  In Bremen, Germany, Amazon is building a logistics centre which can house 280 delivery vans.  In October, Australia Post will open the largest superhub ever built in the southern hemisphere.  The challenge facing An Post should not be one which involves closing hubs and axing jobs.  Rather, it should involve transitioning from a letter delivery company which handles parcels to a parcel delivery company which handles letters without resorting to job losses.<\/p>  <p>  An Post has consistently refused to publish the McKinsey report which advised it on the future of its business.  The report should be published.  There should be no secret reports, especially when they are being kept secret to protect senior Cork politicians.  I wish to state for the record that I am opposed to the closure of the Athlone mail centre as an alternative, even if that is recommended in the McKinsey report.<\/p><p>No An Post worker should have to go through what the Cork workers are going through this week.  The real point about the McKinsey report is that it is out of date now.  McKinsey was hired in 2016 before An Post went back into parcel delivery and before the company experienced a 60% growth in demand for the service.  I repeat: the plan must be to transition to parcels without job losses.<\/p> <p> In the United Kingdom, Royal Mail recently closed three mail centres but then reopened all three as parcel hubs.  Royal Mail is also introducing a second daily delivery of mail.  The An Post history of planning for the parcel boom is remarkably poor.  The decision in 2004 to shut SDS, the An Post parcel delivery service, must rank as one of the most short-sighted business decisions in the history of the State.  Having gifted private operators a free run for more than a decade An Post got back into parcel delivery in 2017, but there is still no comprehensive plan in place.  This is shown by the inability of An Post to handle the volume of parcel mail last Christmas, when mail centres were literally over-flowing with parcels and packages.  It is shown on a week-to-week basis by the backlog in delivering what is known in the company as the Asian mail, in other words, the mail order packages from Asian suppliers.  Instead of closing the only mail centre in the south of this country, An Post should talk to worker representatives and negotiate a plan for expanding parcel services rather than resort to redundancy.<\/p> <p> There are other grounds for asking how much planning went into this decision.  The Government Project Ireland 2040, the national development plan and the national planning framework all project a Cork city population of between 320,000 and 360,000 by 2040.  Cork is projected to be the fastest-growing city in Ireland in the 2020s and the 2030s.  How much of this was taken into account by An Post before it made the decision and by the Government before it decided to back the An Post decision?<\/p> <p> The Government recently announced the climate action plan.  The plan aims to reduce carbon emissions across every Department.  How much was this taken into account by An Post when it made the decision and by the Government before it decided to back the An Post decision?  Does the Minister know that millions of letters that would have been sorted in Cork will now have to be transported by truck to Portlaoise?  There will be dozens of extra trucks on the roads and they will have a major environmental impact.  The Government is about to invest &euro;3 billion of the people's money in rural broadband.  This will surely add to the parcel boom.  Rural households will be able to order packages more easily and rural businesses will be able to sell parcel products more easily.  How much did An Post factor in these points before it made the decision?  How much did the Government factor this in before it supported the An Post decision?<\/p> <p> Workers at the Cork mail centre have had few questions answered so I wish to ask some questions of the Minister today on their behalf.  Will the Minister see that McKinsey is published?  Who made the decision to shut the Cork mail centre?  Was it the chief executive officer or the board?  Did the chief executive officer inform the T&aacute;naiste of the decision before the board meeting?  Will the Minster rule out selling the building to a private sector competitor?  Has the building already been sold?  Does the Government stand over the An Post proposal that redundancy payments will decrease on a sliding scale per year for employees aged over 60 years?  Does the Government share my view that this is actually illegal?  If the Cork mail centre is shut, will the workers be transferred over with wages and conditions intact, including the medical scheme, when new hubs are opened?  Will one-day delivery have to be abandoned for County Cork or even for the Cork city area?<\/p> <p> I wish to comment on the Sinn F&eacute;in, Government and Labour Party amendments.  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment is friendly and we will support it.  The Government amendment supports closure and we will be opposing it.  As for the Labour Party amendment, it is disgraceful.  The Labour Party amendment takes out of the motion the call on the Government to ensure that the Cork mail centre is kept open.  Workers at the mail centre will be gobsmacked to see that the amendment has been signed by Deputy Sean Sherlock.  It seems the Deputy has decided to fly the white flag of surrender before the battle has even had a chance to start.  Instead, the Labour Party has called for the publication of McKinsey and for improved redundancy and redeployment terms.  The Labour Party knows that we support all these demands, but it is trying to force us to choose between a call to keep the centre open and improved redundancy or redeployment terms.  The workers know that we will fight for the best possible terms for workers in every circumstance, but we are calling for a vote against this disgraceful amendment as it means throwing out the call to keep the Cork mail centre open.<\/p> <p> I have made some observations about the role of the Government in all of this.  Before I finish, I wish to make some points about the role of Fianna F&aacute;il and, in particular, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  Deputy Martin has registered his opposition to the An Post decision.  He correctly says it is a strategic error.  He said he intends to raise the issue with the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister and the chief executive of An Post.  He was due to raise the issue with the chief executive of An Post yesterday.  Many workers at the mail centre take all of this with a pinch of salt.  They are fully aware that the mail centre would not close if Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin were to demand of the Government that it should stay open.  The workers are acutely aware of the fact that he has consistently refused to do so.  They may not be aware of the fact - I am making them aware of it now - that both Fianna F&aacute;il representatives on the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment agreed this week to a proposal to excuse An Post from answering questions before the committee this week.  An Post representatives will have breathed a sigh of relief at that and they have Fianna F&aacute;il to thank for letting them off the hook.<\/p> <p> I put my faith in the workers of the mail centre and the workers of An Post to fight this closure and protect jobs rather than rely on resolutions passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  You know and I know, Acting Chairman, that the Government can choose to ignore a resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  My colleague, Deputy Coppinger, will outline some ideas on how the workers might fight this closure.  Will the Government act on the motion if it is passed tomorrow?  I am warning the Government that if the motion is passed but it does not act, then the moral authority of a D&aacute;il vote will strengthen the case of those workers who decide to fight this unjustifiable closure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300043#VV00700","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562166900,"counter":533,"content":"<p>This is not only about the important issue of the jobs of the workers in Cork.  It is also about the future of postal and delivery services in Ireland.  It is clear that with the changing model of retail, parcel delivery services are a part of the logistics more generally and are an increasingly central part of the economy.  This is an area of rapid growth, as illustrated by the fact that the An Post parcel delivery service has increased 60% in only the past two years.<\/p>  <p>  It is also an area where a race to the bottom is taking place globally.  Private delivery services have taken the place of traditionally State-owned postal companies.  As part of this change a substantial undermining of wages and conditions has arisen as has a driving down of the levels of unionisation that would historically have been high.  Precarious conditions, low pay and hard exploitation are widespread.  At the heart of this globally and in Ireland is the question of bogus self-employment.  The majority of couriers and those engaged in parcel delivery for private companies are bogus self-employed.  Although everything about their jobs is controlled by the company, officially they are self-employed.  This off-loads responsibility from the company to the worker for the vans and so on to save the company millions in taxation.  Hundreds of millions of euro each year are lost by Revenue as a result of these bogus self-employment scams.  Couriers and delivery companies are to the fore in this.  That is the model globally.  It can be seen in the USA with Amazon Flex, which is the Amazon delivery company described as the Uber for delivery - in other words, based on bogus self-employment.<\/p>  <p>  The closure of the Cork mail centre only makes sense in the context of this drive for the race to the bottom.  What will happen to the workers?  They will not be rehired in the new parcel hubs that will have to be set up by An Post.  Instead, An Post will hire young people on lower wages and conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Who will buy the valuable and strategically located mail centre site?  A local Fianna F&aacute;il politician has written to the chief executive of An Post to report an expression of interest from what is referred to as a global leader in parcel delivery.  A sale to a private sector competitor would speed up the race to the bottom.<\/p><p>There is opportunity here to point in a different direction and go upwards instead of downwards.  Instead of featuring workers with bogus self-employment, this crucial part of capitalist production and sale would feature workers with decent wages, conditions, and high levels of unionisation.  Instead of selling the Cork mail centre and getting rid of these jobs, An Post could take a different approach and redefine itself primarily as a parcel delivery company which also handles letters.  It would then become part of a model of public ownership based on democratic control by its workers, bringing them and service users to the centre of decision-making and in that way putting a plan in place for further development.  Instead of asset-stripping, let us have investment and instead of redundancies, let us have quality new jobs for young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300044#WW00200","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562167500,"counter":535,"content":"<p>On behalf of People Before Profit, I commend Deputy Barry and Solidarity on tabling this motion.  I pledge our complete support for the campaign of workers in the Cork mail centre to fight against the disgraceful decision to close the centre and eliminate these jobs.  The Minister should bear in mind that An Post does not have a good record on making strategic decisions about its own future.  It closed its special delivery service, SDS, which was a parcel delivery service, in 2003 when the boom in parcel delivery was about to start.  It is a self-fulfilling prophecy in that the management of An Post is almost wishing for its decline and making that prophecy come true with these sorts of decisions.  The management has a history of this.  It completely misunderstood what was happening and a boom in parcel delivery ensued after it made a decision to abandon An Post's special parcel delivery wing.  It cannot be trusted to make these strategic decisions and has made a big mistake here.<\/p>  <p>  How many times have we heard both the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il refer to dramatic plans for population expansion in Cork?  They even talk of the population doubling.  Why are we taking away a crucial hub and piece of infrastructure when the population of Cork is set to double?  The planned roll-out of rural broadband will increase parcel delivery as people buy online and so on.  That would be facilitated by this centre in Cork, yet we are closing it down.  At a time when we are discussing climate action, we are planning for these parcels to chug their way up the road to Athlone, Portlaoise or Dublin, pumping CO2 emissions into the air.  It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.<\/p>  <p>  This is a consequence of moving away from understanding that An Post, like many other State-owned companies, is part of a vital infrastructure that should not be based on narrow short-term commercial considerations, but should be about maintaining a critical infrastructure for both the country and the Cork region.  That slide towards deregulation and privatisation ends with stupid decisions that impact on workers and the infrastructure and services available to people, in this case people in Cork.  It is worth noting that this is also part of the push towards deregulation of services of general economic interest by the European Union.  The process of commercialisation and backdoor privatisation leads to the undermining of key public services.  This comes on the back of a terrible history of closure of rural post offices and the damage that is doing to rural Ireland, all because of commercial considerations.  A vital public service having to run on narrow, short-term, purely commercial considerations leads to the destruction of rural infrastructure and services, with devastating consequences for rural Ireland.  The Government should not allow this to happen.  It should ensure those jobs are saved and this hub and service are maintained for the expansion of parcel services in the Cork region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300045#XX00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1562167500,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I commend this motion and fully support it.

This closure will have a detrimental effect on them, their immediate families and the economy.  Commercially, this decision does not make sense, as the commercial figures show that An Post is in good shape.  The company reported revenues of &euro;900 million last year, which is an increase of 7% from 2017.  Stamp and meter receipts are also up 20%.  The use of stamps and parcels is very productive for An Post, so this does not make commercial or strategic sense.  As other Deputies have stated, this closure is a reflection of An Post's shift from a State company to a semi-State company and then to a commercial entity.  That was borne out in the closure of post offices in rural areas, which has had a hugely detrimental effect on many villages.  Responsibility for this lies squarely with the management of An Post, not the workers who have served the centre in Cork very well for the past 16 years.

I understand that it is a matter of significant concern for local workers and there is no doubt that those workers have provided a great service.  This is not a reflection on the quality of work or the dedication they have shown over a number of years.<\/p><p>The sad fact that lies behind this decision is the substantial decline in the use of traditional mail.  As the Deputies will appreciate, the volume of mail has halved in the past ten years and that decline is projected to continue.  As Deputies will recall, this led to a very serious financial situation for An Post just two years ago when we had to introduce special legislation in this House to increase the cost of stamps.  We also had to invest &euro;30 million to support An Post and ensure elements of its public service commitment, such as the five-day service and post office counter services, continued.  The market in which An Post is trading is changing rapidly and it had to respond by developing a restructuring programme.  We are now seeing early signs of that programme's success.<\/p><p>The Deputies are correct that although parcel delivery services were exploding, An Post experienced a decline in its market share.  One of the strategic decisions it has taken has been to radically change that and grow its parcel business.<\/p><p>One of the elements that allowed that to happen on the scale that it has was a negotiation with its employees.  As a result of that negotiation, restructuring has taken place in the context of how the company delivers services.  It has facilitated seven-day delivery in its parcel service and greater flexibility to increase the company's market share in this thriving business in respect of which there is sharp competition.  Nonetheless, the company is doing very well in that business as a result of the restructuring to which I refer.  The restructuring, which, as Deputies will be aware, was the subject of a Labour Court recommendation, involved a decision to make certain productivity improvements, one of which was to reduce the number of sorting centres from four to three in light of the dramatic collapse in the volume of mail.  This is the outworking of that decision.<\/p> <p> While I can understand both the concern locally and the reason the Deputies have raised this matter, An Post recognises that if it is to be a public service company it must take account of the change in the shape of the expectations of its customer base.  If people are moving away from mail towards parcel and from some of the traditional post office services and demanding new retail services, it must show that it has the capacity and the strategy to deliver.  That is at the heart of what it is doing and there are signs it is being successful in the context of repositioning itself so that it will have a strong growth prospect.<\/p> <p> It is interesting that, contrary to what the Deputies have suggested, this is not a short-term commercial perspective An Post has taken.  At the heart of its strategy are four key principles, including, that it has to be customer-centred so it has to know the direction of business customers want of it and respond to that and that it has to be a responsible employer, meaning that it must make the changes necessary to provide high-quality and sustainable employment that will endure into the future.  That is what it is seeking to do and the very significant success it has enjoyed since it started to make these changes is a very good indication of where it is heading.  However, it must be competitive in these new areas, which is important.  It has had to make changes in work practices and investment to be competitive.  Part of this has been a significant investment of &euro;50 million in its services, so it restructured that business.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that which is happening is very disappointing but I also acknowledge An Post has been very careful to ensure that there are strong exit packages for workers who will be directly affected.  It will have redeployment opportunities for the workers affected and it has a 100-strong employment force in Cork county, there will be support for the many changes in training and supports for people who do not choose to redeploy and want to go elsewhere, not only from An Post but from the wider State services.<\/p> <p> This was a decision of the board.  Under law, some of the things the Deputies are seeking to do, namely, to instruct An Post, is directly contrary to the laws we have established here.  It is not for the Minister, the Government or the D&aacute;il to instruct An Post.  We have set up a way in which our State companies are managed which gives the Minister responsibility for certain high-level policy decisions.  However, the commercial management and working out of these decisions must be done locally.  An Post will be sitting down with the trade unions involved to work through the various terms and support workers in this difficult transition.  It has already engaged with the unions and that will continue.<\/p> <p> Deputy Barry raised the role of the McKinsey &amp;amp; Company in this matter.  I understand that it was involved in the restructuring programme from the beginning, dating back to when it was first engaged in 2016, and that it has been a support to An Post.  There is not a McKinsey report on the closure of mail centres.  McKinsey &amp;amp; Company has been an element in the development of An Post&rsquo;s strategy.  The choice made by the board has had to balance the company's various needs, its employer interests, its ability to service its customer base and the best way in which it can manage from a cost point of view the changes it has to make.  That calculation must be done by the company in the best interests of its employees, its customer base and the future of the company. That is what has underpinned the approach it has taken.<\/p> <p> It is important to recognise that An Post is making significant investments in the Cork area, specifically in respect of the future of its parcel delivery service.  Deputies are right to indicate that this will be a growth area.  Even though mail delivery will continue to decline, which puts a major burden on the company, it must continue to win new market share in the other areas in order to counteract one of its continuing declining revenue streams, which, up until recently, represented more than 50% of its overall revenue.  The company must undertake to successfully transit from an area of business that is highly loss-making and in serious decline to develop these new areas.<\/p> <p> I must congratulate the board of An Post, the workers and those involved in management for undertaking and executing a strategy that is bringing about results.  We see the success of the two new distinct business units the company created, the relaunched parcel business and its growing role in financial services, an area in which it can bring new services to its customer base.  It is one of the biggest retail outlets in the country and it must develop that retail potential for its future recovery.<\/p> <p> I accept that this is a disappointing day.  There is no way of glossing over that from the point of view of the workers concerned.  An Post is doing this in order to ensure that it will be repositioned in a very strategic way to service its customers in the future.  It is also seeking to ensure that it will deliver the services required of a postal communications company.  It has looked at successful models in Germany, Canada and other countries where successful change has been undertaken and where the businesses of the companies involved are strong and thriving.  It is encouraging to see the early signs that this restructuring is working and that we will have growing, albeit different, employment over time as An Post successfully builds its new future.<\/p> <p> While I thank the Deputies for raising this matter, I cannot support the motion.  As indicated, I have proposed a counter-motion in amendment No. 3 on behalf of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300045#XX00400","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562168100,"counter":539,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il has the next time slot of 20 minutes.

In the first instance, I would say to the Minister as a representative of the State and the shareholder in the company there is a clear responsibility and obligation on him to the workforce of An Post and to the company.  The idea that the Minister is completely at a distance form the board and the policy decisions it takes does not hold water.  The Government announced the national planning framework to great fanfare in Cork and elsewhere around the country.  That framework refers to \"Supporting ambitious growth targets to enable the four cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford to each grow by at least 50% to 2040 and to enhance their significant potential to become cities of scale.&rdquo;  It also states, &ldquo;A target of half ... of our future population and employment growth will be focused in the existing five cities and their suburbs.&rdquo;  Under the heading \"National Policy Objective 3B\", the framework includes the phrase \"Deliver at least half (50%) of all new homes that are targeted in the five Cities and suburbs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford, within their existing built-up footprints&rdquo;.  This decision of An Post, a semi-State company, bears no relationship to those targets and objectives.  It annoys people when they hear the rhetoric and all the plans with people congregating in UCC for that big launch and people being told that this is their new future and meanwhile an arm of the State seems completely at odds with the latter's overarching objective for these cities.  This is the most modern mail centre in the entire An Post network.<\/p><p>I am not trying to score political points.  I have been accused of being the person who is now responsible, according to Deputy Barry, for the centre's closure.  I will not go there because there are 230 people who will potentially lose their jobs here and I want to deal with that.<br\/><br\/>There is no secret that the origins of this - I remember Deputy Sherlock raised this in the D&aacute;il - date back to an agreement in 2017 between the Communications Workers' Union, CWU, and An Post hammered out at the Labour Court.  A letter from the deputy general secretary of the CWU to his colleagues states that they will be aware of the Labour Court recommendation, LCR21563, issued in September 2017, which provided for the possible closure of one mail centre.  It states that since that time, the union has dedicated its efforts towards keeping all four mail centres open with the surplus staffing which arises from significant letter and mail decline redeployed to the growing parcels and packet mail streams; that while this has been successful to date, the sad reality is the existing letter machinery network of all four mail centres has outlived its usefulness resulting in a major underutilisation of the 19 letter machines at the four centres; and that, in fact, there has been a further 10% decline.  The letter goes on to state that as a consequence, regrettably, the union has been advised by the company that the board of An Post will decide, at a meeting scheduled for 27 June, which mail centre will close, and that in advance of the likely decision being made, the union and company has agreed provisional arrangements to deal with this most difficult situation facing its members at the mail centre concerned.  The letter refers to later setting up a joint working group to deal with the migration of mail from this centre.  Both the company and the national union were well aware that a mail centre was to go.  Deputy Buckley said that in a previous contribution to the House as well.  I say this as a matter of fact and objective reality.<br\/><br\/>What was not clear was which mail centre would close.  Members sought clarity on that in this House on a number of occasions and did not get that clarity.  I met the chief executive officer of An Post - I sought the meeting - and he revealed that Accenture was brought in to independently assess which centre was to close.  I sought access to the Accenture document.  I was able to read it but was not given a copy.  I said to the chief executive officer that it should be published.  There is no great differentiation between Cork and the remaining centres.  There were three criteria, the first of which is operational feasibility, in other words, An Post's legal obligation to deliver the mail on the next day.  The second related to recurring savings on an annual basis.  The third related to staff welfare - how easy is it to redeploy and for the local economy to absorb.<br\/><br\/>On the recurring savings, there is little between the three centres.  In Cork, one is looking at a potential &euro;11 million saving.  It is &euro;10 million for Athlone and &euro;9.7 million for Portlaoise.  In terms of the property, there are once-off capital costs which also are within &euro;1 million of each other.<br\/><br\/>There seems to have been an assessment made that the Cork economy could absorb the employees a bit better than the other locations, and then there is the talk of redeployment as well.  I would raise questions.  I have a real fear - I do not like saying this - that the closure of the Cork centre was pre-cooked.  I cannot prove that.  It will be denied, reference will be made to the Accenture report, etc.  Having read that document quickly - I did not have prolonged access to it - it seems there is no compelling reason that the Cork mail centre had to close <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other centres or why a different approach could not be taken.  The remit given was the closure of one centre, not an evening out of cost savings.  This arises from the Labour Court agreeing a 2% pay increase but that it has to be offset by savings on the letter mailing system.  That is a disappointing outcome.  That is where there has been something of a disingenuous approach here.  There was no clarity on this, from 2017 right up to 27 June last.  People informally held a suspicion.  I suspect that was coming from the workers' side, they were picking up something from the monitoring group or somebody on the monitoring group was letting out information, but we could not get a hard fix on it.<br\/><br\/>The Minister stated An Post's restructuring has been a success.  This House voted in the stamp increase.  The Opposition here supported it.  There needs to be give and take here.  The Minister cannot expect Deputies to come in and agree an increase in the price of the stamp, which we did to help secure An Post's future and to help the restructuring plan, and then to be hit with a closure involving 235 job loses overall, when one adds in the part-timers who will lose their jobs.<br\/><br\/>Neither the company nor the Minister is being sincere when the Minister states there will be redeployment.  On the redeployment, one is talking about people who work night shifts, who work part time and who will not easily migrate to or be absorbed by the delivery side of An Post.  That is disingenuous as well.  Equally, many being made redundant will find it difficult to get jobs, in terms of the position they were in <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>their life-work balance but also in terms of getting similar-type remunerative jobs in the local economy.<br\/><br\/>Structurally and for other reasons, there was a sense in An Post that the Cork one is easier to close than the remainder.  I am not satisfied at all as to the underlying criteria that drove this decision.<br\/><br\/>Having spoken to the workers, much of what has been said is on offer has not materialised.  Workers are at a loss.  There is no hands-on engagement from the company at present, from what workers said to me as late as last evening, in terms of what options are available to them, in terms of redeployment within the company or in terms of advice, supports and all of that.  It simply has not happened, according to the workers there.  Likewise, they are unsure of the ultimate supports for those who might want to move on.  There has been poor engagement from the company.<br\/><br\/>Fundamentally, there was little point in Government stating that it wants to grow the city of Cork and that it will double in population, yet the most modern mail centre in the entire network gets closed after an NDP and national planning framework was published six to 12 months ago.  Here was a key piece of infrastructure.  By and large, it was covering all of Munster.<br\/><br\/>Another issue raised was that the motorways were a factor.  Motorways were meant to open up, not close down, the regions.  The comment was made to me yesterday by An Post management that the motorways mean the company can service Munster now from Portlaoise in double-quick time.  What are the implications for industry in the regions if that logic is to follow through and is that why we have congestion in the upper half of the country on all fronts?<br\/><br\/>My ten minutes are up and I will hand over to Deputy Michael McGrath.  I would ask the Minister to revisit this matter and review it and to take the spirit of the motion on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300046#YY00300","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562168700,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that Deputy Barry and his colleagues have tabled this motion.<\/p>  <p>  In the short time available to me, I merely want to state - I am sure the Minister will be aware of this - that many of the 240 workers directly affected and their families are devastated.  The impact of this will vary from individual to individual and family to family, but many of them are now facing into a very uncertain future.  They do not know where to turn.<\/p>  <p>  On the substance of this, if one stands back and looks at it, looks at the map of Ireland, the proximity of Athlone, Portlaoise and Dublin and the fact that An Post has chosen to close Cork serving the entire southern region, it really does not make any sense from that perspective, yet that is what they have chosen to do despite all of the ambitious plans that the Government has laid out for Cork over Project Ireland 2040, as has been stated by my party leader and others in this debate so far.  There is a complete mismatch there.  When I look at that map and at the proximity of the other three centres, the fact that Cork was chosen appears to make no sense whatsoever.  From a sustainability point of view and from the perspective of developing An Post's business model into the future, the company will need a substantial parcels centre to serve the southern region in the decades to come.  This is a short-sighted decision.<\/p>  <p>  I would ask the Minister, if he is speaking again during this debate, to confirm that the building will not be sold.  There are many rumours that the building has already been sold and competitors of An Post in the parcel distribution business are eyeing up its purchase.<\/p><p>It would be a deeply retrograde step by the company if it were to let this happen.  Many of the assertions that have been made by An Post are disputed by people working at the front line.  An Post says that the Cork mail centre is operating at below 25% capacity.  In comments made by spokespersons on behalf of the company, the impression has been given - many employees take umbrage at this - that it is underperforming.  That really is not fair or accurate.  Consistently, it has been one of the two best performers among An Post mail centres over that period.  As some of the staff have said to me, they have the posters on the wall stating this and they have a trophy in the cabinet confirming that they have been the most efficient and best performing mail centre.  As Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has said, it is the most modern and best equipped of the mail centres.  This decision needs to be reviewed.<\/p> <p> The Minister's Cabinet colleague, the Minster for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, welcomed the decision, of course, and said he had been working closely with An Post over the last 12 months.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has said there was no political involvement whatsoever in this decision.  Is the Minister for Justice and Equality claiming credit for something in which he had no involvement?  It cannot be both ways; something does not add up.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, needs to become involved and make his views known on this.  It is not adequate for him just to wash his hands.  There is a report from Accenture to which Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has referred which should be published and put into the public domain.  Much of what has been said by the company so far is not accurate and does not stand up to independent scrutiny.  These workers feel they have been thrown under the bus.  In my view, Cork has been shafted in respect of this issue.  It is not fair or right and the Minister should become involved to bring about a reversal of the decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300047#ZZ00200","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562169300,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I acknowledge Deputy Barry for bringing forward this motion, which is very much needed.  The announcement of 240 job losses at the Cork mail centre is a serious blow for all the staff and their families.  It is a retrograde step.  Shutting down a state-of-the-art centre is a strategic mistake.  The staff involved are devastated, as are their families.  They are facing redundancy, which is very unfair on them.  Every effort should be made to meet their needs.  We see the great work they are doing night after night so that post can be delivered in the morning.  There is another group, in addition to the 240, who are also at a loss.  They are the seasonal workers, many of them students, who come in during the run-up to Christmas for those very busy weeks.  They too will lose out.  This centre, which opened in 2003, was the most modern in the country.  Its closure is announced against the background of Cork being expected to grow dramatically and its population to double in size over the next decades.  We see also the way in which parcel post is continuing to increase steadily, up some 40% last year.  An Post is in far better financial health, with mail and parcel revenue up &euro;38 million in 2018.  Last November, we saw a 60% increase in the number of parcels it delivered compared with previous years.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred to having a strong exit package.  Having spoken to a number of the staff, I ask the Minister for clarification.  I understand that while the severance package offers six weeks' pay per year worked for many people, up to a maximum of two years' pay, those over the age of 60 appear to be in a far less favourable position, as they will receive a maximum of six months' pay when they retire.  These are people who are on the D stamp PRSI or the older An Post contracts.  Will they have to wait for retirement?

There are some technical issues but the sentiment and outline of the solutions proposed are the correct ones.  The announcement of 240 job losses at the Cork mail centre is very disappointing for the workers involved and their families.  Some of these people live in my constituency of Cork South-West and some live in that of my colleague, Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe, who is unable to be here this evening but shares our concern.  While I wish those working in the other mail centres in Dublin, Athlone and Portlaoise well, it is ironic that the newest and most modern of the four centres was the one that had to lose out.  I said last week that the decision of An Post to close its Little Island mail centre is further evidence of the erosion of services outside of Dublin and the east coast.  The closure of 12 post offices in the greater Cork area in 2018 was bad enough and now we have this.  Two post offices in my own constituency closed, despite a public meeting at which a local Minister of State gave assurances that everything would be done to avoid these closures.  I have first-hand experience of the importance of the local post office network, having worked in An Post for many years.  In the absence of other amenities such as Garda stations, pubs and general practitioner services, I understand the reliance on the post office for both economic and social well-being, not to mention the efforts of post office staff in the community.  The failure of An Post and the Government to offer replacement contracts as opposed to redundancy packages has made the situation worse.  It will inevitably lead to the closure of further post offices in County Cork and further decimate rural west Cork.<\/p>  <p>  It was only yesterday that we spoke here about mental health issues.  It is undeniable that all matters pertaining to rural Ireland are linked.  The closure of rural services will lead to further rural isolation and hence create more pressures on mental health services.  That is just one indirect consequence.  The blame game cannot continue to play out here.  The closing of this mail centre is fundamentally wrong and I ask the Minister to re-examine it.  Given that this facility is the newest of the four mail centres in the country, the decision to close it is counterproductive notwithstanding any savings that may be envisaged.  I am calling on the Minister to take a stand, undertake meaningful dialogue with An Post and put provisions in place to save this mail centre, the jobs affected and what remains of rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300048#AAA00300","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1562169300,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire, Buckley and Jonathan O'Brien.  I welcome the motion from Solidarity-PBP in respect of the mail centre.  I also welcome the fact that the Deputies proposing it will accept Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment.  Here we are again discussing the closure of another piece of a vital network in terms of the postal services.  A number of times, we have heard Ministers tell us in the House that the Government is committed to protecting the postal services.  However, over 200 workers in Cork are being forced into redundancy with great losses to the community and the city of Cork.  Despite all the talk, the decision has been made.  Is the Minister going to stand idly by while the post office network is being run down?  This is a blow for regional development.  If any one of the four centres is closed, it will be a blow for whichever region is losing it.  I find what has happened with the post office network over the past decade very disheartening.  Between 2000 and 2010, we saw 732 post offices close their front doors.  This is a direct contradiction of what Government policy should be.  The process has continued and has done terrible damage.  We do not view the post office network as a burden.  We see it as key infrastructure that is vital to the economy.  We want to see the establishment of a long-term vision for our network. <\/p>  <p>  It is true that mail volumes are falling but we have known that for a long time.<\/p><p>We need more long-term planning and we need to diversify.  An Post has gone from crisis to crisis for a number of years.  While the position stabilised in the past two years, the company was in free-fall for five or six years before that.

The post office infrastructure needs to offer new services.  The use of parcels is increasing and this should be fully exploited.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, represents the public and is the sole shareholder in An Post.

The way they were treated by the company was extremely shabby.<\/p>  <p>  I could speak about this issue and many other issues for 20 minutes but I have only two minutes' speaking time.  One of the issues that needs to be cleared up is the possibility that employees aged over 60 may not be entitled to full severance of six weeks per year worked capped at two years' pay and declining on a sliding scale.  They are potentially being placed in a disadvantageous position.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister stated that staff can take a severance package or be redeployed.  The hours worked and the nature of individuals' duties and abilities mean it will not be possible to redeploy many of them.  What will happen if there are not enough positions available elsewhere for those who opt for redeployment instead of the severance package?  Will those who cannot be redeployed be made redundant?  I have asked this question previously.  The Minister and An Post should state that no one will be subject to mandatory redundancy.  Positions should be made available for all staff who want to continue working for An Post.<\/p>  <p>  The bottom line is that the mail centre should be kept open.  The decision to close it is crazy and makes no sense.  The McKinsey and Accenture reports should be published.

As the Minister stated, McKinsey and Company was commissioned to do a report in 2016 but we do not have sight of any information on the engagement between An Post and McKinsey, nor do we know what recommendations were made arising from that interaction.<\/p><p>It is a fair assumption that the Cork centre was not the one that was slated for closure.  I believe there was a politically expedient decision to close Cork on the basis that it was the path of least resistance.  This process should be stalled pending a further interrogation by this House in respect of the decisions that have been made about Cork.<br\/><br\/>I say this with some justification.  If the previous Minister can come before the House and create a scenario whereby he seeks some sort of moral authority in respect of the increase in the cost of a stamp to &euro;1, and if this House gives that Minister some impetus to do that on the basis that we want to give An Post a fighting chance, then I also believe that we have the right in this House, given there is a public interest at stake, to interrogate the decisions in respect of Cork.<br\/><br\/>I have already rehashed the arguments in two previous interventions in this House in respect of the increase in revenue and the loss of retail business, so I will not go over them again.  However, when revenue is increasing, the profit line is increasing and the company says it is moving into the parcels business, why would it then hive off one of the parcels centres as an area of activity and close it?  That does not stack up and I do not understand it.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding all of that, An Post's administrative costs, according to its annual reports, have ramped up as a percentage of sales and, specifically in 2018, went from &euro;55.9 million to &euro;63.9 million, which gives it an extra &euro;8 million.  To quote directly from a <i>journal.ie<\/i>post on 17 March, in its official rebranding An Post has spent &euro;5 million, changed the colouring of its logo and created a fictional millennial character called Ciara, and there is a whole blurb about the future direction of An Post.  Therefore, in these two examples, there is already &euro;13 million that we have not had sight of or had an opportunity to interrogate.  Yet, we in this House are expected to accept at face value the closure of a vital, modern and relatively new centre.  I refuse to accept the justification for the closure of this centre until such time as we have a proper process by which we can interrogate those decisions on the basis that there is a public interest issue at stake.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, he said to me on the record of the D&aacute;il on 20 November last year, when I first raised this issue, that &ldquo;it must be borne in mind that this is a public company that has a commercial responsibility&rdquo;.  We have the right to interrogate that relationship between Government and An Post on the basis that we cannot accept an at face value everything An Post is telling us in regard to rationalisation of services at a time when its revenue is increasing.  We want the opportunity to protect jobs and to give those workers a fighting chance.  We need to know exactly how much has been paid to Accenture and to McKinsey thus far by An Post.  While it is talking about savings and rationalisation, one could argue that the spend on consultants and on rebranding would have saved any number of jobs at the Cork mail centre. <br\/><br\/>I support the motion.  We have put forward an amendment and I have clarified the rationale behind it.  If it is the case that the decision is made absolutely and we are not given an opportunity in the House to interrogate that decision further, then our amendment seeks to ensure those workers get the best possible terms and conditions.  We want to speak for those workers, if that is the case.  Nobody has given up the fight, however.  This is the third time I am on my feet in this House, trying to defend those workers on the basis of a set of rational arguments that I seek to put forward based on the criteria that have been presented to us, despite the lack of transparency in the process in regard to how An Post has dealt with this issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300049#BBB01000","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562170500,"counter":556,"content":"<p>The news on 26 June was devastating for the workers in Cork mail centre.  I have raised questions about the management going down late in the evening to inform workers before the board meeting the following day, where they were going to make the official announcement that Cork mail centre was the one.  I support the motion and I am glad it is being discussed in the House.  I am a member of the Communications Workers' Union, CWU, and I have been talking to the union about this issue.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin read from a circular that was sent around to An Post employees about the closure of the mail centre, and he has already dealt with some of the points I wanted to raise.<\/p>  <p>  What is happening in An Post with regard to the reduction in the volume of letters being delivered is a phenomenon due to the change over to email and the change in the way people are communicating.  The reality is that the volume of business has gone down to 50% and even less in some areas.  I have been talking to the CWU about this over the past year and it is obviously very concerned.  It knew the Labour Relations Commission recommendation from 2017 had indicated that one mail centre should close and, in essence, the four mail centres where workers were working were all fearful of the news that was going to come down the road.  If it was not the Cork mail centre, it was going to be the Athlone mail centre, the Portlaoise mail centre or the Dublin mail centre.  The reality is that the reduction in the volume of letters means we have to change, and the workers and the unions have to adapt in regard to building a service around the parcels business. <\/p>  <p>  More of this is going to happen in the next period, for example, with regard to workers in fossil fuel industries.  We will have to ensure there are strong unions so that, when changes come about in those industries, there are jobs elsewhere for those workers and redeployment opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  The situation with the letters business is different from the Government's position on rural post offices in general.  It was this Government that encouraged people to go online and to not go through the post office for many of the services people would have relied on, and this had an impact on postmasters and postmistress being able to keep local post offices going.  There was a different policy by the Government that regard. <\/p>  <p>  The reality is the mail centre has closed.  I believe it should remain open pending the development of the parcels service in Cork and the distribution of that service.  From talking to my union colleagues, I know there has already been agreement that An Post is going to modify the GPO in Cork to take on the extra packaging involved.  I do not know how practical that is and how much room there is for the Cork post office to expand and to take in extra parcels and packaging.<\/p>  <p>  The second part of the motion calls on An Post to enter negotiations with the workers' trade union representatives.  That is in place.  The CWU, knowing this was coming down the line, set up a monitoring group to ensure that workers would not be treated badly and that they would get options of voluntary redundancy or redeployment, and that it is not just in the Cork mail centre but around the country that those voluntary redundancies would be offered.  The union has a commitment that the workers will be offered evening jobs in the parcels area in Cork.  The union is confident enough at this stage that no worker will be forced to take redundancy, or at least that is its feeling at the moment.  If it believes there are to be forced redundancies, it will go to the Labour Court and to the monitoring group to ensure those workers are represented from that point of view.<\/p>  <p>   This is devastating for families who were last week forced to face a precarious future.<\/p><p>The union was prepared for this.  It knew it was going to happen and how it could potentially impact on workers.  Union officials visited the mail centre over the last week to talk to union members.  On the point regarding a new centre that will employ workers who are not union members, the CWU will be representing its members to ensure that does not happen.<\/p> <p> It struck me that two thirds of the 240 jobs are part-time.  This shows the way work has changed over the last number of years.  Permanent full-time workers are now outnumbered by part-time workers.  It is important that part-time workers join a union to ensure they are represented when things change.  We do have to adapt to change.<\/p> <p> The increase in parcel services should maintain these jobs rather than result in workers losing their jobs.  The union will represent the postal workers to the best of its ability.  It is a bad day for people in Cork.  It could have been a day for people in Portlaoise, Athlone or Dublin if the mail centres in those areas had closed as well.  We have to ensure that no worker at the Cork mail centre is forced to take redundancy or give up  his or her job.  As I said, the union has put in place a structure to ensure that does not happen.  It is confident that no worker, other than those who wish to do so on their own terms, will have to leave a job.<\/p> <p> It is worthwhile having this debate and calling for the Cork mail centre to remain in the ownership of An Post to be used to develop the parcel service such that the current workforce can be maintained and additional workers can be recruited into the future to deliver that service.  I again welcome the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300050#CCC00200","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562171100,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I am glad to support my colleagues on the other side of the border.  While it should not make any difference, I should put on the record that I am a postmaster of a rural post office.  Having looked at the figures in terms of the savings that will be made, I believe this was a political decision to take out Cork.  The Government took the view that the local economy in Cork would better absorb the hit than the other two areas in which there are mailing centres.  I do not agree with it.  I think it is ill-thought out.  A lot of the methodology in which An Post has engaged in the last ten years, in my humble opinion, leaves a lot to be desired.  I know that many of the An Post workers listening to this debate would want the issue of collection and delivery, C&amp;D, allowances raised.  These are allowances that are not being paid to people who entered the An Post service after 2007.  For the benefit of those who do not understand what this means, in blunt terms it means they are not getting &euro;50 or &euro;60 per week to which they are entitled.  As things stand, one employee is in receipt of &euro;50 or &euro;60 per week more than another employee who is doing the same work.  The latter are being denied &euro;50 or &euro;60 per week, which is a lot in anybody's language.  It is a lot of money for those paying mortgages and struggling.<\/p>  <p>  To the workers directly affected by this closure, all I can do is support the Deputies who represent them, for example, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and others.  My job is to support the motion and to thank those who brought it forward.  It provides us with the opportunity to show An Post that we are not going to sit idly by and keep our mouths shut while mail centres are closed.  It is our job to support this motion.  In regard to redeployment, I find it hard to see how those affected will get jobs of equal financial recompense in a short timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300051#DDD00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1562171100,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I welcome the motion.  The decision by An Post to close the Cork mail centre by March 2020 will result in the loss of 240 jobs, which will have a devastating affect on the workers and their families.  These staff have been hardworking and loyal and this is how they are being repaid.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is on record in regard to the need for An Post to be commercially viable.  This Government has no problem throwing money down the Swanee on grossly overrun projects such as the national children's hospital and the national broadband plan.  It has a neck to cut jobs now because it wants An Post to be commercially viable.  What about all the taxpayers' money that has been wasted on project overruns?  The Government has nothing to say on that issue.<\/p>  <p>  What is crazy about all this is that An Post has turned the corner and entered profitability yet the staff who worked tirelessly to make it profitable are being discarded with nothing but a thank you for all their hard work and effort.  The Government cannot stand idly by, as it did when An Post closed the post offices in Allihies, Ballineen, Drinagh and Minane Bridge.  Most of the post office closures were in Cork.  Cork is the pick of the deal when it comes to An Post.  If there is any cut to be made, it will be made in Cork and west Cork.  <\/p>  <p>  It makes no sense that in the future a letter posted in Goleen and destined for Schull, a distance of 15 km, will have to travel 280 km to Portlaoise and 270 km back to Schull.  I am no ecologist but a journey of 550 km is one hell of a carbon footprint.  How can the Government justify this in the context of climate change and the need to reduce our carbon emissions?

I note the decision of An Post to close the Cork mail centre by March 2020, with the loss of 240 jobs and the devastating affect this decision will have on the workers concerned and their families. There is an increasing sense among communities that An Post is deliberately moving away from a model based on supporting communities towards a solely profit driven model.  This is happening under the watch of the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  We accept that An Post has to make profit if it is to succeed but what is happening is to be deeply regretted.  We know that An Post returned to growth and profit in 2017 following a restructuring of the business and an increase in the price of a stamp to &euro;1, which I voted against at the time.  Along with the previous two speakers, I am a small business owner.  If we increased our prices by 30% we would be out of business the day after doing so.  An Post did it and it made &euro;140 million and a profit of &euro;8.4 million.  An Post has no sense that this money and these profits are being generated through the good will and custom of communities and its employees.  Where is the sense of public obligation?  It is non-existent.  <\/p>  <p>  I agree with the motion that this is a very short-sighted action by An Post in Cork.  The motion makes clear that the Government's Project Ireland 2040 and national development plan targets are to make Cork the fastest growing city in Ireland for the next two decades with a 2040 population of 320,000.  It even took in part of west Cork to County Cork to make it bigger.  When it comes to this Government, one hand does not know what the other is doing.  It is shambolic.   <\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, on the Order of Business I asked the Minister, Deputy Bruton, about the relocation of the post office in Liberty Square in Thurles to a private shopping centre anchored by Dunnes Stores.  I spoke an hour ago with the planners.  Huge issues have arisen in regard to this shopping centre.  Work has stopped.  When I raised this issue yesterday, the Minister told me that work has recommenced.  It has recommenced in spite of the fact that Tipperary County Council has issued warning letters for non-compliance to the anchor tenant, Dunnes Stores.  This Government thinks it can ride roughshod over everybody.  An ordinary man building a kitchen or an extension in respect of which he did not get planning would be stopped in his tracks.  The council has not issued an enforcement order; it has issued a warning letter for non-compliance across a huge area in that development to which it is proposed to relocate the post office.  The Minister is happy to stand over relocating the post office to a building that is non-compliant with fire regulations and building regulations.  It is also in breach of Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, guidelines, with run-off into the river and so on.  It is a catastrophe.  If the EPA was acting properly, it would close it down.  A road which is supposed to be used for emergency access is being used every day.  Earlier today, concrete was being mixed on it.  Plastering of the inside of the building continues even though it is non-compliant.  Is the Minister going to stand over this?<\/p><p>Can An Post or the anchor tenant, whichever is responsible, break the rules at will?  Can a semi-State body override the rules of the county council and everybody else?  It is disgraceful carry-on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300051#DDD00400","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562171700,"counter":562,"content":"<p>We have been debating An Post and its dilemma for some time in these Chambers, usually in the context of small rural post offices closing.  I remember a time when there was a big row in this House about which Minister was responsible, whether it was the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Minister for Rural and Community Development or the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It is like a football that has been kicked around from Department to Department without anyone ever really getting a hold on what was happening.  This has been happening for a long time.<\/p>  <p>  The main argument has been that the financial position of the company was on a knife-edge and that it needed to cut jobs.  It instigated pay freezes at one stage and it was argued that the closure of rural post offices was essential.  This seems to be hinted at as the justification of the closure of Little Island with the loss of 240 jobs.  When one looks at the facts, one sees that since the Labour Court recommendation in 2017, the company recently announced that a revenue of &euro;897 million in 2018, an increase of 7% on the previous year.  During the last Christmas period, we saw a substantial increase in mail volume, with parcel volumes increasing by 50% from the previous year, with 100,000 postal deliveries a day and record sales of postage stamps.  We see continued growth in parcel and e-deliveries.  I think that a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy mentioned that in a city which is meant to double its population over the coming period, this seems like a crazy planning decision which the Minister should look at again.  It certainly is not climate-proofed.  As has been said by several Deputies, the distances that trucks etc. will have to travel without this mail delivery centre do not do anything for the competency of the company or for the possibility of reducing our carbon emissions.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think it is a narrow decision made on a commercial basis.  We can blow that out of the water.  There was a Labour Court recommendation in which there was agreement with the unions that a centre would close.  It is extraordinary when one looks at Athlone and Portlaoise, with only 32 miles between them, that a political decision was made to close Cork.  That is not to argue that any of them should close; I would argue that we should keep all three open.  This company has turned a corner and we have just gone through the figures to show how.  In addition, we also have a company with a history where, at the very moment that parcel deliveries were taking off, it closed the SDS centre on the Naas Road.  It seems to have a history of making ill-judged and badly-timed decisions about its business.  We are on the cusp of doing something about broadband.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and Minister of State, Deputy Canney, sitting opposite us have consistently said that we need this and will not do without it.  They have said that rural broadband will be delivered come hell or high water.  If we are to deliver rural broadband on the scale envisaged and for people to have access to it to buy online, surely the volume in parcel deliveries will increase even more.  Consider the distance that those parcel vans will have to travel.<\/p>  <p>  The closure of the rural post offices has had a devastating effect on towns and villages.  The closure of Little Island will have a devastating effect on the decent, unionised, pensionable jobs that the population there can enjoy.  I have no confidence in the proposal that a jobs fair or redeployment scheme will protect the lifestyle, wages and income of those workers.  We may see many of them being forced into precarious non-unionised and low-paid jobs because that is the economy that we are living in.  Instead, this Government should subsidise An Post with an amount that will keep it alive and vibrant.  This would keep pensionable jobs that allow people to spend money that goes back into the economy.  It is not rocket science.  What is going on here is that people are being told to move over and make way for the great lord, competition.  If any company wants to set up and compete with An Post on the same scale, this Government will facilitate it to do so, as it has done in facilitating every aspect of competition.  We want to see the workers in Little Island protected and their jobs ring-fenced.  I do not have the same level of confidence that some Deputies seem to enjoy in the union.  After all, it did the deal and instead of fighting to keep those jobs when the economy has been turned around, it has been much too silent on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300052#EEE00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1562171700,"counter":563,"content":"<p>The closure of the mail centre in Cork has been presented as a done deal by An Post, backed up by the Government and apparently by a report; the media narrative that it is inevitab; the Labour amendment to propose to accept redundancies; and, the national union leadership which locked into the closure of at least one of the centres nationally.  I would say to workers not to let their fate be decided by other people.  Workers have been told the news this week.  We encourage them to come together to discuss how this can be reacted to.  Workers are not powerless.  We saw it with the transport strikes and with the nurses and midwives.  Opposing the closure and defending jobs is a viable and necessary option.  The reality of the Fine Gael narrative is that it says there is full employment and there is even a suggestion that people can go and get another job anywhere.  What kind of job?  Jobs that are precarious, low-paid and which have poor pension and other entitlements are the order of the day.<\/p>  <p>  What could workers do to maintain these jobs?  Political pressure is vital.  We all know that the Government has influence, as does its partner in government, Fianna F&aacute;il.  There will shortly be a by-election in Cork and also a general election in the near future.  Some 240 workers and their families can have an impact on those elections.  They could organise a public meeting of workers, booking a huge hotel for it, to which all parties and candidates would be invited and left with a message that, in no uncertain terms, workers do not want to accept redundancies and that this decision must be reversed.  The idea that unity is strength is important.  The attempt to pit one mail centre against another, with Cork against Athlone or Portlaoise, should be rejected.  An Post workers can unite.  The workers from the four mail centres could meet to discuss a united campaign against closure of any of the centres.<\/p>  <p>  There is significant potential to increase jobs in the parcel sector.  That is the message of this motion tonight.  We all know and do not need to be told that posting letters is no longer common.  A ComReg survey in 2015 showed the exponential growth of the parcel sector.  An Post is already the largest player of this, with 40% of the sector.  There are seven other much lesser players.  Why would a company which is the key player in a sector allow a modern centre in the second city of the country to be closed down when it could be expanded to facilitate its growth into the parcel sector?  Some 64% of Irish consumers had parcels delivered by post.  Some 50% now shop online.  Online shopping has increased fivefold in just three years.  Small businesses spend &euro;11,000 to &euro;15,000 on parcel delivery every year; it is a significant growing sector.  This motion argues that there is no need for any job losses in An Post.  This should be diversified into the parcel sector.  There is potential for support from other An Post workers in Cork.  For example, many casual workers will lose out in the other depots in Cork if this centre closes because they will not be able to get casual or part-time work there.  The idea that an injury to one is an injury to all is the old trade union slogan that the unions were built on.  A one-day strike in Cork would send a message to An Post.  Actions such as these would send a signal to the company and the political parties that jobs matter.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party amendment is the opposite of what I have just advocated and contrary to what Deputy Sherlock himself said.  It cuts out any idea of opposing the closure of the mail centre and just argues about accepting redundancies.<\/p><p>From the very outset, that is cutting across the workers having any ability to fight.  I even heard a claim from the Labour Party saying that we would cut across people getting redundancies.  I will finish with a quotation from Rosa Luxemburg who was a socialist and a trade unionist 100 years ago.  When they were fighting for the eight-hour day she said:<\/p><blockquote>It is clear that you must not demand a ten-hour day if you want the eight-hour day.  Do the contrary and you&rsquo;ll do well: if there is any possibility of getting legislation to limit working time to ten hours, it is only by constantly pressing for an eight-hour day.<\/blockquote><p>I urge the leadership of the CWU nationally not to lock itself in, and not to manage the closure of the centre but to discuss expansion into the parcel sector with the local workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300052#EEE00300","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562172300,"counter":565,"content":"<p>An Post's announcement that it is to close its mail centre has undoubtedly been very difficult for An Post's workers, their families and the wider Cork area.  The Government very much welcomes the commitment by An Post that all staff will be offered strong exit packages and redeployment opportunities within An Post's delivery and post office networks in the Cork area, where nearly 1,000 people are currently employed.  In addition, further education grants and support in securing jobs with new employers will be provided.  All relevant State supports will be made available to workers impacted by the announcement.<\/p>  <p>  An Post has committed to dealing with the closure and its impact on workers affected in a sensitive manner.  I am pleased to note that An Post has engaged, and is continuing to engage, with the CWU to ensure the best possible outcome for affected staff.  I understand that the union is working closely with the company in terms of how to deal with the immediate impact on employees.<\/p>  <p>  The financial challenges facing An Post have been well documented and, as Deputies will be aware, are primarily due to the impact of email and other forms of online communication on mail volumes.  In this context, An Post faced growing losses and has had to undertake a major restructuring of its business to continue to be able to build, maintain and protect a service that meets the needs of communities across the country.  There is widespread acceptance that elements of the company require modernisation to build, maintain and protect a service that meets the needs of communities.  Much time and effort has been spent in the past two years working to restructure An Post.  The work was critical in order to save it and protect thousands of jobs and the post office network across the country.<\/p>  <p>  In the face of the serious declines in the volume of mail and post office business, the board of An Post oversaw the preparation of a strategic plan setting out a transformation of the company in both the mail and retail business.  An Post has advised that as part of the process a lot of detailed work was done to ensure that the right infrastructure is in place to adapt to the rapidly changing mail and parcel business.<\/p>  <p>  Reflecting its commitment to sustaining a nationwide post office network and daily mail service, the Government made &euro;30 million available in State funding which is being used to support the renewal of the post office network, which will require &euro;15 million, and the continued fulfilment of a five-day per week mail delivery service, which will cost another &euro;15 million.  As An Post is a commercial State body, the support was provided by way of a loan.<\/p>  <p>  Critically important decisions have been made and An Post has been stabilised because of the action that has been taken.  The implementation of the strategic plan is continuing to yield results.  An Post has gone from being in a very precarious financial position to making a profit.  However, as its chief executive has noted, An Post is \"not out of the woods yet\".  It has taken a major effort to deliver the recovery but it will require greater efforts again to ensure the sustainability of the company and the jobs it provides across the country.<\/p>  <p>  An Post employs 9,000 staff and it continues to have a strong rural focus.  As noted earlier, An Post will employ almost 1,000 people in the Cork area.  It is important to understand the extent of An Post's footprint in rural Ireland and the need to protect the employment the company provides across the country.  A total of 6,000 of An Post's employees are outside Dublin and 4,700 are outside cities.  Some 79% of An Post's post offices and 80% of its delivery facilities are also outside cities.<\/p>  <p>  The closure of a mail centre was considered by the Labour Court in its recommendation of September 2017.  The recommendation was that payment of a 2% pay increase from 1 July 2017 was conditional on necessary cost savings being achieved.  One of the requirements of the recommendation was the conclusion of discussions in relation to An Post's proposal to reduce the size of its mail processing network.  The recommendation provides that 50% of the savings arising from the closure of a mail centre would contribute towards the cost of the pay award.  Following extensive consideration, the Cork mail centre was assessed by An Post as being the most suitable for closure.  Currently, the Little Island plant is operating at below 25% capacity as mail volumes continue to decline.  Letter processing to and from the Munster region will be incorporated into existing operations in Portlaoise and Dublin.  There will be no impact on service quality or mail delivery times for customers in the south west.<\/p>  <p>  An Post has indicated that the closure will result in savings of &euro;11 million per year and that the company will invest &euro;15 million in its parcel infrastructure in Cork and the wider region over the next three years.  Parcel volumes are increasing dramatically due to the growth of online shopping.  A total of 1,040 parcel lockers are being installed across Cork city and county to make collections more convenient for customers and a major parcel delivery centre for Cork will open by 2022.  A new, all-electric fleet with zero emissions, will be rolled out for deliveries and collections in Cork city within weeks, extending to Kinsale, Bandon, Midleton and Mallow from next year.  A new &euro;750,000 mail delivery unit to serve the Skibbereen area will open next month.  Cork's GPO in Oliver Plunkett Street is to undergo a major refurbishment reflecting the rapidly growing range of services being developed for customers.<\/p>  <p>  Where such difficult decisions have to be made, they must be made in the best interests of the company, its employees and its customers by the board which has been put in place to lead and direct An Post.  As such, it would not be appropriate for a Minister to intervene and instruct An Post to reverse its decision, as the motion proposes.  There is no doubt that continued transformation of the postal business will be difficult and will require tough decisions but the new changes are designed to make An Post fit for a future where the organisation can be confident, robust, and begin growing again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300053#FFF00200","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1562172300,"counter":566,"content":"<p>Before moving on to the main issues I will start by referring to two small points that came up in the course of the debate.  The Minister was asked about the McKinsey report.  He seemed to indicate that there was no such report.  He indicated that McKinsey had been involved in the process since 2016 and had been working with An Post but there was not a report, as such.  That is a very surprising and an interesting development because the McKinsey report has been spoken about and batted back and forth quite a bit recently.  For the first time we have an indication that it may not exist.  I ask the Minister to clarify that point after the debate.  Perhaps the media might be interested in asking about it as well.<\/p>  <p>  More importantly, we learn of a second report, the Accenture report, which Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin got to glance at when he met the CEO of the company yesterday.  That report should be made public.  There should be no secret report when we are looking at the future of An Post and the future of the Cork mail centre and 240 jobs.  The Minister should publish the report.<\/p>  <p>  I can report to the House that An Post has been invited to come in here next Wednesday, 10 July from 9 a.m. to 12 noon to answer questions at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment on this and other issues.  An Post must take up that invitation and not refuse it and try to be out the gap for the summer.  We will put pressure on An Post to do that.  We want to question it about this.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the more substantive issues.  The Minister said that this was not a short-term decision.  It flies in the face of all the information and data that have been given in the course of this debate about the boom in parcel deliveries.  The argument has been made that Cork was chosen instead of another mail centre because it might be easier to redeploy staff in Cork.  I do not believe that the welfare of the staff was a serious consideration in the matter.  I believe that the key consideration was that An Post felt it could get serious money from the sale of the building and the site.<\/p><p>Rather than retaining an asset, it felt it could strip assets and opt for a short-term quick buck at a time when parcel delivery is booming and when the building could be extremely valuable to the company.<\/p> <p> The Minister stated that the company intends to invest &euro;15 million in parcel delivery and hubs in Cork over the next couple of years.  That is an important point.  There is speculation as to where the site might be.  Will it be in Ballincollig, Carrigtwohill or, perhaps, Watergrasshill?  More important, what will be the wages of the workers in the hub?  What will be the conditions of those workers?  What will happen if staff lose their jobs in the Cork mail centre and end up working in the hubs?  Will they carry over their wages and conditions?  I am of the view that it is the intention of An Post to drive down wages and alter workers' conditions.  This must be seen in the context of an attempt to organise a race to the bottom.<\/p> <p> Deputy Coppinger raised extremely important points on the potential of the workers to resist the closure and push back against it.  She raised the fact that there is likely to be a by-election in Cork in the next six months and possibly a general election shortly thereafter.  She rightly stated that represents an opportunity to the workers.  At a mass meeting attended by all the workers and their families, as well as An Post workers from throughout the Cork region, a clear message could be given to the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il representatives in attendance that they should reverse the decision quickly or there will not be a single vote for them or their parties from a mail centre worker or An Post worker, or a member of their families, in the Cork region, be it in the by-election or general election.  One should remember that An Post workers deliver mail through letter boxes and have the ability to put messages through letterboxes in that regard.<\/p> <p> The workers have industrial power.  They have the ability to withdraw their labour.  There needs to be a united approach involving the workers in Athlone, Portlaoise, Dublin and Cork.  Someone said it was a good day for the workers in Athlone when they learned Athlone would not be affected.  It was not a good day for them.  It is a bad day for every mail centre worker and every An Post worker if one of the centres - it is Cork in this case - is to close.  If Cork is closed more easily, the company will target Portlaoise and Athlone more easily.  Maybe the vision of An Post is to have one centre for mail and parcels, heavily automated and with workers on lower wages and with poorer conditions.  It is in the interest of all mail centre and An Post workers to resist this.<\/p> <p> The idea of strike action by united mail centre workers and An Post workers, first, perhaps, in the Cork area and involving a one-day stoppage, would send a very clear message to An Post management, the political establishment and big parties in the run-up to a by-election.<\/p> <p> There are important votes on these issues tomorrow.  I want to make a few points about this.  The Government is opposing the motion and tabling an amendment supporting the closure.  That is what I expected it to do.  I will not comment on that.  Let me consider the Labour Party.  Deputy Sherlock stated that there is no economic justification for closure.  I agree with him 100%.  If he believes that, he should withdraw his party's amendment.  The effect of the Labour Party amendment is to take out of the motion the only sentence stating the closure must be opposed and stopped and that influence must be brought to bear on An Post to stop it.  Why would one support an amendment that takes that sentence out of the motion if one believes there is no economic justification for the closure?  Deputy Sherlock is not present but he will be watching the debate.  I appeal to him to withdraw the Labour Party amendment if he believes that there is no economic justification for the closure.  If the Labour Party does not withdraw its amendment, I shall appeal to all other Deputies who are not in government, including those in Fianna F&aacute;il, to vote for the Solidarity motion and put pressure on the Government to put pressure on An Post to prevent the closure and save the 240 jobs.  I ask mail centre and An Post workers in Little Island, Cork and beyond to contact their public representatives tonight and appeal to them to vote in support of this motion tomorrow.  Fianna F&aacute;il holds the balance on this vote.  If it votes one way, the motion will be rejected.  If it votes the other way, the motion will be carried.  Fianna F&aacute;il must support this motion tomorrow and oppose the closure of the Cork mail centre.  Mail centre workers and An Post workers should make their views known tonight in this regard.  I do not believe that a majority vote by the D&aacute;il will resolve this matter.  The Government has made clear already that it will attempt to ignore it.  The opposition to the mail centre that can be most effective is the workers themselves organising to stop the closure but I am in favour of giving them the moral authority of a majority vote in the D&aacute;il to say the national Parliament supports what my party is doing and that it is opposed to closure.  That is how the national Parliament must vote tomorrow.  If Deputies do not vote for this motion, this debate will have been nothing but hot air and words.  We need to see some concrete support tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300053#FFF00300","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562172900,"counter":568,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1562172900,"counter":569,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 4 July 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300054#GGG00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Seanad","time":1562172900,"counter":570,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300054#GGG00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1562172900,"counter":571,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Civil Law (Presumption of Death) Bill 2016 without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300054#GGG00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1562172900,"counter":572,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300054#GGG00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1562172900,"counter":573,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Health has completed its consideration of the CervicalCheck Tribunal Bill 2019 and has made amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300054#GGG00700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Parole Bill 2016: Motion to Recommit","time":1562172900,"counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300054#GGG00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1562172900,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, pursuant to Standing Order 157(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business, directs that the Parole Bill 2016 in whole be recommitted to a Committee of the whole House.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300054#GGG00900","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562172900,"counter":576,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Parole Bill 2016: Report Stage","time":1562172900,"counter":577,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300054#GGG01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1562172900,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I understand that all parties are anxious to have this Bill enacted before the recess.

Many of the changes here are for drafting reasons and to ensure a greater level of clarity and legal certainty on the various terms used throughout the Bill.  There are few, in particular, that I will mention.  On the definition of &quot;victim&quot;, the definition of &quot;victim&quot; used here is in line with the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017.  The definition of &quot;parole&quot; here is defined as the release from prison, pursuant to a parole order, of a person serving a term imprisonment prior to the expiry of that term.  It is important to note that release on parole does not and will not conclude the sentence of the person, who is being allowed the privilege, under certain conditions, of serving the remainder of the term in the community.  The definitions of medical professionals are important for those sections of the Bill dealing with the composition of the board and the sections dealing with the powers of the board to obtain expert reports.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 7 inserts a new subsection into section 2 of the Bill, which will mean that where the death of a victim is caused by an offence, the entitlements under the Act for victims to be heard can be exercised by a family member.  This must, of course, be anticipated for many of the cases coming to the Parole Board in respect of a decision.  The Parole Board will initially only be considering life sentence prisoners, who will in most cases be serving sentences either for murder or manslaughter, although the Bill does provide that this can be extended later by regulation to other prisoners who may be serving long sentences.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 9 is related to amendment No. 7, which inserts a new section 3 into the Bill, which provides a mechanism for dealing with a decision on which a family member may exercise rights under the Bill.Amendment Nos. 7 and 9 reflect the provisions in the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 8 inserts a new subsection (3) into section 2 of the Bill to state that the Bill applies to people who were sentenced to detention when they were a child but are now in an adult prison and that the period that they spent in child detention centre is included when calculating the length of sentence served for the purpose of determining when they first become eligible to be considered for parole.  This ensures that prisoners who were sentenced to life as children are treated similarly to those sentenced as adults.  This amendment No. 8 also ensures that a person can apply for parole while on temporary release and that any periods that a prisoner spent on temporary release during his sentence can be included for the purpose of calculating when they become eligible to be considered for parole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300055#HHH00400","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1562173500,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I welcome this debate on the Parole Bill and I share the sentiment expressed by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on our joining together to enact it.

I support the amendments the Minister has referred to, namely, amendments Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, which in effect expand and provide greater definition in the interpretation section and also deal with sections 2 to 5, inclusive.  As the Minister outlined, these deal with, in particular, the difficult situation that can arise when the family of a victim of crime cannot identify who should be the person who makes submissions to the board, and this is dealt with in amendment No. 9.  This also deals expressly with the fact that the Act is without prejudice to other pieces of legislation, such as the Criminal Justice Act 1951 and the temporary release provisions in another piece of criminal justice legislation.  I had indicated that in respect of the explanatory memorandum before the House when we debated this on Second Stage.  The proposed amendment No. 11 is more appropriate and is worthwhile having it included.

I would contend that they reflect the intentions of Deputy O'Callaghan to large measure.  There are some changes, which I will make brief reference to now, if I may.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 17 inserts a section on the functions of the board replacing the existing section 7.  Importantly, this is the section that provides that the board is to be independent in the performance of its functions, which is a central feature of Deputy O'Callaghan's legislation.  While the primary functions of the board are described throughout the body of the Bill, this section gives the board the power to do other things such as providing information in respect of its functions.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 18 refers to the membership of the board and replaces the existing section 8.  The original policy intent as to how people are to be appointed to the board is retained.  While members of the board are technically to be appointed by the Minister, the majority will in effect be nominated by State bodies and a number of professional organisations.  This is to ensure that the board has the necessary range and depth of expertise to make decisions properly on the matter of parole.  There will be experts in law and psychology and experts with experience in psychiatry.  There will be a member of the staff of the Irish Prison Service, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a probation officer.  These will bring their expertise of working on a day-to-day basis on the front line within the criminal justice system to the decisions of the board.  Another member of the board will be drawn from an NGO working in an area of prisoners' rights or prison reform.  The other members will be persons chosen on the basis of their experience and expertise.  This section also includes provisions to ensure that there will be a gender balance on the board.<\/p><p>There have been some suggestions that board members should be appointed following an open competition by the Public Appointments Service.  I am not averse to this idea in principle, but I am concerned, especially in the early years, that this would confine the selection process to those who apply.  This might result in the necessary and appropriate breadth of experience and expertise not being available to the board.  I would say to those Deputies who may have some concerns that I am happy to keep this matter under review.  We can re-examine it at some stage in the future in light of the experience and workings of the board.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 deal with the terms of the appointments, the matter of resignation from the board, the ineligibility of board members and the removal of board members.  As with an earlier amendment, these are standard provisions in legislation of this kind.  These sections replace the original section 9 of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300056#JJJ02500","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1562174100,"counter":633,"content":"<p>These amendments amend the Part of the Bill that governs the Parole Board.  Amendment No. 17 seeks to provide a more precise definition of the functions of the board than was outlined in section 7 of the Bill as originally drafted.  I am happy to go along with that.  The amendment is effective and beneficial.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister stated, amendment No. 18 sets out specifically what the membership of the board should be.  This is similar to what was originally outlined in the section 8 that I drafted, and it remains the case that the membership of the board can number no more than 15.  The Minister, in the amendment, has suggested that the number of members should be between 12 and 15.  That is appropriate, and it is worthwhile keeping flexibility in that respect.<\/p>  <p>  One of the concerns with the parole process was that the Executive had too much control over it in that the Minister appointed the Parole Board and ultimately made the decision on whether parole was granted.  I am pleased that the Minister has kept on board the proposal in the original legislation, which is that, although he appoints the people, the individuals are nominated by persons who are independent of the Government.  For example, the chairman of the board will be nominated by the Chief Justice and any lawyer on the board will be nominated by the Bar Council or the Law Society.  Obviously, this is a board that will require members with diverse abilities across multifaceted disciplines.  For that reason, we need to have psychiatrists and psychologists on the board.  It will not be the Government that will be nominating them.  Rather, they will be nominated by their respective professional bodies.  However, the Minister will ultimately appoint.  A person will be nominated by the Irish Prison Service, the Garda and the Probation Service.  People may be concerned that these are all entities that are under the control of the Department of Justice and Equality, but the days of a Minister trying to influence the appointment of individuals to boards such as this are long gone.  Although some people may have concerns about the fact that the Department will have some level of indirect control over it, I do not share those concerns.<\/p>  <p>  In the Bill as originally drafted, I included a member of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, which is a body that does a great deal of excellent work on behalf of prisoners.  I specifically identified it in the legislation as being an entity that should nominate a person for membership of the Parole Board.  That is not included, but I note that there will be a representative from an NGO that specialises in advocating for the rights of persons in prisons.  Being realistic, the IPRT will fulfil that function in any event.  I urge the Minister, who will have the executive power in respect of appointing that person, to do so and to concentrate on that body.<\/p><p>The rest of the amendments are standard amendments in language favoured by the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers regarding the term of appointment, resignation and removal of members.

It is correct to have a certain level of flexibility in the number of members, with between 12 and 15 being permissible.  Many of the categories of appointee identified are appropriate for membership of the board.  In some respects, these proposals closely resemble what was outlined by Deputy O'Callaghan in the Bill previously.  However, there are several key differences.  One is that the original Bill proposed that panel convenors be appointed by the Public Appointments Service.  The removal of that provision is a regressive step, which is why I do not support the amendment.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan identified a point regarding agencies of the Department of Justice and Equality and people appointed directly by the Minister.  I do not believe that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, would have in any way used either the offices or the appointees to try to influence this process.  However, the point is that this is similar to the situation for Caesar's wife, in that the Department must not only be above reproach, but seen to be so.  The involvement of the Public Appointments Service is important for the confidence of those going before the parole board to seek parole and their families, as well as the interests of the victims of crime.  It is important that the board is as independent as possible and is seen to be so.  For that reason, the proposal in the amendment is a regressive step.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the amendment removes subsection 8(2)(h) of the Bill, which provides for the inclusion of a representative nominated by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, and that is a regressive step.  <\/p>  <p>  On a minor drafting issue, I may be wrong, but section10(3)(a)(i) as proposed in amendment No. 18 should include the word \"or\" in order to be clear that it is one of the three conditions, rather than the first and one of the latter two.

If that is the case and he is open to it being reviewed on many levels in two years, I will support the amendments in this grouping.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Penal Reform Trust has been mentioned and given great praise.  It does tremendous work, but it worries about funding from year to year.

including how it conducts its meetings and gathers information to assist it in the making of a decision.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 21 deals with the powers of the board.  The Bill as it stands provides that the board would sit in panels of three to five members to consider applications for parole.  Upon careful examination, it became apparent that there were legal and policy concerns with this approach, mainly relating to consistency in the composition of these panels, how the full range of expertise of the board could be brought to bear in every case and that the panels could lead to a disparity of treatment between different parole applications.  I decided that all decisions should be made by the full board, although meetings and information gathering can still be conducted by a subgroup of the board to be determined by its chair.<\/p><p>The Bill also envisages two ways in which decisions on parole could be made, namely, a review and a hearing, with the hearing being somewhat more formal in terms of process.  I decided there should be a single consistent process that is robust and transparent, although I am anxious to ensure that it is not overly formal.  As the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald, outlined when the Bill was discussed on Second Stage, a formal hearing process could become adversarial.  I am keen to ensure that the new process will be closer to that of the current parole board, albeit with some important differences.  The board would have the power to obtain reports about the prisoner.  For example, it can direct the Irish Prison Service to provide a report on the prisoner's behaviour in prison, engagement with treatment and involvement or otherwise with education programmes.  It can obtain psychological reports in respect of the prisoner.  The board can meet with the prisoner, interview him or her and provide him or her an opportunity to put forward a case for being granted parole.  This meeting or interview can be conducted by two or more members of the board and may take place at the prison.  All of this will help the board to determine whether the person poses a risk to the public, or has been rehabilitated.<\/p><p>At this stage of the process, the victim will be entitled to make an oral submission to the board should he or she so wish.  Under the current system, the victim is entitled to write to the board and the board takes these submissions very seriously.  However, I know that some victims would prefer an opportunity to address the board personally, and it is important that we give favourable consideration towards providing for that.<\/p><p>Legal representation and legal aid will be provided for the parole applicant and the victim in the parole process.  The board will be making decisions which have a significant impact on a prisoner's liberty.  Many prisoners will have limited capacity to make their case.  Legal representation for the applicant was a recommendation of the final report of the strategic review on penal policy published in 2014.  As I stated, the victim will also be entitled to legal representation and legal aid.  This will help ensure that the balance is maintained between the need of the applicant and the requirements of the victim.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 23 deals with the practical arrangements for meetings of the board, the matter of a quorum and other procedural details.<\/p><p>On a matter of clarification on the legal representation, the provision of such for the victim and the applicant is a feature of the Bill in its current form.  The amendment as proposed provides for legal aid to be given for that purpose.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 22 provides for the board to make its own procedures under the Act, subject to stipulations.  In particular, there is a requirement for these procedures to be fair.<\/p><p>There are certain matters that the board is obliged to take into consideration.<\/p> <p> These amendments will ensure the board can determine procedural detail such as timeframes and the manner in which notifications are to be made.  This allows for the less formal structures of which I speak and for a degree of flexibility and practicality.  There will be limits on the discretion of the board.  For example, the board will have to allow for legal representation.  It will have to notify the victim of consideration of an application of parole and give the victim an explanation of how he or she will participate in the process.  The board will also provide the parole applicant with the information it will consider in reaching a decision.<\/p> <p> I have referred already to amendment No. 23.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 24 provides that members of the board and the chief executive will not be liable for damages for the performance in good faith of the functions of the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300057#KKK01500","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562175300,"counter":647,"content":"<p>These are probably the most significant amendments that have been tabled by the Government.  They will change the Bill as originally drafted.  Under the Bill as passed on Second Stage - it went through Committee Stage as well - there were to be panels and panel convenors.  Under the legislation as originally drafted, there were to be reviews and hearings.  Reviews would take place on the basis of a paper analysis of the application.  These would have been appropriate for less controversial applications, for those that could be dealt with by the Parole Board without too much controversy or difficulty.  Hearings were to take place, however, where an issue arose requiring greater deliberation.  Under the original legislation, the board was to sit in different panels.  Of the board's 15 members or thereabouts, a panel of three to five members would be constituted to hear a parole application and it could conduct a review or direct that there be a hearing.<\/p>  <p>  I had the benefit of the expert advice that the Minister has available to him in his Department.  I had an informative meeting with officials from the Department, for which I thank the Minister and the officials.  They provided me with an insight into the thinking of the Department and the reasons those responsible thought they needed to change the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that the process of different panels within the Parole Board could become complicated.  It could make it difficult for the board to make determinations based on the assembled qualifications that exist within the board.  I appreciate and understand the logic of moving away from the panel criteria and allowing the board to operate as one entity.  I suppose it will mean the board will be able to set its procedures for reviews and hearings.  That is a matter for the board to determine.  I am supportive of these amendments.  I recognise the Minister's logic in putting them forward.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister mentioned, the original Bill provided for legal representation.  It is an important that the person who is seeking parole has an opportunity to put forward his or her best case.  Similarly, as the Minister has indicated, victims of crime are to be involved.  This is at the heart of the Bill.  I believe they should have a say in whether a life sentence should in practice be reduced significantly.  It is beneficial that there is legal representation for families affected.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has now provided that those families will not have merely abstract legal representation but, rather, they will get the benefit of legal aid so that they can be heard.  I also see the logic of the requirement that if one party is to be given legal assistance, the other must be given assistance too.

It potentially ensures a certain level of uniformity to have things done through the board rather than through panels as originally proposed.<\/p>  <p>  The point on hearing the voices of the victims of crime is right.  It is important that those seeking parole have the right to put their case forward.  We have discussed this in several Bills in recent times.  I expect the Minister was discussing the matter in the Seanad earlier today as well.  The voices of the victims of crime during the past 200 years have become more marginal.  We need to be conscious of ensuring that they have more of a participatory stake in the justice system.  It is right that they have a say.  It is right that they have legal representation.  A balancing of rights must be struck but I believe it is right and proper that they have their say and that they have legal aid.

Amendment No. 25 provides that the staff will be civil servants appointed by the Minister under the usual terms and conditions of such appointments.  Amendments Nos. 26 to 30, inclusive, insert a series of new sections providing for a chief executive of the board.  The role of the chief executive will be to manage and control generally the board staff, administration and business.  The chief executive will have to prepare the accounts for audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The chief executive is to be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees.

I am sure neither the Minister, nor I or anyone else wants this to turn into a large quango.<\/p><p>I do not believe that will be the case.  The Parole Board currently operates efficiently on limited resources and I do not see any reason it should have to become much bigger as a statutory body than it currently is as a non-statutory body.  The workload will increase over the years and it will be necessary for the board to be properly resourced.  For that reason, it is appropriate that we set out procedures and rules for the staff and chief executive of the board and that the Minister will be able to appoint staff to it.  In doing so, I have no doubt that he will liaise with the members of the board on what the full requirements of their workload are.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 27 deals with superannuation.  Amendments Nos. 28, 29, and 30 deal with the accountability of the chief executive to the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees.  All Members of the Oireachtas will know that when the chief executive of the Parole Board comes before any Oireachtas committee, they will not be able to ask him questions about individual parole cases.  I know that will not happen, but I am pleased to see it set out in the legislation that the function of the Committee of Public Accounts is to ensure the Parole Board's moneys are being appropriately and properly spent.<\/p> <p> Deputy Connolly's amendment No. 31 has been overtaken by events as we have already amended the section dealing with membership of the board and the reference to the Irish Penal Reform Trust has been removed.  It is a matter for Deputy Connolly but I do not think it is necessary to push her amendment since the relevant provision has already been changed.

Given that the panel structure has been removed, we would have to amend the wording of section 15 in the Seanad.  It is appropriate, however, to provide for some form of review within a relatively short period of a parole decision, although it would not have to be done in the manner provided for in the section.  It is reasonable to have reviews because people deserve an opportunity to have parole decisions looked over again.

subsection.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>These amendments deal with eligibility for parole and how an application is made.  Members will see that Part 3 of the Bill deals with the parole process.  Due to the Bill's move away from the distinction between reviews and hearings, as well as for drafting reasons, it was necessary to replace this Part in its entirety.  However, I am keen to ensure that I have retained the essence of what Deputy O'Callaghan intended in bringing forward this Bill.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 34 inserts a new section relating to eligibility for parole.  The Bill in its current form increases the length of time which must be served by a life sentence prisoner before being considered for parole.  Members will be aware that prisoners serving a life sentence currently become eligible after they have served seven years.  Under this Bill, that increases to 12 years and the amendments I am proposing will not affect that.  I hope that increase will go some way towards limiting the ongoing trauma, distress and upset victims currently experience when they are notified that a prisoner is to be considered for parole seven years into his or her sentence.  Eligibility to be considered by the new Parole Board will be limited initially to those serving life sentences, although the Minister will eventually be able to extend it to other prisoners serving long sentences through regulation.  Parole is particularly relevant for life sentence prisoners because of the need, recognised by the European Court of Human Rights, to ensure prisoners are not detained indefinitely without any prospect of revisiting or review.<\/p><p>This amendment also states that prisoners who are serving mandatory minimum sentences are not eligible until the minimum period has been served.  It sets out how eligibility is to be decided when a prisoner is serving a concurrent or consecutive sentences.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 35 provides that the Irish Prison Service will notify the board of who is eligible for parole and also if a person becomes ineligible, for example, if they are convicted of another offence.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 36 deals with the application process for parole.  The board will notify the prisoner six months before he becomes eligible.  The prisoner writes to the board to confirm that they wish to apply for parole.<\/p> <p> I oppose amendment No. 50, assuming Deputy Connolly moves it.  The process for applying for parole is dealt with in the new section 26.  I invite the Deputy to accept these issues are dealt with in the new section but I agree that prisoners should be notified by the board when they are eligible for parole.  This is the current practice.  If we consider the new section 26, this is provided for in subsection (1).  My contention is that the import of Opposition amendment No. 50 in the name of Deputy Connolly has in effect been provided for. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300059#MMM02800","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562176500,"counter":691,"content":"<p>The Minister is correct when he said the essence of what was in Part 3 of my Bill has been retained in the amendments.  Under Part 3 of the legislation, the parole process is set out.  In the Bill, as originally drafted, we included sections dealing with guiding principles, criteria for parole, eligibility and consideration for parole.  In many respects, the Minister's draft has it in a very similar format.  There is eligibility for parole, which is dealt with in the new section 24.  The Minister mentioned a point that was in the earlier draft I prepared which stated that people convicted of a life sentence would not eligible to apply for parole until they had served 12 years.  That is an important provision and I welcome the fact the Minister has retained it in his proposal.  We talk about the victims of crime and it is unfair on the family of somebody who has been murdered to be told after having served seven years the person who murdered their family member can apply for parole.  An application for parole can start when a person has served seven years but in reality there is no prospect of that person getting parole.  If we consider any of the decisions of the Parole Board, it is clear that nobody who is sentenced to life imprisonment gets parole after serving seven years.  It also has the effect of misleading a person who is serving a life sentence into believing he or she has a prospect of getting out of prison after serving seven years.  He or she does not.  It is important we set on a statutory basis that one cannot apply for parole until such time as one has served 12 years, if one is sentenced to life imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister deals in amendment No. 35 with how a prisoner will be informed of his or her entitlement to apply for parole.  We know from the new section 25 that the Prison Service will notify the board in writing of the eligibility of a person for parole and once the Irish Prison Service is informed of that the parole applicant shall be entitled to be informed of it so that he or she can bring forward their application for parole.  That is a sensible way of doing it.  It takes pressure off the prisoner in terms of trying to find out when they can apply for parole.  Now a prisoner will be told by the Prison Service that he or she is eligible for parole and an application can be made.  Section 26 sets out how the application for parole will arise.  Section 27 deals with the decision on parole, which is an important decision.  In the first instance, we will be only dealing with people who have life sentences imposed upon them.  There are conflicting rights at stake.  First, there is the right of the community to be protected, which is the fundamental priority.  The system is stating that a person who is given a life sentence should go to prison for life but in reality that does not happen because we hold out the prospect of rehabilitation and redemption.  After serving 12 years a person may apply for parole.  It may be that in the vast majority of cases a person will not be granted parole having served 12 years.  As the Parole Board currently operates, the likely time one must serve before one can get out from a life sentence is of the order of 18 years.  We need to ensure the process is properly considered.  I welcome the fact we will have a statutory regime in place so that the person applying for parole and the families of victims of murder can have a say in respect of it.  I will be supporting these amendments.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister said, Deputy Connolly's amendment is not necessary because under the provision of the section I referenced there will be an obligation on the Prison Service to inform the Parole Board of when a prisoner is eligible for parole and the Parole Board must then tell the prisoner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300060#NNN00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1562176500,"counter":692,"content":"<p>I accept my amendment is covered in section 26.  It is important my proposal is included as it was not included originally.  The onus is now on the Parole Board to inform the prisoner, and I welcome that.  I will be guided by the Acting Chairman on this.  I have a difficulty with the 12-year period.  I have a later amendment proposing that the period be reduced to eight years.  It is actually seven years.  I will not be supporting the period of 12 years.  I fully support the victim.  The victim and the protection of the community must be foremost in this respect.  I am not sure where the Deputy is coming from in this regard.  The Parole Board annual report 2017 points out the difficulties on the ground.  The report refers to the delays in the timeframes for the review of an individual serving a life sentence.  There are major delays on the ground.  The report states that such delays can be based on the Parole Board not receiving reports in a timely manner, delaying the complete dossier from being available, and-or the capacity within the Parole Board secretariat to administer the volume of cases.  The report concludes that the current parole model is not efficient and requires change and states that hopefully, the new Parole Bill, which is due to be debated, will bring about substantial changes.  The Parole Board is highlighting the problems on the ground and stating that the reviews cannot be done.<\/p><p>I agree fully with what Deputy O'Callaghan is trying to do with this Bill and I support almost all of it.  I read the debate on the Bill when it was considered by the Select Committee on Justice and Equality on 24 May.  On the proposed amendment to  delete &quot;eight&quot; and substitute &quot;twelve&quot;, Deputy O'Callaghan stated: <\/p><blockquote>At present the Parole Board is required to consider people who are convicted of a life-sentence offences for parole after eight years.  It is just not feasible because people do not get parole after eight years.  Parole is not generally considered until after 12 years... <\/blockquote><p>For that reason he proposed putting on a statutory basis something I cannot support on the basis of that logic.  I would have thought we needed to improve the system rather than copperfasten a bad system.  The Parole Board's report highlights victims and families and clearly states how often it receives letters from victims and families.  It states that if a case involves a murder, many family members are still experiencing severe trauma and mental health problems after the death of their loved one.  I want to put that on the record.  The Parole Board's report states that these letters are seriously considered before deciding on a recommendation.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The difficulty I see here is the logic behind it because in reality they are not considered for parole at eight years in any event.  I do not know why Deputy O'Callaghan would want to copper-fasten that in legislation.  I would leave the little discretion that is there to the Parole Board if the practical difficulties can be worked out.<\/p> <p> As a general principle, they say that parole only operates, as we know, for those who have received a sentence of more than eight years or a life sentence.  It goes on then to point out, as Deputy O'Callaghan has already said, that it is up at 15, 16 or 17 years before parole is ever considered.  I have a difficult, where it is highlighted as a problem that should be analysed and helped, that we will copper-fasten it in legislation.<\/p> <p> I do not know where the amendment is taken but I have that amendment in.  One is already being taken care of, I think, in amendment No. 50.  Then I have amendments Nos. 49 and 47.  Amendment No. 49 was to reduce it, to take out the \"twelve\".  I will move that amendment.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 47 is one on which I will be guided by the Minister and Deputy O'Callaghan.  In amendment No. 47, I ask that \"clear and accessible information and support\" be provided to the prisoner.

I was not participating in the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality at that time.  There is a reasonable point that can be made there but the average amount of time that those who are recommended for release had spent in prison was 18 years.  People may say that is a long time and, indeed, it is.  It seems potentially excessive to set the statute basis for the beginning of review of sentences at less than half of that.  There is a fair point that it creates an unrealistic expectation, potentially putting prisoners up for numerous reviews before they have any hope of being successful.  Realistically, that would be a rubber-stamping exercise.  There is a point that it is difficult for the victims of crime to imagine, even if it is not realistic, that somebody could be released on parole seven years after a potentially heinous crime.  Potentially, I would consider something more than eight years and less than 12.  Eight is too little.  It is far out of line with the reality of what is happening and with what is a reasonable expectation.<\/p>  <p>  I note that there are concerns about whether it delays some of the processes that surround parole, such as hearings and parole reviews in terms of treatment, training, evaluation, etc.  Perhaps we should consider an amendment for the Seanad to see whether there is some legislative basis for beginning some of that work - I am sure some of it is going on all the time anyway but putting some formal shape to it within the context of the parole system - in advance of that 12 years.  I will consider that in advance of the Seanad.<\/p>  <p>  For the moment, I will be supporting the amendments that are currently before us.

When the Bill was originally drafted I put down the statutory provision that a prisoner could not apply for parole if he or she was serving a life sentence until he or she served 12 years.  The effect of that, if it is enacted, will take a great deal of pressure off the Parole Board.  At present, the Parole Board has to consider applications from life prisoners, say, who are told after seven or eight years that they can apply for parole.  Such prisoners go through the process and the board has to consider their application in the knowledge that the prisoner will not get parole.  It would be a much more efficient system, from everyone's point of view, if prisoners were told that they cannot apply for parole if they are serving a life sentence until they have served a specified period of time.<\/p>  <p>  Seven or eight years is too low.  Twelve years is approximately right.  One must balance the rights of the victims of crime and the rights of the prisoner.  It reflects the purpose of imprisonment which is twofold: punishment and rehabilitation.  It is a difficult balancing act to achieve.  As legislators, we cannot be swayed too much by the interests of one group over the interests of another group.  For too long, the interests of the victims of crime have not been given sufficient weight by the Oireachtas.  It is not as though this is a provision which is appalling from a prisoner's point of view.  If a person has been convicted of a crime that results in a life sentence, he or she has committed a very serious offence of deliberately and intentionally killing somebody.  For that reason, it is appropriate to put it at 12 years.  It will ease the work of the Parole Board.  There is a logic to putting it in so that prisoners do not have the expectation that they will get parole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300061#OOO01100","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562177100,"counter":704,"content":"<p>Amendment

victim.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>The amendments deal with parole orders, namely, the granting of a parole order, the refusal of a parole order, the variation of a parole order and the conditions which might be attached to parole orders.  Amendment No. 38 broadly replaces the old section 22 of the Bill.  It sets out what must be in a parole order when it takes effect and who must be given a copy of the order.  The order will specify a date upon which the person is to be released, perhaps up to 18 months in the future.  Often prisoners who have been detained for very many years may find it difficult to adjust if they are released immediately.  Time can be used to prepare a person for their eventual release, for example by transferring him or her to an open prison, perhaps.  A parole order will be subject to conditions that the board considers appropriate in the circumstances, for example, that the parolee does not communicate with the victim, that he or she does not visit a particular locality, or that he or she does not commit an offence while on parole.  At the moment, life sentence prisoners living in the community are supervised by the probation services.  As was mentioned on Committee Stage, these officers are responsible for facilitating and assisting an offender in reintegrating into society.  As such, they are likely to be best placed to identify the immediate needs of and risks faced by an offender, including how these needs or risks might change or vary.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 39 provides that the prison governor must comply with a parole order.  Amendment No. 40 deals with the refusal of a parole order.  When refusing parole, the current Parole Board can recommend measures that could further the prisoner's rehabilitation or capacity to reintegrate into society or that might mitigate any risk they might pose to the public.  For example, it can recommend that prisoners undergo a therapeutic programme or educational course or that they undergo short periods of temporary release.  This is an important aspect of the board's current work, particularly when it is reviewing prisoners at an early stage of their sentences.  There was broad agreement among Deputies on Committee Stage that this sentence management function should continue.  At the time, Deputy O'Callaghan brought an amendment to the Bill to include sentence management as one of the board's functions.  Subsection (2) inserted here makes that requirement more explicit.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 41 deals with the variation of a parole order.  It allows the board to vary a parole order, for example, where it believes that a new condition might need to be added or that an existing condition should be changed.  It can also vary the date of release of a person who is still in prison.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 42 deals with situations where the board decides on standard conditions that apply to all parole orders or a group of parolees.  The board must notify every person affected of the new condition.  It can also notify certain other people, including the victim, if the condition is relevant to the victim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300062#PPP00400","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1562177700,"counter":716,"content":"<p>In the Bill as drafted and passed through Committee Stage, section 22 had a provision dealing with parole orders, section 24 dealt with variation of parole orders, and section 25 dealt with the revocation of parole orders.  In many respects there is not much difference between that and the new sections the Minister is proposing, which deal with parole orders, refusal of application and variation of parole order.  One of the important things is that we have to preserve and put into statute the power of the Parole Board to set conditions on granting parole.  We need to recall that parole is granting somebody permission to be out of prison.  They have been sentenced to a life sentence; parole is letting them out, but it can be on condition.  One of the things I had in the original Bill which I am pleased to see the Minister has kept in his amendment is that persons being released on parole can be subject to a condition that they have to stay away from a particular person or place or refrain from having contact with a particular person.  That is not too arduous from a prisoner's point of view but from the point of view of a victim of crime, it is extremely important.  In the case of somebody who was sentenced for life for rape, the Parole Board could understandably want to ensure that this person stays away from the victim of his rape.  It is important that we preserve that as a condition.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments also deal with how refusal of an application for parole shall be effected and the variation of a parole order.  Persons out on parole are out with the permission of the State; the life sentence still remains hanging over them.  If they breach the terms of their parole, we need to ensure that there is some sanction for that.  If they breach a condition of the parole order, there must be provision such that they can be brought back in or held to account for it.  I think they are preserved in these amendments and I will be supporting them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300062#PPP00500","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562177700,"counter":717,"content":"<p>Amendment

The powers of the board to gather information, including reports, will apply when the board is considering revocation.  The board does not have to revoke the order.  It can consider varying the order.  Indeed, it can take no action at all, depending on the circumstance.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 44 to 46, inclusive, provide for power of arrest where a person has breached a parole order.  Breach of a parole order renders a person unlawfully at large whereby he or she can be arrested.  This is similar to a breach of a condition of temporary release.  A person can be arrested and returned to detention.  There is a similar provision in the Bill as it stands, however, on foot of legal advice, it is being amended here to reflect the system already in use for other forms of release.  Where a person is arrested for breach of parole conditions, the parole order stands suspended until the board can consider whether to revoke the order, vary it or leave it in place.  In this regard, the parolee will be entitled to make a submission and will be entitled to legal representation for this consideration by the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300062#PPP01600","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1562178300,"counter":728,"content":"<p>Again, this replicates the provision that was in the original Act.  We are talking about a revocation of a parole order.  When a person is given parole it is legally quite complicated.  The person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment and he or she is being released from prison.  That has to be effected.  The proposed legislation will effect this through the issuing of a parole order.  Obviously, there must be some power to put the person back into prison if he or she breaches the terms of the order.  In this legislation, that is done by providing a section that deals with a revocation of the parole order.  As the Minister has said, there can also be a variation of the parole order.  It is to be hoped it may not be necessary for the person to be put back into prison if it is the case that the parole order has been breached in some respect.  If it was breached in a very material or egregious way it would require revocation of the order.  This provision, however, permits there to be a variation of it also.<\/p>  <p>  I note the proposed new section 34 and the unusual term, &ldquo;Persons unlawfully at large\", which is used elsewhere in our legal system.  It designates what happens when a parole order has been made with conditions, when those conditions have been breached, when a revocation of the parole order is issued and what one does with the person who is out in the community with a revoked parole order.  This proposal seeks to categorise the person as a person unlawfully at large.  This makes it an offence for the person to be unlawfully at large, and it entitles a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - without a warrant - to arrest the person who is unlawfully at large.

Obviously there is a process there in that a person who breaches his or her parole conditions could potentially be arrested, have his or her parole revoked or there is a hearing of the parole board and so on.  It is structured in such a way, however, that it is essentially an automatic criminal offence to be in breach of the conditions of the parole order.  This is a difficulty because some of the conditions of parole may not necessarily be criminal offences.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust has given the example of insobriety.  The person could be expected to stay sober as a condition of his or her parole.  There are other such examples.  It would not necessarily lead to the revocation of the parole order but as this proposed legislation is structured, it is automatically a criminal offence, if I understand it correctly.  This is despite the fact that not being sober would not ordinarily be a criminal offence.  I have some reservations regarding the proposed new section 44.  Perhaps the Minister will address that but if not, perhaps I will vote against the amendment.  Will the Minister clarify the situation?  If I understand the amendment correctly then any breach, regardless of whether it is a criminal offence, is treated as a criminal offence on the basis of it being a breach.

A condition of temporary release, for example, is where on the matter of a breach, the person is arrested and returned to the place of detention.  This process moves swiftly.

My amendment stands, whether it is appropriate to deal with it now or whether it is to be bypassed.  I am simply asking that people are given &ldquo;clear and accessible information and support&rdquo; in their parole application.  The Minister's answer was that there is now legal assistance.

To put such terms in statutory form might give rise to unintended difficulties.  I have an expectation that when the board is providing information, every effort should be made to ensure the information is clear and accessible.

In addition, the Irish Penal Reform Trust referred to an unpublished survey conducted by the Irish Prison Service over the period 2015-17, so these are up-to-date figures.  Some 25.6% of prisoner participants in that survey did not attend secondary school, 52% left before junior certificate, 80% had left before leaving certificate, only one in five had completed a leaving certificate, compared to three in five of the general population, and only 9% had completed some form of higher education.  There are many other studies, with which I am sure the Minister is very familiar, that link disadvantage and the population of our prisons.  To go way back, although the figures have remained the same, in 1997, some 56% of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison came from six districts in Dublin and almost 80% of participants in that study had left school before the age of 16.<\/p>  <p>  Literacy is an issue I am particularly interested in.  The figure nationally for the general population is astounding from the 1970s onwards.

I share the Deputy's concern.  I also share his sympathy for families of murder victims because of the ongoing upset and trauma they suffer, in particular, when after a period, the offender is being considered for parole.  The Bill, as amended, will provide for the board receiving submissions from the victim.  We have made reference to and considered the issue of legal representation for the victim and the granting of legal aid to him or her.  In reaching a decision the board is obliged to take these submissions into account.  There is a really important role for the victim.  One of the primary concerns is whether a parole applicant would pose an undue risk to the safety of the public, communities and, of course, the victim.

I will take up what Deputy Sherlock said.  Section 27 which is being inserted into the Bill by way of amendment No. 37 takes care of the Deputy's concern.  It provides that the board, in deciding whether to grant parole, shall take into account the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment relates.  This, necessarily, will involve the board considering the impact of the offence that was perpetrated by the applicant for parole on the victim.  Subparagraph (l) provides that the board will also take into account any submission made by or on behalf of the relevant victim in accordance with procedures determined under section 14.  This means that the victim of a crime or the family of the victim of  a crime will be able to make whatever submission they wish to the board.  The Deputy is concerned to ensure it will take into account the long-term and continuing impact the crime has had on the victim.  I would have thought it would because those making submissions on behalf of the victim of a crime could say the person was still traumatised and badly affected by the consequences of the parole applicant's behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  There has to be some objectivity to the parole process.  For example, are family members who are much more vocal or taken the crime much more seriously having been affected by it to be treated more preferably than a victim who does not have a family advocating on his or her behalf?  There is a balance to be struck.  My own view is that the Deputy's concern is met in the Bill.

I welcome the passage of the Parole Bill.  It is important legislation and it will be of benefit to the criminal justice system.  It will be of particular assistance to the victims of crime who now will know when persons who perpetrated crimes will be eligible for and be able to apply for parole.  The victims of crime will now also be able to make submissions in respect of parole applications.  I also think it is beneficial for prisoners who are applying for parole because they can now see in statutory form the process by which they can seek parole.  As I indicated earlier, it is a complicated matter that involves balancing the rights of the victims of crime on the one hand with on the other hand the entitlement of people who are in prison to seek parole.  The purpose of prison is twofold; punishment and rehabilitation, and both of them need to be balanced.  I believe that is what a good parole board will do.  I know that the Parole Board that has existed on a non-statutory basis to date has done that.<\/p>  <p>  I thank my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, for giving me permission to put forward this legislation.

Currently rates are levied on properties that exist on the valuation list on the date of the making of the local authority budget.  This means the addition of new properties or amendments to the valuation list during the year are not effective for rates until the financial year following the making of the next budget.  Amendment No. 5 allows for additions and amendments to the valuations to become effective immediately for rating purposes.  It is now proposed that a new or revised valuation will trigger a new rates liability to reflect the new or revised valuation.  Amendment No. 5 also provides that where a person commences the occupation of a relevant property or becomes entitled to be the occupier of a relevant property after 1 January in any year, a local authority may levy a charge for the remaining period of the year on a <i>pro rata<\/i>basis.  Again, this is a new initiative.  Where it occurs, the local authority shall adjust the charge levied on the person in occupation on 1 January.  The current position is that the person in occupation on the date of the making of the rate is liable for the entire year.  It is now proposed that the local authority shall adjust the rates bill issued to the person who is in occupation on 1 January or after 1 January where there was more than one previous occupier in that year, and such that the charge for the full year is apportioned between the different occupiers on a <i>pro rata<\/i>basis.  This is a fairer system of levying rates.  The current situation, where the occupier on the date of the making of the rate is liable for the whole year, is outdated and unfair and derives from a time when commercial occupation did not change frequently.  As Members will know, that is not necessarily always the case at present.  The new method is a more equitable and modern method of levying commercial rates where occupation changes in a rating year. <\/p><p>The amendment is also a technical amendment to clarify that the reference to &quot;Act of 2001&quot; in section 4 of the Bill refers to the Valuation Act 2001 and the reference to &quot;valuation list&quot; has the same meaning as in that Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300068#VVV02900","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1562181300,"counter":855,"content":"<p>I am seeking clarity.

Office of the Planning Regulator shall, within such period as the Minister shall specify, comply with that request.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>This amendment relates to section 31A the Planning and Development Act 2000, and there are consequential amendments to sections 31A(q) and 31A(r), regarding regional spatial and economic strategies, RSESs.  This is a time-critical amendment that arises in the context of the establishment of the new Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, on 3 April 2019.  Section 31A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for ministerial directions regarding RSESs.  As currently enacted, the section provides only that the Minister can issue a direction on foot of a recommendation made to him or her by the OPR, on the basis of the regulator having been involved in the RSES process from the outset and having made submissions on the draft RSES document.  The requirement relating to the planning regulator being involved from the outset, however, cannot be satisfied for the current strategies, as the process for all three had formally commenced prior to the establishment of the office.  In all three cases, a draft regional strategy was published prior to the establishment of the office and submissions have been made by the Minister.<\/p><p>This amendment provides for transitional arrangements to ensure that the Minister has a robust legal basis to issue a direction to a regional assembly, if necessary.  In the case of the current RSES process, the amendment will allow him or her  to issue a ministerial direction to the regional assemblies to take such specified measures as he or she may require regarding that plan, which may be required to ensure that the RSES is consistent with, and does not deviate, from the national planning framework, NPF, and other key Government strategies and to bring it in line with national policies.  <\/p><p>This amendment has the effect of reverting to the position that obtained prior to the establishment of the OPR.  However, in the spirit of the Act, and in recognition of the new office, as established, the proposed transitional arrangement includes provision for the regulator to be requested by the Minister to enter and RSES process in an advisory role where the process had commenced and was under way on the date of the establishment of the office.  To facilitate this advisory engagement in the context of the current RSES process, the four-week timeframe for the Minister to issue a draft direction, which was the norm prior to the establishment of the OPR, is being extended to six weeks.  The proposed amendment will only apply in respect of the three current RSESs that commenced prior to the establishment of the office.<\/p><p>Section 31A, and related sections 31A(q) and 31A(r), will remain valid in the case of RSESs made in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300069#WWW02200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1562181900,"counter":882,"content":"<p>I did not make a comment on this last night, but this is my third time to contribution to a debate on legislation, where we are bringing in amendments to other Bills on Report Stage.

I will not support it.  I echo Deputy Casey's view on it.  This six-page amendment is half the length of the Bill that we are discussing in the first instance and is not pertinent to it.  I will repeat what I said on Committee Stage and last night.  We need Ministers to stop using this mechanism of tabling Report Stage amendments - at times very detailed and technical ones - that have nothing to do with the Bill.  This is not a criticism of any of the officials or the Minister of State, as this is not necessarily his fault, but it is bad practice.  Our committee has been very flexible with the Department and the Ministers, but that will not necessarily always be the case.<\/p>  <p>  I am opposing the amendment for the same reason I opposed the final piece of legislation on the Planning Regulator.  It was then Judge Mahon's central recommendation, which was critical of the overcentralisation of power in the Minister as regards local government and planning, that that power be devolved to fully independent bodies such as a planning regulator.  My central objection is not that the Minister should not have oversight of local authorities.  I fully accept that there should be oversight, but there should be independence.  It should not be the case that a regulator undertakes an investigation or report and recommends a course of action to the Minister and he or she can then ignore it if he or she so wishes.  If the Minister chooses to ignore it, all he or she has to do is lay before the Oireachtas the reasons for same.  That is not what an independent planning regulator should do, nor is it what Judge Mahon recommended.  My principal objection does not relate to oversight but to the Minister's power to decide whether the recommendations from the Planning Regulator are acted upon, which is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Mahon tribunal's key recommendation on planning.

I have expressed a different view from Deputy &Oacute; Broin regarding the question of the Planning Regulator.  That the Minister must explain to the Houses if he or she is taking a different view from the Planning Regulator means that the Minister is accountable to the Houses for the decision in question.  We have a number of bodies that make large decisions for citizens but are not accountable to the Oireachtas.  There are transport, health and other bodies that we cannot require to appear before us regarding decisions of theirs that are relevant to citizens.  It is a question of balance, but it is better that the Minister ultimately be accountable to the elected Members, who are here on behalf of the people.  It is a judgment either way, but in this case it is right.  It would be brave or foolhardy of any Minister to make a decision that is contrary to what the Planning Regulator has said is the appropriate action.  Nevertheless, the reason behind this measure is to ensure accountability to the elected representatives of the people.

Sections 11(1)(aa) and (ab) allow for alternate notification periods for Cork city and county councils whereby they may extend the notification period to review their existing development plans from four years to a maximum of five years by way of ministerial order.

However, the special provisions for Cork city and county councils are not included in section 11(1)(b) for the purpose of enabling the incorporation of the national planning framework and a regional spatial and economic strategy into a development plan.

The remainder of the amendment replaces paragraph (a) of section 19(5) of the 2004 Act, which paragraph was also inserted by the 2019 Act and describes the works that would bring about a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation such as to warrant an exemption from the 4% rent increase restriction applicable in rent pressure zones.  Concerns have been raised that it would not be possible for works undertaken to protected structures to satisfy this prescription and that this could result in the loss of such units from the sector.  That is the case because works to extend, adapt for disabled use or change the layout of a property are less likely to be permitted in protected structures.  Works to improve the energy rating of a protected structure would not qualify them for an extension because such structures are exempt from the BER regulations.<\/p> <p> In recognition of these factors and to encourage continued investment in this type of property for use in the rental sector, the proposed further change to section 19(5)(a) will allow for the first rent set under the tenancy of a protected or proposed protected dwelling not rented in the previous 12 months to be the market rent.  Thereafter, the 4% annual rent increase ceiling will apply.  For all dwellings that are not protected or proposed protected structures, the required vacancy period will remain at two years.  The enactment of such an amendment in the immediate aftermath of the 2019 Act and the changes therein should help to eliminate any potential negative impact of the changes on the planned refurbishment of protected structures in the rental sector and help to maintain supply of that type of rental property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300070#XXX01400","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562183100,"counter":898,"content":"<p>I am not minded to support the amendment.

It would have been possible to provide a more specific definition or, for example, to waive the BER rating change or provide greater flexibility in adaptation for persons with a disability.  A 12-month vacancy period is too short.  When the original rent pressure zone legislation was being introduced, with the inclusion of a reference to substantial refurbishment, many on the Opposition benches made it clear that the provision was too broad and urged the then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, not to allow the legislation to go through with that broad definition.

One may set the initial rent for one's property at whatever rate one wishes.  The rent pressure zone legislation acts to limit increases thereafter.  In that sense, there is nothing unique about the position on pre-63 structures or the protected structures affected by this provision.  I understand its phrasing may seem somewhat unclear, but the phraseology is necessary.  Our system does not seek to put limits on the rent sought by a landlord letting a property for the first time, although there is a limit on the rate of increase thereafter.  Obviously, there is a limit to the market rent a property can achieve, although such limits have been higher in recent years than was previously the case.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment will affect a small number of properties.  There is a limited number of protected properties being let.  There is an acceptance that necessary works to make them occupiable are limited by the fact that the properties are protected.  The amendment is to deal with an omission from the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 and relates specifically to the small number of protected structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300071#YYY00400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1562183100,"counter":901,"content":"<p>I will give the Minister of State a real world example.  I live in a protected structure in Clondalkin which I rent from the Church of Ireland.  It is one of four houses built in the 1870s.  They are beautiful and unique stone buildings.  The current rent has complied with the 4% rent pressure zone cap in the past two years and is less than half the current market rent in the area.  My rent is currently &euro;936 per month, while the market rent in the Clondalkin area is between &euro;2,000 and &euro;2,200 per month for a house of comparable size, albeit one built in this century, rather than 150 years ago.  Through the amendment, the Minister of State is allowing my landlord to make some alterations to the property next door to me if it becomes vacant, sit on it for a year and then charge &euro;2,200 for a property that is currently being let for &euro;900.  That would be permissible because it would be in line with the market rent.  The landlord would not have to do anything to the property, apart from leave it vacant.  One may ask why a landlord would do so as it would involve the loss of rental income for a year.  However, if one can achieve two and a half times the rent currently being received without having to do anything other than sit on the asset, one may choose to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is that the families who live next door to me are on low to modest income and there is not enough accommodation available for such families.  The Minister of State is correct that the amendment will have a limited impact and only affect a very small number of properties.  However, it could result in the property in which I live or the neighbouring properties moving from a rent of &euro;900 per month to &euro;2,200 and, thereafter, &euro;2,400, &euro;2,800 and so on.  There is a need to work out a solution for properties which, for example, cannot be adapted under the disability regulations or have a BER rating.  That should be done because there are derelict properties in this city that could be renovated and rented.  However, the amendment is too broad and not the right way to achieve that aim.  For every property the amendment may affect in a positive way - that is what the Minister of State is trying to achieve - we may lose a property which is currently on the market for families on modest income who are working and renting.  That is not a risk we should take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300071#YYY00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1562183100,"counter":902,"content":"<p>It may be helpful to note the situation where a landlord is seeking to let a non-protected structure.<\/p><p>The landlord cannot seek a rent that is higher than the 4% threshold if the property is in a rent-protected zone and if it has been let within the previous 24 months.

Certainly, it is not the intention of this legislation or this amendment to seek to diminish the rights of tenants in any way, shape or form.  It is an attempt to ensure that this limited number of protected structures that could be subject to letting are provided for in the legislation.  I emphasise to the House that what we are talking about is not a situation where a landlord can, at the end of a tenancy, simply return and charge any rent he wishes to charge.

It also addresses the arrangements for the commencement of annual registration for tenancies both generally and in the student-specific accommodation sector.  The primary change applies to section 37 of the 2019 Act, which provides for the application of certain aspects of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to student-specific accommodation occupied under licence.  The intention is to commence this provision in mid-July, in time for the coming academic year.  At that point, the 4% per annum rent increase restriction in rent pressure zones, RPZs, the dispute resolution services of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, registration requirements, and the new RTB sanctioning regime for improper conduct will all apply to the student-specific accommodation sector.  The definition of &quot;owner&quot; used in section 37 of the 2019 Act has been identified as enabling its possible circumvention through the use of lessors to occupy the accommodation.  The proposed amendments to the definition will close this potential loophole prior to the imminent commencement of the provisions by clarifying that an owner is any person with an estate or interest in the property.<\/p><p>Also, to improve the clarity of the provision, the substituted section 37 places the text at the end of the enacted subsection (2) into a separate new subsection (2).<\/p> <p> The other three sections of the 2019 Act amended by amendment no. 18 are sections 22, 25 and 26 and these sections relate to the introduction of annual registration for student-specific accommodation and other tenancies, which will happen in 2020 when the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB has completed its preparations for this change.  These three technical amendments arise from the fact that the move to annual registration will take place after the commencement of the student accommodation provisions and the 2019 Act consequently makes separate provision for the registration fee applicable to student-specific accommodation.  The amendment to section 22(2) clarifies that the three-month phasing-in arrangement relates to tenancies other than those in the student-specific accommodation sector, which are provided for with a separate but similar three-month phasing-in period via a provision in section 22(1).  Sections 25 and 26 of the 2019 Act deal with the amount of the registration fee applicable generally and a reduced fee applicable to dwellings provided by approved housing bodies.  The technical amendments to sections 25(2) and 26(2) clarify that the changes to registration fees under the 2019 Act will not take effect in respect of tenancies, other than those in the student-specific accommodation sector, until after the introduction of the annual registration fee regime in 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300073#AAAA00100","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562184900,"counter":907,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562184900,"counter":908,"content":"<p>Bill reported with amendments.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1562184900,"counter":909,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 18a and 22 to 27, inclusive, are related.
