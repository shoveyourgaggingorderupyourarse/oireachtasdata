My own Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. Monthly expenditure profiles for each Government Department for 2019 will be published this month. The January Fiscal Monitor, published this week, presents a year-on-year comparison. From February on, as is usual, the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer will be reported on each month against expenditure profiles, in the Fiscal Monitor published by the Department of Finance. <\/p><p>Due to the scale of Government expenditure and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons, including policy decisions, timing issues and overspends. Supplementary Estimates are an important element of our expenditure management toolkit, allowing for the proper alignment of resources with allocations. However, they can only be provided within the context of our overall fiscal parameters. <\/p><p>In 2018, Supplementary Estimates made provision for additional funding in a number of areas, including for:<\/p><p>- Overruns in the Health sector;<\/p><p>- Superannuation pressures in Education;<\/p><p>- Garda pay and overtime;<\/p><p>- Overseas Development Aid;<\/p><p>- Housing and homelessness services;<\/p><p>- A 100 per cent Social Welfare Christmas Bonus; <\/p><p>- Costs relating to the Papal visit;<\/p><p>- The Community Childcare Scheme; and<\/p><p>- Army pensions. <\/p><p>In some cases, there were underspends within Vote groups that could be used to offset overspends in other areas.

Taking into account the various moving parts within the overall tax and spending figures reported in the end-year Exchequer returns,  based upon the Exchequer figures, a small general government surplus is now possible for 2018. A modest deficit of 0.1% was projected for 2018 in the recent Budget last October. <\/p><p>In setting out the proposed allocations for 2019, published in the Expenditure Report 2019, account was taken of the ongoing impact into 2019 of the increased level of resources that it was proposed to allocate to Departments by way of Supplementary Estimate in 2018.

The commitment indicated that the review will be timed to take account of the final outcome of that particular PPP project, and as such will take place in the latter part of 2019.     <\/p>  <p>  However, as an interim step in that process, a &lsquo;learnings&rsquo; workshop involving the NDFA, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was held in Tullamore, on Tuesday, 15 January 2019, to review the experience to date with the Schools Bundle 5 PPP project and the difficulties encountered with it. (The NDFA had already, previously, conducted its own internal review, specifically in relation to the impact of the Carillion\/Sammon liquidation on the project, subsequent to the first three schools being delivered in September 2018, but clearly a wider review with all relevant stakeholders needed to be conducted and the January &lsquo;learnings&rsquo; workshop is the first step in that process.) <\/p>  <p>  While the construction process on the remaining schools is now progressing well, the fact is that there are still 3 schools within the Schools Bundle 5 PPP project which have yet to be completed and handed over by the PPP partner. It would therefore be premature to seek to reach any definitive conclusion in relation to learnings from this PPP project at this point.  The final review exercise will be completed once these remaining schools have also been delivered and are fully operational. This is currently expected to be in Quarter 2 of 2019 and a final review will be conducted thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's reference to the collapse of PPP contracts, I am not aware of any Irish PPP contract ever collapsing.  In accordance with international best practice, Irish PPP contracts are particularly robust and typically include detailed provisions that apply in the event of the liquidation of a consortium member of the PPP company, or an entity under the contract, to protect the State and ensure that the project proceeds to completion.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of such PPP contracts, in the case of the liquidation of a consortium member, or an entity under the contract, the PPP consortium&rsquo;s funders and remaining shareholders are required to intervene and implement rectification measures to ensure that the project is completed to the satisfaction of the State.  Liquidation of a company involved in delivering a public infrastructure project is an unfortunate and unforeseen development but would impact on any project where a supplier became insolvent during the delivery process, regardless of whether the project was being procured by PPP or by traditional means. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, with regard to the issue of protection for subcontractors, this is not a matter that is intended to be addressed in a PPP contract, as the State does not negotiate or hold contracts with subcontractors in relation to such PPP contracts.  However, there is already legislation in place which was introduced to protect subcontractors under construction contracts, which is applicable to all contracts entered into since July 2016.  The Construction Contracts Act imposes minimum terms on all construction contracts, public or private, whether they be written or oral and provides the tools necessary to enforce payment.  While the legislation does not apply to a contract between a State authority and its partner in a PPP arrangement, it does apply to all contracts that are subsequently awarded by the private partner to any subcontractors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700056#WRB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700056#WRB02800"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[5809\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700056#WRB02900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the steps he is taking to facilitate more civil servants who wish to relocate out of Dublin to other locations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[5808\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700056#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the steps he is taking to encourage greater staff mobility within the wider public service; the progress made in 2018 to achieve same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":54,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 37 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Civil Service Mobility scheme which comes under the remit of my department, and is administered through HR Shared Services, National Shared Services Office, offers an opportunity for staff members to apply for mobility through an open and transparent system. The establishment of the scheme fulfils one of the requirements of Action 15 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan; and Action 14 of the People Strategy for the Civil Service, which calls for the further expansion of a coherent mobility policy to facilitate staff development and strategic alignment with other HR policies, builds upon this.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is being introduced on a phased basis. Phase 1A of the scheme is for the general Civil Service grades of Clerical Officer (CO) and Executive Officer (EO) to apply for mobility between and within 46 zones - excluding mobility within Zone 46 (Dublin) which will be included in Phase 1B. <\/p>  <p>  There has been a high level of interest in the scheme since Phase 1A opened for applications on 13th November 2017 with c. 3,800 staff members (22% of the 17,000 participating staff members - 60% CO : 40% EO) applying for mobility and making an average of 10 organisational choices. Over 50 moves have taken place since the operational launch of the scheme on 10th September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The location choices in the scheme are divided into mobility zones rather than county or province.  An applicant may express a preference for mobility for a maximum of 3 zones from the list of 46 zones with a choice of any or all organisations in each zone (a full list of zones and organisations per zone can be viewed at www.hr.per.gov.ie). Staff members can apply for mobility within their current zone (excluding Phase 1B, Zone 46 Dublin) as well as other zones. A number of mobility zones also have an option to include or exclude a choice of satellite towns.   <\/p>  <p>  There are currently 855 staff members based in zone 46 (Dublin) that have applied for mobility to other zones. This equates to 12% of the 7,000 participating staff members in Dublin (55% CO: 35% EO), while 88% wish to remain in their chosen location. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Mobility scheme launched following an era of moratorium and low levels of staff transfers in the Civil Service and these factors would contribute to the initial high surge of interest in the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that over 50% of the staff members who were made offers of mobility since the operational launch have now declined the offer. Therefore with regard to the percentage of declines of offer, I am confident that the actual number of staff members who want to move from Dublin to other zones is lower than the reported figure of 855, which shows those who have put in an initial request.<\/p>  <p>  Following the full roll out of the Civil Service Mobility Scheme, it is the intention to review and extend mobility over time to provide additional development opportunities and enable greater mobility across the Public Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700056#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Reform Review","counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700056#WRB03200"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[5914\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700056#WRB03300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the degree to which reforms throughout the public sector remain in place to ensure accountability, collective responsibility and good value for money; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>As I have previously informed the House, significant public service reforms have occurred in recent years that continue to deliver improved services and value for money across a range of specific areas such as governance, accountability, procurement, shared services, organisational reform and property management. <\/p>  <p>The current phase of public service reform - Our Public Service 2020  , which I launched in 2017 &ndash; represents a whole-of-public-service initiative designed to build on these previous reforms while expanding the scope of reform to focus on collaboration, innovation and evaluation.

The &lsquo;Floods&rsquo; Directive also requires Member States to exchange information and coordinate in undertaking these steps in cross-border river basins.<\/p>  <p>  It was agreed in 2009 by the Office of Public Works and the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers of Northern Ireland that a Cross-Border Coordination Group, supported by a Cross-Border Technical Coordination Group, would be established to facilitate the exchange of information and coordination in the implementation of the Directive. The Group has met on a number of occasions, and has ensured that information has been exchanged as necessary, and that there is a good mutual awareness of the approaches to implementation in both jurisdictions.

On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September \"A\" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with Defence Forces regulations, the award of medals for bravery is time bound. These may not be awarded in any case unless a recommendation is made through the usual channels to the Chief of Staff, not later than two years in the case of the Military Medal for Gallantry, and not later than four years in the case of the Distinguished Service Medal, after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made. Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.  <\/p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the recommendation for the award of a medal to the person whose details are supplied and the other various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded. Defence Forces records indicate that recommendation for the award of a medal to the person referred to in the details supplied was considered by this board, but not upheld.  The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently, at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings. There is currently no regulatory provision either to revisit the findings of a Medals Board or to effect a meritorious promotion posthumously. <\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of years various representations have been received in my Department outlining the courage and bravery of \"A\" Company. All representations have been considered and responded to acknowledging their valiant actions while under siege in Jadotville.   <\/p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.<\/p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include: <\/p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to \"A\" Company in 2006. <\/p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006. <\/p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. <\/p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. <\/p>  <p>  E.

I refer the Deputy to recent responses to Parliamentary Questions for more detail on the CIWG&rsquo;s two primary reports, the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance (4215\/19) and the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance (4742\/19), respectively.   <\/p>  <p>  As part of the formal consultation processes for the two reports, there was engagement between the CIWG and representatives from the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association and Meat Industry Ireland, as well as some of the main providers of insurance for the agriculture sector in Ireland.

What has been in doubt however is the ability of insurance undertakings and insurance distributors (i.e. brokers) to continue performing certain obligations and activities and ensure service continuity with regard to such contracts, e.g. pay out claims. <\/p><p>It is understood that a significant majority of UK\/Gibraltar insurance undertakings have prepared appropriate Brexit contingency plans which are expected to be implemented in advance of Brexit. However, there is a legitimate concern, that  a small number of such undertakings as well as a number of insurance distributors will either not  have completed  such contingency plans by the end of March 2019,  or have made a decision not to implement them in the first place. Such a scenario as you will appreciate gives rise to a risk in respect of their ability to continue servicing the insurance policies they have sold.<\/p><p>Consequently, the focus of my Department and the Central Bank has been to find a solution to address this issue.  The proposed solution, which is reflected in the General Scheme of the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill, provides for a temporary run-off regime which, subject to a number of conditions, will enable impacted UK\/Gibraltar insurance undertakings or insurance distributors to continue to provide services to their Irish customers for a period of 3 years after the date of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.

Since the UK referendum, Brexit is an integral part of business planning in the Department of Finance and issues relating to Brexit are mainstreamed across all divisions of my Department. In this context, I meet and engage on an ongoing basis with my officials on issues linked to Brexit.  The objective of my approach as Minister for Finance is to protect the economic and financial interests of the state and to support the work of the Revenue Commissioners so as to minimise disruption to trade to the greatest extent possible. These objectives are being advanced under four priority headings which are developing appropriate economic and budgetary policy advice; safeguarding financial stability through engagement with the CBI and the NTMA; assuring continued funding of the State by the NTMA and supporting the work of the Revenue Commissioners in the areas of customs, direct and indirect tax.  <\/p>  <p>  On the question as to what level of engagement I have had with the insurance industry in relation to Brexit, the Deputy should note that my colleague Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has immediate responsibility, within my Department, for Financial Services and Insurance.  As such while I have not had direct discussions with the industry, Minister D'Arcy has had a significant level of engagement, both with individual insurance companies, and with insurance industry bodies, during which Brexit has been discussed.  This has included speaking at events held by insurance representative bodies, where Brexit related issues were on the agenda.  In addition, I would note that the IFS2020 Strategy allows for structured dialogue with industry at the quarterly Joint Committee meetings, chaired by Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy, at which Brexit is a standing item on the agenda.  My officials have also had close engagement with the insurance industry through various fora since the outcome of the 2016 UK referendum, where Brexit as an issue would have been raised.  <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the insurance industry has been clear from the outset of the potential difficulties that a hard Brexit may cause to policyholders and claimants from a contract continuity perspective.  This has been conveyed through a range of forums including at EU level.  However, the EU Commission has stated repeatedly that industry is responsible for ensuring that it is appropriately Brexit prepared. Accordingly, the Central Bank has engaged with the insurance industry and the UK regulatory authorities to ensure that this is the case and in a general sense this exercise has been successful. <\/p>  <p>My Department and the Central Bank have however been cognisant that not all insurers or brokers would be fully Brexit prepared and therefore since September have been considering what could be done to ensure that all policyholders are appropriately protected from a hard Brexit.   The Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill 2019  , contains proposals which if enacted, will ensure that  UK or Gibraltar authorised insurers will be deemed to have a limited authorisation for a period of three years after withdrawal. This will therefore allow policies written prior to Brexit  in relation to risks in the State come under scope of the ICF subject to the terms and conditions of the Fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700058#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":169,"content":"<p>Question No. 74 answered with Question No. 72.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":170,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700058#WRD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":171,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[6178\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700058#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of insurance companies operating here under freedom of services which are prudentially regulated in the UK or Gibraltar by the type of insurance sold and the number of applications with the Central Bank from insurance companies wishing to be prudentially regulated here, respectively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":172,"content":"<p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.

The Government&rsquo;s approach in that time has been based on steady increases in public expenditure, underpinned by stable and predictable tax revenues. This approach is aimed at delivering steady and sustainable improvements in public services and infrastructure, while protecting our hard-won economic recovery. Under this approach, a key consideration when allocating funding is whether it is affordable both now and into the future. This requires continuing prudent management of the public finances.  <\/p>  <p>  A further element of this approach is to prioritise spending that mitigates risk, enhances the resilience of the economy and raises our growth capacity. This is the context for the National Development Plan. The capital expenditure ceilings set out in the Revised Estimates Volume reflect the multi-annual ceilings agreed by Government and published in the NDP. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this prudent management, over the last number of years a number of reforms have been implemented to support increased transparency and accountability in the budgetary process. This includes the Performance and Equality Budgeting initiatives, the publication of reports such as the Mid-Year Expenditure Report and the Summer Economic Statement and the roll-out of the Spending Review process. These reforms aim to facilitate a more meaningful dialogue around expenditure decisions and a shift in focus away from simply how much is being spent, towards what is being achieved. <\/p>  <p>  Efficient management of expenditure is a key part of protecting our ongoing economic recovery and this forms a key part of the role of each Government Minister. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. <\/p>  <p>  The January Fiscal Monitor presents a year-on-year comparison. At end-January, total gross voted expenditure was &euro;5,135 million. This is an increase of &euro;328 million, or 6.8% in year-on-year terms. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;4,911 million was &euro;322 million, or 7% ahead of the same period in 2018, while gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;225 million was &euro;6 million, or 2.6% up in year-on-year terms. Monthly expenditure profiles for each Government Department will be published this month. From February on, as is usual, the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer will be reported on each month against expenditure profiles, in the Fiscal Monitor published by the Department of Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700059#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700059#WRE02400"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[6219\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700059#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the degree to which he continues to strive towards a fair and equitable restoration of income throughout the public sector with a view to ensuring that the sacrifices made during the economic downturn by the various sectors are acknowledged and have their payment restored in accordance with the relevant criteria; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[6225\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700059#WRE02600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which he expects the restoration of public sector pay to be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 100 together.<\/p><p>The process of dismantling the Financial Emergency legislation commenced under the Lansdowne Road Agreement 2016-2018 and will be completed under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 (PSSA). <\/p><p>The PSSA, which was negotiated in 2017, and the provisions of which were statutorily provided for under the terms of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, allowsfor a continued, controlled unwinding of the financial emergency (FEMPI) legislation.

I commend the Commission for its work so far and the efforts it has put into this first report.

The Commission's report is available at its website (www.ircommission.org  ).<\/p>  <p>  In the report, the Commission expresses strong confidence in the whole-of-society approach to ending paramilitarism that underlies the measures set out in the Fresh Start Agreement  .

I am sure the Deputy will join me in urging people on all sides in Northern Ireland, especially those in positions of political influence, to engage fully in this process of positive change for the people of Northern Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  The Commission's report makes clear that there are a range of areas where the full and effective implementation of the Executive&rsquo;s action plan is hampered by the absence of an Executive in Northern Ireland.  It is another reminder of the importance of re-establishing the power-sharing arrangements in order that they can work to address the issues of most importance for people in communities across Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission will continue its valuable work over the next number of years as per the Agreement between the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom.

I also published a high level plan, &lsquo;A Policing Service for the Future&rsquo;,which sets out the approach to implementation over the next four years of the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations, which will be overseen by a dedicated programme office in the Department of the Taoiseach, as recommended in the Commission&rsquo;s Report.

The Department of Health is currently engaging with the DHPLG in this regard to examine the policy and legal implications on this issue.

Excess cystine damages cells and often forms crystals that can build up and cause problems in many organs and tissues. The kidneys and eyes are especially vulnerable to damage; the muscles, thyroid, pancreas, and testes may also be affected. There are a number of medicines authorised for the treatment of cystinosis.  These medicines are subject to routine pharmacovigilance follow-up.  1. Cystagon 50 and 150 mg capsules contain the active substance mercaptamine (also known as cysteamine). The medication is authorised for use in patients who have nephropathic (kidney) cystinosis. This medication should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of cystinosis.<\/p><p>Cystagon is contra-indicated during breast-feeding and should not be used during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, unless clearly necessary.  It is contraindicated in patients who have developed hypersensitivity to penicillamine, and in patients who are hypersensitive to mercaptamine or to any of the excipients.  <\/p><p>Monitoring of blood cell count is recommended on a regular basis.  Cases of Ehlers-Danlos like syndrome and vascular disorders on elbows have been reported in children treated with high doses of different cysteamine preparations. It is therefore recommended to monitor regularly skin and to consider X-ray examinations of the bone as necessary<\/p><p>2. Procysbi (mercaptamine) 25 and 75 mg capsules are also indicated for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis.  This medication should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of cystinosis.<\/p><p>3. Cystadrops (mercaptamine) is an eye medicine used in patients from 2 years of age who have cystinosis. This medication should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of cystinosis.<\/p><p>Cystagon is contra-indicated in patients who are hypersensitive to mercaptamine or to any of the excipients. <\/p><p>All medications carry the potential risk of side effects. There is a legal framework for the provision of detailed side-effect information, including specific warnings if required, for medicines across the European Union which provides for the format and content of this information as part of a medicine's authorisation process. Such information is then published as a Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) document as well as a Patient Information Leaflet (PIL). The SmPC contains information for the healthcare professionals and the package leaflet for patients, both of which are reviewed and approved as an intrinsic part of the licensing of a medicine, and continuously updated to reflect the current state of knowledge of the medicine and the risks associated with its use. As such, it is considered important for healthcare professionals and patients, as well as their carers, to regularly read and review these documents in full to support safe and appropriate use of medicines. <\/p><p>Regarding other treatments available, it would not be appropriate for me as Minister for Health to comment in this manner on the range or details of possible treatment options available for any individual patient or condition as this is remains a purely clinical matter. <\/p><p>It is important to note that any decision to consider or undertake any course of treatment is solely the decision of a treating doctor, in conjunction with their patient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700063#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700063#WRJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":479,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[6166\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700063#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason requests by a person (details supplied) for a service have been denied; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":480,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The HSE reports that laboratories have agreed to undertake additional recruitment, provide for overtime and manage annual leave in an effort to minimise the backlog. <\/p>  <p>  In addition the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results. The HSE advises that sourcing capacity and resources is a serious global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff and is resulting in staff understandably seeking opportunities in other fields. This has limited the HSE&rsquo;s ability to source additional laboratory capacity and so improve turnaround times.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of these out of cycle smears ceased on the 31st of December 2018.

The EU&rsquo;s MFN (Most Favoured Nation) Tariff Schedule was then applied to this export data.  This tariff schedule includes both ad valorem tariffs and tariffs per weight\/unit of product, as set out in the EU&rsquo;s TARIC database. The imposition of tariffs is not a linear exercise, and the possible tariffs that could be imposed vary both within individual categories and the sector as a whole.

This programme is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and physical recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.

Castlebar is expected to open shortly and Lucan is expected to commence this year.<\/p>  <p>  D5: A capital allocation of &euro;4.9m is provided to Sport Ireland for the development of the National Sports Campus at Abbotstown. This allocation includes &euro;2m for the completion of Phase 2 of the National Indoor Arena. Phase 2 comprises full-sized and half-sized covered synthetic pitches, primarily for soccer and rugby but capable of accommodating all field-sports, together with ancillary facilities. A further &euro;2.9m is provided for general capital maintenance and minor projects at the National Sports Campus.   <\/p>  <p>  D6: A capital allocation of &euro;1m is provided to Sport Ireland under Subhead D6 for the disbursement, on behalf of my Department, of Dormant Account Funding to sports measures which are aimed at providing support and interventions to persons from disadvantaged backgrounds and to persons with a disability. In previous years this funding has supported capital projects in such areas as outdoor adventure hubs, sports inclusion disability equipment and artificial turf pitches.

It is under constant review and scrutiny in response to new intelligence on threats and risks. Ireland is obliged play its part in the international effort to make flying as secure and safe as possible. If we aspire to be a highly connected nation, we need to make sure our international airports are up to international best standards in security terms. On the matter of how and why specific decisions have been taken  in respect of certain categories of people working at our airports, such details are security related and confidential, but I can advise the Deputy that they are informed by international best practices and risk assessment.  <\/p>  <p>  Background checks are a key element of aviation security requirements that are applied with very limited exceptions to all persons other than passengers requiring access to the security restricted areas of airports and on-board aircraft in the State.

The employer conducts the verification of identification and pre-employment check. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides the criminal records check. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has recently introduced a programme of security enhancements which have been subject to a detailed risk assessment by the Irish Aviation Authority, which is responsible for regulating aviation security. A number of reviews\/audits of security practices and procedures at the State airports have pointed to the need to introduce improvements in staff screening arrangements. The new enhancements were adopted by the National Civil Aviation Security Committee (NCASC) - which includes the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - on the basis of a risk assessment by the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), which has responsibility for overseeing compliance with aviation security requirements in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  With regards to further developments at European level, new provisions are on the way which will introduce additional aspects to the background checks carried out in civil aviation, including the use of security intelligence.

Of the 4,475 cases submitted, 3,043 were ineligible or terminated during the process.  Of the remaining cases submitted, 445 have been completed, and the remaining 987 applications are being actively progressed.<\/p><p>The reasons why a case may not have progressed are varied and can depend on the household, the property, the ability of the Approved Housing Body (AHB) sector to increase its involvement in the scheme, the sale of the property not being agreed between the lender and AHB or an MTR application being withdrawn by either the lender or the borrower.  The Housing Agency publishes, on a quarterly basis, detailed statistical information on the operation of the MTR scheme including the reasons for cases not progressing and the number of such cases.  This information is available on the Agency's website at the following link:<\/p><p><i>.  <\/i><\/p><p>The primary reason for cases not progressing is the withdrawal of MTR applications.  To the end of 2018, the number of MTR applications withdrawn was 1,173.  All withdrawals are notified by the lender and the underlying reasons for withdrawal are not indicated. However, it is known that the 1,173 cases included some 500 applications that were incorrectly submitted by lenders in the early stages of the scheme when lenders were not familiar with the scheme's purpose and operation.<\/p><p>Not all MTR applications will develop into fully completed transactions given the understandable reluctance of those in mortgage arrears to lose ownership of their homes.  Such a decision cannot be taken lightly and so the MTR process allows the borrower enough time to consider the option fully.  If other options rather than losing home ownership are put forward by the lender, a borrower is more likely to avail of these.  This is particularly the case in the context of a now improving economy.  <\/p><p>A Review of the MTR scheme, published on 8 February 2017, introduced a range of amendments to the eligibility criteria and administration of the scheme in order to improve its operation.  The Review, which is available at the following explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and recommended a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  My Department and the Housing Agency are working with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the Review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.  The eligibility requirements of the scheme were widened to include a greater number of borrowers and a larger number of property types.  Increasing awareness and understanding of the scheme has been a priority and a new website - - dedicated to guiding and advising borrowers has been developed.  In addition, new structures and arrangements have been put in place to encourage a greater number of entities to take part in the scheme.<\/p><p>While it will continue to be the case that not all MTR applications will develop into completed transactions,  the implementation of the resulting actions from the Review means that MTR is available to provide a long-term solution for more households in mortgage distress, where appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700066#WRM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Private Rented Accommodation Standards","counter":719,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700066#WRM05100"},{"type":"question","counter":720,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[6072\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020700066#WRM05200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will review the regulations in place concerning standards in privately rented accommodation in order that it is compulsory for double glazed windows to be provided in such accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":721,"content":"<p>The minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017.
