The first phase will be for all children under six years of age and all persons aged 70 and over to have access to GP care without fees.  These arrangements will come into operation in quarter 2 of 2015, subject to the conclusion of contractual discussions.  I expect the Bill to extend GP services without fees to all over-70s to be published in March.  These measures represent a major step on the way to universal health care.  The Government recognises that different age groups have different health care needs and abilities to access services and that children and older people have particular needs in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The medical card system is fundamentally based on means, and this position has obtained for more than 40 years.  However, the Government recognises that the health service needs to be responsive to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs.  In November 2014 the Minister for Health and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people's needs, especially where serious illness is involved.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold.  Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, he or she may be provided with a GP visit card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs and appliances under the long term illness scheme, where the qualification criteria are met.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has recently established a clinical advisory group for medical card eligibility.  The group will provide oversight and guidance to the operation of a more compassionate medical card system and will focus initially on the development of a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of illness in this context.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is reforming the system of health service eligibility that it inherited and is seeking to make it fairer.  For many years we have had universal eligibility for acute hospital services, but free access to the first and most effective point of contact with the health service - that is, GPs - has only been provided on a public basis to those on very low incomes.  The provision of universal GP access through greater public investment in primary care services is a critical reform in resolving inequities and rebalancing our services towards earlier prevention.  The introduction of universal GP access for the youngest and oldest members of our community is an important step in the phased implementation of these reforms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500003#A00500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1424856600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.

As late as this morning it was revealed that there is a widening gap between health outcomes in the various income groupings in Cork North Central and parts of Cork South Central.

There is a more compassionate way of looking at it.  It is about the burden of illness.  Even where people do not qualify through a means test, there is a recognition that illness brings an additional burden with it.  We have increased the number of discretionary medical cards to over 70,000.  The number of GP cards has increased to almost 85,500, and the figure for medical cards in general is over 1 million.  A sizeable proportion of the population, therefore, are now covered by free access to a primary care medical card and, in many cases, GP access also.  There is no shortage of people in need.

My Department provided information and observations on an early draft of that report.  The report emphasises the need for reform of our health services and acknowledges that the Government is the first in the history of the State to commit to the principle of a universal, single tier health service which guarantees access to medical care based on need, not income.  The first concrete manifestation of that will be seen this year by extending GP care without fees to the younger and older in our society.  We remain committed to the goal of universal health care and to driving forward reforms in other areas such as extending GP care without fees to other groups, further widening discretion for medical card based on medical need as well as income, improving the management of chronic diseases, establishing activity-based funding, establishing hospital groups, and making health insurance more affordable.  These initiatives are important reforms in their own right that will drive efficiencies and bring benefits in advance of moving to a system of universal health care. This Government's commitment to major reform is long overdue with the report noting that reform \"was largely ignored in the pre-crisis period\".<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the potential cost of a competitive universal insurance system, my Department is working with the ESRI, the Health Insurance Authority and others on a major costing exercise.  This exercise will examine the cost implications of a change to a multi-payer, universal health insurance model, as proposed in the White Paper on UHI.  The analysis will include a review of evidence of the effects on health care spending of alternative systems of financing and changes in financing methods and entitlements.  It will also estimate the cost of UHI for individuals, households, employers and the Exchequer.  I expect to have the initial results from this exercise in April, following which I will revert to the Government with a roadmap on the next steps to UHI.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the WHO and others points to the fact that there is no magic prescription for all countries when it comes to health service reform.

While the Government, through the voice of the previous Minister for Health, anticipated that if every citizen was forced to have health insurance, providers would compete against each other, thereby driving down costs, the international evidence does not support that.

At the same time in parallel, we are trying to make health insurance more affordable for more people because it is good that people take out health insurance in the same way they take out other forms of insurance, whether it is life insurance, pension cover or travel insurance.  It is open to debate whether a multi-payer system is the best way of keeping costs down.  The best example of keeping costs down is our own system.

I attended and participated in an IMO seminar towards the end of last year in Dublin city centre.

There are many different ways to achieve universal health care.  Looking across different jurisdictions and countries, one cannot say definitively that one model is best.  I do not buy that.

It must also be adequately staffed.  The first step in Waterford is to extend the hours of the existing cath lab, because any new cath lab will take time to build.  There are currently three cardiologists.  If six people can cover a 24-7 service, surely the existing three people can cover a 12-hour service seven days a week.  As the Deputy should know, if he does not already, there is great difficulty in hiring cardiologists and being able to cover rotas in the way that people expect.  If a rota is not covered, this results in a greater patient safety risk.  An unsafe service is not a good thing.

What was in Dr. Tony O'Connell's letter, which was not addressed to me but to others in the HSE, was nothing new.  It is absolutely the case that older people who are in hospital longer than they have to be because they are waiting on a nursing home bed or home care package are at risk of falls, medication errors and infection.  In addition, the fact they are not being discharged certainly does delay treatment for others, who are then put at risk.  There is nothing new in what Mr. O'Connell pointed out in his letter.

While older people prefer to remain at home if possible, there will always be a need for long-term nursing home care.  The scheme's introduction in 2009 relieved families of potentially very onerous expense and ensured equity of treatment based upon means, regardless of the type of nursing home care provided.  It involves a very significant financial commitment on the part of the State, with &euro;948.8 million allocated to the scheme in 2015.  This represents an increase of &euro;10 million on the 2014 figures. <\/p>  <p>  When the nursing homes support scheme commenced, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  This review is being carried out by my Department in collaboration with the Health Service Executive, with analysis and recommendations provided by Deloitte Consultants on specific issues which required specialised expertise.  The review is considering the long-term sustainability of the scheme, including funding arrangements.  No decisions have been taken and no plans put in place regarding changes to the way the scheme currently operates.<\/p>  <p>  Between now and 2024 the population over 65 years is projected to increase by some 200,000.  Based upon current trends, those requiring long-term care will increase by a third over the same period.  On that projection, spending on the scheme at current prices would approach &euro;1.3 billion per annum from its current level of just under &euro;950 million.<\/p>  <p>  The review of the nursing homes support scheme, as well as considering how the scheme has operated to date, is expected to identify some of the broader issues that will need to be considered and tested more fully into the future, including the future financing of the full range of supports for older people, how community and residential supports and services should be balanced, and whether new care approaches can contribute positively.  A continuum of more efficient care might serve to reduce the number of people requiring nursing home care and limit the projected increase in the cost of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There is much reference these days to the challenges that demographic trends represent.  That we are facing these challenges should be welcomed, as it means we are achieving longer lives for more of our people.

While there are no easy solutions to addressing the problem, the Government is committed to stepping up the effort to reduce the number of drug-related deaths.  The latest annual figures from the national drug-related deaths index indicate that 350 people died in 2012 due to the toxic effects of drugs, a decrease from 387 in 2011.  There were 86 deaths involving methadone in 2012 as compared with 118 in 2011, 60 in 2010, 69 in 2009 and 80 in 2008.  Methadone was involved in one out of four poisoning deaths, and in most of these deaths methadone was mixed with another drug.<\/p>  <p>  Many drug-related deaths are avoidable, particularly those involving methadone or heroin overdoses.  For this reason, I have authorised the HSE to undertake a demonstration project on the use of naloxone in the prevention of opioid overdose.  Naloxone reverses the effects of drugs like heroin, morphine and methadone in someone who overdoses.  The pilot study, which is being carried out this year, aims to increase access to naloxone for non-medical staff, such as the families or friends of a drug user and those who work with drug users.  The HSE budget includes an extra &euro;2.1 million to support this project and other measures targeting vulnerable drug users, including through the provision of additional residential detoxification beds and additional rehabilitation facilities.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is commencing work on the development of a new national drugs strategy for the period after 2016.

This will be the single most effective measure we can take to save lives.  The second development, which is very important, is to increase the budget for drug treatment by over &euro;2 million this year.

We must examine other options to try to ensure we give addicts every assistance in trying to address their drug addiction.

The HSE has advised me that all patients from the 2013 waiting list initiative who have not been seen, diagnosed, treated and discharged back to their GP have all been accepted back to Letterkenny General Hospital on their appropriate waiting list.  This includes the surgical pre-assessment, day surgery and inpatient surgical waiting lists.  These patients will be treated within the hospital's service and budget for 2015.  For some outsourced patients, the treating consultant required further review to either verify their clinical requirements or perform further diagnostic tests.

The HSE has already put in place specific measures to address waiting lists more efficiently in collaboration with the acute hospitals.  These include observation of the national waiting list protocol as approved in 2014, adherence to the relevant HSE national clinical programme guidelines and prioritising day of surgery admission where clinically appropriate.  My Department is working with the HSE to put in place a plan to eliminate very long waits by the end of the year.

Of those 3,000, approximately half were discharged back to their general practitioner.  There are 1,500 others, and I listed them in the question, who need surgery, diagnostics or follow-up patient reviews and for whom Letterkenny General Hospital and the HSE were expecting to be able to provide follow-on funding to allow them continue their care with the consultant who had already seen them.  That follow-on funding has not been provided and those 1,500 patients are now being put back on waiting lists in Letterkenny General Hospital, but those waiting lists have got longer in recent months because of the accident and emergency department situation.<\/p>  <p>  One measure the Minister could propose to help address the waiting list problem in this hospital immediately would be to provide the follow-up funding for these patients to continue their care with the consultant who has already seen them, is aware of their case and has diagnosed the follow-on treatment or diagnostics required.  Unfortunately, the Minister seems not to be doing that.  I would point out to the Minister that of any hospital in the country, Letterkenny General Hospital has the largest number of patients waiting more than two years to see an outpatient consultant, yet the Minister is putting these patients back on these hospital waiting lists by not providing the funding for them to continue their care.  I urge the Minister to take action today to provide that funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500010#H00400","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1424860800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Sorry, Deputy, I will let you back in.

They were not disadvantaged in any way by having their case outsourced.  It is not a satisfactory situation that if somebody is outsourced and sent for private treatment, they should stay in that until their treatment is completed.  That did not happen in this case.

The reason these patients were referred out in the first place was because they were waiting more than one year.  They were referred out at the end of 2013.  Before that they were waiting at least a year, and in most cases more than a year, to see a consultant.  They were referred out at the end of 2013.  They then saw a consultant at the start of last year, which is more than a year ago at this stage.  They are being brought back to Letterkenny General Hospital but before their treatment can be brought forward or diagnostics done, they now have to see a consultant in Letterkenny for the first time because a consultant will not decide to treat a patient without first seeing him or her.  That is the position in which they find themselves.  They are back to square one, as such.  The difference is they know they need some follow-on treatment.  That is beneficial in itself but they are back to square one in that they are waiting to see a consultant in Letterkenny General Hospital for the first time.  What is required, and this can be addressed immediately, is for money to be provided and for Letterkenny General Hospital to be asked to stop requesting the files from the consultants who are treating these patients and instead provide the funding to complete their treatment.

I welcome that it is a reforming Bill updating family law and that it at last recognises in law and gives clarity and certainty to the status of family members, specifically parents with children, in the many different family formations.  It gives that clarity and certainty in the context which prioritises the needs of the children.<\/p>  <p>  It has been many years since the typical household was one of husband, wife and children but even when that was the norm, there were many differing arrangements for the rearing of children.  Many such arrangements were informal and undocumented where, for instance, a grandparent, a spinster aunt or an uncle took over the care of a child, perhaps from a large family, or where the mother may have been ill.  Many of these arrangements were very satisfactory and benign and worked in the interests of both the child and the parenting family.  This was a very common practice but for many children it was not a benign arrangement.  We know all too well the tragic tales of what happened to children, for instance, if they were born out of wedlock or where people in positions of power but with no legal entitlement often secretly and without any documentation sequestered children into orphanages, often for their entire lives, or sent them to work on farms or in households as virtual slaves or, worse, exported them to countries such as America, Canada, New Zealand and Australia where in many cases their fates still remain unknown.<\/p><p>These children had no rights, entitlements or power.  We should welcome the fact that in more enlightened times we started to introduce legislation to protect children, including the Guardianship of Infants Acts, the Status of Children Act and the Adoption Acts.  Now is the time to update family law to reflect the diverse forms of family in which many children grow up and to ensure that these children have the legal support, security and protection in their relationships with those who are parenting them.<\/p> <p> While there has been some opposition to this Bill, it is probably more a reflection of unhappiness with the circumstances that gave rise to the need for the legislation rather than with the Bill's measures.  I can understand that people maybe unhappy with the decline in the traditional marital unit, but it is declining none the less.  People may not be happy with single parents or unmarried parents but they exist.  They may not be happy with marriage breakdown but it happens.  They may not be happy with assisted human reproduction but it is happening and will continue to occur, probably with greater frequency due to fertility decline in Ireland.<\/p> <p> Children are being born into, and living in, these kinds of relationships every day.  As legislators, it is our responsibility, first, to recognise in law that such relationships exist and, second, to ensure that the children of these relationships have the same legal security, protection and certainty about parentage that children of marital parents have.  Legal certainly about parentage, custody, guardianship, succession rights and maintenance is vital to a child's welfare and well-being.  Children in the traditional family have it and it is now time to ensure that all children in the diverse family formations that exist also have it.<\/p> <p> In legislating for children born from assisted human reproduction we are doing something new.  In all its forms, including surrogacy, it is complex and evolving.  It presents us with totally new and previously unimagined family relationships and, consequently, with new and extremely challenging legal and - let us face it - ethical questions as well.  However, being new and challenging does not justify ignoring the existence of donated assisted human reproduction or DAHR.  In fact, it highlights that it is imperative to regulate it and establish the status of relationships that result from DAHR.<\/p> <p> I appreciate the concerns that have been expressed about the exclusion of surrogacy from this Bill.  As the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, said on radio this morning, there is an urgency about it.  Issues have already arisen before the courts because of the lack of any legal framework.  Indeed, the courts have changed their minds on a number of occasions, but they have clearly indicated that it is up to the Oireachtas to provide legislation in that regard.  As the Minister also indicated this morning, this area is extremely complex and arcane.  The ramifications are difficult to deal with and some of them have not yet been foreseen as this is an area which is evolving all the time.<\/p> <p> The Government has decided to provide for the regulation of surrogacy in a stand-alone Bill.  The Bill before us is, in itself, long and complicated enough without introducing the surrogacy issue.  I welcome the progress that has been made on the surrogacy issue, including the publication of the heads of the Bill.  I hope it will follow this legislation in the not too distant future.<\/p> <p> There has been some criticism of the donor-assisted human reproduction element of this Bill.  However, I would have thought that regulation and imposing controls on the circumstances of donation, which already exist, would be welcome and a clear improvement on what at the moment is effectively a free-for-all, if that is not an inappropriate expression.  In future, donation must be carried out in a clinical setting.  Otherwise the clarity of parentage granted under this Bill will not apply, and rightly so, as there cannot be clarity of parentage in the loose and often private arrangements that currently pertain.  This clarity of parentage through a donor-conceived person register, which is welcome, is a vital element of the legislation.  It will give the children of donor-assisted human reproduction access to information about their genetic make-up and to all of the health related implications they or their children may have in the future, perhaps in perpetuity.  Clarity about one's genetic make-up is essential.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact that the same information is now accessible to all children.  It is bizarre that it was not available to all children until the enactment of the Civil Registration Bill last December.  That legislation requires the mother to name the child's father on the child's birth certificate, which is a very basic requirement.  I hope the next step will be a requirement for fathers to make a contribution to their children's upkeep.  Most non-marital fathers take an active interest in their children's upbringing and certainly contribute to their maintenance, but there are many serial fathers who do not.  In almost every western European country it is a requirement that the father makes some contribution to the maintenance of his children.  It should not be left to taxpayers to carry that burden.<\/p> <p> In giving greater responsibilities to fathers, it is also right that we should recognise their relationship to the children they have parented.  That is reflected in the various categories of parents, other than birth mothers, who will have access to guardianship rights under this Bill.  I have heard some complaints by unmarried fathers that the mother's live-in partner, married or unmarried, may have greater rights than they have under this legislation.  They may have a point in respect of their own position but the reality is that this legislation and the defence of it prioritises the child not the parent.  That is the tone of the legislation and we have to accept that it is the right way to go.<\/p> <p> I also welcome the Bill's provision for improved access for grandparents.  When families break down, it often means that the relationship, however close it may have been previously, can be completely severed.  That is not in the child's interests, so it is right that we should do what we can to minimise the disruption to a child's world caused by marriage breakdown.<\/p> <p> The legislation puts in place a number of provisions to ensure parenting works for parents and children as well as it can when breakdowns occur.  The Bill also tries to ensure that a meaningful relationship exists for both parents with their children.  When children are old enough, they can be consulted on what kind of custody, access and maintenance arrangements are put in place for them.  Where children are not old enough, an expert can be appointed to advise the courts on the best arrangement for the children's parenting.<\/p> <p> Two points stand out for me in this legislation.  First, if people are worried about this Bill, there is absolutely no change whatsoever in the constitutional rights of birth mothers and marital fathers.  The second point concerns the diversity of relationships in families, which has often been stated with regard to this legislation.  There is the traditional marital relationship, the non-marital relationship, the separated-previously married relationship, and separated non-married couples.  We have same-sex couples and into that mix we also have donor-assisted human reproduction.  We have relationships that form and break up, followed by new relationships.  These diverse relationships can be complex, challenging, messy and unsatisfactory on a range of fronts.  If they break down they are often the cause of major grievances between couples, not just over property and money but also over maintenance, guardianship, custody and access to children.  These grievances are not always resolved in a way that makes both parties happy.  Neither will this Bill, to be honest, but the legislation is not about the happiness of adults.  It is about children and what arrangements best serve their interests in respect of the diversity of relationships in which they are increasingly living.<\/p><p>Bearing in mind that a child may move through a range of relationship types over his or her childhood, the framework we put in place is vital to children's well-being and future.  I very much support the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500010#H01200","speaker":"1026","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424862000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I welcome the publication of this ambitious Bill, the Child and Family Relationships Bill.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on bringing it before the House.  I also acknowledge the work of the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, on this Bill and in the area of family law.  The Bill is another essential tool in the protection and underscoring of children's rights in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt that there will be a substantial debate in the House on this legislation.  Allied to this there are many observations and recommendations from expert parties such as the Office of Ombudsman for Children, which will also inform us as the legislation progresses through the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  This is substantial child-centred legislation which will address a series of anomalies created over the past five decades in our family law system and thus ultimately offer far greater protection to our children.  The Bill will put children at the heart of family law, provide legal clarity on various family types and address issues faced by children in non-marital families, as well as addressing key issues relating to guardianship, custody, access, maintenance, adoption and parentage.<\/p>  <p>  The law to date has not caught up with the changes in the family.  There are now many pathways to parentage.  The Constitution places great importance on the family and Article 41 defines it as \"the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of Society\".  However, the courts have narrowly interpreted the constitutional family as only including marital families.  Cohabiting couples, civil partners, lone parents, unmarried fathers and grandparents have all in essence been excluded from this definition.  An increasing number of children are being cared for in non-marital settings.  For example, one in four children live with lone parents and almost one in ten live with unmarried cohabiting couples.  Despite this the law does not provide a mechanism whereby the unmarried parent's relationship with the child is recognised.  This can impact on their day-to-day parenting role, for example, in giving consent to medical treatment or granting permission for school trips.<\/p>  <p>  There is diversity now, maybe even fluidity to the family that has not been correctly acknowledged.  Existing law in Ireland does not really recognise the realities of family life in the country we live in today.  The Bill is designed to modernise the law regarding the parental rights of children living in diverse family forms.  The Bill will address the needs as they arise of children living with their married parents, their unmarried parents, a parent and that parent's partner, or a grandparent or other relative who is parenting the child.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister said last night, the Bill represents a watershed in the development of Irish family law.  Children are entitled to security and stability in their family situations.  Children are entitled to clarity in law around the issues of parentage, guardianship and access.  The Bill merely, but fundamentally, modernises Irish law in a range of complex and sensitive areas and puts the child at the centre.<\/p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Bill is long overdue and I wholeheartedly support it.  I look forward to its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500012#K00200","speaker":"975"},{"type":"speech","time":1424862000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I believe the way this is being done is very wrong.  Very rarely in my time in the House, other than with finance and consolidation Bills, have I seen a Bill this large being published.  It is a very large Bill, containing 172 sections and an amount of detail.  The Minister published it last Friday within the D&aacute;il.  That goes against all the protocols we were assured we would have about D&aacute;il debates.  There are meant to be two weeks between Second Stage and Committee Stage to allow people prepare amendments.  There are also meant to be two weeks between the Committee and the Report Stage.  I understand the Minister intends to throw all this aside for no reason.  If the Minister could not get this in on time, the only thing she could do with the timescales is to push them all back.<\/p>  <p>  As we, who are experienced in putting legislation through, know, rushed legislation, particularly complex legislation, tends to be very bad legislation.  So-called consensus-driven legislation - let us not look at it and examine it for unintended consequences - tends even in the simplest of cases to lead to mistakes being made.  My experience of doing Bills was that as I went through each section in detail and analysed a Bill in detail, in many cases the drafters came back or I went to the drafters and asked if they were absolutely sure certain things were correct.  As the Minister knows, ministerial amendments arising from drafting errors are many in most Bills.<\/p>  <p>  I was looking at a much smaller Bill, the Animal Health and Welfare Bill, which ran to approximately 40 sections.  It took more than a year going through the two Houses.  In fairness, to the Minister's colleague, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, he went through that Bill in a very meticulous manner.  He engaged with the Opposition in a very thorough manner.  We got excellent briefings.  He accepted Opposition amendments.  That was an uncontentious Bill.  Nobody in the D&aacute;il is against the principle of animal health and welfare.  However, when we started looking at the small print, the Minister accepted there were many amendments to be made.<\/p>  <p>  After he had gone through an exhaustive process on Committee Stage, the Minister postponed Report Stage because more amendments were being drafted.  In fairness, on Report Stage he came back with many amendments that improved the Bill.  He also took on board all the reasonable proposals put by the Opposition.  As the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, knows when dealing with a Bill, in many cases an Opposition Member puts forward a thesis and the Minister is able to explain why that thesis does not stand up, perhaps because it is covered in some other section of the Bill.  Most people in opposition accept that.  However, where the Opposition made a good case, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, accepted it.<\/p>  <p>  In fact, I welcome the Bill wholeheartedly because there is a need for reform.  However, I argue that it is highly unlikely that there are not drafting errors and issues of unintended consequences within the Bill.  Why would this Bill, which is immensely complicated, be so different from all the other Bills that come into this House?  What is so magic about the way this one was drafted that it does not need proper parliamentary scrutiny?  What is the rush?<\/p>  <p>  I remember making a mistake in my early time as a Minister in rushing one small part of additions to legislation.  It ended up costing me more grief than all the legislation I had done both as a Minister of State and as a Minister subsequently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500012#K00300","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1424862000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to deal with what is in the Bill or what could be in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500012#K00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1424862600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>The procedure is vital here because the problem is that we will never get to deal with what is in this Bill.  This is the problem with the process being driven by this Government for some agenda that is hard to understand.  Good process is good process, and it is good process with every Bill.  If we want to see the dangers of what I would call this consensus-driven \"let's get it through and let's not look at the words\" approach to legislation, I can give a simple example.  In everybody's rush to show goodwill towards the Good Friday Agreement, nobody examined the wording put forward in the referendum that followed the Agreement.  They were two paragraphs relating to the wording of the articles that replaced Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  The wording stated that everybody born on the island of Ireland was automatically an Irish citizen.  The Minister might remember that subsequently we had to have a second referendum - I am sure Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in remembers it - because people who did not have any status in the UK because they were refugees or asylum seekers were coming over to Belfast overnight and having a baby and that baby automatically became a citizen of Ireland.  As a result of us not thinking through the propositions, we had to have a second referendum saying, \"sorry, that's not going to be the way it is and we should have looked at this the first time\".  That only related to two paragraphs and the Minister is telling me that there are no little issues like that in 172 sections.<\/p>  <p>  The second thing that fascinated me was previous Deputies welcoming the Bill but saying that the family is defined in the Constitution as only being a marital family and then welcoming the fact that all these changes recognising all these different types of families are coming in now.  The hyperbole that is sometimes used around here is mind-boggling and I accept that some of my own colleagues have used the same hyperbole.  As the Minister knows, if the Constitution did not provide for everything in this Bill, she could not bring it in.  Of course, the Constitution allows us to recognise that there are many types of family and that children are raised in very many types of situations.  In fact, I saw a complaint in a newspaper last week by Fintan O'Toole about the Constitution not defining the family.  I always have believed that, for very good reasons, the very cautious and clever drafters of the Constitution took a studied and purposed decision because they knew the complexity of families.  John J. Hearne was very much involved in the drafting of the Constitution and was by all accounts exceptional.  The drafters of the Constitution knew that then that, as is the case now, there are all sorts of different arrangements, situations and human realities and it was much better to leave that undefined.  <\/p>  <p>  The reference in the Constitution is about the protection of the institution of marriage on which the family is founded so it does not say that married families are the only families.  However, it does say that, in general, stable marriage contributes to society, everybody's good and, in particular, very many happy homes for very many children.  Most of us would accept this as a general principle.  It does not say and it does not mean that in all sorts of other circumstances, other arrangements do not give very good outcomes for children.  It just says that marriage is an important institution.  If it was not an important institution and if the Government did not recognise the importance of it or think it was of any consequence in society, the logical and simple thing for it to do would be to abolish marriage as a civil concept because it would not be of any importance.  Of course, the Government knows that irrespective of religion or no religion, every society sees the commitment of people to each other as being of fundamental importance.  <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, I have not had the time to go through the 172 sections because there were many other things to be done over the weekend.  I believe that, in general, everything here in terms of adoption and so forth should be welcomed.  An issue has been raised that the Minister might explain.  My understanding is that, at the moment, there is a qualifying word relating to single people adopting.  In other words, we provide for single people adopting but there is a qualification relating to the particular circumstances.  I have no problem with that being extended to same-sex couples but I am curious as to the reason the word \"particular\" is taken out.  I accept that this can be very much the preferable solution in cases but I understand, under the current situation in law, all things being equal and allowing that there are no particular circumstances that favour a single person, which we are now extending to same-sex couples, the presumption is that a heterosexual couple is favoured.  Why are things being changed, all things being equal, and I am saying \"equal\" because there are all sort of circumstances where they would not be equal?  It is fair to say that many people would question that.  This is not to say that, when one takes in individual circumstances, one would not wind up with either a single person or a gay couple adopting but it says that all other things being equal, a heterosexual couple would be favoured.  I am wondering how that fits in with the protection of the institution of marriage in terms of the Constitution.  These are the kind of little issues that need to be teased out.  <\/p>  <p>  I received a rather complex e-mail the other day from a single father who welcomed guardianship rights for fathers but raised all sorts of technical issues with me that, again, need teasing out.  His view was that guardianship should not be automatic but that the father should be able to apply for it.  In other words, for technical reasons, he was against automatic guardianship for all fathers because he believed that if they have not shown any interest, they should not automatically get something they have shown no interest in.  This is interesting because it was not coming from the side of the argument one would necessarily expect it to have come from.  Again, I would like to see all these things teased out because, as we know, sometimes when ones solves one problem, one creates another.  I have not had time to look into exactly what has been proposed here and the issue this person raised.  I am sure that over the coming week, and the problem is that it is only a week, now that the text of the Bill is available, many other groups on every side of the debate will come forward and say that the balance is not quite in the right place and that it should be shifted.  <\/p>  <p>  The issue of donor-assisted reproduction arises in this Bill without us knowing the answer to a question that is fundamental.<\/p><p>In 90% of cases, assisted reproduction involves a man and a woman who provide the genetic material required to become the parents.  They are not the people about whom I am speaking.  In cases of sperm donation and cases in which a man wants a child but does not have a female partner, we are into the realms of surrogacy.  Many countries across Europe have in place restrictions or a ban on surrogacy.  As a TD, I would like to think this one out carefully.  There are many issues that need to be teased out.  It is not simple.  Is it right - I do not know - that a woman in this country or any other country be paid commercially to carry a baby?  Is it right to commercialise vulnerable women in this way purely for financial gain?  Is it right to expect them to sever all ties and have no attachment in life to the child that may or may not be of their genetic material?  That is a debate we need to have.  As I said, many of the major European countries have chosen not to go there. <\/p> <p> Another issue that arises is that of relationships in which a family member is used as a surrogate.  There have been some very interesting cases in this regard.  I was on a radio programme the other day during which I listened to a case raised with Pat Kenny, which brought to mind the old saying: \"If your father's son was my father's daughter,\" and the games we used to play as children, because the mother turned out to be the child's aunt and so on.  This is a hugely complex issue.  While the number of cases of surrogacy will be few, we will need to regulate this area.  I do not understand why we are not addressing that issue within this Bill because, as I understand it, it has an impact on some of the provisions of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500013#L00100","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424863200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>What issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500014#M00200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1424863200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>The issue of donor-assisted pregnancy and so on.  My understanding is that a baby produced in this way will be entitled, on reaching 18 years of age, to information regarding his or her genetic mother but will have not have any right to a relationship <i>per se<\/i>with the mother, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The Minister might say that the same currently applies in relation to sperm donation, which is another issue.  However, without being sexist, I believe that biologically there is a slight difference between the two situations.  In one case the sperm is donated and in the other a woman somewhere has carried the baby for nine months.  To tell me that is the same thing is, in my view, to misunderstand what equality is.  Equality in these cases does not mean one equals one; rather, it means same and equal.  It means equality of rights and equality of standing.  Sometimes, to ensure equality one has to favour one situation over another.  As I have often said, if we were to treat all of the children of the nation equally we would never provide an SNA in a classroom or resource teacher hours, because if we provided that service for the child with the disability we would have to provide it to every other child.  Equality means that one recognises a situation as different and takes compensatory measures to deal with the inequality.  In this case, because it is not an issue of mathematical equality, special rights must be afforded to mothers.  While the status must be equal, there must be a recognition that the relationship with the baby will not be the same in both cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500014#M00300","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1424863200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on her introduction of this Bill, which is complex but rational and workable legislation, and for being so progressive in carrying on the type of reforming work commenced by her predecessor, rather than leaving things as they are and taking the \"cute\" political option.<\/p>  <p>  Like Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I come from a part of the country where people tend to look at issues with a certain amount of pragmatism and rationale.  We pride ourselves on that.  I would like to dispel a few of the myths and distortions around this Bill.  Many people do not appear to understand what is at issue, which has led to many popular myths around the legislation.  It is known to many but not to all that 36% of children are born outside the traditional family model, 352,000 children are currently cared for by lone parents and only 233 children are currently being reared by same-sex couples.  Let us be proportionate about this.  It is also worth mentioning that these 233 children are being reared by same-sex couples irrespective of the effects of this legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  Adoption is a very complex and difficult process, and our provisions must fit with the Hague Convention.  To obtain an assessment for a declaration of eligibility, an applicant must apply in the first instance to the HSE, which is a complex and rigorous process that lasts as long as seven years and includes interviews, group sessions and one-to-one sessions.  To put this in perspective, between January and September 2014 only 83 children were adopted in this country.  Because of other progressive legislation, the number of children available for adoption has radically decreased.  Also, foreign adoptions must comply with Irish criteria for eligibility.  Foreign adoption is an expensive process that is often fraught with delays.  It is important to put that background information on the record.<\/p>  <p>  We now have blended families in Ireland, including one-parent families, children living with cohabiting parents or same-sex parents, and children living with grandparents or other members of their extended families.  The composition of the traditional Irish family is ever-changing and it is important that we as legislators ensure that our laws respond effectively and comprehensively to reflect these changes.  Every child living in this country is entitled to legal clarity, security and stability.  This Bill seeks to ensure that.<\/p>  <p>  Part 4 of the Bill, which amends the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, will enable the court to appoint the step-parent, civil partner, cohabiting parent or guardian with custody of the child to nominate a temporary guardian for that child.  This will be particularly important for anyone who is a foster parent in that it allows them a legal right to access and custody.  This is an important aspect of the Bill.<\/p><p>The inclusion of this part is also important in instances in which a parent with sole custody of a child falls ill and is unable to physically care for the child.  Under this provision, such parents can now nominate a temporary guardian for the child.  That is a simple but important reform that will be welcomed in the real world.<\/p> <p> Section 40, which is very important, inserts a new subsection (4A) which seeks to make it more straightforward for unmarried fathers to obtain guardianship rights for their children.  We have received major complaints in that regard for years.  The process will be made more simple.  When a relationship breaks down for whatever reason, many fathers feel their rights of access to their children are unprotected under current family law.  I welcome the inclusion of section 40.  Grandparents can also apply directly to the court for access, which is very important.  Often, access to a child by one set of grandparents is removed in an acrimonious family breakdown.  That is a very important reform.<\/p> <p> Given the time constraints, I will move quickly through the important points I wish to make.  Typically, in court proceedings involving children, there are individuals and parties present who claim to represent the voice of the child in question.  Children are now to be provided with an option for their voice to be heard.  That is an important provision.  Traditionally, it was assumed that X and Y knew what was best for a child.  Now, if a child is capable of making a representation of his or her view of what is right for him or her, that will be taken into account.  An interesting and worthy provision is to be introduced for children under two years of age in allowing for an expert view to be taken into account in a decision.  Such provisions are all important.<\/p> <p> The crucial section relating to same-sex partnerships in this very complex and major legislation has inevitably garnered all of the publicity surrounding the Bill.  In the case of same-sex partnerships, where one or neither member of a couple is the biological parent of a child they wish to adopt, the legislation will ensure that the child in question gains a legally recognised parent.  It rightly gives the child legal recognition, rights of succession and other such rights.  Last year, GLEN made a submission to the Department of Justice and Equality based on its findings that a substantial number of same-sex partners were forming families and parenting children.  That reality exists outside of the gates of Leinster House.  It is shocking to think that such families currently exist without the protection of a secure legal framework.  That is essentially what the Bill is doing - creating a legal framework for the protection of a child in such a situation.<\/p> <p> I made the point at a meeting last night that any same-sex couple will go through the extraordinarily rigorous process - rightly so - of adoption and that all of the rigours of the law apply in that regard.  The popular mythology that it will be easy for a family unit that might not be capable of rearing a child to adopt one has no validity.  The tragedy for many eligible and wonderful people seeking to adopt children currently is that they cannot access children because of other progressive developments in society.  Cohabiting couples must have been living together for more than three years to become eligible to begin a process that could last for another seven to ten years and might never be completed.  Those are important, practical aspects of the legislation.<\/p> <p> We must legislate for all of the human realities and myriad complex family structures that exist outside the Chamber.  In all instances, the paramount responsibility on us is to ensure that the child's rights are looked after and that the child is central to the process.  That is the reason for the rigorous adoption process.  We wish to ensure that children will have rights of succession, good care and all the other rights of a child, including intervention by social services where the rights of the child are not sustained.  The more one legitimises, legalises and formalises the home situation in which children live, and the more one embraces them in law and brings them into the country's legal processes, the more likely one is to achieve the optimum outcome for the child.  It is proper that children achieve the best outcomes within legal structures.  In that sense, the voiceless one at the centre of the process is the infant child.  That is where we must ensure the best possible protection.  My submission is that the legislation recognises the variety of situations into which a child can be born today, legitimises those complex situations and brings them under the remit of proper processes and practice.  That is a reasonable thing to do and it is what should happen.  To shirk this duty would be to discriminate against children both born and unborn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500014#M00500","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424863800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister on her introduction of the Bill.  After listening to the contributions of previous speakers, I am minded to observe that probably the most important stakeholders in the debate are not those in the Chamber but the children observing proceedings in the Visitors' Gallery.  The Bill we are debating is about their lives, their futures and their reality.  To put the legislation in layman&rsquo;s terms, it is essentially about putting children at the centre of the legislation and making law to effect the betterment of children.  In many cases, life runs very smooth for people and they exist in relative bliss, but when difficulties arise the legal system can prove to be a considerable obstacle to progress in a child&rsquo;s life and ensuring that a child&rsquo;s best interests are served.<\/p>  <p>  It is a personal honour and privilege for me to contribute to the legislation.  The Government often talks about its achievements and is often criticised for its failures.  However, what I personally am most proud of as a member of a Government party for four years is what we have done for children.  We have put children at the centre of the Constitution through the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  It was the same Minister who is present today, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who led the campaign on the referendum.  Unfortunately, the legislation is tied up in a Supreme Court case and we must wait to give effect to it.  In effect, we are recognising the rights and needs of children and putting them in the Constitution.  Today, we are debating legislation concerning the introduction of a legal framework to support and recognise the different arrangements within families that are outside the norm, in order to avoid the grief, difficulty, pain and huge emotional trauma that ensues for parents and children in cases of family breakdown.<\/p>  <p>  To put matters in context, the previous serious piece of legislation in the area dates back to 1964.  It was the Guardianship of Infants Act.  That is a long time ago.  At that time, approximately 3% of children in the country were born outside the typical, traditional arrangement of a married mother and father, whereas today, of the approximately 70,000 babies that are born every year, 25,000 are born into arrangements that are different from those we consider to be traditional.  That is more than one in every three children.  It is high time legislation caught up with the reality of life.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the contribution, effort, passion and vision brought to the Bill by the previous Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, who had personal conviction in this area.  His contribution to the lives and well-being of children constitutes a legacy that will live for a long time to come.  I put on record my appreciation of his vision in bringing about the Bill, as well as my appreciation of the current Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and both Ministers' staff and advisers.<\/p>  <p>  One of the first stories one learns when one goes to a Christian school is the famous story about Joseph, Mary and baby Jesus, which we have all read.  Joseph was a foster father.  One of the rights that will be introduced in the Bill is that a foster father can apply to become a guardian of the child in his care.  I am sure Joseph would have been happy to avail of that right 2,000 years ago.  That puts in context how long the story has been going on and how long the need has existed.  People might think it is a modern phenomenon that families are not made up of the traditional married mother and father, but it goes back 2,000 years to Joseph the foster father.<\/p><p> One of the greater privileges I have had in life is to be a foster father.  I happen to have the honour and privilege of sharing my home with children who for a variety of reasons are not in a position to live in their own homes with their mothers or fathers.  The greatest gift my family has received from being in a position to share our home with other children is the understanding my children have that life is not black and white.  They asked me at a very young age why these other children were not living with their mothers or fathers or why a particular child did not have a dad.  They realised at young age that life can be very difficult and challenging and there is no exact norm or definition of \"the family\".  It is important that legislation catch up with this.  I very much welcome the provisions in the Bill that will help foster parents.<\/p> <p> Anybody who has had the privilege and honour of dealing with children in the care of the State - I know the Minister has a background as a social worker - will agree that what is very striking is that every one of them will be drawn back to their genetic mother and will always want to go back to their birth mother and father.  No matter how much love and affection is showered on them and what provisions they are given, there is a natural innate attraction in all human beings to a sense of identity - to know who they are, to know their mother and father and, ideally, to live with them.  Even if these children stay in the care of the State until they are 18, as soon as they are 18 the first thing they will always want to do is to seek out and try to find their birth mother and go back to the parent, irrespective of the circumstances of that person at the time.<\/p> <p> Many provisions in the Bill will allow children to find out who they are and who their birth mothers and fathers are.  Legislation was recently passed providing that a father's name must be on a birth certificate, which is a very welcome development.  A child will grow up to be a young adult and will yearn for this knowledge some day.<\/p> <p> As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated earlier, the Bill is a huge piece of work, and it will be very challenging for us as a body politic to get it right because many issues will arise in the debate.  I welcome the amount of time allocated to the debate.  I wholeheartedly welcome the provision for the child's voice to be heard, which has not been the case heretofore.  This is one of the best elements of the Bill.  It has been an aspiration and has been spoken about but is not based on law.  It will be mandatory for the courts to take into account various aspects, such as domestic violence and other factors.<\/p> <p> The appointment of court welfare officers is referred to in the Bill, and this is a very welcome development.  The Cafcass officers in England are a very good example.  I presume the Minister is aware of them.  They are welfare officers with child qualifications appointed by the courts.  The Bill does not address satisfactorily who will fund this service, or give a commitment in this regard, because it will have costs.  A marriage break-up or any separation is a very costly, difficult and challenging event on many levels.  A two-income household can all of a sudden become a one-income household.  I would like to see the Bill be more specific and give a commitment on the part of the State to deal with funding for the appointment of court officers to cases in which the welfare of a child is an issue, so that people with child qualifications will be in place.  I look forward to the Minister's response on this and would like to see all of the boxes ticked.<\/p> <p> We legislators will not be in the courtrooms when real cases and real-life experiences will play out, and somebody will have to make a decision based on the laws we pass.  I find the provision on cohabitation interesting because I am not sure how somebody will prove cohabitation if it is a matter of contention.  If a parent claims to have cohabited for 12 months, three of them after the birth of the child, but the other parent disputes this, I am not sure how it will be proved.  It will be up to the courts to deal with this burden of proof.  Perhaps we as legislators could look ahead and make it easier for the courts by defining this more clearly.  Marriage and other arrangements have a licence, and people can prove these, but I am not sure how someone can prove cohabitation if the issue arises and it is a bone of contention, as it is very likely to be in many of these cases when one parent is looking for guardianship.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Bill and look forward to contributing further to the debate.  I look forward to the Minister's response in due course to the issues I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500015#N00200","speaker":"994","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424864400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>The Bill is welcome and long overdue.  I take this opportunity to commend the Minister on its introduction.  Much of the Bill is without controversy and has been long awaited.  It represents a major change to family law in the State.  For many families it will bring legal recognition in line with reality.  It is a very substantial piece of legislation which spans 170 sections, relating to the extension of guardianship, custody and adoption rights to different types of families.  Importantly, it refers to the best interests of children and allows for increased guardianship for unmarried fathers and increased rights for grandparents.<\/p>  <p>  It must be noted that while it is very important for so many families throughout the State, the Bill will result in no change for the majority of families.  The Bill will enable civil partners and cohabiting couples who have lived together for three years to jointly apply to adopt, something they can do individually at present.  It will also allow one member of a same-sex couple to be eligible for adoptive leave.  Where a spouse or partner has lived with a parent for three years and looked after a child for two years, he or she will be able to apply for guardianship or custody.  The legislation will allow a relative of a child to apply for custody if he or she has looked after the child for 12 months where no guardian is able or willing to do so.  Unmarried fathers will be given automatic guardianship rights if they have lived with their child&rsquo;s mother continuously for a year, including for three months after the birth.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the more controversial aspects of donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, are being addressed - namely, the ending of anonymous gamete donation.  This will allow all children conceived in this manner to trace their genetic identities.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a register through which all children who are born via assisted human reproduction will be able to trace their donors.  I will return to this later.<\/p>  <p>  I will focus mainly on the elements that relate to assisted human reproduction, on which there are some issues that I wish to have clarified.  I believe some of the provisions in the Bill require amendment.  I hope the Minister notes these and, if she accepts the points, that she will address them on Committee Stage.  The first of these is on father's rights.  We would like to see the establishment of a central register for statutory declarations for joint guardianship and a change to the provision to which I referred that requires an unmarried father to live with the mother, as this might not be practical in all cases.  I know of such cases in my community, and this fact requires an amendment to the Bill.  What is required is that the father has lived with the child's mother continuously for a year, including for three months after the birth of the child.  It could also be argued that this discriminates against the less well off in our society, for whom the prospect of living together may be but a far-off ambition.<\/p><p>If the Minister wishes to explore the matter with me, I could instance real cases that I am familiar with.<br\/><br\/>The Bill sets out a national donor-conceived person register to allow children conceived in this way access to his or her identity.  This is fair and just.  It also sets out obligations for donor-assisted human reproduction facilities, parents and donors as well as information that will be required for the register.<br\/><br\/>Section 5 deals with parentage in cases of DAHR and sets out the position on the legal parents of a child born through DAHR.  The birth mother will always be a parent of the child.  The child's second parent will be the birth mother's spouse, civil partner or cohabiting partner if the birth mother and that person consent in advance of the birth.<br\/><br\/>Section 6 outlines the procedures that will apply to the consent of a donor of a gamete.  This is a necessary provision.  There are also provisions whereby donors can direct their gametes to a specific couple.  Sections 7 through 16 deal with other elements around consent, the revoking of consent and information to be given relating to DAHR procedures.<br\/><br\/>Section 17 has an important provision that will make it unlawful to become a donor for financial compensation beyond reasonable expenses.  It will, however, be possible for the donor to be refunded for any reasonable expenses that may arise from making the donation.  It is important that becoming a donor is not commodified and I believe the House is of one mind in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Section 18 relates to retrospective recognition of parentage of certain donor-conceived children born before the commencement of this part of the Bill.  It applies to any donor-conceived child born in the State following a DAHR procedure carried out in a clinic or hospital in the State or in a DAHR facility outside the State.  The second parent must be able to demonstrate that she or he knew at the time of the DAHR procedure that she or he intended to be a parent of the child.  The donor must be unknown to the birth mother or intending parent.  In this case an important question is almost invited.  Why would or must the donor be unknown to the mother?  What of parents who had the aid of an extended family member or friend?  There is an absolutism here and I am somewhat unsure that it is as it should be.  Again, I would be inclined to revisit the matter on Committee Stage.  Section 19 outlines the District Court procedure that will apply where a declaration of parentage is sought in respect of a donor-conceived child born before the commencement of this part.<br\/><br\/>Part 3 deals with DAHR.  Section 23 sets out the obligations on a DAHR facility and states:<blockquote>A person shall not perform a DAHR procedure unless the person is&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(a) a registered medical practitioner, or<br \/><br \/>(b) a registered nurse.<\/blockquote>This section appears to preclude what could be termed DIY or do-it-yourself donor-assisted human reproduction, a practice that, as the Minister is aware, currently occurs.  Can the Minister clarify whether this is the case?  What does she know of these instances?  What of those who have decided to go this course already?  Will any provision be made for them?  Certainly, there are cases such as those I have referred to.  What does the Bill mean for them?<br\/><br\/>The remaining sections deal with information required by DAHR facilities, the regulation of such facilities and the establishment of a register for those conceived by DAHR.  They deal with access to the register, what information may be released and to whom as well as clarification that counselling has been received prior to this information being handed over.<br\/><br\/>Like many other Deputies, I imagine, I have been contacted by some working in DAHR clinics who have what appear to be valid concerns about certain aspects of the Bill.  I will outline some of these concerns.  They are concerned that current patients will be retrospectively punished by certain sections.  While they recognise that allowances have been made for certain groups of patients, they believe there are other groups for whom no provision has been made.<br\/><br\/>The first such group consists of patients with anonymous sperm donors selected, paid for and currently in storage in Irish clinics awaiting use in treatment.  Should there not be some consideration for these patients in order for them to complete their treatment cycles?  I understand that in the region of 600 to 700 patients throughout Ireland will be prevented from completing their initiated treatment following the enactment of this legislation.  One possible solution might be that the initiation of new anonymous treatment cycles could be precluded from the date of enactment rather than the retrospective application.  A transition period of 12 months from the date of enactment to allow these patients to complete their treatment cycles could be allowed as well.  There are options in this area and I appeal to the Minister in this regard given the circumstances and on behalf of those who will clearly be severely and seriously impacted.<br\/><br\/>The second group consists of patients entering into anonymous egg donation within the past six months whose embryos have not yet been created.  It should be remembered that the egg donation process is not immediate.  The process from initiation to completion can take up to six months and, on occasion, longer.  This is due to the fact that following donor selection the donor may not, for medical, social or a variety of other reasons, be ready to start the process immediately.  It is my understanding that numerous patients have initiated donor egg treatment cycles but the creation of the embryos remains outstanding.  By enacting the legislation as is, this group of patients, who are several months into the process of egg donation, will be precluded from completing their treatment.  Again, one possible solution might involve the initiation of new anonymous treatment cycles being precluded from the date of enactment.  However, a transition period of 12 months from the date of enactment to allow these patients to complete their treatment cycles would be a reasonable concession.  I invite the Minister to take these possible amendments on board or to make them her own.  I am keen to see that the legislation is inclusive, fit for purpose and has the compassion required to respond to the circumstances that many people find themselves in.  These people are dependent and hopeful that legislators will be mindful of their situations.<br\/><br\/>There is one further area in which concerns have been raised by certain DAHR clinicians.  This relates to sibling treatment.  The legislation allows for treatment resulting in a sibling child from an anonymous donor for a period of three years from enactment.  However, if the patient has recently become or is about to become pregnant, she would have a particularly small window of opportunity for an attempt at a second child.

That analysis was written on 8 September, a month before the budget.  He had some very telling things to say, including: &ldquo;From a quality and safety perspective this situation is unacceptable...  Frail, elderly patients risk nosocomial infections, falls, pressure ulcers, and medication errors.\"  In terms of lengthening waiting lists and emergency department overcrowding, he said that both of these phenomena risk patient safety, delayed treatment for patients needing surgery and increased mortality for patients blocked in their transit through emergency departments.  He also said that the solution is adequate funding of the social care sector and that the 2015 Estimates bid appropriately seeks additional funding for social care to address shortfalls in current funding levels.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister was asked this morning about this matter.  Of course, with his usual detached, commentator approach, and in a now common refrain from the Minister, he simply said, \"It is not new to me\" and that \"It is going to get worse\".  His response to this was it is going to get worse.  Therefore, there will be more people at risk of dying in our hospitals before the Government decides to get to grips with it.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has been warned about this all along.  From June 2014, the Government was warned about delayed discharges, the appalling cuts in the fair deal scheme and the fact that twice as many people are now waiting three times as long for fair deal scheme places.  If we compare February 2014 to February 2015, the number of people waiting on trolleys has gone through the roof.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500018#Q00400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1424865600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>A question, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500018#Q00500","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1424865600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>The fundamental point is that the Government had choices in the budget last October.

I accept there have been difficulties for many years now with delayed discharges and the lack of beds, in some cases, to accommodate people who need this kind of attention.  I would point out to the Deputy that, as the Minister said this morning, there is not anything new in the information provided in the letter by Dr. O'Connell, who is an eminent medical person.  Clearly, he pointed out what is absolutely realistic in the context of older people and the difficulties that are created when we have a backlog situation.<\/p>  <p>  The fact of the matter is that an extra &euro;500 million was provided to fill the overrun in respect of health last year, with about &euro;150 million for the budget for this year.  A health service plan was presented and accepted.  The Government supports the Minister fully in dealing with the many challenges in the area of health, not least of which is the fact that they are compounded by this particular problem in respect of delayed discharges.<\/p>  <p>  The fair deal scheme, introduced quite a number of years ago, is being reassessed.  That report's findings on the effectiveness or otherwise of the fair deal scheme will come before the Government when presented by the Minister.  The estimate of the population of over 65s this year is 604,825 and this will rise by 100,000 in the next five years to over 700,000.  This is a demographic challenge we face and, as I said, the Minister is reviewing the fair deal scheme.  That will set out the options for the State, the costs and some data in respect of mapping for future needs.  With over &euro;13 billion in the health system this year, this is a very substantial amount of money but it is an area where the Minister has the support of Government in attempting to manage it in the interests of every patient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500018#Q01100","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1424865600,"counter":151,"content":"<p>That is an appalling response.

He referred to endoscopy lists going from 10,000 to 20,000 by year end, with greater risk of increased mortality.<\/p>  <p>  Four years ago, the Taoiseach said he would review this scheme.  In December 2006, when the fair deal scheme was brought in, Deputy Kenny led the attack and said this was \"the introduction of a new death tax on the elderly\".  At that stage, it was at a 15% contribution whereas it is now at 22%, courtesy of his good self.  However, in a letter to me two days ago, he now describes it in this way: \"The scheme is a generous one in that it carefully matches the contribution made by residents with the ability to pay and it limits the portion of an applicant's assets.\"  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has said it should be demand led, and the Minister nodded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500018#Q01200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1424865600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Would you put a question, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500018#Q01300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1424865600,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Why was it not demand led last October?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500018#Q01400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1424865600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Because the Deputy's party bankrupted the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500018#Q01500","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1424865600,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Some &euro;1 billion was spent between tax reductions and other things last October.

Following the budget announcement last October, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, acknowledged that small businesses are the lifeblood of the economy.  We must be mindful that 98% of Irish firms are small to medium enterprises, SMEs, and 69% of private sector employees work for an SME.  Growth in employment will therefore depend on growth in smaller businesses.  Job creation figures from last year indicate that small and medium-sized businesses created almost four times more jobs than the foreign direct investment sector, for example.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin and some of the larger cities and urban areas are experiencing good growth but there is a two-speed recovery.  Many of our rural towns and villages are being left far behind and the effects of any recovery are still to be felt.  The inner parts of towns are becoming denuded of people because of the growth of large multiples on the outskirts of the towns which attract a large volume of business.  Local government may see parking charges as a cash cow in such cases, so that issue must be addressed in the immediate future.  The review of valuations has so far been confined to Dublin, Waterford and Limerick, with 48,000 businesses being checked in that process.  All these valuations were carried out in a boom, for example, and businesses may have declined dramatically.  There is a need to reduce valuations in such cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500020#S02400","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1424866800,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Will the Deputy please put a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500020#S02500","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1424866800,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I ask that the process be rolled out across the country.

There is a glaring anomaly which sees us bend over backwards to accommodate the foreign direct investment sector, which attracts much industry to the country.  Nevertheless, the domestic tax system penalises the self-employed sector.  We had an opportunity to address this in the last budget but it was not addressed at the time.  It is very obvious with a 55% marginal rate for self-employed rather than the 51% rate applied to general workers as there is no rational explanation for it.  There is also discrimination against lower-income enterprises, with tax credits for all workers except the self-employed.  That has the bizarre effect of penalising the lower-paid self-employed sector.  I ask that such issues be taken on board in preparing the forthcoming budget for next October.  It would be a welcome and positive step.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is currently meeting representatives of the banks with regard to the mortgage crisis.  In recent days there have been dramatic increases in bank charges for handling coins and smaller notes, which are used by small businesses.  I ask the Taoiseach to take on board this matter in his discussions with the banks.  My final point concerns energy costs.  Oil prices have rarely been as low on the world markets but that does not appear to be having an effect on prices paid by the general or domestic consumer and our businesses.  The energy costs are 6% to 8% higher than the European average.  Will the Taoiseach examine that issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500020#S03900","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1424866800,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.

There has been a dramatic reduction in the cost of oil, which has reduced the cost of energy and brought a benefit to the consumer through lower fuel costs.<\/p><p>Clearly, what has happened in the United States, where energy costs have dropped substantially, has changed the balance for industry and industrial costs, and there are indications that companies wish to sign long-term arrangements regarding energy costs for their particular industries.<\/p> <p> Regarding the move by banks to increase charges so people will move to electronic payments and electronic online systems rather than cash, it is not appropriate in many cases around the country at present.  I have received an amount of contact from small businesses in the retail sector which are having difficulties arising from that.<\/p> <p> As regards the self-employed, everybody got the same treatment where the reduction of the tax burden was concerned, although obviously the Government was very careful to ensure that those on higher levels of income paid higher levels of USC.  The low pay commission is meeting this week and it will report to the Government before the summer.  The Government will reflect on that report and obviously it will also have to take account of the impact of any change for employers, as it has always tried to do.  It is a case of not putting a tax on work, but of making it easier for businesses to be set up and to employ new people.  There is a raft of schemes for that.  The more people who are working, the more that is fed into the economy and the more it can grow.  It is about having more people having good jobs, so they can have careers and opportunities in their local and regional areas where that is possible.  We strongly support that and it is a central part of the strategy in the Action Plan for Jobs.

I want to address three matters in the time available.  They concern the changes to entitlement for jobseeker's benefit that have taken place, some due to budget 2012.<\/p>  <p>  The first matter is the qualifying conditions for jobseeker's benefit.  As the Minister knows, jobseeker's benefit is paid for nine months in the year.  The impact of the changes in the qualifying criteria and the implementation of the nine-month period has come home to roost in the past six or eight months in the south west Donegal area in that qualifying people have to move to jobseeker's allowance, which is a means-tested payment, after jobseeker's benefit has ended.  A number of people, particularly couples, do seasonal work in the fishing industry, and one couple I know of lost over &euro;150 a week when they changed over to the means-tested assessment.  They lost the entitlement initially on jobseeker's allowance and child dependant allowance for children in full-time education.  This is having a severe impact, and it will have an even more severe impact in the coming years as these changes bed in, so to speak.<\/p>  <p>  The second matter is that of subsidiary employment and entitlement to jobseeker's benefit.  It is linked to the same period, but in south west Donegal and many other rural areas, many farmers are part-time farmers who work in fish processing factories to supplement their income from farming.  When they become unemployed and subject to an assessment for jobseeker's benefit, this comes in under subsidiary employment from their farming income.  The requirements are that they cannot have an income of more than &euro;12.70 per day from the subsidiary employment.  They have no problem with that because they are all small farmers and they get a very low income from that.  However, there is also the requirement that they must have paid 117 PRSI contributions in the preceding three years, and because of the seasonal nature of the work and the impact of quotas, whereby the working season has been shortened, it is virtually impossible for them to have the 117 paid contributions.  That means they will have to depend on a means-tested payment, which will have a severe impact in terms of allowing them to avail of seasonal work in the area.  It is some of the only work available across Donegal.<\/p>  <p>  The third item is more of an administrative matter.  The Department recently introduced scannable dockets for seasonal workers in the Killybegs local social welfare office, which means they have to go to their employers every week to have their dockets signed and stamped.  That creates a severe burden on them, because many workers might have to take a 30 mile round trip to get their dockets signed and stamped by their employer.  While it may reduce the administrative burden on the Department, it increases the burden on employers and increases the difficulty for the workers in having the docket signed.<\/p>  <p>  Those are the changes that have been implemented in the past while but, with some tweaking, the Minister could make it easier for people to manage on jobseeker's benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500024#W00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1424869200,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Pringle for raising the matter.

In terms of having a meaningful engagement, I suggest that we sit down next week and go through the three items, namely, the scanning of the document, and the onerous amount of travel required for some people, subsidiary employment in the fishing industry, and the change in the jobseeker's benefit entitlement for part-time farmers.<\/p><p>Rather than giving the Deputy a stock answer, I would be happier to engage with him to examine the impact of what he is suggesting and see if we can alleviate it in some manner.

I have already spoken to the Minister about it and I know he is working on the matter.  I am raising this item in the context of recent changes that were made to the Central Bank's lending requirements for mortgages.  There is a specific issue concerning one-off rural houses.  When houses are being built currently, the burden of regulation on signing off on the construction element is fairly onerous.  That is because the person who draws down a mortgage for a one-off rural house is not the same as a standard developer.  In other words, they are taking 100% of the risk, so it is in their interest that the house is properly built, engineered and overseen.<\/p>  <p>  In common with other Deputies, I have been contacted by draftsmen, engineering technicians, architectural technicians and technologists who for years have built up a level of experience in maintaining a good stock of one-off rural houses.  The Minister of State will know from his own constituency that one-off houses did not cause the difficulties arising from the construction sector's collapse, and neither did one-off houses cause difficulties such as those at Priory Hall or with pyrite.  <\/p>  <p>  People building one-off houses are insistent that proper standards are required.  Sign-off costs for one-off houses currently range from &euro;4,000 to &euro;7,000 plus VAT.  Another problem is that some people who have built up quite an amount of experience in recent years, including technologists and engineers, are excluded from being able to sign off for an individual's mortgage drawdown.  Shrinking the number of people who can do this, particularly in rural locations, is adding to the cost burden involved. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government had very good reasons for introducing such changes.  As we all know, the low standards that applied under the previous Administration left us with pyrite and Priory Hall.  They also left us with houses falling down all over the country and unfinished housing estates.  Given that the mortgagor for one-off houses is taking 100% of the risk involved, that risk is not borne by the State.  The Minister of State will not find anyone knocking on his office door at the Custom House having had difficulties with a one-off rural house due to planning permission and the way in which such construction is supervised.  He will find, however, that speculative sales in housing estates are causing problems.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to see some sort of re-examination of the building regulations regarding one-off houses.  This re-examination should include architects, engineers and technicians with years of experience in the design, construction and supervision of such projects, including the drawdown of mortgage stage payments for one-off rural houses.  The Department should ascertain whether we have gone too far in this respect.  Anecdotally, from my own constituency in County Limerick, technologists and technicians say that on the one hand they are being pushed out, while, on the other, costs are rising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500025#X00900","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1424869500,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I wish to thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  It is an issue of concern to many Deputies around the country who have raised it consistently.<\/p>  <p>  Following public concern with regard to the widespread failure to comply with regulatory requirements in all sectors of the construction industry, the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, otherwise known as Statutory Instrument No. 9 of 2014, were introduced to strengthen the arrangements in place by requiring greater accountability in relation to compliance with building regulations.  In relation to single dwellings, common problems which have come to the attention of my Department include inadequate drainage and septic tanks, necessitating the introduction of an inspection regime; sub-standard energy performance arrangements, as evidenced from the national building energy rating database; and occasional structural problems arising from poor workmanship or poor choice of materials.<\/p>  <p>  Over 5,000 construction projects have commenced, to date, since the new regulations took effect on 1 March 2014.  Over 1,100 of these are new build single dwellings.  This is a significant number of projects and already a significant number of home owners, builders and other professionals are gaining direct experience of advancing one-off housing projects under the new arrangements.  These dwellings will now enjoy the benefit of statutory certification of their design and construction, having been inspected and certified by the builder and a registered construction professional who have lodged compliance documentation with the local authority, where it is validated and included on a public register.<\/p>  <p>  We now have a credible regulatory framework for building activity in place on a nationwide basis for the first time in the history of the State.  While this is of immense benefit to home owners, obviously the issue of cost and value for money is of paramount concern for any new home owner.  While costs are determined by market forces and are therefore outside the scope of my regulatory powers, I recognise the importance of ensuring that the regulations do not impact unduly on one-off housing, particularly in relation to cost. <\/p>  <p>  As I have indicated previously, my Department, in conjunction with the Housing Agency and the construction professional bodies, is currently finalising additional guidance on an appropriate inspection plan for a typical one-off dwelling.  This guidance will be helpful in better informing the market in relation to offering realistic and appropriately priced professional services for such work.  I intend to publish this guidance shortly.<\/p><p>In my opinion, based on the advice I am receiving, the inspection regime for one-off houses should cost no more than &euro;3,500.  However, I am aware of many cases where the cost of inspections has far exceeded this amount, something I am determined to address in as far as possible.<\/p> <p> I intend to announce details of the imminent review of SI 9 of 2014 early next month.  It is appropriate that it be reviewed now that it is almost a year in place.  I expect that the issue of cost in the self-build and one-off housing sector will be a key component in this review.  I look forward to engaging openly with all stakeholders on the matter, including the technicians and technologists the Deputy has mentioned.  A full report on the matter will be produced by the second quarter of 2015 and will inform further regulation in this critical area.  I will arrange for a copy of the report to be made available in the Oireachtas Library in due course.<\/p> <p> My Department will continue to engage proactively and constructively with all key stakeholders and interested parties in reviewing and strengthening the arrangements in place for the control of building activity.  This is in the interest of the consumer and the person who builds, and also in the interest of keeping a high standard and keeping accountability at the forefront of construction here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500025#X01000","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424870100,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's decision to review SI 9 this year.  It is an important signal to send out to people with one-off rural houses.  I know the Minister of State is a great proponent of one-off rural houses.  From my time on the local authority and from the Minister of State's membership of Waterford County Council, we both recognise that there is a very strong anti-rural house lobby, some of whom might have found a welcome home in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I am glad the Minister of State will take on that lobby with the review of the statutory instrument.<\/p>  <p>  The current obligations regarding inspections and regulations for one-off houses also extend to house extensions of up to 40 sq. m, which is onerous.  In many cases, this might not even involve a mortgage and might involve the person paying for it himself or herself.  If it involves a mortgage, it could be much smaller than the actual cost because of savings, etc., which is also onerous.<\/p>  <p>  The requirements under the existing regulation to meet energy ratings almost lead to a kind of passive house environment, which adds costs of &euro;10,000 to &euro;15,000.  This is all having an impact on something those in my area and, I know, the Minister of State in Waterford want to sustain, which is the viability of people being allowed to construct a house on their own land in most cases.  These are ordinarily the sons and daughters of farmers or landowners.  If we want to maintain a vibrant community in rural areas particularly, this is something that needs to be addressed.  I support the Minister of State's approach in reviewing it.

This is a very serious topic with a local element affecting the town of Newbridge in my constituency and the very national element of the credit union movement in general and lessons learnt from the past.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for attending today.  I remind people what happened in Newbridge Credit Union.  In January 2012, the Central Bank appointed a special manager to run Newbridge Credit Union.  Effectively, for the following 22 months, that special manager stayed in place in a position where that person could say very little owing to a High Court gagging order.  Very little information came out to the members of the credit union.  They were kept in the dark and it led to a very significant amount of frustration.  People did not know there were problems with their credit union because they were not able to be told.  It led to considerable speculation as to what had happened.<\/p>  <p>  When the Central Bank report was published in November 2013, just after the transfer to PTSB, we got examples of some significant lending, which would not be traditional to credit unions, that had caused major problems.  However, the Central Bank decision to appoint a special manager could have been handled better.  Leaving people in the dark for as long as they were without that key information was very difficult.<\/p>  <p>  Since taking over the assets and liabilities in November 2013, PTSB has acted in the credit union building in Newbridge in the name of Newbridge Credit Union, albeit not in a position to give out new loans, but to continue to run existing loans.  That has left Newbridge, the 15th largest town in the country, effectively without credit union services.  The issue came to a head in recent weeks with PTSB sending cheques to thousands of members of the former credit union with the final closure of those savings accounts.  That was the one cheque in the post most people did not want to get because they did not want to see their credit union close with the loss of those services.<\/p>  <p>  This very large town does not have access to credit union services and businesses do not have the ability to take out those small loans.  The big benefit for small businesses in the area was that when the dividend was paid at the end of the year, people had more money in their pockets heading into the Christmas period.  There are many people in the town who do not traditionally want to be with banking institutions but like to be members of a credit union.  That option is no longer available to them.  It is crucial that we ensure the return of those credit union services to the town of Newbridge.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, I want to see a credit union operating in Newbridge again.  However, as a starting point we need people in Newbridge to have access to credit union services that we do not have at present.  There is no common bond area covering Newbridge.  The nearby Naas Credit Union has made an application to the Central Bank.  I met Central Bank representatives in support of the Naas application.  That proposal is still under consideration to the best of my knowledge.<\/p>  <p>  It is absolutely crucial that Newbridge residents get access to a credit union.  Down the line I hope that such a facility can open in the town itself.  However, as a start, people who want to access those credit union services have to be able to do so.  It is just too big an issue.  The ordinary members of the former Newbridge Credit Union, who made no mistakes and are not at all at fault for what happened with the credit union, are the real losers at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500026#Y00500","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1424870100,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising what I know is a very important issue for the people of Newbridge and for him personally.  It is an issue he has raised in the House with the Minister for Finance on a number of occasions.<\/p><p>While the Government is absolutely determined to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement and has highlighted its support for the return of credit union services to Newbridge, the role of the Minister for Finance is to ensure the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.  In line with the Credit Union Act 1997, as amended, the registration of a new credit union and the extension of a common bond of an existing credit union is the responsibility of the Registry of Credit Unions at the Central Bank.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Finance was informed by the Central Bank that it sought to address both financial and governance issues at Newbridge Credit Union from 2008 which ultimately led to the appointment of the special manager in January 2012.  Following a thorough assessment and in the context of the existing legislation, it was determined that the only viable resolution of the financial difficulties was a transfer to another entity.  It is important to understand the practices in Newbridge that operated over many years.  Some of these can be illustrated in the following key lending statistics: an individual loan of &euro;3.2 million, which was in excess of the Credit Union Act restriction of a maximum of 1.5% of the total assets; 52% of the loans exceeded five years duration as opposed to the maximum of 20% as set out in the Credit Union Act; the average loan in Newbridge Credit Union was &euro;17,281 as compared with the average credit union loan which was &euro;7,764; and 26 loans of an average value of &euro;550,000 which were seriously distressed.  These figures illustrate that Newbridge Credit Union was operating in a very different way from a normal credit union. The structure of some loans was more akin to development loans with so-called bullet repayments as opposed to regular repayments.<\/p> <p> All available options were considered by the Central Bank before the decision was taken to transfer all assets and liabilities, excluding the premises of the credit union, to Permanent TSB.  In line with the resolution options available, the Central Bank undertook a process which involved the examination of possible credit union combinations.  These efforts resulted in an approach being made to a number of credit unions.  Ultimately, however, no credit union considered that it was in its best interests or those of its members to complete such a combination even in the context of considerable taxpayer support.  The Central Bank also considered proposed solutions put forward by various interested parties but formed the view that none was viable.<\/p> <p> The transfer to Permanent TSB was ultimately the only viable solution available with the alternative option being a full-scale immediate liquidation of the credit union with interruptions to members' access to their funds and risks to depositors not covered by the deposit guarantee scheme.  This action was taken to protect members' savings within Newbridge Credit Union and to protect confidence and stability across the credit union sector and the wider Irish financial sector.  The alternative option to a transfer to Permanent TSB was that full-scale immediate liquidation, which was not in anybody's interests. The transfer to Permanent TSB ensured that members could continue to access deposit and lending services within the local community and also ensured the protection of their savings.<\/p> <p> It is acknowledged that there is a demand for the services of a credit union in Newbridge and the Minister for Finance has been informed by the Central Bank that it is open to meeting any party interested in restoring credit union services to the Newbridge area, including the possible extension of the common bond of credit unions in the local area.  Any proposal to establish a new credit union or to extend the common bond of an existing credit union is subject to regulatory approval by the Central Bank.  As of 31 January 2015, the Central Bank has received a proposal from a local credit union to extend an existing common bond that would allow for the restoration of credit union services to the Newbridge area.  This proposal is under consideration by the Central Bank and a final decision will be relayed in due course to the credit union involved.<\/p> <p> The funding required for the protection of Newbridge Credit Union members' savings is being provided by the credit institutions resolution fund and it is fully recoupable via a levy over time.  The Government has made available &euro;500 million to support the stability of the credit union movement.  This amount is divided between two distinct funds, with &euro;250 million in the credit institutions resolution fund for resolution purposes such as in the case of Newbridge and &euro;250 million in the credit union fund which provides funding for voluntary, incentivised and time-bound restructuring under ReBo, the Credit Union Restructuring Board.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Finance would like to emphasise the Government's recognition of the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and the distinction between credit unions and other types of financial institutions.  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall.  The Government is determined to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement and would encourage the movement to work with stronger credit unions in order that they can provide a viable option for assisting weaker credit unions.  In particular, the Government and the Minister for Finance would like me to highlight their support for the future return of credit union services to Newbridge.  As I have already outlined, there is a proposal with the Central Bank that is subject to its ongoing consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500026#Y00600","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424870700,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

How can we be sure that what happened in Newbridge never happens again?  What investigations have taken place to discover the cause of what happened and to make sure lessons have been learned from that?  Has there been any criminal investigation into what happened?

It is a fine building of which the people of Newbridge feel a very strong sense of ownership.  I would like information about the OPW's role in acquiring this building, the future uses of the building and the Intreo services that have been mooted and discussed around the town.  We do not have Intreo services in Newbridge and they would be very beneficial for us given that Intreo is a single point of contact for people who need access to supports to get back into employment.  This is something we very much need in the Newbridge area.

All the assets and liabilities of the credit union, excluding the premises, were transferred to Permanent TSB pursuant to a High Court order dated 10 November 2013.  The financial incentive agreement between the Central Bank and Permanent TSB comprises the following elements: &euro;23 million in cash upfront to fill the hole in the balance sheet; restructuring and integration costs of &euro;4.25 million; &euro;2 million for other transferring liabilities; and a risk share on the transferring loans whereby the State will absorb 50% of the losses where loans perform below their transfer value and 50% of the gains where they perform above the transfer value.  If the loans were written off entirely with no recovery, this would have resulted in an additional &euro;24.7 million total cost.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the position regarding the drawdowns to date and expected further expenditure from the agreement is as follows.  Restructuring costs, which are payments to cover the establishment and maintenance of a recovery and underwriting platform for the Newbridge Credit Union loans, are capped at a possible &euro;3 million.  To date, &euro;1.3 million has been drawn down.  The Central Bank expects to incur a further &euro;200,000 in such costs.  Integration costs, which are payments to cover the costs of any redundancies of former Newbridge Credit Union staff, are capped at a possible &euro;1.25 million. To date, nothing has been drawn down but the Central Bank expects to incur the full &euro;1.25 million allocated to integration costs.  Transferring liabilities are capped at a possible &euro;2 million.  To date, &euro;300,000 has been drawn down. The Central Bank does not expect further drawdowns under this heading.  Loss compensation payments are payments to Permanent TSB to cover deterioration in the performance of the Newbridge Credit Union loan book.  The Central Bank has a 50-50 profit and loss sharing arrangement over a ten-year period with Permanent TSB in respect of these loans in order that the maximum cost the Central Bank can incur is &euro;24.7 million if all of the loans defaulted.  If the loans perform well, the Central Bank may have no liability under this heading or could actually be paid by Permanent TSB.  Given the performance on the loan book to date, the Central Bank expects to incur some costs under this heading, although nowhere close to the capped amount.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of offences committed or lessons learned, Section 33AK(3)(a) of the Central Bank Act 1942 requires the Central Bank to report information to other bodies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, if it is suspected that a criminal offence has been committed by a supervised entity or that a supervised entity has contravened a provision of the relevant Act.  The Central Bank commissioned a report from the liquidator examining the governance and management practices leading to the appointment of the special manager.<\/p><p>The Central Bank considered the liquidator's report in the context of whether any further action might be required and has concluded that no further regulatory action is required.  The report will inform regulatory decisions of the Registrar of Credit Unions concerning those involved in the future.<\/p> <p> On the current position regarding ownership of Newbridge Credit Union, as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works I can tell the Deputy that the liquidator has signed contracts with the OPW to purchase the former premises of Newbridge Credit Union.  This sale is expected to be completed formally within the first quarter of this year.  As the Deputy rightly said, the building will provide important Intreo facilities in Newbridge which are about much more than the traditional dole office.  Intreo is about getting people back to work.  It is an important community facility.<\/p> <p> In regard to the Deputy's approaches to the T&aacute;naiste and me about community use of spare capacity within the building, my officials in the OPW and officials in the Department of Social Protection are meeting on that matter.  Both Departments are positively disposed to examining ways the community can use any additional capacity once the Intreo services have been established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500027#Z00300","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Children and Family Relationships Bill 2015: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1424871300,"counter":443,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500028#AA00200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1424871300,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1424871300,"counter":445,"content":"<p>Prior to the adjournment of the debate I was speaking about the issue of sibling treatment and was commending to the Minister a revisitation of the arrangements that would allow for treatment resulting in a sibling child from an anonymous donor for a period of three years from enactment, which is what the legislation as currently drafted allows for.  However, if the patient has recently become or is about to become pregnant, she would have a particularly small window of opportunity for an attempt at a second child.  Having a second child would be the wish of many who are taking any of the options we have already addressed.  I am suggesting that it would be reasonable to allow for three years from the birth of the first child or three years from the date of enactment of this legislation, whichever of the two periods is longer.  I think that is reasonable.  I hope that the Minister will give consideration to this suggestion in advance of Committee Stage and to the other suggestions I posed earlier.  Provision for a second child in these circumstances would allow patients a longer timeframe to make an attempt at a second child, with up to approximately 3.5 years between births rather than having to make the decision either to have two children within a three-year window, which in the circumstances is very narrow, or, as the case may be, not to have a sibling child at all.<\/p>  <p>  I have been made aware of a couple who performed a DIY donor-assisted reproduction with sperm from a friend.  They are disappointed that the spouse of the natural birth mother will not be automatically covered by the legislation.  That is to say, the spouse of the birth mother will not qualify for guardianship of the child because the procedure did not take place in a designated DAHR facility.  This is despite the fact that the spouse might be to all intents and purposes a live-in dad throughout the lifetime of the child's domicile with the mother and, in this case, the dad.  If couples in cases like this go about the procurement in an ethical and informed manner, acquiring signed affidavits that show that the donor consents to the treatment and that all parties understand parenting roles, why should they be excluded?  In my view, this is a further matter that merits address.  I am sure we would be surprised by the number of people in this situation.  Again, I encourage the most inclusive approach before finalisation of this legislation and its enactment.  I appreciate that DAHR facilities have robust methods to get fully informed consent and to ensure all parties are kept up to date.  However, is there any reason this could not occur outside such a facility in cases where the aid, assistance and support of a clinician and appropriate legal advice is sought?  The Minister might address that question in her concluding remarks.<\/p>  <p>  Some commentators have criticised the fact that this Bill allows for egg and sperm donation, which is their right.  Aside from the concerns I have outlined above and the others mentioned yesterday by my colleagues, Deputies Mac Lochlainn and McLellan, I think this Bill is an important change in the recognition of families throughout the State.  I believe it will go a long way in furthering the rights of members of families who are currently anonymous before the law.  More important, it protects the rights of an individual conceived as a result of DAHR to knowledge of their genetic lineage.<\/p>  <p>  Ar an ioml&aacute;n, cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Bhille seo.

It is exceptionally positive.  Much of the time, people who occasionally glance into the political world in the D&aacute;il Chamber might ask about the relevance of some of the Bills passed through the House.  Although we might know how relevant each Bill is that becomes law, the Children and Family Relationships Bill is one to which everyone can relate because of its vast, positive impact on society and how we view the diverse types of family life that exist.<\/p>  <p>  One could ask what is the purpose of a law.  For me it is about protecting citizens, reflecting the society in which we live and enhancing the quality of life of everyone in society.  In themselves, laws should never intend to displace citizens or create a hierarchy of citizenship.  In essence, the Children and Family Relationships Bill, of which we are debating the technicalities, is really about the vast, collective human story of Irish people &ndash; families, Mams and Dads, and children.  It is about recalibrating the legal perspective of how we view family life and the lives of children in this country in terms of the legal protection offered to them.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to keep the debate straightforward.  Most speakers will focus on the technicalities of the Bill.  The thrust of the Bill is about creating better family law that represents the type of society in which we live.  Let us be honest: whether it is good, bad or indifferent, a one-size-fits-all law is not a good way for a progressive, inclusive society to do business.  Previous family law, especially in the early days of the State, did create a hierarchy.  It excluded people rather than including them.  Perhaps that was unintentional, or perhaps it was intended to create a particular type of society or values, but the knock-on effect was that it relegated many people to the shadows of society.  When we do that and the law does not recognise people, the effects include stigma and the creation of cultural norms.  A hierarchy develops in terms of who we view as important.  In the past, the fact that one lived with one's granny, through no fault of one's own, was something of which one might have felt ashamed.  Questions were asked about the reason a person did not live with his or her mother or father or why someone&rsquo;s parents were not married.  In the past, the legislative solution to people who did not fit the norm was to send unmarried women with children to mother and baby homes.  That was the type of law that was created in the past, which had the knock-on effect of creating a stigma against some types of family that existed.  It was not acceptable to do that back then and it certainly is not acceptable now.  Thankfully, we have addressed the issue.  The Bill before us will create a new platform, one that tries to right the wrongs that have always existed in family law and to include the excluded who were never even acknowledged in family law but exist none the less.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, as legislators we can get caught up much of the time in the legislation.  I remind the House that behind the Bill is the human story of the reality of life.  Life is not what advertisements try to sell us on the front page of a travel brochure - the perfect family with two children in the swimming pool and Mammy and Daddy passing the beach ball to them.  We must recognise that families exist in many forms.  That is exactly what the Bill aims to do.  It is trying to get rid of the stigma that has often been attached to hundreds and perhaps thousands of families.  Particularly in the 1970s, when I was growing up, it took a brave single parent to rear a child because it was not culturally accepted.  In previous times, when girls got pregnant at a very young age they could be forced to get married because it was the thing to do.  The effect of this was a very unhappy relationship for the adults involved and sometimes traumatised relationships for children in such situations.  That was not right.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, I wholeheartedly commend what the Bill seeks to do.  Its purpose is to create a modern platform to put every child and his or her family circumstances on an equal footing and to get rid of the cultural stigma that was previously attached to families.  I hope it will create a gateway into the future whereby we will view families for who they are and accept that while they are all different, importantly, they have equal protection under the State.  As a secondary school teacher for 13 years I am all too familiar with the diverse families who presented in schools.  I have encountered teenagers who lived with their grandparents due to very tragic family circumstances, some who did not know one of their parents, and others who were living with a parent and his or her new partner.  Laws are only good if we reflect the people who live in society.  That is what the Bill seeks to do.<\/p>  <p>  I was very disappointed with the approach taken by some elements of the media, including those whom I hold in high regard.  I accept that they have bosses who pay their wages.  It is very disappointing that a Bill with 170 sections was described on the front page of one of the leading broadsheets as the gay adoption Bill, given that the vast majority of those who will benefit from the Bill are heterosexual families.  One of my colleagues mentioned this morning that 36% of children are currently born out of marriage, which is approximately one in three.  Currently, there are approximately 230 families involving same-sex couples.  It is very disappointing and misleading to give a title to a Bill which is much more far-reaching than its effect on gay and lesbian people, as if that was what the Bill was about.  There is a very important connection between the Bill and future events, but the Bill should not be seen in that way because it is about recognising families that were not previously allowed to exist under the law in this country and that were essentially airbrushed out of society.<\/p>  <p>  I thought I had more time, but as I do not, I will bring my contribution to a conclusion.  The ancient philosopher Aristotle developed a concept known as \"human flourishing\".  It subsequently became known by others through the centuries as \"the good life\".  Essentially, his concept was that every human being is good and decent in his or her own right, and in the right circumstances each person can thrive and reach his or her full potential.  He believed we should always ensure that the right environment is created in order for people to flourish or to lead the good life.  For far too long in society we have prevented people and sectors of society from leading the good life.  When we eventually create laws that allow every individual - be it through gender recognition, gay and lesbian rights or children who are raised by diverse or blended families, which is the term used today - to reach his or her full potential, society as a whole benefits.  If I am correct, when Martin Luther King marched on Washington he spoke about the white people who turned up at the march.  He said they were there not because of the lack of rights afforded to their black fellow citizens, but because, by not giving black citizens full rights, white citizens in America were denied access to a better society.  That comes back to the concept of human flourishing.  We create a two-tier society if we continue to allow people to live in the shadows of society.  The Bill is long overdue.  I commend the previous Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, the current Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the officials in the Department, as I am aware that the preparation of the legislation has been exceptionally tricky.<\/p><p>The real impact of this will be felt by the people we all know who are single parents, parents who have chosen not to get married, which they are entitled to do, children who live with their grandparents and same-sex loving couples who have children from a previous relationship.  They should all be entitled to equal protection under the law.  Families <i>de facto<\/i>are unusual.  If one asks two people living next door to each other about the traditional family, both of them will say that every family is a little bit diverse, even the one in the picture on the front of the brochure with two parents playing ball with two children on their summer holidays.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500029#BB00100","speaker":"1023","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424872500,"counter":448,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Thomas Pringle, who will share time the Deputies Paul Murphy and Seamus Healy.

We should look at human flourishing as a way of organising society, as it would be much better.  The family unit, as it was once known, has changed significantly and it is still changing.  In one generation, and in one family alone, the unit can go through several changes as it adjusts to different circumstances.  According to the 2011 CSO figures, one third of families do not belong to a traditional family unit, 186,284 single mothers care for their children and 29,031 lone fathers care for theirs.  The number of cohabiting couples with children amount to 60,269 people.  This means that more than 275,000 adults and children fall outside the traditional family unit.  Significantly, the Bill reflects this change and respects the many different definitions of family throughout Ireland, making them equal under the law.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the Bill improves equality in society.  It allows same-sex couples to adopt a child jointly, subject to the requirement that they be suitable adopters.  Nobody would have a problem with this.  The Bill sets out various provisions by which a wider circle of people will be able to apply for guardianship, custody of, or access to a child, including grandparents.  There are provisions in the Bill to support joint parenting after relationship breakdown, and mediation between estranged parents is encouraged to resolve disputes about their children.  Various provisions are set out with the aim of helping people to make parenting work.<\/p>  <p>  The law relating to child maintenance is amended so that all children will be treated equally, regardless of their circumstances of conception and birth, when child support or lump sum orders are made.  Most importantly, the Bill provides a new definition of the best interests of the child in Irish law, meaning that courts will have to consider the physical, emotional, psychological, educational and social needs of the child, including his or her need for stability having regard to age and stage of development.  The best interests of the child are indicated in Part V, which safeguards children's voices in the court system.  It takes into account the best interests of the child in all court proceedings and indicates a comprehensive list of what the courts must take into account when making a decision that could affect the child in question.  However, attention needs to be paid to the application of this Bill in the courts, and the court procedures need to be child-friendly.  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, the special rapporteur for children, suggested that, in tandem with this welcome legislative development, structural reform should also take place.  The establishment of a specific family court system was promised in the programme for Government and is a necessary development for a fair and effective forum to vindicate the rights of children and families.<\/p>  <p>  There are some provisions in the Bill which do not contribute to the development of a more equal society, and which foster a sense of inequality within the family structure itself.  This is regrettable, given that the Bill generally sets out to make family relationships more equal, no matter what type of family is involved.  At present, a father only has full guardianship rights if he co-signs a statutory declaration paper with the mother of the child in front of a peace commissioner, commissioner for oaths or solicitor.  This is despite the fact that the father may have signed the child's birth certificate.  The Bill improves this situation by automatically granting rights to fathers, but only if they have cohabited with the mother for 12 months in total, three months of which are after the baby is born.  Here the law presumes the father is guilty of not being responsible until he is proven innocent.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister stated that the 12-month provision was put into the Bill to give the father an opportunity to show responsibility through cohabitation.  There is a presumption that mothers have responsibility from the very start, which is unfair to fathers.  Many men show responsibility even without cohabiting.  Some couples parent a child without cohabiting for many reasons, such as housing issues or a requirement for a parent to work away from home.  Why should these fathers not have automatic rights to their children?  Some men can live with the mother of the child but demonstrate no responsibility, and we probably all know many of them.  There are also mothers who, for different reasons, are not responsible either.  The consequence of a father not being given automatic rights to the child means that if the mother is away and the child falls ill, the father cannot authorise medical treatment.  If the relationship breaks down and the partner decides to move abroad with the child, the father has little power to prevent this.  The father still has no automatic right to custody or access to the child by virtue of being the father.  By law, the mother is entitled to sole custody of the child if the father has not been made a guardian.<\/p>  <p>  The three-month rule, whereby the father must be living with the mother after the birth of the child for this length of time to quality for automatic rights, is controversial in cases where the mother is in difficulty after the birth of a child or the child is sick after being born.  The father cannot make decisions on behalf of the mother or for the child.  Many mothers are also concerned about this issue.  Expectant mothers who want to prepare effectively for the arrival of the child are anxious about the legal entitlement of the father in this situation.  If we granted fathers automatic rights at the time of registration of birth, these rights could then be challenged in court if a mother or the State is concerned about the welfare of the child.  We should have higher expectations of men in this country.  Other jurisdictions grant automatic rights to the father who signs a birth certificate, such as Northern Ireland, Britain, other European countries and Australia.<\/p>  <p>  Critically, there is no central registration system for the documents signed by fathers.  The signed document is not protected by a particular Department and is not logged or acknowledged.  The onus is on the father to retain the document and keep it safe in case he ever has to assert his rights and use it.  The loss of documents can be devastating for a father trying to prove guardianship.<\/p>  <p>  While the Bill focuses on the child's specific relationships in the family, we must take into account what Dr. Geoffrey Shannon stated: that the Bill should be taken in tandem with structural reform.  It is important to make the courts more accessible and child-friendly.  While the Bill recognises the changing structure of families and gives a legal definition with regard to the best interests of the child, there is an onus on the Government to look at the wider elements of its powers to ensure children are supported.  The Government must examine the maintenance of welfare supports, including supporting one-parent families even after the youngest child reaches the age of seven.  When measured against the Bill, this could have a potential negative impact on families.  We must also ensure that there are proper antenatal care services.  Services for pregnant women in Donegal are being withdrawn from outreach clinics.  This has an impact on family life and the equal treatment of families throughout the country.  We need to protect the lives of adults who look after children.  These are all wider societal issues.  If we are going to build a society which allows human flourishing we need to examine these systems also.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is very welcome.  It recognises that the concept of the family has changed and is fluid.  If we go back far enough, the traditional nuclear family was probably not what was envisaged for evolving animals.  There has been a change and we must recognise it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500030#CC00300","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1424872500,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I broadly welcome the thrust of the Bill.  It is about recognising the reality of family life as it exists today and as it has always existed, contrary to the propaganda and ideology.  The reality is more than one third of births in Ireland are outside marriage.  Three hundred thousand children live with lone mothers, 100,000 children live with unmarried cohabiting couples and more than 40,000 children live with lone fathers, while more than 200 same-sex couples have children.  The Bill states that these children should not be discriminated against because they are in non-marital families, and they have a right to a legal relationship with the people who play the role of parents in their lives.  They should not be discriminated against in this sense.  In particular, I welcome the provision whereby unmarried couples, be they heterosexual or homosexual, have the right to adopt children together and be parents together.<\/p><p>It is already clear from the debate that those on the religious right in this country are going to attempt to use this provision to try to whip up opposition to the referendum on same-sex marriage.  The only argument they have is to claim that people will lose their mother if these two things go through.  On this basis, they will try to stop a referendum which, I believe, the vast majority in society favour.<br\/><br\/>Those of us who support same-sex marriage and are opposed to discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people should consider how we respond to that argument.  We should be upfront about it and make the point that the overwhelming weight of the evidence suggests that two gay parents are as capable of being good, loving, caring parents as heterosexual couples.  We should defend absolutely the right and ability of gay couples to rear children.  There is no evidence to suggest any problems whatsoever with that.  To be honest, any belief that there is an issue is rooted, I believe, in a homophobic outlook which views this as problematic.  It is simply looking for problems in this situation.<br\/><br\/>I welcome in particular the commitment and centrality of children's interests and rights.  However, the Government must match this in terms of policy provision.  Separately, we have seen an explosion in child poverty.  A recent UNICEF report stated that child poverty rose from 10% to almost 30% between the years 2008 and 2012.  Similar figures have been produced by Barnardos.  We know that tens of thousands of parents will be cut off from the lone-parents allowance.  The Government can have a rhetorical and legal commitment to the rights of children but these must be matched by action and funding.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the provisions relating to assisted human reproduction.  However, the reality is that for vast swathes of society the option is simply beyond them.  It is very expensive and is not covered by the public health service.  At a minimum, one go at <i>in vitro<\/i>fertilisation costs approximately &euro;5,000, although in most cases the costs are significantly more.  In reality, these vast costs put the right of people to try for a family beyond many working class people, be they gay or straight.  As part of the process of recognising the rights of people, we should hold that all couples, including gay couples, should have the right to assisted human reproduction, provided free through a public health service.<br\/><br\/>Another point relates to making all of this real and the necessity of legal and financial resources behind the legislation.  This is complicated and rather court-focused legislation.  It could result in a significant increase in court cases.  The reality now is that there is a year-long waiting list for people to get access to free legal aid for family law cases and a significant backlog of family law cases in the District Court.  If these rights are to be accessible to people, we need investment in resources in legal aid, including the expansion of legal aid in order that people can get access to the type of expertise that, at the moment, is mostly not available to people availing of legal aid.  We also need assistance for low-income families who do not qualify for legal aid.<br\/><br\/>I support the calls for reform in two areas from the Children's Rights Alliance.  The alliance has called for a central register for statutory declarations for joint guardianship because, at the moment, the situation is similar to that of wills in that they can be lost and there is no central repository.  The alliance has also called for the establishment of a comprehensive court welfare service to support the roll-out of this legislation.  This must be backed by the resources necessary to give people access to the rights legally given through this Bill.<br\/><br\/>There are further particular legal points and questions.  None of the provisions will come into force until a ministerial order is commenced.  This is rather unusual.  Will the Minister explain why this is the case?  Is it because the Government or the State will not have the resources to implement it?  Is it for political reasons?<br\/><br\/>Reference has been made to recognition of the father and the 12 months requirement.  I do not imagine it was the Government's intention but, as it is currently drafted, the provision seems to have retrospective impact.  This could be seriously complicating and could create a minefield.  I presume that is not the Government's intention.  Clarity could be provided, perhaps with the introduction of amendments.  There are other related difficulties not covered in the Bill in terms of where the burden of proof lies in the case of a conflict between a mother and a father.  What kind of evidence can be deduced to back up a claim that someone has been cohabiting for a period of 12 months?<br\/><br\/>Section 51 allows for applications for access by a relative of a child.  It was previously the case that a relative had to have leave of the court to make an application.  As it currently stands in the Bill, this has been withdrawn.  Why is that the case?  This could potentially create complicated situations whereby estranged relatives could apply for access without having leave from either the courts or the parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500030#CC00400","speaker":"1197","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424873100,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I broadly welcome the Children and Family Relationships Bill.  It is a positive contribution to the law in this area.  It updates and improves the legislation.  I suppose it reflects the changes in society over the years and takes account of the many different family types currently in existence.  Some areas within the Bill could be improved or amended and I will refer to those shortly.<\/p>  <p>  This is probably the most significant change in guardianship legislation since the 1960s.  At that time, approximately 3% of children were born to unmarried women.  Given the situation in 2014, when over one third or 36.1% of children were born to unmarried women, this represents a significant change.  Obviously the structure of Irish family life changed significantly between the 1960s and today.  The Bill recognises that reality and the diverse types of family involved.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, approximately 24,000 children are born every year in circumstances where the father has no legal relationship with the child.  This is not acceptable and needs to be changed.  The 2011 census painted a picture of the significant changes that have taken place in society over the years.  The figures include approximately 308,000 children living with 186,000 lone mothers, 104,000 children living with 60,000 unmarried cohabiting couples, 43,800 children living with 29,000 lone fathers and 230 same-sex couples with children.  Of course we have no idea how many children are being cared for by grandparents and other family members.  The figures are simply not available but we all know the number is considerable.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill represents an important reform of child and family law and puts children at the heart of family law.  It addresses various issues, including guardianship, custody, access, maintenance, adoption and parentage.  The Bill will provide legal clarity around various family types and addresses the discrimination faced by children in non-marital families.  I hope it will significantly reduce the number of cases that go to court due to the current legal vacuum.<\/p><p>The whole question of the definition of the best interests of the child is particularly significant and this is the first legislation which defines that interest.  There is the whole question of the participation of children in judicial decision making and having the voice of the child heard is particularly important.<\/p> <p> The Bill may not go far enough, however, and is still discretionary, so perhaps it needs to be changed.  Professor Ursula Kilkelly of the UCC Law School has indicated that such discretion should be changed to make this mandatory.  There are a number of other amendments which I believe are necessary, many of which have been referred to already.  In particular, there is the question of a central registrar for statutory declarations for joint guardianship, the question of a comprehensive court welfare service and its funding and resourcing to ensure that all families, irrespective of means, will be able to avail of those services and, again, the question of joint guardianship for unmarried fathers.  Of course, the Law Reform Commission as long ago as 1982 and again in 2010 said that non-marital fathers should have automatic joint guardianship, so that is another aspect of the Bill that may require amendment.<\/p> <p> Generally, I welcome the Bill.  It is a positive contribution to the law in this area and reflects the current societal situation and the changes that have taken place in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500031#DD00200","speaker":"960","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424873700,"counter":454,"content":"<p>This is an important reforming legislation and as T&aacute;naiste and leader of the Labour Party I have no hesitation in commending it to the House.  As an independent State, our record in Ireland in dealing with children and in using the law to protect and enhance the lives and the rights of children has been patchy at best.  There have been important pieces of progressive legislation, such as the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 or the succession provisions of the Succession Act 1965, which imposed an obligation on parents to have regard to the needs of their children when drafting a will.  However, there were many dark moments and, indeed, dark decades too, when the State wilfully ignored the rights of children and often connived with others, most frequently religious orders, to deal with what were regarded as &ldquo;problem children&rdquo; in ways that most of us in this House would regard as unacceptable at best.<\/p>  <p>  Until 1952, adoption was illegal in Ireland.  Instead, we had an informal system of adoption or fostering which operated outside the law.  Extra-marital children were often regarded as a problem, something to be swept under the carpet.  Even as the law changed in the 1960s and 1970s, social attitudes were slow in changing.  It was only in the 1970s that the then Government, and my predecessor as Labour leader, Frank Cluskey, put in place support for single parents and their children in the form of what was then called the unmarried mother&rsquo;s allowance.<\/p>  <p>  There is one consistent thread which runs throughout society&rsquo;s view of families and children over this period, and it is a view which is still much in evidence today.  It is denial.  We so wanted everybody to be living in happy nuclear families that we were very slow to see that many people were not living in \"traditional families\" at all.  As a result, we ignored the family arrangements of hundreds of thousands of our citizens and left countless children in a sort of legal limbo.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of my own experience, I was adopted formally in the 1950s, so I had birth parents.  As a baby, I had several sets of foster parents.  I was then adopted by my adoptive parents, Bridie and John.  When my mum died and my father remarried, I had a stepmother.  I had various aunts and uncles who, after my mother died, as they were all single, helped to look after myself and my brother.  That is just one story.<\/p>  <p>  While some people suggest they are in some way fearful of this legislation, I do not think they see life's rich tapestry or that not everybody fits into one single structure, as some people undoubtedly would like in order to give certainty to what they see as being the most desirable.  At the end of the day, it has always been my conviction that what matters is that the child has people - the parents primarily - who nurture them, love them, care for them and commit to them.  That is what really matters in the end for any child.<\/p>  <p>  When we look at the conservative definition of the family in the Constitution, we can argue it made it difficult for the Oireachtas to act.  However, since the people passed the children&rsquo;s amendment to the Constitution in 2012, that argument is no longer available, if it ever was.  It is now time for us to open our eyes to what is really happening in our society.  The traditional family of one man married to one woman, having children without any need for medical intervention prior to conception, is the norm for most people, and we know that.  While it will never be what happens for everybody, which is one of the things we must acknowledge in the discussion around this legislation, it is obviously the preferred option for many people.  That is a choice to which they are entitled, but it is not everybody&rsquo;s choice.  Some will choose to bring up children as single parents, some will choose to cohabit and not to marry and some will have children with more than one partner.  Some people find their life partner, get married and 60 years later they are celebrating a long, successful and happy marriage with children and grandchildren.  We need to look at the circumstances, which can be dictated by the vagaries of life, such as illness, the death of a partner, estrangement, divorce or infertility.<\/p>  <p>  In a small number of cases, the law intervenes to stop people living the lives they would like to live.  Gay couples cannot adopt, nor can unmarried heterosexual couples.  However, it is unusual for the law to prohibit people from doing things.  I remember a conversation I had with a doctor years ago.  He was well off and his wife also had a job, but as one of them was a Catholic and one a Protestant, they could not adopt, much and all as they loved children and desired to do it.  We need to be conscious of where we have come from and how our society has evolved.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the State is to ensure that, whatever choices adults may make, the rights and well-being of their children are protected and improved, and the children are brought up in an environment of love, support and nurturing.  However, the current position is that some children live in something of a legal limbo: take the child whose father has died and whose mother is now living with another partner; the child of a gay mother who is now living with her gay partner; the child who is being looked after by her grandparents because her parents cannot cope; or a child born as a result of donor-assisted human reproduction.<\/p>  <p>  In fairness, we have made some progress on some of these issues in recent years, but not enough.  This Bill represents the first real effort in decades to deal with all of these related issues in a comprehensive way.  As of today, the only adults who have automatic rights in regard to children are the natural mother and her husband, if he is the father of the child.  It is important to say that this will remain the case if and when the Oireachtas passes this legislation, with one important exception which I will come to later.  It is true that a variety of other people such as those I described earlier &ndash; grandparents, step-parents, gay partners and unmarried couples &ndash; will have the right to apply for adoption, guardianship or custody.  However, and this is important, in each and every instance they will have to make the case in court that this is in the best interests of the child.<\/p><p>A judge will be required to grant or refuse an application with the best interests of the child at the centre of the decision-making process.  In fact, this is the first Bill that has attempted to define the concept of the best interests of the child and it does so in quite some detail.<br\/><br\/>The Bill sets out several dozen questions, criteria and circumstances which should be taken into account when a decision is being made on the future of a child.  These criteria include a requirement to gauge the views and preferences of the child, something I very much welcome.  There is absolutely no question of unsuitable people getting automatic rights in regard to children.  We have broadened the scope for people acting <i>in loco parentis<\/i>to apply for adoption, custody or guardianship and we have made it easier for them to make such an application.  Any application must be decided by a judge and she or he must make the decision in the best interests of the child.  This principle, namely, that the interests of the child are paramount, is at the centre of our law on children, and this Bill reinforces and strengthens it by spelling out in plain English and in great detail what this means. <br\/><br\/>The exception to which I referred earlier concerns the rights of unmarried fathers.  Until now, unmarried fathers were obliged to apply to a court to assert any right to guardianship of their children.  This will no longer be necessary, provided the father has cohabited with the mother for at least one year.  This is a difficult issue.  Some unmarried fathers have argued that they should have equal rights with the mother, but as a matter of fact, however uncomfortable it may be, some unmarried fathers do not commit in terms of interest in their children and often lose contact with the mother before the child is born.<br\/><br\/>The Government is settled on the view that any unmarried father who is acting <i>in loco parentis<\/i>at the time the child is born and for a period after that should be entitled to act as guardian to the child without the need for an application to court.  Those who are not part of the child's life at that stage will have to apply to court at a later stage if they want to act as guardian.  In all the circumstances, this is a fair balance.  I know many men who have had a child in a non-marital relationship and who love the child to bits.  The most difficult issue is their estrangement or removal from the child because the relationship, which may have started with great hope and love, has withered.  This redresses a balance which has long been missing in our legislation.  <br\/><br\/>Another important area addressed in the Bill is donor-assisted human reproduction and IVF, which I welcome.  This is a difficult and sensitive area of legislation, but I welcome the fact that, as a Legislature, we are now addressing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500032#EE00200","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424874300,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Before the T&aacute;naiste spoke, I should have alluded to the fact that she is sharing time with Deputies Kenny and Costello.

It is perhaps the most important and far-reaching Bill to come before the House during the lifetime of the Government.  It is a large Bill and I can only refer to a small amount of it in the time available to me.  The Children and Family Relationships Bill 2015 represents the most important reform of child and family law for a generation.  It seeks to put children at the heart of family law, to provide legal clarity on various family types and address the discrimination faced by children in non-marital families.<\/p>  <p>  The Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I am a member, was invited to review and consider the proposed legislation and report back to the Minister with any observations arising from the consultation process.  The committee held a public consultation and its report was published in May 2014.  I was glad to be able to participate in this valuable process.  It is hoped that the Bill will significantly reduce the number of cases going to court due to the current legal vacuum.  The Bill addresses key issues related to guardianship, custody, access, maintenance, adoption, parentage, assisted human reproduction and surrogacy.  <\/p>  <p>  The Bill will amend a number of existing pieces of legislation, including the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, which will be repealed in its entirety.  The Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976, the Status of Children Act 1987, the Family Law Act 1995 and the Adoption Act 2010 will also be addressed.  The Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 will also be amended.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will see further implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in Ireland by protecting the child's right to family life and protecting the children of unmarried parents from discrimination based on their parents' marital status.  The best interests of the child will be of paramount consideration in decisions involving guardianship, custody and access, and children will be provided with the right to have their voices heard as part of the best interests determination in guardianship, custody and access cases.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Constitution places great importance on the family, defining it as \"the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society\".  However, the courts have narrowly interpreted the constitutional family as only including marital families.  Cohabiting couples, civil partners, lone parents, unmarried fathers and grandparents are all excluded from this definition.  An increasing number of children are being cared for in non-marital settings.  For example, one in four children live with a lone mother and almost one in ten live with unmarried cohabiting couples.  However, the law does not provide for the recognition of the unmarried parents' relationship with the child.  This can have an impact on matters that are part of the day-to-day parenting role, such as giving consent to medical treatment or granting permission for a school trip.  This lack of legal clarity can be particularly detrimental to a child in the context of a marital breakdown.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to speak briefly about my experience.  My father died when I was two and a half years old.  I had a younger sister and my mother became a widow.  Having grown up in a one-parent family gives me some insight into the experience of lone parents.  <\/p>  <p>  The Bill aims to provide greater legal certainty and recognition of the relationship between the child and the person or persons responsible for his or her everyday care and upbringing.  The explicit focus on the best interests of the child is extremely welcome.  However, I have concerns about how the courts can be systematically and professionally resourced with the relevant background information to determine the best interests of the child.  I have heard too many stories of our courts being under-resourced with the relevant information, in particular when parents are not in co-operation or agreement about plans for the child's care.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions of the Bill on family violence and domestic abuse are welcome.  I strongly urge courts to examine all issues relating to a family in the round, preferably in one sitting by the same judge, to ensure consistency and that decisions are made in the best interests of the child.  Family violence is not limited to physical harm, sexual abuse or fearing for one's safety.  This must also be taken into account. <\/p>  <p>  I am very proud to support this pioneering, modernising and overdue Bill.  I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500033#FF00300","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1424874300,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the Children and Family Relationships Bill.  It is, as she said, a very far-reaching Bill which puts children at the very heart of Irish family law.  It is about time that happened.  It reflects the reality of life in Ireland today.  In the past there was a belief in an idealised version of the family.  In reality, even if on the outside a family appears to be traditional and perfect, made up of a mother, father and children, every family has its difficulties, problems and foibles.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been a very cold place for the non-traditional family relationship.<\/p><p>We have been dealing with much of the fallout from that perception of what a family was and how it should be dealt with in society.  We have had to deal with the Magdalen laundry cases and the women who were pretty much incarcerated there.  We have had to deal with children in industrial schools, reformatories and orphanages.  All of that has been part and parcel of what we have been doing during this Government's term and in those of previous Governments.  It has taken a very long time for us to come to grips with and address the wrongs we have visited upon children over the years and the manner in which society has treated children with regard to the family relationship.<\/p> <p> It is about time we put children first and, in doing so, we should recognise the centrality of children in the family relationship, no matter what the nature of the relationship.  We must define the new parameters of that relationship in a legal context as we cannot leave such issues to the courts all the time.  This must take in the matters of responsibility, guardianship, protective orders, affidavits for access to children and the pantheon of issues that can cause enormous difficulties in the court and in family scenarios that should be simpler, more comforting, certain and more receptive to the needs of children.<\/p> <p> I compliment the Minister on the work she has done in this respect and the previous Minister, Deputy Shatter, who took this matter very seriously and began the initial work for the Bill that the Minister has built on so strongly.  The majority of children live in marital-based families with biological parents, but that is not the reality for a large number of children who live with other family types.  The 2011 census indicates that more than 215,000 families were headed by lone parents and the number of children living in cohabiting households increased by 41% between 2006 and 2011.  These are quite stark figures which indicate a move from the traditional family relationship that would have been recognised very much in the Constitution and would have been perceived in previous decades to have been the norm.  It is the norm today but it must be recognised that other relationships are not by any means an exception, as they are quite common as well.<\/p> <p> I can see it in my constituency of Dublin Central, in Cabra and the north inner city.  In many cases there, almost half of families are headed by a lone parent, and there are also many households where a grandparent is the main carer.  The 2011 census indicates that there are areas in Dublin Central with no traditional households consisting of a husband, wife and child at all.  This development has occurred over decades and it is high time we recognised it and incorporated it in legislation to give certainty to the children who need support.<\/p> <p> It is clear that a significant number of children are living in households other than those headed by married parents and it is most welcome that the Bill will tackle some of the complex issues around parentage, guardianship, custody and access across a range of family positions that are not addressed adequately in current law.  This Bill reflects the diverse family types in which people live and updates the current legislation in respect of who, other than a child's parents, can apply for guardianship in respect of a child.  The area of assisted human reproduction and donor-conceived children must be clarified in order that we do not have to deal with such issues in the courts on an ongoing or piecemeal basis when there is no direction in law.  It is high time that clear legislation was put in place in this respect.<\/p> <p> This will also enable a wider range of unmarried fathers automatically to become guardians of their children and it is important that we support unmarried fathers who want to be involved in the care of their children.  There is, of course, an increasing number of fathers who wish to be involved and are more than willing to build the relationship.<\/p> <p> My final point concerns grandparents, whose role has been completely unrecognised.  I remember during the divorce referendum campaign holding a meeting at Barry's Hotel with Mr. Mervyn Taylor and there was a row of seven elderly women there.  They were part of an organisation called \"GPO\".  I had never heard of this and thought it referred to the GPO down the street.  The name referred to \"grandparents obliterated\" and these women were concerned that with the advent of divorce proceedings, grandparents might end up with no access to children.  I am glad this Bill will consider the role of grandparents in the lives of children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500033#FF00400","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424874900,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Deputy Naughten is sharing time with Deputy Timmins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500034#GG00200","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1424874900,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  I also acknowledge that the Minister is present to hear the debate, which is important.  This is important and far-reaching legislation which is long overdue.  Nevertheless, I have concerns that we are rushing the legislation.  It is a complex Bill and some of its unintended implications have not been thought through.  I am afraid we may have to revisit this with amending legislation because of unintended consequences arising from us rushing this.  The Bill was published last week, for example, and we are dealing with Second Stage today.  It is an extremely complex Bill that is amending other primary legislation, which makes it very difficult for anybody, even those with parliamentary skills, to read the legislation.  I will return to this later.  With the issue of guardianship, for example, it would have been far better to repeal current law and incorporate all the provisions of guardianship into this legislation.  We could then have had one clear and distinct piece of legislation dealing with the issue of guardianship rather than having amending legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I grew up in a typical family and I am raising my own children in a typical family.  There are many other types of family, including those with single parents and widows and those involving same-sex marriage or adopted children.  Approximately one in three births in this country is registered outside marriage, with approximately a quarter of children in the country outside the typical definition of the family as interpreted by the Supreme Court.  These families and the children involved attend our local cr&egrave;ches and sit beside my children in their school and every other school in the country.  It is wrong that they have been ignored, pretty much across the board, under legislation as it stands.  This Bill is long overdue but it will give children the type of protection and rights they deserve and should have had for a long time in this country.  It is important that we acknowledge the practical reality of family life in Ireland today and this legislation catches up with that reality.<\/p>  <p>  A child needs a parent or parents who love him or her and who are prepared to care for that child properly.  That has to be the primary objective behind legislation such as this, and it must ensure that it can protect those types of parents.  I was very taken by a story I heard here before Christmas.  A young man called Stephen met his current wife in 2010 and the couple subsequently married.  She had a son from a previous relationship and Stephen had never been married prior to that.  He did something very unusual in that he took his wife's name after getting married.  That surprised me but one can understand the logic, as this would guarantee that all his children would have the same surname.<\/p><p>There are not many people who think that far ahead, but he did.<\/p> <p> The biological father of his son has been involved to a certain extent with the boy.  Stephen and his wife have encouraged that and sought to develop it.  However, the biological father never showed any interest in gaining guardianship of his son.  Everything appeared to be going well until Stephen and his wife broached the possibility of Stephen adopting their son.  The biological father immediately objected, believing it would infringe and undermine his rights and his access to his son.  Stephen subsequently had two other children, a boy and a girl.  He is in the unenviable situation that if some of them are involved in a medical emergency or an accident, he can make decisions for his wife and for two of his three children, but he cannot do so for the first son due to the law as it stands.  This legislation will enshrine in law the basic rights Stephen will have in respect of all of his children, and all of them will be treated equally.  All of them have the same surname.  He ensured that in a particular and determined way and I am glad this legislation is catching up with Stephen's forward thinking at the time he got married.<\/p> <p> We must look at all of these cases from a child's perspective, not just the legislative perspective.  A child grows up in a family unit.  To them, it is their family and their home.  However, everything is turned on its head when something happens with regard to the child's legal guardian.  It is interesting to recall the case of baby Ann that came before the Supreme Court some time ago.  The two year old baby girl was returned to the custody of her birth mother following the decision of the Supreme Court.  The mother was unmarried at the time the original adoption papers were signed.  She later married the father of the baby and withdrew her consent.  That two year old baby was taken from what she understood to be her parents.  It must have been heart wrenching for all of the people involved, both the birth mother and the adoptive parents, to see the two year old girl being taken from what she perceived to be her home.  I happen to have a two year old daughter.  To contemplate that she would be taken from our home and moved somewhere else would not sit well with anybody.  However, that is the law at present.<\/p> <p> The legislation is in place since the 1960s and is completely outdated.  The most significant element of this legislation is not those legal aspects but, more importantly, that it enshrines the principle of the best interests of the child.  That must be sacrosanct in both this legislation and any other legislation brought before the House in future.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, for bringing that through in the children's referendum and enshrining it in our Constitution.  It is paramount in respect of decisions on guardianship, custody and access, which is what this legislation provides for.  The current law is seriously lacking in that area.<\/p> <p> It is also relevant to other issues, including cases we have discussed previously in the House such as the Kelly Fitzgerald case.  The report on the death of Kelly Fitzgerald raised the issue of the lack of consideration of the views of the child, which were not taken into account at that time.  Those same issues were raised again in the Roscommon neglect case, where the views of the child were not taken into account.  In those two cases there was a family, as defined and interpreted by the Supreme Court, involved.  I have no doubt that if the issues in those two specific cases had arisen outside of that clear definition, the authorities would have taken a very different approach at the time.  We must put the focus back on children.<\/p> <p> It is also important that children have the right of access to their father.  This is where the legislation is weak and must be strengthened.  Fathers will not have rights to guardianship unless they have been cohabiting with the mother for 12 months, with a minimum of three months after the birth of the baby.  In other jurisdictions such as Northern Ireland, Britain, other European countries and Australia unmarried fathers have an automatic right to guardianship when they jointly register the birth with the mother.  This legislation must be amended in that regard.  The vast majority of parents and, indeed, of professionals believe that once the father's name is on the birth certificate, it automatically confers on him rights in respect of guardianship.  That is not the case.  Whether it is consent for medical treatment or something as simple as permission for school trips, guardianship is not automatically enshrined on foot of having one's name on the birth certificate.<\/p> <p> Deputy Stanton argued last night that one could not give automatic rights to the birth father because of matters such as domestic violence and rape.  However, these matters also arise in other family types, not just in one parent and unmarried families.  A more practical approach has been taken by the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act that was passed by the House last year.  Under that Act it is compulsory to have the father's name on the birth certificate, except where the father cannot be traced or it poses a risk to the mother to make contact with the father.  It should be the case that a father would have automatic rights to guardianship, except in particular circumstances where there are issues with domestic violence or rape.  Such rights should be automatic and let the courts stop somebody who should not have such guardianship, rather than a father being forced to go before the courts to secure the right to guardianship.<\/p> <p> As I said earlier, the Minister should have repealed the Guardianship of Infants Act and introduced new primary legislation.  The Guardianship of Infants Act has been amended on two occasions prior to this and there are significant amendments to it in this legislation.  That will cause more confusion.  It will make the information less, rather than more, accessible.  I believe the original intention was to repeal that Act, and it should be repealed during the passage of this legislation.<\/p> <p> Another issue has arisen in respect of guardianship.  There is a need to have the joint guardianship declaration that is signed by both parties registered and recorded on an official database which is accessible to those who require that information.  One cannot expect a father to carry his guardianship declaration with him 24\/7 in case one of his children is caught in an emergency and the mother is not available to deal with it at the time.<\/p><p>A national database needs to be put in place.  Legislation to establish a national register of wills was proposed by my colleague, Senator Terry Leyden, in the Seanad a number of years ago.  It is surely not too difficult to use the expertise and skills available in the General Register Office in County Roscommon to put this register in place.<\/p> <p> Part 6 of the Bill amends the law on maintenance of spouses and children.  This area also needs to be re-examined.  Fathers should have an automatic right to guardianship except in particular circumstances, that is, where it is not in the best interests of the child.  Fathers also have a responsibility to maintain their children.  A contribution relative to their capacity to earn or to their income, no matter how small, should be made by all parents.  I questioned the T&aacute;naiste on the figures on maintenance recovery within her Department.  The figures were interesting.  Last year, the Department examined more than 8,000 cases and of those, it determined some 2,500 relatives were liable to make a maintenance payment.  Only 54% of them did.  We need to be far more active in ensuring the recovery of maintenance and in ensuring that fathers are responsible and provide maintenance for their own children.  <\/p> <p> We need to properly resource the courts system.  I welcome the introduction of penalties where access is denied to the other parent.  We also need to look at the issue of maintenance and how we can ensure proper maintenance is provided.  This legislation is positive and is a welcome development.  It does, however, need to be strengthened before it is enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500034#GG00300","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424876100,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Naughten for giving me three minutes of his time.  Having sat in this House listening to him, I am sure he could have spoken for another three hours, let alone three minutes.  This brings me to the kernel of the point I wish to make on this legislation.  I was not going to speak until tomorrow but, due to work pressures, I may not be able to do so then.  Normally when people speak on legislation in this House, they have a good knowledge of the area.  However, there is very little expertise in this House with respect to this Bill.  I do not doubt that the legislation seeks to create a framework for the complexities and changes in the family unit and to ensure certainty, security and equality in that family unit.  The Bill was published last Thursday.  It is some 100 pages long and has 172 sections.  It would, in its own right, fill a module in a third level course.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister consider having Committee Stage held in this Chamber rather than in the committee rooms?  The kernel of this legislation will arise from various amendments put forward or proposals made.  While the legislation seeks to put a framework on the complexities which exist at the moment, legislation can also facilitate, enhance, increase or stymie social changes.  This may or may not be good for society.  Just before I came into the Chamber, I saw that I had received an e-mail from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on the issue of donor assisted human reproduction, DAHR.  The institute may have had a legitimate point.  I do not know.  It expressed concern, however, about a submission it made during the pre-legislative scrutiny period last November.  It urged that certain issues should be taken on board.  I do not know the merits or otherwise of the arguments it made.  However, it is important that we take our time with this legislation.  It is too important to rush.  As politicians in this House, many of us have become cowards.  We are a house of cowards because we do not deal with the issues.  In the past, we were in the shadow of the church.  People may have been afraid to say certain things.  Now we have the commentariat and we appear not to have the courage of our convictions.  <\/p>  <p>  I may be quite supportive of everything in this legislation.  From a glance, I am in support of most of it.  However, I would like an opportunity to go through it in detail to ensure, if I am supporting it, that it is for the common good and the security of the child and the family unit.  I do not doubt that every politician in this House wants to make things better for society.  We should, therefore, not be afraid to come into this House and to articulate various views.  I lost the Fine Gael Whip over a social issue.  I am now in the Reform Alliance group.  One day I heard a renowned commentator say that we must be against same-sex marriage because we follow the teachings of the Catholic Church on the abortion issue.  This is complete and utter rubbish.  We should not allow things such as this to stymie us if we have concerns or if we want to give approval to things. <\/p>  <p>  I commend the Minister on bringing forward the legislation. I do not envy anyone the task of having to sit down and put this together.  It is very complex.  There are many views in this area.  It is important, however, that we get it right.  We should come into this House as mature politicians, irrespective of who is banging on our door or otherwise - I would like to say that no one is banging on my door - and go through the minutiae of it on Committee Stage in this Chamber.  We should not do it down in the dungeon in the hope that it will not cut across the marriage equality referendum.  This legislation has to be taken on its own merits and dealt with separately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500036#JJ00200","speaker":"1184"},{"type":"speech","time":1424876100,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that this Bill is in this House and that it is being progressed through the Chamber.  It is to be hoped that it will be enacted as soon as is possible.  I accept and endorse what other Deputies have said, which is that it is important that the legislation is not enacted with undue haste.  I am, of course, very familiar with the provisions of the Bill.  It was some considerable time ago when I, in a personal capacity, commenced drafting this legislation.  I was determined that this area, which had been ignored for far too long, would be fully addressed.  There was a need to update and modernise our laws on guardianship, custody of and access to children, parentage, using DNA fingerprinting to assess parentage and a whole range of other issues, including dealing with an area that had for too long been ignored, namely, assisted reproduction and surrogacy.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill has gone through various phases.  I drafted it as a Bill but discovered as Minister that the Attorney General's office would be very unhappy to be provided with a Bill.  The very good and professional officials within the Department of Justice and Equality then turned it back into heads of a Bill and annotated it.  I wish to mention, in particular, Conan McKenna, Carol Baxter and Dara Breathnach----- <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500036#JJ00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1424876100,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500036#JJ00400","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1424876100,"counter":467,"content":"<p>-----in the Department of Justice and Equality, without whose support, enthusiasm, commitment and expertise the heads of the Bill which were published on 31 January 2014 would not have been published.  They did sterling work when confronted by a Minister who furnished them with a draft Bill.  They went on a global tour of various jurisdictions, both within Europe and outside, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States and examined their legislation with a view to identifying the best legal architecture to address the various issues with which the Bill deals.<\/p>  <p>  There is much in the Bill about which I am enthusiastic and fully support.  The central issue in all of this is the best interests of children.  One of the central tenets in the drafting of this legislation when I was Minister was to ensure that the terminology and the rights of children contained in the constitutional amendment which was accepted by the people were reflected in the philosophy and wording of the legislation.<\/p><p>There are differences, however, between the Bill as now published and the scheme of the Bill or draft Bill published in January 2014.  It was always anticipated that there would be differences.  The Bill published initially was published for a consultative process, and it was subject to this process for many months.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality held hearings.  I am familiar with many of the submissions on the Bill received up to my time as Minister and with those seen by members of the committee.<\/p> <p> I want to be unequivocal in welcoming the fact that the Bill is before the House.  However, I have some concerns over the manner in which it has evolved, how some issues that should be included in it are now not covered and about the turnaround in the architecture, which has no doubt resulted from the engagement of the Office of the Attorney General.  I agree with other speakers that the legislation originally drafted envisaged that the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 would be replaced and that all the law relating to guardianship and custody of, and access to, children would be contained in this Bill.  The Bill is unnecessarily complex.  The 1964 Act, amended not just by this Bill but in other legislation, is being left in place.  For the life of me, I do not understand why we are retaining in law arcane provisions incorporated into the 1964 Act by the Houses of the Oireachtas that simply reflect provisions that were in the Guardianship of Infants Act 1886, enacted by the UK Parliament, and that have long since ceased to have any relevance in this Parliament.<\/p> <p> I am also concerned about the update of what are known as the presumptions.  We have presumptions of paternity in our law.  I changed those in the draft legislation to presumptions of parentage, and they had a number of purposes.  There is no unique way of reforming legislation.  There are always alternative ways of achieving the same outcome.  However, by removing the new parentage presumptions, it seems a situation is being created whereby all parents or couples in this State who conceived and had children born as a result of assisted reproduction by donor prior to the enactment of this legislation would, in order to secure their parentage rights, be required to make a court application.  That is my reading of the Bill but I am open to correction on that.  As originally framed, the legislation created certain presumptions.  It certainly allowed for a court application where a dispute as to parentage arose.  Where there is no dispute, the presumptions would have applied and the formula adopted was one that had worked successfully in a series of other common law jurisdictions.  It was not unique; it was looking at what had worked in practice elsewhere.<\/p> <p> I want to say something in particular about the area of assisted reproduction.  The legislation is essentially concerned with assisted reproduction provisions where there is third-party donation.  I refer to where an embryo is created by a couple's sperm and ova but where they need the assistance of what I would describe as assisted reproduction.  The Bill does not appear to address the particular circumstances where the reproductive material derives from the couple themselves, the husband and wife or the cohabiting couple.  It is confined to dealing with assisted reproduction by donor.  Indeed, there are 36 sections in the Bill dealing with assisted reproduction and many of them comprise a very important step forward.  I welcome many of them.  I would be interested in knowing, in relation to the issue of the register that is to be established, what research has been done that will ensure there will not be a future difficulty for couples who wish to use assisted reproductive methods to have children in accessing, for example, sperm or ova by donor.  A substantial portion of the sperm used in Ireland is imported from Denmark, for some reason.  What engagement has there been with fertility clinics?  This was an important issue.  I know all the reasons we should have a register.  I envisaged when this legislation was being prepared that this issue would be dealt with by the Minister for Health.  During the lead-in to the publication of the heads of the Bill in January last, it was the intention.  It was intended that many of the medical issues relating to assisted reproduction and surrogacy would be dealt with by the Minister for Health or Department of Health and Children and that the parentage issues would be dealt with by the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p> <p> Regarding the way in which the legislation has evolved, I found some of the public comment and today's press release by the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, very confusing.  He seems to be telling the media, who do not have the time to examine the detail of a Bill of this size, that assisted reproduction will be dealt with solely in his legislation when there are 36 sections in this Bill dealing with assisted reproduction.  It is right that this Bill deals with assisted reproduction with regard to the issue of identifying parents dealing with issues of how one establishes relationships within a family.  All these are extremely important matters.  For some reason, however, the subject seems to have become very unnecessarily confused.  It seems the only area of parentage related to assisted reproduction that is excluded from the Bill is that of surrogacy.  We deal with assisted reproduction by donor with regard to couples, with regard to women residing together, and with regard to single women who use a sperm donor to become pregnant.  However, what we exclude from the Bill are heterosexual couples, married or not, who commission a surrogate to give birth to a child.  We exclude from the Bill gay men who may wish to have children through surrogacy.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge these issues can be controversial.  The issue of surrogacy caused a shudder within the echelons of some advisers behind the scenes when I produced the Bill for publication in January last.  Indeed, it took some weeks before I could get it through the Cabinet.  I predicted that there would be no major outcry or difficulty.  There was none and what was in that Bill was widely welcomed.<\/p> <p> I have a series of concerns.  First, it is in the best interests of children that we address all these issues in relation to parentage.  It is entirely wrong that there is a small group of children now in this State or who may be conceived in coming months through surrogacy who will in effect have their relationship to the people who are parenting them daily undetailed and unspecified, such that they will be left in some sort of legal limbo where the surrogate who gave birth and agreed she would not act as a parent to child will maintain a legal relationship as mother, and the person who is actually acting as mother, who may have donated her ova for the conception of the child, will be excluded from being the mother.  I do not understand why this is not covered in the Bill and I am enormously confused by much of what the Minister for Health is saying.  Today, he was asked why these issues have not been addressed and he said he did not know why it has taken so long, that it might not have been prioritised and there might have been a fear of controversy.  I do not know whether that was a sideswipe at the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, but I do not know of any controversy that arose out of the January legislation.<\/p> <p> The Minister stated on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning, echoing to some degree what he said in an interview on \"Prime Time\" a few days ago, that all this was very complicated but that he now had permission to draft heads of a Bill.  He said we may see these sometime next autumn and that there is little chance legislation will be enacted this side of the general election.  He said he would provide for a legal mechanism to transfer parentage with a simple court procedure and that detailed consents would be required at all stages.  He stated the welfare of the child would be paramount, that there would be no commercial surrogacy and that the birth certificate would name the birth mother until parentage transfer.  He stated commercial surrogacy would be outlawed, that there would be age limitations in the area and that, if somebody entered into a surrogacy contract, they could not be forced to transfer the child if they did not wish to do so.<\/p> <p> What I found very curious was that although the Minister has commenced a consultative process, all the issues he says will be dealt with in the heads of the Bill he hopes to publish next autumn were dealt with in the heads of the Bill I published last January, which have gone through a 12 month consultative process and on which the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality reported.  I do not understand this.<\/p><p>There are many other issues that the Minister for Health has said he will address, and I agree with him that they should be addressed.  They fall uniquely within the health brief.  They are not concerned with determining the legal relationship between parents and children.  They are not concerned directly with legal contracts or with court procedures.  There is a range of other issues that should be dealt with and, indeed, it was my understanding that those issues would be developed during the preceding 12 months.  I have no idea why they are so undeveloped.<br\/><br\/>I believe that, as there is no possibility that the issue of surrogacy and parentage will be dealt with during the lifetime of this Government, the provisions contained in the draft Bill I published, together with some appropriate amendments arising out of the consultative process, which I think was very helpful, be incorporated in this Bill on Committee Stage.  It is not in the interests of children that we fail any longer to address this issue.  The excuse given for not addressing it, which I heard some months ago, was because there was a Supreme Court judgment pending in proceedings relating to a matter of surrogacy with which I am familiar.  I am sure other Members of the House are familiar with it also; I do not have the time to go into the detail of it.  Those proceedings existed when we published the Bill last January.  They were in a place whereby the High Court had made a decision, the Supreme Court's hearing was about to take place, and it was anticipated the Supreme Court would ultimately produce judgment, as it did in November of this year.<br\/><br\/>The heads of the Bill, as drafted, anticipated the outcome of the Supreme Court decision absolutely correctly.  When it commenced hearing those proceedings, the Supreme Court was informed that the Government, in the context of the Children and Family Relationships Bill, intended to address this issue.  The fact that the scheme of the Bill had been published, and I am open to correction that a copy of it might have been handed into court, although I may be wrong about that, could not influence the outcome of an appeal the Supreme Court was determining.  It merely brought to the court's notice that the Government intended, in the Children and Family Relationships Bill, to address this issue.<br\/><br\/>By the time the Supreme Court produced its decision on 7 November 2014, it had become known that the Government was not going to address the issue in the Children and Family Relationships Bill.  All the judges in the Supreme Court urged that legislation be enacted in regard to surrogacy so that no individuals should again have to go through the difficulties the husband and wife, and the wife's sister, went through in the context of the High Court and the Supreme Court proceedings that were necessary.<br\/><br\/>I want to give one quote from Mr. Justice Hardiman.  He was referencing legislation in this area.  He stated:<blockquote>There is, at present, a serious disconnect between what developments in science and medicine have rendered possible on the one hand, and the state of the law on the other.  It is as if Road Traffic Law had failed to reflect the advent of the motor car.  The failure to adapt the law in relation to developments in Embryology of course, affects far fewer people, but it affects them in a peculiar and intimate fashion which makes statutory law reform in this area more than urgent.<\/blockquote>There is no more I can say about that.  I believe this Bill should be amended on Committee Stage to address parentage issues in regard to surrogacy and the court procedures that are necessary to provide protection for children and the welfare of children, and to ensure that we address the issue of commercial surrogacy.  All the other issues can properly be dealt with by the Minister for Health, but I wish he would stop pretending that he is presenting some new crusade to address an issue that no one, before he came along, was interested in addressing.  It is misleading, and it is unfair to members of the media and those interviewing him who do not have the intimacy of knowledge of both the Bill that was published last January and of this legislation.<br\/><br\/>I want to rapidly touch on some other issues.  I have a concern about the change in the definition of &quot;embryo&quot;, and in particular with reference to fertilisation of a human egg.  The January 2014 heads had a different approach to it, and there was a reference to part of an ova.  Without getting too much into medical science, in circumstances where a husband and wife want to have a child but the wife who provides the ova has a mitochondrial deficiency in her DNA, at the frontier of DNA medical science or embryology there is now possibly available a mechanism whereby a donation of 0.1% of someone else's DNA from their ova can correct that difficulty.  The manner in which this legislation is now framed will create a barrier to that.  The manner in which the draft Bill was framed in January last year did not create a difficulty in that regard.<br\/><br\/>We should not enact legislation which creates a difficulty in regard to a major issue of health that could impact not just on the child who might be born, but future generations derived from that child when that child grows up, and we should not create a barrier simultaneously with the House of Commons and the House of Lords passing legislation to remove a barrier that exists in their own legislation in the context of this area.  I am concerned that what we are doing is copying a formula from the United Kingdom that is now proved to be out of date.  That needs to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of child maintenance, there is a provision in section 86 of the 2015 Bill which seeks to amend the law with regard to the provision of lump sums for the benefit of children.  I have stated previously in this House that there was a case quite a number of years ago, preceding my time as Minister, when a High Court judge deigned to determine that the mother of a child born outside marriage could not, for the benefit of a child, seek from the courts the same lump sum payment to provide for the child's support and accommodation as a married mother could for a child born within marriage.  I was outraged, as a lawyer, with that judgment.  It stopped at the High Court.  It could not go any further.  The unmarried mother had been successful in the Circuit Court.  The case was reversed in the High Court.  We took a case in the European court, and the State settled the case in the European court on the basis that the law would be adequately changed.<br\/><br\/>The provision in this legislation does not reflect in full what was in the draft Bill in January last.  It is inadequate, and it does not deal with the situation that could arise where, in the case of a child born outside marriage, there is a very wealthy father and funding could be provided, for example, to purchase a house in which the child could reside with the mother, and to deal in future with the ownership of that house.  I am asking the Minister to revisit that particular issue.<br\/><br\/>I am conscious I have run out of time and I will not get to all the matters I wish to raise, but perhaps the House would give me one more minute to raise three issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500036#JJ00500","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424877300,"counter":470,"content":"<p>One minute, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500038#LL00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1424877300,"counter":471,"content":"<p>The legislation in January last gave specific definitions to the concepts of access, custody and guardianship.  Those definitions reflected global best practice.  I do not understand why they are not in this particular Bill.  The definition of best interests of child and what we should have regard to directly reflects what was in the January legislation.  I can only assume it is not in it because there is some reluctance in the Attorney General's office to change provisions in the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 which are completely inadequate.  I urge that that detail be included in the Bill.  It is in the best interests of children that it be included.<\/p>  <p>  The final matter I want to mention is the enforcement provisions.  Although I am not a member of the Oireachtas committee dealing with this, I hope to have an opportunity to say something more about it.  The enforcement provisions have been seriously watered down.  There is an enormous problem, where people are estranged, of the primary custodial parent, who most often is the mother, deliberately obstructing fathers from accessing children.  They are using children as pawns, going to war with fathers, causing some fathers to have nervous breakdowns, and destroying relationships deliberately between children and fathers.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions in this Bill about counselling and sending people to mediation, all of which were in the draft Bill, are absolutely right, but the courts have nothing of practical use they can do where we have the obstinate, obstructive, venomous, hate-filled parent who is determined to destroy the other parent, and the other parent's relationship.  The heads of the Bill published last January had within them provisions, for example, to require the completely recalcitrant parent in certain circumstances to pay some form of financial compensation or to perhaps undertake community service.  There were some meaningful sanctions available to the courts, which fall short of imprisoning a parent.  I do not know why those provisions have been removed from the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500038#LL00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1424877900,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of this Bill.  As other speakers have said, it is a substantial, detailed and intricate piece of legislation.  It would take some time for any Member of the House to fully digest it.  The legislation will be a fundamental building block in how we acknowledge family formation in the years ahead and the diverse make-up of families in modern Irish society.  The Bill was published last week and we are now on Second Stage, so the pressure is on to rush it through the Houses of the Oireachtas and ensure that it is not running into or being confused with the marriage equality referendum.  That, however, is doing a disservice not only to this legislation but also to the debate on the marriage equality referendum.<\/p>  <p>  It was unfortunate that it was delayed, because we have had just one week since its publication to assess, adjudicate, engage with various stakeholders, take our own soundings and advice, and make an informed contribution to it in this debate. <\/p>  <p>  I listened with interest to Deputy Shatter's contribution.  Even if I had not been speaking after him I would have come in to listen to him, given his intimate knowledge of the Bill.  He made some very valid points about the delay in the Bill and the need for us to have an informed debate.  There are a few issues, however, that will need to be teased out further.  That is why I hope that on Committee Stage ownership will not be taken by any one side.  I also hope that the constructive views of both Opposition and Government Deputies will be examined impartially.  As the Minister knows, Opposition amendments are often ignored or reasons are found to block their passage through Committee and later Stages.  As much as possible, this Bill should be handled in a non-partisan way.  We are not talking about Opposition views on Government legislation; we are talking about how we form society in the years ahead.  That debate should be as consensual as possible in the time available.  I know the timeframe will put the Minister under pressure, but we should allow as much debate as possible in order to have a consensus in amending any parts of the legislation where there may be deficiencies.<\/p>  <p>  Reference has been made to the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 and the fact that it is quite an archaic law based on legislation prior to Independence.  In drafting the Bill before us, I wonder why there was not a full repeal of those Acts.  In that way they could have been subsumed into one substantial piece of legislation that reflects modern Ireland and the changes in our society over the years.<\/p>  <p>  We have unearthed much evidence of sadness in society in the past because of our view of what a family had to be.  Lone parenthood, for example, put huge pressure on women to hide their shame by going to England or giving up their babies at an early stage.  We now have a more modern, caring and compassionate view of what a family is.  It does not have to be the traditional nuclear family of one plus one and children flowing from that.  There are many circumstances and reasons why families are formed in different ways.  We have to be able to accommodate that and ensure that children's rights are at the centre.  Children's interests must be best served by the legislation which underpins their rights and entitlements concerning guardianship, custody and access to parental lines.  All those things are positive but they do need to be fleshed out a lot more.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Shatter referred to stem cell research and hereditary diseases, and I would like the Minister to clarify those points.  In addition, deficiencies can now be identified in the ovum and rectified with third-party DNA.  Thanks to major scientific advances, hereditary diseases can be identified and treated with interventions by medical science using third-party DNA.  There are now great opportunities for parents to avoid the transfer of a hereditary gene that may cause disease or illness.  I am not an expert in this area and, unfortunately, I have not had time to delve into it detail.  Hopefully, however, we can revisit it on Committee Stage.  In the meantime, the Minister may wish to examine that area of stem cell research and embryology, whereby third-party DNA is required to prevent the transfer of hereditary diseases.  It may be covered in the Bill, but at a cursory glance I think there could be deficiencies in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  It has been said that children are at the centre of this legislation, which is correct.  I assume that is the reason behind the Bill, but there is a deficiency in the area of a father's right of access to children.  As a society we have not faced up to this issue.  There is a strong body of opinion that fathers who want to have access and play a meaningful role in rearing their children are sometimes unable to do so.  There is not much in this legislation to address that particular issue, which is of fundamental importance.  Week after week we can see the difficult, confrontational attitudes that are adopted when fathers try to gain access to their children.  As Deputy Shatter said, children can almost be used as pawns or battering-rams to try to inflict damage on the other parent.  That matter has to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The family law courts are doing their best but they need to be underpinned with modern, progressive legislation to give the Judiciary a steer on what we believe is the right and entitlement of fathers to access their children.  We can see that problem arising week in and week out.  It is a major deficiency in this legislation.  If a father is being denied access, that is certainly not in the child's best interests.  Access and bonding are good things, as is knowing one's parentage.  However, there is a lacuna which is sometimes being abused and exploited.  With the best will in the world, our family law courts are still adversarial.  On many occasions it is a winner-takes-all approach, but that is not inherently in the child's best interests, so we have a lot of work to do in that area.  Many organisations have been actively campaigning, and often with a lot of pain, to try to get this issue remedied.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe we have gone the full distance with this legislation.  I say this having had a cursory glance at the Bill, as it was only published last week.  The Minister has an intimate knowledge of the legislation, as has her predecessor.  Most Deputies, however, are trying to peruse the Bill, which was only published last Thursday.  It comprises more than 100 pages of detailed, intricate data whose language is technical in nature.  <\/p>  <p>  It is critical that we be given adequate time on Committee Stage to discuss the Bill's proposals which some Deputies may have concerns about.  Deputy Timmins said that this debate should be held in plenary session in this Chamber, which is an idea.<\/p><p>I would like this legislation to go through the Houses of the Oireachtas, head off to the President and find that it has consistent support in defining what we view now as guardianship, custody, modern family, access, etc.  For that purpose, it would be important.<\/p> <p> Surrogacy is not addressed in the Bill.  There has been reference to a Supreme Court case at the time it was being drafted.  The Bill went over and back between the Office of the Attorney General and the Department, as is normally the case.  The provision in question was taken out for that reason and it will stand alone.  However, it is critical that there be no further prevarication or delay in addressing the issue of surrogacy.  I am concerned that when this legislation is passed it will bring down a very arbitrary line in one way.  Many people who have availed of assisted human reproduction will still need to go through the courts process to get clarity about guardianship, parentage, custody and all of that.  I hope we can deal with the Bill in a timely manner, but that the issue of surrogacy will not be allowed to drift on for one, two or three years.<\/p> <p> I do not see how there can be much that is confrontational or divisive in the issue of surrogacy.  Most people in this House accept that, with advances in technology and science, we should facilitate people who cannot have a child naturally in doing so through surrogacy and assisted human reproduction.  Of course, the questions of commercialisation, anonymous sperm donation and other such issues can be teased out.  However, the broad principle of surrogacy is accepted across the House.  We should not prevaricate and delay.  Many people who will be availing of this in the meantime will find themselves in no man's land when this legislation is passed.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the Bill, which has been a long time coming.  That is not casting any aspersion on the Minister.  It is something that needed to be done.  Many of our custody and guardianship laws are archaic.  They are based on previous times in a different world where there were different attitudes and different views of a simplistic family make-up.  We now find ourselves in a very changed society where family breakdown may result from difficulties in a family, or, simply, family formation may be different from what we traditionally assumed.  At the centre of all that, the child's best interests must be served.<\/p> <p> This brings me back to the issue of parents who have just become completely irresponsible in the area of parenting, where there is child neglect or possibly abuse, including severe physical abuse.  We still have a problem in that area.  This goes back to the broader issue of just not giving support to families but considering cases of complete dereliction of parental duties.  I do not believe the State has fully addressed how it will intervene in those cases.  I know this is a broader issue that goes beyond the Bill.<\/p> <p> There has been the most appalling abuse of children in this country in recent times, with cases in which it would have been obvious to a passive observer that there were difficulties in a home.  Yet it seems the State was incapable of dealing with that.  We have had some tragic cases in very recent times.  This is not something that happened in the 1940s, 1950s or 1960s, but very recently.  Of course, the debate always centres on when the State is infringing on the rights and entitlements of parents.<\/p> <p> Equally, one must ask if the State is disavowing its obligation to act in the best interests of children.  That balance needs a long discussion in society and in the D&aacute;il.  We have a Constitution and the very narrow interpretation placed by the courts on the make-up of the family, giving sanctity and protection to the family, which are all very welcome.  However, at times the State can be reluctant to enter a home to assess potential abuse of children.  That is something that needs to be addressed.  For instance, the State dealt very badly with a recent case involving Roma children in the midlands and this has had a devastating impact.  There may be other cases in that context.  To take it more broadly, if the State intervenes and it is found that there was no abuse, then we castigate the officers, the social workers and the system.  Equally, we then expect the same system to respond on every occasion where there is potential neglect or abuse.  I believe we are putting social workers, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and many other people in an invidious position.  They must ask whether they should act and, if they act, what the sanction might be.  There can be very serious vilification.<\/p> <p> I have come across cases in Cork in which neighbours were very concerned about particular children - they saw children with lice in their hair, who were scruffily dressed, badly turned out or absent from school.  While there were major concerns, it was unclear whom they should approach.  Should it be the social workers or the school attendance officers?  Where does the system take us in terms of making an assessment and acting upon the perceived best interests of a child at that time?  They may get it wrong from time to time, but I always believe it is better to err on the side of caution and intervene if there is a suspicion.<\/p> <p> It is inappropriate to turn our backs on vulnerable children because we are unsure in legislative terms, and in terms of basic logistics, supports and services, whether to intervene.  That is another critical area we have to address.  The Bill addresses many matters, but there needs to be a more formalised approach to the support and assistance provided to care and social workers, school attendance officers, medical professionals, front-line garda&iacute; and teachers who may observe cases of neglect or abuse.  We need to ensure that we do not have professionals saying, \"Look, if I don't intervene the worst that can happen is that I could be called incompetent, but if I intervene and I am wrong then there could be very serious sanction and vilification.\"  I do not want or expect the State to confer powers on individuals to break down doors and check to see whether a baby's bottle of milk is warm.  However, we need some understanding of what can happen.  Abuse has happened behind the doors of houses over many years and is probably happening today.  Where there is suspicion of abuse or neglect of children, or there is a very obvious pointer that it is happening, the State is often reluctant to get involved for many reasons.  That is something that must be dealt with.  It is as important as any other area in the context of putting children first, which is the key focus in all of this.<\/p> <p> We need to ensure that children's rights are vindicated, that they have knowledge of their parentage and that there are proper discussions on custody and guardianship.  We have had referendums to ensure that the rights of the child are vindicated if there is neglect or abuse, or if one parent is denying the other parent access.<\/p><p>All these things must be dealt with, not only in the context of legislation but in terms of a fundamental mind shift regarding how we protect our children.  I commend the Bill to the House but I hope the Minister takes on board the broad discussion and tries to facilitate as much debate as possible here in order that we can all leave this Chamber knowing we have done a good day's work in ensuring our children are first in this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500039#MM00100","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424879100,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.  It is legislation that once adopted will not necessarily change the world we know but more accurately reflect it.  The traditional concept of the family evolved a long time ago and it is great that politicians are finally catching up to that fact.  I am proud to be part of a Government that is doing this important work to reflect what Ireland is today and what modern Ireland looks like.<\/p>  <p>  I want to touch upon an issue we spoke about previously, namely, fathers' rights.  The Bill does not give automatic rights to unmarried fathers and tells them that if they want these rights, they must earn them.  They must prove their commitment to the child but also to the mother, and they do this by living with the mother and child for a 12-month period.  I am concerned about the natural rights of the father and about recognising the father's natural rights in the guardianship and raising of the child.  If there is no recognition of such natural rights, does this not then undermine the notion of an automatic natural responsibility which needs to be encouraged where sometimes it is, unfortunately, lacking?<\/p>  <p>  If we look at the practicalities of achieving guardianship for the father, we can see that the test to achieve such rights and responsibilities, if we can call it a test, seems to contradict the kinds of modern family arrangements we see today and which the rest of the Bill so nobly attempts to address.  I wonder whether 12 months living together, of which three must be after the child's birth, is the best test to prove that a father is interested in his child.  In the absence of recognising a natural or automatic right to guardianship, is this really the best standard by which we would then confer guardianship on the unmarried father?  I have a concern about this area and it is a concern voiced to me by others as well.  I look forward to fleshing it out in more detail on Committee Stage.  Perhaps it is a point of policy on which the Minister and I disagree and will not agree, which is understandable.  Every piece of legislation that goes through the D&aacute;il is about compromise and sometimes it will be possible to amend legislation in the way one wants and sometimes that will not be possible and it is hoped to do it again in the future.  I believe there should be automatic rights to guardianship for the unmarried father and that is something I would like to pursue with this legislation and, if not with this legislation, at a later date.<\/p>  <p>  I will touch on another related area, which is the idea of a central register for joint guardianship agreements.  I note that there is a request that the Government would amend the Bill to include the establishment of a central register for joint guardianship agreements to keep a record of statutory declarations agreeing guardianship rights.  That seems very sensible to me.  I know that in its pre-legislative scrutiny, the Oireachtas committee recommended something similar, as did the Law Reform Commission, so I hope this is something that could at least be considered as we move through to Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Minister on bringing forward this legislation and all the many aspects of it.  I foresee some difficult times when it goes through the House and people opposing it for different reasons, but it is important that we try to build as much consensus as we can around this law because of the impact it will have on society.  I welcome all the time that has been afforded to the debate so far.  A full week on Second Stage and more if we need it is very welcome, and anything we can do to have a meaningful and constructive Committee Stage debate where we give the necessary time to flesh out every issue before we adopt this Bill would also be very welcome in terms of making sure that as this legislation leaves the House and becomes law, it has the support of most, if not all, politicians and that people recognise that we are trying to act in the best interests of the modern family we see today.  I commend the legislation to the House and congratulate the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500041#OO00200","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speech","time":1424879100,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I also commend the Minister on bringing this extremely important and progressive legislation to the Chamber.  I also commend her predecessor, Deputy Shatter, whom I listened to previously and who I know was and still is extremely invested in this.  It is important to state at this stage that this Government has placed more emphasis on and done more to protect the rights of the child than any other Government.  Following the general election in 2011, a specific Department of Children and Youth Affairs was set up by Fine Gael and Labour and I acknowledge the work that the Minister did when she started the Department and during her period as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, work that has been taken up by the current Minister, Deputy Reilly.  Although the turnout in the children's rights referendum, which was held on 10 November 2012, was disappointingly low, the majority of people voted in favour of the proposal and it was a proposal that undoubtedly put children first.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of this Bill is to reform and update family law and safeguard the welfare, safety and best interests of our children so, again, it is about putting our children first.  The last legislation regarding guardianship of children living in diverse families was the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, so we are talking about legislation that was created 50 years ago.  As we all know, a lot has changed in 50 years, particularly when we are talking about the make-up of a family.  We need to modernise the law relating to children living in diverse family forms and I am happy this Bill will address and provide not just for guardianship but also for parentage, custody and access across a range of family situations which are currently not being addressed by older regulations or legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I am also pleased that the Bill caters for children being parented by same-sex couples or those who have been born through donor-assisted reproduction.  At the same time, I do not think this Bill is trying to change the fact that, where possible, a child should be brought up by their birth mother and father.  However, life is not so black and white and the sooner we realise that and can cater for different families, the better.  There are children who are being brought up by a mother and father who are husband and wife but there are also children who are being brought up by single parents, grandparents or other family members, and we need to make sure that regardless of the make-up of the family, the child is in a caring and safe environment and all their needs are met.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill clearly sets out who can apply for guardianship in respect of a child.  It obviously enables a relative to apply for custody and, when relationships break down, it enables grandparents and other relatives to have easier access to children.  This is extremely important because I have seen how when a relationship breaks down, there are often side effects that the parents often do not see.  I am glad the Bill addresses that.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of maintenance is addressed in respect of the child and a civil partner or a parent's cohabiting partner where that person is a guardian.  While the legislation cannot compel a person to pay - when it gets to that stage, it goes to court - it forces us to take on this issue of liability in a much stronger manner.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also enables a wider range of unmarried fathers to become guardians, but I must say that I agree with Deputy Eoghan Murphy in respect of requiring the father to live with a partner for 12 months, three of which must be after the child's birth.  If a person does not show any interest in their child and does not care for them or support them, they should definitely not be given guardianship, but I would question requiring fathers to live with a partner.  Perhaps this could be looked at.<\/p>  <p>  The face of adoption has changed in recent years.  Last year, fewer than 100 children were adopted in Ireland.  Twenty or 30 years ago, that number would have been drastically higher.  The reason for that is because society has changed its attitudes to young mothers and unmarried couples.  There are far more supports in place and religion does not have the same hold on people as it would have had then.  Even with that change, however, I know many people seem to have reservations about one aspect of the Bill, namely, the amendment to the Adoption Act 2010.  This would allow for the extension of its provisions to civil partners and cohabiting couples.  There has been a lot of debate recently about whether gay couples should be allowed to adopt.  Nobody has an automatic right to adopt.  There are many families which on the outside look like typical conventional families where the parents are married, have children and live in a nice house, but that does not automatically mean they live in a happy household.  It does not automatically mean that the children are being looked after in the manner they should be looked after but because of how the world works and because a man and a woman can create a baby, the situation is sometimes challenged.  I think we need to challenge that more.  People who want to adopt, regardless of whether they are gay or straight, in a couple or single, must sometimes go through years of interviews and background checks.<\/p><p>They have to jump through all sorts of hoops to show that they are good parents and will provide for the child.  When speaking about adoption we are speaking about the best environment for a child and so sexuality should not be an issue.<\/p> <p> There are many aspects of this Bill that could be touched on.  It is extremely complex legislation.  The interests of the child are paramount and the welfare of the child is a necessity.  It is important we are all in agreement when this Bill passes through the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500041#OO00300","speaker":"1180","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424879700,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Like other speakers, I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  I also commend her predecessor, Deputy Shatter, for his previous work on the compilation of this Bill.  Colleagues on all sides of the House also need to be congratulated for their input and observations on this extremely complex and detailed legislation which attempts to cater for almost all of the eventualities of which we are aware, and many of which we are not aware.  Regardless of what one does as a legislator something will always be missed.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment Deputy Kelleher on his references to child abuse and the experiences we have had in this regard in this country over the past number of years.  This Bill proposes to put in place protections for children in a way that heretofore has not been done.  It also attempts to put in place a necessary back-up system in this regard.  I hope this will happen.  Deputy Kelleher posed the question, \"When is the right time to intervene on behalf of the child?\"  Given that this legislation is built around the child and protection of the child it is important there is clarity around the right time for that intervention.  I have previously posed questions such as: \"When should one intervene?\"; \"How does one know if one is doing the right thing?\"; \"Is one interfering in another person's business?\"; \"Is one taking adequate precautions?\", or whatever the case may be.  Invariably, it is a matter of judgment.  The professionals involved need to be able to make a judgment call.  All of us have dealt down through the years with situations in respect of which judgment calls were not made in time and as a result there were consequences of an undesirable nature.  Usually in this situation the child became the victim.  That should not be the case.  I am currently dealing with a case in respect of which it is clear serious abuse is taking place within a family.  No action is being taken in this case, other than to victimise the mother and the children, because of a lack of unwillingness to become involved.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill deals with a number of other issues, including assisted human reproduction.  The issue of donors and the need for a register of same is hugely important.  I note there are a number of exceptions in this regard.  Lawyers are going to have the greatest time in the world in terms of the likelihood of their being called upon to determine which law is applicable in this area.  I am aware of only one instance of the law being applied retrospectively in this country.  In the case of a donation made ten years ago which becomes active at this point in time will the legislation enacted ten years ago apply or will this legislation, when enacted, apply?  A case relating to this issue was before the courts a number of years ago.  It is inevitable that case law in this area will be established over a period of time.  The amount of case law required to set the basis for the interpretation of this legislation will be huge.  The tendency in this country is to challenge.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Helen McEntee referenced the provision regarding the commitment of a father to a child in particular circumstances.  It should not be sufficient for a father only to have resided with the child for a couple of weeks or months.  There is need for a stronger commitment in this regard.  It is not necessarily the case that the mother will object out of peevishness.  It should not be forgotten that the maternal bond is very strong.  It has been contested in court on numerous occasions that the maternal and paternal bonds are equal.  I do not agree.  I believe the maternal bond is the strongest.  Any attempt to break this bond can have serious consequences for a family and the health of the mother and so on.  We are all aware of court cases involving assertions to the effect that one or other parent is an unfit parent, particularly in the context of separation disputes between parents, whether cohabiting or married.  I wonder whether address of this issue will be as simple as it now appears.  Invariably, when a case reaches the courts it becomes a battle between two sets of legal advisers who will do everything in their power to win their case.  Neither set of legal advisers is going to hold up their hands and, in the interests of fair play, concede the case.  That never happens.  I ask that the Minister bear in mind the likely process that will take place in those circumstances.  Many speakers referenced single fathers being deprived of their rights.  I believe that the rights of the mother of the child need to be borne in mind in a particular way until such time as men can give birth, which will be some time into the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also deals with guardianship.  I note that responsibility for this legislation is divided between several Departments, including the Departments of Health and Social Protection.  To what extent will social welfare law have to be amended accordingly?  We have all dealt with cases involving a grandparent, relative or non-relative who is acting as guardian of a child in respect of whom no decision on guardianship has been made and the guardian gets no allowance.  If they do, it is against the run of play.  It some cases a mother may have abandoned her child to be maintained by, for example, her mother.  In such cases, when the mother is interviewed by social services and asked if she is maintaining her child the mother will always say she is doing so, in which case the grandparent, relative or non-relative will never get a payment.  We have all dealt with such cases.  I ask that this too be borne in mind at the appropriate time.  It should not be the case that when guardianship of a child is being determined the word of the mother or father in regard to whether he or she is maintaining the child is accepted.  They should be required to prove that is the case.  We have all dealt with cases in respect of which the natural parent has not seen his or her child for ten or 12 years.  It is important that the guardian of a child in such cases is recognised.<\/p>  <p>  I regret that it is not possible in the time available to me to speak to the many issues covered in this Bill.  I hope I will have ample opportunity to address these issues on Committee Stage.  This is complex legislation.  I agree with those speakers who said that we need thoroughly to discuss, analyse and debate it at each Stage of its passage through the Houses to ensure as much as possible protection of the child and all relationships and to ensure that their responsibilities and entitlements are recognised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500042#PP00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1424880300,"counter":479,"content":"<p>The next slot is a Sinn F&eacute;in one.

Every Deputy in their constituency clinic sees the manifestation of those changes every day and it is correct that our laws should reflect them.  The long wait for this legislation has left many people in legal limbo regarding various aspects of their family lives and it is a good thing that those matters will now be sorted out without having to go through expensive and lengthy legal processes.<\/p>  <p>  Single parenthood and families which mix the children of two former families are common and there are all sorts of issues to do with guardianship, custody, adoption and cohabitation in the many new forms of family life which exist now in Ireland.  All of the people involved in these families have rights and responsibilities and it is proper that the law moves to protect all of them.  Most particularly, the rights of children must be protected by legislation and the obligations of parents and guardians too must be enshrined in law.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill contains provisions which will challenge our traditional view of the family but it is time to move on in that regard.  In many instances the traditional view of family has failed children as well as parents.  This legislation in itself will help to change the attitude of those who hanker for the day when the nuclear family as we knew it was the only family recognised in law.  The Bill will allow couples who have been together for three years to apply jointly to adopt.  That is a good provision to replace the current situation where just one of the couple can be an adoptive parent.  There have been sad and tragic circumstances where one half of a loving couple of parents dies and grandparents have stepped in to prevent the surviving parent from having access to the child and in cases where the person in question was not legally an adoptive parent, he or she had no rights despite a long-term relationship with the child.  It is to be welcomed that children living in non-marital and non-traditional families will be in a position to enjoy a legal relationship with the person who provides them with day-to-day parental care, whoever that person may be.<\/p>  <p>  Single persons who are gay or lesbian have been allowed to adopt children before now.  The Children and Family Relationships Bill just ensures that in the case of same-sex relationships, both parents are guardians and the child has the same rights as any other child.  It is unfortunate that some people who want to live in the past and who do not support the Bill have been calling it the gay adoption Bill, as if gay people could not already adopt.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to note provision for fathers' rights in the Bill, because it was a serious omission and led to a lot of unmarried fathers having restricted or no access to their children.  All of us as elected representatives have encountered that in our clinics in the past.  The Bill could have gone further, as there is still no option for an unmarried father if the mother of his child will not sign the statutory declaration for joint guardianship, except cohabitation for the requisite length of time.  The new provision for someone who has lived with a parent for three years and looked after a child for two years being able to apply for guardianship or custody is also a good provision.<\/p>  <p>  There have been countless sad and even tragic stories in this country in the past about people who could not find their families due to illegal and irregular adoption practices.  I welcome the provision where all children who are born via assisted human reproduction will be able to trace their donors.  There is hardly an extended family in this island that has not encountered restrictions being put in their way when trying to find birth parents or their children who were given up for adoption.<\/p>  <p>  There are some provisions which we will try to amend on Committee Stage, but in general this is good legislation and I congratulate the Minister on it.  Now, the question is whether the framework around the legislation is fit for purpose.  Will there be a court welfare service to back up the provisions of the Bill?  There is a lack of appropriate mechanisms to assess a child's welfare and best interests.  Will there be mechanisms in place to allow older children to express their views on the situation and to have those views impartially assessed?  Will mediation, counselling and welfare services be able to deal with the proper implementation of the legislation?  Is there any plan to train the Judiciary to deal adequately with complex family law cases?  Will family law courts have the services of properly trained free legal aid solicitors?  Family law cases can genuinely be life-changing for all those involved and every measure must be taken to ensure that decisions about a family are well informed and backed by the best possible training and knowledge.<\/p>  <p>  It must be made very clear that the Bill and the forthcoming referendum on marriage equality are totally separate.  The referendum on 22 May is about marriage and has nothing to do with children.  The sole question which people will be asked is whether gay and lesbian couples can marry.  That is all.  Those against marriage equality will try to confuse the issue, but it must be made clear that children are not involved in the question being put on 22 May.  Meanwhile, although there may be some amendments from Sinn F&eacute;in on Committee Stage, we generally support the broad thrust of the Bill and we congratulate the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500043#QQ00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1424880300,"counter":481,"content":"<p>The purpose of the Bill appears to be to bring legislation in line with how people live their lives today.  There are some who seem to be of the view that if we do not change the legislation, somehow people will live the kind of lives we had at the foundation of the State, and that they will live different lives that fit in with the views of some people on the world and the State.  However, that will not happen.  The Bill is catching up with life as it is today.<\/p>  <p>  The make-up of families has changed substantially since the foundation of the State and the drafting of the Constitution.  The laws which were enacted and introduced by the fledgling State reflected the reality of the time.  From today's perspective, Ireland would probably be viewed as far more conservative and narrow minded in terms of the prevailing view of what constituted a family.  I make the point without any intended criticism that to the people of that time, any family that did not consist of a father, mother and children was considered strange.  It was not quite a family.  Men who were widowed were expected to marry again, because it was considered to be somehow perverse to have men rearing children on their own.  Single mothers came under the scrutiny of the State, and it was often the children of families where the father was no longer present who were shipped off to industrial schools to face the horrors we have come to learn about.<\/p>  <p>  The far different make-up of families today is accepted by the vast majority in society.  There are two-parent families, one-parent families, step-parents and a whole multitude of different varieties that make up modern Ireland.  Therefore, I welcome the long anticipated Children and Family Relationships Bill.  This legislation will hopefully reflect the different make-up of families which now exist in Ireland and ensure security and peace of mind for all families in this State.<\/p><p>I echo what Deputy Ferris said in commending the Minister on her introduction of the Bill.<\/p> <p> The Children and Family Relationships Bill is much more than a piece of legislation for same-sex couples.  Some people are putting across a point that this is all about same-sex couples, but it is about much more than that.  Some elements are making scurrilous accusations that this piece of legislation will somehow give same-sex couples more rights than heterosexual couples.  This lie must be put to bed.  The Bill in fact recognises the fundamental diversity that exists in Irish family life.  It gives a legislative voice to an existing reality.  Day-to-day tasks such as medical examinations and school trips can prove difficult for some families if there is no clear legislative guideline as to who can be considered a parent or guardian.  It has a big impact on how people can live their lives.  This is an important step towards recognition of equality for all.  It would be disappointing if those voices which only wish to spread lies and half-truths were allowed to be the loudest in this debate.<\/p> <p> There are of course some issues with the Bill which I believe need to be addressed.  The section regarding cohabitation needs to be examined, whereby a father living with the child's mother for 12 consecutive months, including at least three months with the mother and the child following the child's birth, will automatically become a guardian.  It is not always possible for the father to live with the child's mother for 12 consecutive months or for three months following the birth.  There are many reasons a father may not be cohabiting with the mother of his child.  For example, the mother might be living with her parents, or the father might be living in another part of the country or another country due to work commitments.  There is nothing substantial for unmarried fathers outside the cohabiting clause.  Everyone else will be obliged to resort to the courts if the mother does not agree to sign a statutory declaration of joint guardianship.  These issues need to be addressed by the Minister.<\/p> <p> The courts and the legal system must be equipped to deal with the changes that the Bill will introduce.  The Bill is possibly one of the most significant pieces of legislation that will impact on how the legal system will view the make-up of the family structure.  There has to be a degree of specialist knowledge in this area, and the court system must be adequately equipped to deal with these cases coming before the courts.  The days when children and parents are dealt with in the same way as other civil cases must end.  An adequate family law court system must be established, backed up by a comprehensive court welfare system.  Access to this must also be addressed, especially for low-income families who are unable to access free legal aid.  The court system must be open and available to all, not just those who can afford it.<\/p> <p> The Minister should work to ensure that as many people as possible are aware of what the outcomes of the legislation will mean so that those putting forward the nightmare scenarios are silenced.  This will be useful to counteract many of the lies being spread by a small but vociferous section of society who seem bent on misinforming the public.  Also, the more information that is given to the public, the more families in future will be aware of the legal situation in which they find themselves.  For example, many people believe that putting a father's name on a birth certificate automatically guarantees a father's guardianship rights.  As we know, it does not.<\/p> <p> Overall, the Children and Family Relationships Bill is a progressive step on the road to creating an Ireland that better recognises its diversity.  I welcome the fact that the legislation has been brought before the House and I look forward to working with all Deputies to ensure we get this right.  The Minister's office needs to work very closely with Opposition spokespersons to ensure the final enacted legislation is as good as it can be.  I sometimes get the impression that amendments put forward by the Opposition are regarded as a comment on the ability of the Government, the Minister's office or the legal draughtsmen.  Conversely, Opposition spokespersons putting forward amendments may not fully realise that there might be unintended consequences to the amendments being tabled.  We need to look on this as a collaborative job of work, because by working more closely together, listening to each other and deepening our understanding of the complexities of today's lives, we will surely come up with the best possible piece of legislation to reflect them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500043#QQ00300","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424880900,"counter":483,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Catherine Byrne, who is sharing time with Deputies Se&aacute;n Kyne and James Bannon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500044#RR00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1424880900,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the Bill, which is a crucial element of child-centred reform that will amend laws regarding children's rights and child protection.  It is about modernising family law and addressing the particular needs of children in the areas of parentage, guardianship, adoption and custody access.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on her publication of the Bill and I commend the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, on his work on it.  I welcome the cross-party support for the Bill, which is a testament to its content and what it sets out to do.  The Bill has been in the pipeline for many years and I am proud that the Government has stepped up and delivered on its commitment to children.  It will afford all children, including those living in difficult and challenging situations, the support and security they need and deserve.<\/p>  <p>  Children in this country are cared for and protected in a range of family types, but the law does not recognise this.  The Bill will ensure that the courts have much greater flexibility to grant guardianship where they have been prevented from doing so.  At present, awarding guardianship can be problematic if parents fall ill, pass away or cannot care for their children for a variety of reasons.  The Bill offers legal support and protection to the children of married and unmarried parents, the parents' partners, the children's grandparents and other relatives.  The Bill enables grandparents and other relatives to have easier access to children in cases of relationship breakdown and to apply for custody if a parent is unwilling or unable to take responsibility for caring for the child.  I welcome this aspect of the Bill, as for many years grandparents have not been able to intervene where people have fallen ill and in situations of substance abuse.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation reflects changing modern society and the various types of family that exist.  We all know families whose setup is not seen to be traditional.  The Bill protects and clarifies relationships for children living in such families.  I welcome the clarity the Bill brings to cases in which children are parented by same-sex couples or have been born through donor-assisted human reproduction.  This is a complex area which has until now been unregulated.  The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction first reported to the Government in 2005, but it has taken until now for action to be taken to give legal certainly to children and families in this situation.  The Bill also provides for the establishment of a register of donor-conceived persons, which is important to provide clarity on parentage.<\/p><p>This means once a donor-conceived child turn 18 years of age she will be able to seek information about her donor.  Many people were adopted and never knew who their real parents were and are still struggling to find out today.<\/p> <p> I was disappointed to see that surrogacy was not included, but I heard today that the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has stated that his Department is working on a Bill to address the many complexities surrounding surrogacy.  I urge the Minister to bring that legislation before the House as soon as possible.  The possibility of transferring parentage from a surrogate to a genetic mother where there is agreement is a bold and brave move to address the difficult situation whereby the birth mother is deemed to be the mother and the genetic parents must adopt their own child.  The Bill will enable civil partners and cohabiting couples who have lived together for more than three years to be enabled to apply to adopt jointly, provided they have been assessed as suitable adoptive parents.<\/p> <p> I have heard the arguments against the Bill and comments from those who have intentionally confused the legislation with the forthcoming referendum on marriage equality.  I do not support their point that this legislation will intentionally deny a child either a mother or a father.<\/p> <p> This is a comprehensive and progressive Bill.  It will provide much-needed support to families of all shapes and sizes.  I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill to the House.  I believe it is important legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500044#RR00300","speaker":"1029","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424881500,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of this Bill, exactly four years since the general election.  With 172 sections, this is one of the most complex Bills to come before the House in that time.  It has implications and consequences for several substantial high-profile Acts of the Oireachtas, including the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Succession Act 1965, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children Act) 1976, the Status of Children Act 1987, the Adoption Act 2010 and the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  It can be asked why these Acts were so high profile and significant.  It was because they impacted directly on the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals and families in the State.<br\/><br\/>This Bill will join the catalogue of landmark legislation in this area.  Like others, I am proud that a Fine Gael Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is pursuing the Bill.  I congratulate her predecessor, Deputy Alan Shatter, on introducing and leading this Bill in the initial stages as well.  Although the statement is sometimes disputed, Fine Gael is a party of the progressive centre.  We believe in equality, fairness, upholding the law and vindicating rights.  The Bill seeks to emulate all of these aims.<br\/><br\/>The Bill is made up of 172 sections.  We should keep in mind the recent past and the institutional State-sanctioned inequality and unfairness that existed in our country.  In recent times we have seen numerous reports and apologies, and rightly so, relating to what went on in our past.  People, especially those of my age and younger, should recall that the ridiculous arcane concept of illegitimacy was only abolished with the Status of Children Act 1987.  Prior to that Act, children born of parents who were not married were legally illegitimate.  In case anyone was unaware of this, the State issued a different colour birth certificate to remind them and everyone else.  Looking back, it seems absolutely ridiculous and completely crazy that such a situation existed, but it did.  Unfortunately, it exists today in a different way.  Today, some children and <i>de facto<\/i>parents do not enjoy the same rights or protections of the law, and this is wrong.  In the same way as the Status of Children Act moved to address these shortcomings and failings, so too will the Children and Family Relationships Bill.  The Bill modernises the law and, in effect, represents the law catching up with the reality of everyday life in this country.  Above all, the Bill is child-centred and addresses a range of areas, including parentage rights and responsibilities, guardianship, custody and access, donor-assisted reproduction and maintenance.  The Bill represents the culmination of a long process of research, reform and consultation.<br\/><br\/>As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process introduced by this Government, the Joint Committee on Health and Children held important hearings last April and produced a report on the proposed Bill.  The Minister published the general scheme last September and facilitated further consultation and comment on the Bill's contents and aims.<br\/><br\/>Opponents of the legislation are seeking to link it to the marriage equality referendum, which is equally important but separate.  Opponents of this legislation are also seeking to confuse matters by focusing on families headed by same-sex couples.  I have been dismayed, as have other Deputies, by the narrow focus some media outlets are putting on the Bill as well.  While it is true that some of the families positively impacted are families headed by persons who happen to be gay or lesbian, the Bill impacts positively on hundreds of thousands of other families as well.  These families include married parents, unmarried parents and grandparents or other relatives in a parenting role.<br\/><br\/>Section 40 enables a wider range of unmarried fathers to become guardians of their child automatically.  A father who has lived with the child's mother for 12 consecutive months, including at least three months with the mother and the child following the child's birth, will automatically become a guardian.  It will enable a parent's spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of not less than three years' duration to apply to the court to become a guardian where he or she has co-parented the child for two years.  These provisions cover day-to-day issues in the best interests of the child.<br\/><br\/>Section 45 includes a new section 6E for the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  This is welcome and shows that this Bill is child-centred.  It enables a guardian or parent to appoint a temporary guardian for his or her child, through a court-based process, where the parent is suffering from serious illness or injury that prevents him or her from exercising his or her guardianship responsibilities.<br\/><br\/>Section 51 amends section 11B of the 1964 Act and will enable grandparents and other relatives to have easier access to children in the context of relationship breakdown.  They will be able to apply directly to the court for access rather than having to go through the current two-stage process of applying to the court for leave to make the application for access.  I welcome this provision.<br\/><br\/>Section 56 amends section 18A of the 1964 Act to ensure that the child in question can make his or her views known in proceedings relating to guardianship in custody and access cases, where possible and given the child's age and understanding.  It is welcome that where the child is of an age that he can make his views known, those views will be taken into account and listened to.  I welcome this move.<br\/><br\/>Sections 66 to 73, inclusive, contain amendments to the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children Act) 1976.  This landmark Act provided protection to spouses - in the main, wives - and children.  It ensured that other spouses, mainly husbands, could not sell the family home to the detriment of the wife and children, among other protections.  The amendments extend protections in a way that reflects the fact that couples may be of the same gender, though they may not be married or civil partners.<br\/><br\/>Section 75 deletes section 35(4) of the Status of Children Act.  This means a child will now be able to make an application to a court for a declaration of parentage.  This is being introduced because it is in the best interests of a person to know his or her identity.<br\/><br\/>Opponents of section 108 maintain it confers the right to adopt on same-sex couples.  Let us be clear that no legislation, this Bill included, confers a right on anyone to adopt.  A person has the right to apply to adopt and be rigorously assessed by the adoption authority.  Section 108 extends the right to apply to adopt to cohabiting couples, whether same-sex or different-sex couples.  The Bill duly recognises that a person's parenting ability is not connected in any way to sexual orientation.  Rather, it is about stability and the ability to provide a safe environment for the child.<br\/><br\/>Overall, I welcome the Bill.  It is reflective of modern life.  It recognises that a child has a right and need for security and stability and has the right to know that someone has a legal duty to look after him or her.  It modernises the law by encompassing a wide area, including parentage, custody, maintenance and adoption.  I welcome the Bill and I hope it has swift passage through the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500045#SS00200","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1424881500,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I am pleased to contribute to the debate on this reforming legislation.  Like much legislation coming from the Government in recent months, it is a forward-thinking Bill designed to bring the Statue Book up to date with society in 2015.  The Minister rightly summed it up when she said that this reform of family law was a \"substantial and detailed response to the reality of family life in Ireland today\".<\/p>  <p>  It is a modernising Bill because, for the first time ever, we are addressing the needs of children living in diverse families.<\/p><p>The National Women's Council of Ireland recently described this Bill as a \"milestone in the protection of children's rights in Ireland\" and it was absolutely right.  We are putting children at the heart of family law, where they always should have been.  The reason we are only doing this now is that Irish families have broadened and changed in recent decades and are much more diverse than the type of family settings my own generation would have been familiar with.  There are numerous types of family in Irish society today, including unmarried parents with children, parents and their partners with children and civil partnerships with children.  We need only look at the most recent census data from 2011 to see that diverse families exist in substantial numbers.<\/p> <p> I would like to quote a few figures from the census of 2011 as they highlight the varied nature of Irish families today.  At that time there were 215,000 lone-parent households, and 17,000 lone parents were living in multi-family households.  Some 66% of the 155,000 divorced or separated women were living with their children.  Approximately 25,000 children were born outside marriage or civil partnership.  There were 49,000 households of cohabiting couples with children under 15.  Indeed, the number of children in households headed by cohabiting couples increased by a substantial 41% between 2006 and 2011.  Looking at these statistics, it is as clear as night follows day why this legislation is needed.  Essentially, we are addressing a number of key issues in regard to diverse families and their rights to access, maintenance, adoption, custody and guardianship.  By addressing these key issues, we are placing a solid framework around the rights of the child.<\/p> <p> There are a few particular aspects of this legislation that I am particularly pleased with.  For example, I believe it is an important move to ensure that unmarried fathers become guardians of their children automatically.  The Bill provides a clear timeframe whereby the father must have lived with the child's mother for 12 months, including at least three months after the birth of their child, in order to automatically obtain guardianship.  In my view, this places a much greater responsibility on the father, and I am glad to see it happening.<\/p> <p> The emphasis placed on grandparents in this legislation is also important.  I have no doubt that we have all come across cases of grandparents being blocked from seeing a child due to a breakdown in family relationships.  Unfortunately, hostile family break-ups can be a common occurrence, and it is not unusual for the grandparents of a child to perhaps lose contact or find it very difficult to see the child.  What we are now doing is providing grandparents and other relatives with greater access to children when a relationship breaks down.  Previously, grandparents and other relatives would have to go through a two-stage process whereby they would have to apply to the court for leave to make an application for access.  Instead, we are now allowing them to apply directly to the court for access.<\/p> <p> In  conclusion, this legislation provides critical legal support and protection for children who may grow up in a range of different family settings.  It also provides greater clarity on rights of parents and other family members.  It is very comprehensive legislation and it quite rightly recognises the rights of children and families in 21st century Ireland.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on all her work in this area since she took over as Minister for Justice and Equality.  I am delighted the Minister has sat through the entire debate.  I watched from my office the Minister's presence here in the Chamber during the course of the debate.  I believe it is very much appreciated by all the Members and, I am sure, by the public at large.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500045#SS00300","speaker":"1062","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424882100,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, who is sharing time with Deputies Ruth Coppinger and Joan Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500046#TT00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1424882100,"counter":490,"content":"<p>There is no doubt this is a major piece of work and it has been welcomed by many groups and organisations that work with children.  One aspect I want to acknowledge is the way in which this Bill acknowledges the changes and diversities in family life in Ireland.  The traditional married mother and father in the family home with children has been added to by quite a range of family scenarios.  The Central Statistics Office gives us very interesting figures on this.  In the second quarter of 2014, some 36.1% of births were registered as being outside marriage.  There are also figures on children living with lone mothers, with lone fathers, with unmarried cohabiting couples or with same-sex couples, families where a parent has divorced and remarried and families where children are being cared for by grandparents.  That is the diversity in Irish life today.<\/p>  <p>  That is not to undermine or denigrate in any way the traditional family but it is acknowledging the new reality.  That reality needs legislation because children in these non-traditional families have to be provided for so they are not discriminated against.  Irish law needs to reflect these social changes.<\/p>  <p>  I very much welcome the point about grandparents.  In the north inner city, for many children of parents in addiction, the grandparents have been the unsung heroes and heroines at times in their lives when their own children were adults and they should have been looking forward to some respite.  However, because they did not want to see their grandchildren being taken into foster care, they became the parents.  They had long battles with the authorities relating to children's allowance and so on, but most of those issues have been resolved.<\/p>  <p>  Parents separate and, unfortunately, many separations are fraught.  It is the grandparents who often provide stability and comfort.  It has been heartbreaking for many grandparents when one of the parents, usually not their son or daughter, moves into a new relationship because the children's relationship with the grandparents can be a casualty.  Grandparents do not want to lose contact with their grandchildren, regardless of the status of the parental relationship.  They certainly did not need the onerous two-stage procedure they had under the previous legislation, so what is planned here is much more manageable.<\/p>  <p>  I want to spend some time dealing with the issue of unmarried fathers.  We were told that the Bill would enable a wider range of unmarried fathers to become guardians of their children automatically, but I have been meeting unmarried fathers who are very concerned.  Provided he has lived with the child's mother for 12 consecutive months, including at least three with the mother and child following the child's birth, the father will automatically become a guardian.  The difficulty is that a father is a father regardless of how many months or days he spends with the mother, and regardless of the type of relationship he has with the mother.  It has been extremely difficult for many unmarried fathers to play a real fatherly role in the lives of their children because the mother is the ultimate authority.  We know there are fathers who have long, bitter and expensive battles in order to be fathers.<\/p>  <p>  Organisations that work with men in these situations will show that men today tend to be victims of a system that solely benefits the mother.  How can it be in the best interest of the child to deprive it of its father?  Our court system has been guilty of contributing further heartbreak to families.  Fathers can and should play an equal role in raising their children.  The part of the Bill dealing with fathers, especially unmarried fathers, does not go far enough on the issue of equality of parenting.<\/p>  <p>  In Northern Ireland, once the father's name is on the birth certificate, he is then the automatic guardian of his child, but the Republic has denied unmarried fathers this right.  In what is proposed here, the father does not have an automatic right but an earned right, depending on his relationship with the mother.  With this legislation, the partner of the mother, after three years living with her, can become the guardian of the child, regardless of the father's position.  Surely the support should be for the father of the child to be the child's guardian, unless, of course, there are circumstances like violence, abuse or addiction.<\/p>  <p>  There are one-night stands were women become pregnant; they are most unfortunate, but they happen.  That child has the same right to be cared for by both parents as a child born to a married or a cohabiting couple, whereas, with the one-night stand, the mother has automatic custody when she becomes pregnant and the father could face years of legal wrangling to have any say in the life of the child.  Surely we want to see the father playing an active and responsible role in parenting, and I am not sure the Bill addresses this point.  I believe it could worsen the situation of the unmarried father in that particular scenario.  We need laws that ensure fathers act as fathers, rather than laws that prevent them from doing so.<\/p>  <p>  The child has a right to be raised by both parents but often, unfortunately, when separation occurs, there is acrimony and the children can be used like pawns.<\/p><p>It is usually the father who is told he will never see his child again, which is a horrible sentence.  If both parents had equal rights we could prevent that.<\/p> <p> I was made aware of a very distressing situation in which the parents of a child were not married, but were separated.  The mother had a new partner.  She sadly died, but her partner has custody of the child despite the fact that the father also has a fatherly role in the child's life.  He cannot make any decisions for his child.  The guardian could find a new partner who could then have more of a say in the life of the child than the father would.<\/p> <p> That brings me to passport issues for the father and others where another man is a guardian.  The father may have to ask permission from the guardian to take his son or daughter on a holiday abroad.  We know that a mother's new partner can refuse this and restrict access for the father.  Equally, there are questions regarding education.  The Bill seems to cover residence and religious and cultural upbringing where the existing guardian's permission is required.  The Bill is extensive, but education is an important aspect in which the father should have a say.<\/p> <p> There is also a fear factor for separating couples, who may stay together in an unhealthy and negative relationship so that the father does not lose contact or a role in the child's life.  I am not saying all fathers are perfect and want to be involved in their children's lives, but the majority do, and separated fathers have been very badly treated in Irish society.  A mother's new partner, who could be an almost total stranger to a child, could have more rights than a child's father.  We need rigorous background checks on the suitability of partners to be guardians.  A father can end up being a father to another man's son or daughter without being a father to his own son or daughter.<\/p> <p> Continuity and stability are very important in children's lives.  This has to be central to the aspects of the Bill relating to unmarried fathers.  The length of the mother's relationship seems to be the deciding factor, and three years is the magic number.  It takes almost four years to divorce but three years to be the guardian of a child.  <\/p> <p> There are issues with regard to the provisions of the Bill relating to lone parents.  If a mother is in receipt of rent allowance, there are regulations covering overnight stays by a father or boyfriend.  A married father acts jointly with his wife as a legal guardian, but if they divorce or separate he can be undermined by a third party who forms a relationship with his former wife.  The third party can become a third legal guardian, and if decisions have to be made, the mother, together with the new partner, will always outnumber the father.  It is another area where fathers' rights are being ignored.  There are concerns for fathers who are unmarried and separated from the mothers of their children.<\/p> <p> I note the point on the best interests of the child being paramount, and nobody would disagree with that.  When it comes to deciding that, we need more information.  I was a teacher and a guidance counsellor and the Minister was a social worker.  Both of us were in situations in which we made decisions about the best interests of the child.  I know I could disagree with my colleagues on what I felt were the best interests of a child in my school.  The Minister may have been in that situation.  <\/p> <p> I do not know that one can legally define the best interests of the child, but it is a grey area.  Where is the accountability for the person who makes the decision?  Where is the follow-up on the outcomes of those decisions?  The best interests of a child have to be based on fact rather than opinion.  I would hate to see a child put in a situation in which he or she has to choose between parents, unless there is abuse or violence.  <\/p> <p> One of the other positive measures is that dealing with fractious and difficult situations in which parents who have separated obstruct or prevent contact between the child and the other parent.  It is very good that this is being addressed.  There are many positives in this Bill, and that has to be acknowledged.  I again refer to the issues I raised relating to unmarried fathers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500046#TT00300","speaker":"1005","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424882700,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the recognition within the Bill of the diverse range of families we have in this country.  Let us be clear.  It is not that forward-thinking, because for decades there has been diversity in family types in this country.  The Bill is recognising that reality.  For example, there are 308,000 children being raised by lone mothers and about 44,000 children being raised by single fathers.  Almost 400,000 children in the country are being raised outside the idealised scenario that is painted by some of the critics of this Bill and the marriage equality legislation.  Many children are being brought up without a father or a mother in their home.  I welcome the fact that the Bill recognises cohabiting couples, step-parents, grandparents and relations, foster parents and lesbian and gay parents.<\/p>  <p>  The anti-marriage-equality lobby is attacking this Bill and linking it with the upcoming referendum.  According to some in the Iona Institute, we could have mothers marrying their daughters if the likes of this Bill is passed.  These family formations already exist, and the idea that putting a law in place would prevent such families from forming is not correct.  In the past, Ireland, because of its unique history, has had matriarchal families, children raised by relatives and all sorts of family setups due to emigration and the poverty that blighted this country.  The biggest threat to the family in Ireland is the ongoing austerity and poverty which is hitting families and making it extremely difficult for them to exist in a happy and safe place with a roof over their heads.  <\/p>  <p>  While I welcome the Bill, I have some concerns.  Unlike a couple of previous speakers, I would raise a question about automatic guardianship for a father who has lived with a woman for 12 months from the point of view of women in situations of domestic violence.  Women's Aid has highlighted that one in five women in this country are victims of domestic violence, which is quite a lot of women.  Men who are violent and not good fathers could have control that they do not currently have because of this provision on automatic guardianship.  They could be in a position to prevent women from getting passports and so on for their children.  I would like people who raise this matter to demonstrate that there is a problem.  Today I spoke to a family solicitor who assured me that any father who applies for guardianship in the courts gets it unless there is a serious reason he or she should not.  If people are saying otherwise, I would like them to demonstrate that this is the case.  I have a genuine concern about this. <\/p>  <p>  Some 30% of women who experience domestic violence experience it for the first time when they are pregnant.  It is the most dangerous time to be in a such a relationship.  A woman could be with somebody when she is pregnant and leave him after three months.  He would have played no role in the child's life, but would have automatic guardianship because of that short experience.  Many women are single parents for a very good reason, namely, because the birth father is not a good father.  Unfortunately, that is a reality.  I am not for one moment saying that men should not play a role in children's lives; they should.  I do not think any woman would prevent somebody who is a positive influence on a child from playing that role, and no court would do so.  However, I have a concern about automatic custody.  I understand that in Britain one applies at birth for custody.<\/p>  <p>  There is a danger that women could be brought under the orbit of controlling or violent men from whom they are trying to escape, using the children, as they do in such situations.  They would then have to go to court to get a father de-selected as a guardian.  I welcome the idea of a child-centred approach.<\/p><p>It is quite interesting that the other day in this House a case was raised and a school was cited.  For example, the Stay Safe programme was argued to be quite dangerous as it was child-centred and not in line with Catholic ethos.  There was a conflict in the past when too much emphasis was given to families staying together over a child's interest.  I welcome this progress.  I raise a concern regarding women in violent relationships.  Their safety must also be considered, along with that of children, and there can be conflicts in this respect.  I ask that this be taken into account in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>I spoke to some family solicitors and their daily work is in the family courts.  They raised quite a number of criticisms of the way the Bill was written and did not think it was clear.  They argue that there are many difficulties with it.  One which is well known is that courts are not in a position now to deal with all the processes proposed in the Bill.  There would have to be serious levels of investment but there would still be an unbelievable backlog in free legal aid.  If people did not have the means to pay for legal representation and get the best advice, there would be a serious problem.<br\/><br\/>This is a very large Bill and it is not possible to deal with all the elements in five minutes.  I welcome that assisted reproduction is being brought into the equation.  The Bill only deals with offspring created in a clinical setting.  That can raise issues, as many people cannot afford <i>in vitro<\/i>fertilisation and may look at other means to this end.  Such an exclusion might mean a partner would not be entitled to guardianship, which should be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500047#UU00200","speaker":"1195","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424883300,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill in general, and this has been a feature of contributions today and yesterday.  Such an attitude arises from the fact that something needed to be done and we have waited far too long for this to come through.  That was as a result of issues outside of the control even of the Minister and her predecessor, but it is important legislation.  The fact that so many umbrella groups of family and child-centred organisations are supporting it, despite some areas of concern, is an indication that we would be left in limbo, as we have been for the past almost 40 years in the State, without the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  It is complex legislation with 172 sections.  I am not a solicitor or barrister and would not even pretend to say I understand the Bill.  One would almost need somebody to work through all the aspects of the Bill.  It will need serious scrutiny on Committee Stage and examining it with the participation of all Members is very important.  There may be unintended consequences, as mentioned by other Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the main thrust of the Bill in placing the interests of children centre-stage and recognising diversity of family life in modern society.  As I indicated, the Bill is long overdue.  Those who oppose it and the same-sex marriage referendum are attempting to propose a narrow, religiously based view of the family which no longer corresponds to the reality of the family unit today.  It does not reflect the family unit of 30, 40, 50 or 60 years ago either.  How many of us have sat down with family members only to find that an aunt was really somebody else or had to go to Britain to have a child, or that there was a cousin or uncle in Britain, America or Australia?  Children who thought they were reared by their mother have been reared by grandmothers, sisters or aunts.  Family life has always been as complex in Ireland as in any society, because no society in reality has realised the rose-tinted vision of every family being a nuclear family with a married mother and father.  This legislation is required to get us past the first and second steps on the road of putting children's interests first.<\/p>  <p>  There is a requirement for a register of assisted human reproduction donors, and the automatic right of children conceived through that process to access information on the identity of the donor when they are 18 is important.  As others have noted, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has concerns in this respect, so perhaps the Minister will address this when summing up.  Will she take these points on board?  The fact that people cannot get this information until the child turns 18 is a concern.<\/p>  <p>  Although I generally welcome the Bill, I note the concerns that have been raised by various groups about costs for families going through the courts.  Will resources be made available to enable courts to put the interests of children first?  There is also the question of child advocates.  Will they be registered and what level of qualification will be required?  Who will pay them and how will they advocate for children who cannot speak, have not reached speaking age or have disabilities?  How will this link with the family courts, which already have large backlogs of cases?  Much resourcing will have to be provided to family courts to deal with this.  Should we have a children and family court advisory support service, as there is in England and Wales?  What is the Minister's opinion on such an initiative?  Would this be independent of the courts, the social services, education and health authorities?<\/p>  <p>  I am also concerned about some issues related to birth fathers.  I am not convinced of the arguments I have heard and the matter must be teased out.  Everybody deals with complicated family issues each day of the week and each of these can leave grandparents, stepmothers and stepfathers or gay and lesbian people in limbo.  There can be cases of family break-up with no acrimony but other cases may be very acrimonious.  We must take everything into account.<\/p>  <p>  I listened carefully to Deputy Shatter's comments.  I am sure they will be examined with regard to what the Minister is putting in the Bill and if the ideas merge.  As I have indicated, the Bill is welcome but needs serious scrutiny on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500048#VV00200","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1424883300,"counter":495,"content":"<p>We have waited a long time to speak on this Bill in the House, as it is a policy issue that has been discussed at length since this Government was formed four years ago.  There has been divided opinion about the merits of the legislation, because there is divided opinion in the country as a whole as to what this legislation will mean for family life in Ireland.  The Bill recognises the reality of Irish family life as it currently stands.  It takes the cases of families across the island and attempts to put the best interests of children at the heart of the legislation.  It might suit some people to forget that one in four families in Ireland do not consist of a married mother and father with children; they are a blend of all family types.  We cannot ignore such families, and I know the Minister knows that.  I agree with her comments that the best interest of the child is the golden thread running through this Bill.  This holds the Bill together.<\/p>  <p>  Ministers and their civil servants have drafted very forward-looking and comprehensive legislation.  Many of the speeches from the Opposition have centred not on the merits or demerits of the legislation but on the amount of time we expect to spend debating the legislation.  That is just shadow boxing because, over the past four years, we have introduced reforms in how we deal with legislation.  For example, the heads of this Bill went through a public consultation process with the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which held in-depth hearings that were far-reaching and thorough.  There were 38 submissions received by the committee from various interest groups and individuals and, as a result, a report was submitted to the Department in order that the conclusions could be included in the final text of the Bill.<\/p><p>The legislative reform we introduced helps to produce better-quality legislation due to the time and effort a committee can put into teasing out the issues in a legislative measure.<\/p> <p> The Bill recognises lone-parent families, blended families and same-sex couple households, or households headed up by grandparents or other relatives.  This is very positive and reflects the Ireland of today.  It tells children in non-traditional families that they are in households in which they have the same right to be cared for, listened to and nurtured as children in any other family.  That is also positive.<\/p> <p> Concerns have been expressed about adoption and what this Bill will mean for that process.  The adoption process is about what is best for the child and nothing else.  Politicians are not social workers.  It is not for us to make the best call in cases in which children are being placed into foster or adoptive homes.  That is the work of social services, and that is where the experts are.  These people are trained to deal with those decisions, and they are best left to them.<\/p> <p> One of the other provisions of the Bill allows for cohabitant partners, one of whom is not the biological parent of a child, to be officially recognised as parents by the State.  The legislation sets a minimum period of three years of cohabitation with the partner and child for that to happen.  It is very likely that after three years the child would be calling the parent \"Mum\" or \"Dad\" anyway, so it is fitting that the State should recognise this.  There is no issue with that.<\/p> <p> Undoubtedly, there will be time to tease out the issues relating to this legislation on Committee Stage.  I commend the Minister's work on this and we all support her in it.  We hope to see the legislation passed as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500048#VV00300","speaker":"1076","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424883900,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Children and Family Relationships Bill.  In the programme for Government we made a commitment to modernise and reform outdated elements of family law.  As the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, stated, when enacted, the Bill will be a watershed in the development of Irish family law and will align it with the realities of modern Irish family life.  It is clear that the current law does not adequately address the many diverse family situations that exist in Ireland today.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is centred on the child and will address the needs of children who are living in diverse family situations.  It also clear that the Bill will ensure that the child's best interests are served, regardless of the family type.  It acknowledges that children, regardless of family type, have a fundamental right to security and stability in their lives.  Children have a right to clarity and transparency on the rules of parentage, guardianship and access.  I wholeheartedly agree with the Minister's comment that children need to know that there is someone who has a legal duty to care for them.<\/p>  <p>  As Members know from their daily constituency work, family life in Ireland has changed dramatically since the Guardianship of Infants Act was enacted in 1964, over 51 years ago.  The census of 2011 confirmed that the traditional fabric of family life in Ireland is changing.  Over 215,000 families are headed by lone parents and 44% of parents have never married.  There are more than 49,000 households of cohabiting couples with children under 15 years of age, and this figure has risen by over 40% since 2006 and is continuing to rise.  It is clear from the census that a significant number of children are living in household types other than those headed by married parents.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will address a wide range of family situations in Ireland today, including situations in which children are reared within married families, in lone-parent households, by same-sex couples or by grandparents or other relatives, and children who have been born through assisted human reproduction.  It will have a positive impact on Irish family life, not only for the children but also for people who have a legal responsibility in the care of children.  Features of the Bill which I support and welcome include the provision enabling a larger range of unmarried fathers to become guardians of their children automatically.  A father who has lived with the child's mother for 12 consecutive months, including at least three months with the mother and child following the child's birth, will automatically become a guardian.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will enable grandparents and other relatives to have access more easily in the event of a relationship breakdown and will allow them to apply directly to the court for access, unlike the current system which requires a two-stage process whereby they must apply to the courts for leave to make an application for access.  As a grandparent, and like many thousands of grandparents throughout the country, I am delighted that access to grandchildren will now be more straightforward.  The Bill will also enable a relative to apply for custody of a child.  In addition, a parent's spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of not less than three years can also apply for custody where he or she has shared the parenting of a child for two years.  <\/p>  <p>  The Bill allows a person to apply for custody if he or she has parented a child for a year and if there is no parent or guardian willing or able to exercise the powers and responsibilities of guardianship.  It will enable the birth mother and the partner to register the birth of the child jointly, rather than requiring them to undertake court proceedings to establish parentage.  It will also enable civil partners and cohabiting couples who have lived together for three years to be eligible to apply jointly to adopt.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, I fully support the Bill and commend the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on her introduction of the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500049#WW00200","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1424883900,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this far-reaching and reforming legislation.  It is necessary to update our family law based on the social reality of modern family life.  We are simply ensuring that our legislation catches up with the modern composition of families.  Ultimately, our job is to legislate and provide clarity and certainty, as far as practically possible, for all families regardless of their composition.<\/p>  <p>  The Children's Rights Alliance has provided statistics relating to the composition of modern families.  They show the number of children living in diverse family types.  There are 308,000 children living with 186,284 lone parents, 104,665 children living with 60,269 unmarried cohabiting couples and 43,887 children living with 29,031 lone fathers.  In addition, there are 230 same-sex couples living with children.  However, if one were to listen to and heed the media coverage of this legislation, one would swear that it sought to deal only with same-sex couples with children.  There are 42,960 people who have divorced and remarried, and of these, 66% of remarried women and 22% of remarried men live in a household with children.

While much of the debate today has dealt with and focused on the adoption provision for same-sex couples, the reality of the existing adoption law and current practice is that a sole applicant can be considered for an adoption order.  That has been the case since the Adoption Act 1991.  In that Act there is no reference to the sexual orientation of the applicant, so a sole applicant in a same-sex relationship has been eligible to apply for an adoption order for the past two decades, subject to his or her having the capacity to parent a child into adulthood.  This Bill is reflecting in law what is currently happening in practice.<\/p><p>Listening to comment in the media, however, one would not think that was the case.<br\/><br\/>The most reforming provisions and the most substantive content of the Bill are in the area of guardianship.  It is important that clarity be brought to the assignment of parentage in different types of family.  The reality is that there has been a lack of clarity on the status of children and parents who do not fall within the traditional family setup.  The most significant innovation is the provision for a court-appointed guardian.  This Bill will ensure that children in non-marital and non-traditional families will be in a position to enjoy a legal relationship with the person who provides them with day-to-day parental care.  The new guardianship provisions extend parenting rights to four categories of person: step-parents, civil partners, cohabitees living with a biological parent for three years and co-parenting the child for two years, and people <i>in loco parentis<\/i>for a period of 12 months where no other guardian is able to act.  For cohabiting parents, the requirement is that they must have been living together for three years and co-parenting for two years.  I understand that guardianship is automatic for civil partners.  Will the Minister clarify this?  The provision relating to people acting <i>in loco parentis<\/i>for 12 months benefits grandparents and aunts and uncles who are providing care.  These are family members who step in when there is a derogation of duties or the care is substandard or not provided at all.  It would be helpful if the Minister were to provide clarity on the parameters of this relief. <br\/><br\/>What happens to a grandparent who provides care for 12 months and successfully applies for guardianship if, after a number of years, the original or biological parent, an alcoholic or drug addict dealing with substance abuse who could not provide care, is rehabilitated?  This parent is now in a position to resume care of the child and wishes to provide that care.  The parent wishes to exercise his or her constitutional rights.  Will the Minister confirm what happens in terms of guardianship in such an instance?<br\/><br\/>The provision dealing with temporary guardianship is also interesting.  This will occur where a parent is incapacitated for a period of time - for example, as a result of serious injuries sustained in a car crash - and is unable to parent the child.  My understanding is that a temporary guardian can be appointed where it is proved to the court that the parent is incapacitated and that the applicant for temporary guardianship is a fit and proper person to parent a child.  I imagine that this will eliminate the need for certain children to enter the care system.  If a sibling of a parent were to make an application for temporary guardianship, it would alleviate the need for State intervention.  If this is the case, it is to be welcomed.  At the moment, there is a chronic shortage of social workers.  Further, State intervention should only occur in family life where there is a genuine need for child protection services.  I have always stated that it should be a last resort.  Will the Minister confirm whether my thinking on temporary guardianship is correct?<br\/><br\/>The legislation provides for the voice of the child to be heard in all legal proceedings and places the best interests of the child at the centre of such proceedings.  These are provisions on which we voted two years ago in the children's rights referendum.  I welcome the elaboration of the best interests test set out in the Bill.  This should lead to greater transparency in judicial proceedings.  The current level of inconsistency in judicial proceedings is a major concern.  Although the <i>in camera<\/i>rule may have been relaxed, we need greater reform of our court system and, in particular, of our family courts.  This promise was made in the programme for Government, and a Bill on court reform is in the Government's legislative programme.  While I welcome this legislation, its full implementation may not be possible without broader family court reform.  The Minister might address the need to reform the family court system in her concluding remarks.  I am sure the Minister agrees that there is a need to reform the family courts, and I hope that such reform will be prioritised.<br\/><br\/>The Bill provides for a child expert who will reflect the views of the child in all court proceedings.  I am concerned that the appointment of such an expert is left at the discretion of the courts.  Further, the cost of the expert must be paid by the parties to the proceedings.  Does this mean that children whose parents cannot afford a child expert may be excluded from the decision making process?  This is my reading of the provision.  This Bill seems to favour those with financial resources and potentially discriminates against low-income families.  It is, arguably, in breach of a constitutional requirement on which we voted in November 2012 when we enshrined the rights of all children in our Constitution.  These rights should apply regardless of means.<br\/><br\/>I am surprised that there is no reference to the &quot;GALs&quot;.  This would have been an opportunity to streamline the system of guardians<i>ad litem<\/i>.  The costs to the State of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>are excessive.  This would have been an opportunity to bring in comprehensive reforms to ensure an effective and efficient service which would genuinely serve the interests of the child.  This needs to be addressed urgently.  <br\/><br\/>The Bill also amends the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act.  I am delighted to see the provision ensuring that a guardian is liable to provide maintenance, because with rights come responsibilities.  This is very important.<br\/><br\/>The Bill also includes far-reaching provisions to make parenting orders work.  At the moment, a parent who breaches a court order cannot be sanctioned other than through criminal law.  This introduces a compensatory time provision requiring a parent who breaches the access order to compensate the parent whose rights have been infringed with additional time.  This should help eliminate unnecessary litigation and is a welcome provision.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the fact that a national register of donor-conceived persons is included in the provisions dealing with assisted human reproduction.  I have constantly underlined the importance of a child's right to his or her identity.<\/p><p>The Minister will know this from her previous role as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I have spoken about the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and a child&rsquo;s right to his or her identity.  It is very important and this provision is welcome.<\/p> <p> The basic rights of children conceived through assisted human reproduction are consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under Articles 7 and 8 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.<\/p> <p> I am somewhat disappointed by the manner in which unmarried fathers&rsquo; rights are addressed in this Bill.  The Bill does not comprehensively address the right of a child to know and have a relationship with the biological father.  The provision of automatic guardianship applies where the biological father has been living with the mother for 12 consecutive months, three of which must be after the birth of the child.  There are a number of problems with this provision.  The first concerns the definition of \"cohabiting\".  Does it involve a couple who share a room or house for three or four nights per week?  Will it be specified that a couple needs to be sharing a house for seven nights a week?  Is that cohabiting?  Must the couple be joint owners of a property or hold a joint lease?  What exactly is cohabiting?  I do not know, and I stand to be corrected, but it does not appear to be defined in the legislation.  The lack of a definition is a weakness and there could be court cases unless this is addressed.<\/p> <p> The legislation seems to revolve around the father&rsquo;s relationship with the mother rather than with the child.  Surely, when talking about legislation that pioneers the best interest of the child, the focus should be on the relationship between the father and the child.  I know, and am sure the Minister knows, many cases in which a father and mother have an outrageous, unbelievably bad relationship, but that does not make either a bad person.  The legislation concentrates excessively on the relationship between the father and mother.<\/p> <p> Under the current legislation, on the birth of the child the unmarried father and mother can agree the appointment of the father as a guardian.  Unfortunately, there is no central register of such declarations.  I support the call from Treoir for the establishment of such a register.  Given the significance of guardianship, it is imperative that there be a central register to ensure such declarations are maintained.<\/p> <p> The legislation should go further, as suggested by the Law Reform Commission, by providing automatic guardianship rights to all biological fathers, except in exceptional circumstances, having regard to the relationship and circumstances of the birth.  I refer to phenomena such as rape.  We can all agree that a father should not have an automatic right in the case of rape, for example.  Beyond that, however, there should be an automatic entitlement to guardianship.<\/p> <p> The presumption should be in favour of granting a right of guardianship to all fathers, but this should be retractable in cases of rape and other such cases.  For the legislation to be effective, and as suggested by the Law Reform Commission in its consultation paper on this issue, there should be a compulsory requirement to name a father on the birth certificate.  This would ensure that rights given are commensurate with responsibilities.  The Minister for Social Protection alluded previously to the fact that it would be a requirement to name a father on the birth certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500049#WW00500","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424885100,"counter":503,"content":"<p>It is now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500051#YY00200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1424885100,"counter":504,"content":"<p>That is welcome.

The Minister might point out what happens where guardianship has been approved, perhaps for a grandparent, aunt or uncle, because of an addiction problem experienced by a biological parent.  If the biological parent wants to resume custody and guardianship, what is the position? <br\/><br\/>Let me refer to the timeline for the commencement of this legislation.  National vetting legislation was passed by the Houses a number of years ago but the commencement order has yet to be signed.  While we can debate the Bill in this Chamber and in the Seanad, it is ultimately the responsibility of the Government to sign it.  We need a commitment that it will be signed very quickly after it has been debated here in the Houses.  We will be proposing amendments to do with unmarried biological fathers.  For the most part, the Minister seems to be genuinely interested and she is usually very forthcoming and takes on board suggestions from this side of the House.  I ask her to take mine on board.  The focus should not be on the relationship between the father and mother.  There are exceptionally good fathers who just may not have a good relationship with the mother.

It is about putting in place legal protections and supports for the reality that faces many families across the State today.  Deputy Troy and other speakers stated that in Ireland, according to the latest census, there were 49,005 households of cohabiting couples with children in 2011.  Some 36% of children are born outside marriage.  The figures are worth putting in context.  Almost 352,000 children live with lone parents, 104,665 children live with unmarried cohabiting parents, and there are 230 same-sex couples with children.<\/p>  <p>  Families in today's Ireland are diverse.  The traditional model of married parents and children, under which many of us grew up, is still the most common form of family life in the State, but it is not the only one.<\/p><p>The reality of family life today is that children are parented by biological parents, non-biological parents, other family members and partners, and parents' civil partners.  Under our laws currently, there is inadequate provision for the needs of all those children and their families, and we all agree that must change.<br\/><br\/>Our outdated legal structure and archaic family law provisions must be modernised, reformed and updated to take account of the reality.  It is no longer tenable to assert that Irish law should continue to ignore the various family forms that we now know are a reality in society.  Our modern laws should be about protecting families and protecting and safeguarding children.  That is the purpose of this Bill.  <br\/><br\/>This Government had the first Minister with responsibility for children at Cabinet, a children's rights referendum, and this legislation.  That is why it is important that we continue that work.  The Bill is child-centred, and we all want to protect and safeguard the child.  It continues the constitutional preference for families based on marriage, but at the same time it is providing essential legal certainty for all families, whatever their official status.  That is a welcome reform, and a radical overhaul.  It will create new rights for parents, both biological and social, grandparents, anyone <i>in loco parentis<\/i>to children and, most critically, children themselves.  This Bill is about safeguarding the rights of all families, just as should be provided for in a modern, caring society.<br\/><br\/>There has been much debate and scaremongering about this legislation, which is unfounded.  Let us be clear from the very start.  This Bill does not commodify children.  It does not undermine the right of a child to a mother and father, and it does not interrupt the natural ties between parents and children.  The Bill does not do anything to reduce or limit the rights of natural parents.  It is putting in context a new framework.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note at the outset that there is no right, under domestic or international law, for a person to adopt a child.  A person may adopt as a sole applicant in a process of consideration.  In determining the application of a sole applicant, it is not permissible to discriminate on the basis of the potential adopter's sexual orientation.  It must be pointed out, also, that every application is assessed based on the best interests of the child.  None of us can adopt automatically.  It must be in the best interests of the child, not the person or persons seeking to adopt.  That point has been lost in the debate.<br\/><br\/>What is the story with adoption in Ireland today?  In the ten years between 2004 and 2013 there were 3,832 applications for declarations of eligibility and suitability.  Of those, 94% were from married couples, only 6% were from sole or single applicants, and only two of those single applicants were men.  When it comes to inter-country adoptions, over the period 2003 to 2014, 3,460 of these were registered in Ireland.  Of those, 3,286 adoptions were to married couples and 179 were to single applicants.  Of those 179 single applicants, 178 were women.  Despite the fact that under Irish law as it stands today, gay and lesbian people are eligible to apply to adopt on their own, just like any adult in this country, the number of single applicants is very small.<br\/><br\/>There is an opportunity as this Bill progresses to raise awareness about what already happens under Irish law.  In Ireland currently, lesbian and gay people can apply to be considered for adoption on the same grounds as any other person in the State.  Lesbian and gay couples are fostering successfully, and they are playing a pivotal role in that regard.  We sometimes see young children from challenging backgrounds being fostered in a caring and loving home and being made feel very welcome.  Lesbian and gay couples are raising their children in Ireland today.  That is the reality.  It did not just happen yesterday or last week.  It is happening in every village and town across our country.  Those lesbian and gay men and women who are parents will still be parents regardless of this Bill, but the Bill will ensure that the children in these families have equal legal rights.<br\/><br\/>Currently, a lesbian or gay person can apply to be considered for adoption but a lesbian and gay couple are not allowed to apply jointly, even if they are in a civil partnership.  That is a gap in the law which has not caught up with the passing of civil partnership legislation, and which this Bill will address.  This law ensures that the guiding principle of the adoption process is what is in the best interest of the child.  No matter who is allowed to apply to be considered for adoption, this principle will remain.  The main point will be what is in the best interests of the child.  I worry when I hear some opponents of the Bill talking about watering down that principle and inserting preferred options, regardless of what is in the best interest of the child.  Those proposals are leading to scaremongering tactics, which are not helping this debate.  The proposals by opponents of the Bill are profoundly worrying and would lead to outcomes that are not in the best interests of the child.  For example, if a lesbian or gay couple have fostered a child long-term and that child becomes eligible for adoption, surely it would be in the best interests of the child for that couple to be allowed to apply to adopt him or her.<br\/><br\/>In 2012, a Northern Ireland High Court judge held that an outright ban on adoption by civil partners and unmarried couples in Northern Ireland infringed the European Convention on Human Rights, and that while single gay people could potentially adopt, a civil partner could not adopt jointly or even as an individual.  He concluded that this was contrary to the convention.<br\/><br\/>Under the Bill, civil partners are to be permitted to adopt children jointly, and it is proposed that the same criteria be applied to them as to married couples.  While the Adoption Act 2010 allows adoption by a sole applicant, joint adoption is only possible where the adopters are married to each other.  While in principle there is nothing to prevent a person who is a civil partner or a person who is gay or lesbian from adopting as a sole applicant, it is not possible for civil partners to adopt jointly.<br\/><br\/>If adoption is about the best interests of the child, we should place that above the marital status or sexual orientation of the potential adoptive parents.  We must continue to ensure that the primary and overriding consideration in determining whether an adoption should be facilitated is whether the adoption serves to advance the welfare of the child.  This is about providing a loving, caring home for a child.  It is about providing a place where children can grow and prosper, be equipped with the necessary skills and be taught values to allow them reach their potential in a world that can pose many challenges.  The changes that are being introduced will allow children to be adopted into homes and families that are founded upon committed, loving and stable relationships.  To me, that is always a positive thing.<br\/><br\/>Assisted human reproduction, AHR, is an advance of our modern world that has allowed a great many families in this area to enjoy and celebrate the gift of a child or children, but sometimes that simple and extraordinary fact is lost when people publicly debate the issue.  It is regrettable that Ireland is one of the few countries that has not yet legislated and regulated for the reality of AHR.  Every year approximately 3,000 babies are born in Ireland as a result of IVF and other high-tech interventions.  That is a reality, and it is occurring every day without a proper legal framework.  While the medical aspect of AHR is covered by medical ethics and practices, the legal aspects have been ignored.  As a Legislature and as a society, we have failed to openly face up to and address that reality.<br\/><br\/>It is more than a decade since the then Government set up a Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction. That commission was to advise on how the area could be regulated.  It is now over six years since that group reported but since then, despite promises, nothing has happened.<\/p><p>This was a failure of politics to address the desires of so many families, men and women, citizens of our State.  It was a failure to support them in their quest to have children.<\/p> <p> In this Bill the Minister is proposing to put an end to anonymous donation for AHR.  The idea behind this is that every child should have access to his or her genetic identity.  Ideally this should be the case, but there are related issues that we should take into account.  We must look at how our laws interact with those of other countries.  How do our laws affect what is already happening here or what has already happened?  How will our laws affect access by people who want to be mothers and fathers to the benefits of technology in helping them to have a family?<\/p> <p> In Ireland today there is virtually no embryo donation using sperm or eggs donated in Ireland.  I understand that it occurs in a handful of cases, usually involving family members or friends.  Sperm and egg donations are mostly from Denmark and Ukraine, where donation is or can be anonymous.  People who travel for egg donation go to Spain or the Czech Republic, where donation is anonymous.  I ask the Minister and her officials to examine this as we progress the Bill through the House.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I received correspondence from and had meetings with members of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists who have raised this issue with me.  I am not in a position to make their evaluation, but I hope we can examine their concerns and address them on either Committee Stage or Report Stage.  The last thing we want to have is unwanted or unintended consequences.  There are also concerns about the impact of these changes on women and families who have already commenced the process of using AHR.  We should carefully consider the timelines in facilitating people to continue with something that has already started.<\/p> <p> Concerns have been raised with me about how different couples might be treated under the changes proposed by this Bill, and the retrospective application of presumptions regarding parentage.  It has been suggested to me that, for example, a lesbian couple using AHR would have to apply to court for both women to be named as parents, but for a heterosexual couple this would be facilitated automatically.  Perhaps this is something the Minister might clarify in her reply to this debate.  The Bill is about creating families, and I hope that arbitrary distinctions between couples can be avoided.  The legal structures we are putting in place concerning AHR are long overdue.  All people, whatever their views on AHR, should welcome the fact that regulations are finally being put in place.<\/p> <p> This Bill does not undermine the traditional marital family.  It is putting in place legal structures to support and protect the various forms of family and the blended families that are part of today's Ireland.  It is not about taking away rights or supports.  It is about ensuring that these supports are available to all families.  The Bill is not about replacing or usurping biological parents.  It is about putting in place custody and guardianship arrangements that take account of the diverse family arrangements that exist in Irish society today.  It is not taking away the company and care given to children by biological parents.  It is putting in place structures so that in situations in which children are cared for, loved and supported by someone other than, or in addition to, a genetic parent, that person and the child's dependence on and relationship with that person are legally supported and protected.<\/p> <p> Children have the right to an identity in terms of culture and family, and also genetically.  This Bill is safeguarding all of those aspects.  In cases of assisted human reproduction, it is explicitly providing that in this country every child will have access to information about who their genetic parents are.  This is not about hiding from anything or about sweeping reality under the carpet.  It is about facing reality and providing structure for what is already happening.<\/p> <p> I will briefly refer to the marriage equality referendum which will be held in May.  I am doing this to explicitly state that it is distinct and separate from this Bill.  Whatever one's views on the referendum, I appeal to those commenting on or opposing this legislation to remember that the Bill before us is important and requires and merits our separate attention.<\/p> <p> We need to address the issues of identity, parenting and assisted human reproduction, as well as putting in place legal structures to support all forms of family.  The issues we are debating today are important to those outside the House who are listening to the debate and watching how we vote.  The Bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation we will pass in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  These issues have a much wider implication; they do not just pertain to same-sex couples.  They are equally, if not more, relevant to opposite-sex, heterosexual couples.  Primarily, this is about catering for relationships between men and women.  These relationships form the vast majority of relationships that exist outside our current definition of marriage.  After this Bill is passed and after the referendum, the provisions of this Bill will affect every heterosexual couple.  It is they who make up the majority, and they want to see this Bill enacted.<\/p> <p> I feel privileged to be able to support this legislation.  Without wishing to sound patronising, I am proud that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, was the first Minister with responsibility for children at Cabinet.  She has brought this Bill before us, and it cannot be undermined in any shape or form by those who try to oppose, obfuscate and confuse.  This is about affording protection to children under our laws, and that is why the legislation is so important.  If we are to take Maslow's hierarchy of needs, whereby we all begin by seeking safety and move towards finally reaching self-actualisation, this Bill fits those criteria.<\/p> <p> I hope every citizen will be proud of the Oireachtas for enacting this Bill.  It is long overdue and absolutely necessary.  The lives of our citizens are complex, but this child-centred Bill will give certainty in dealing with the lives of those in many different forms of family.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500051#YY00600","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424886300,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an mBille t&aacute;bhachtach seo.<\/p>  <p>  It is the case, and has been for quite some time, that the family as understood by those who framed our Constitution and those who were at the helm of the State for decades is a faulty, outdated and ultimately useless idea which betrays more about the social conservatism of those who espouse it than it promotes healthy family relationships and good law.<\/p>  <p>  Irish social policy has been profoundly damaging in its approach to families, including children, women and even men, particularly some fathers.  This Bill is a major moment for reform of these wrongs but, like all steps in the right direction, it is not without its flaws and limitations.  One disappointing thing about the Bill is that we have had to wait so long for something so basically fair, which simply allows people to live their lives and be a family with fair recognition in law.  It is particularly shocking that it has taken this long when one considers that the shortcomings of the State in this regard have touched every family in the Twenty-six Counties.  We have all been victims to a greater or lesser degree of this prevailing ideology of denial and repression of our humanity when expressed outside the clearly defined lines handed to us by those who were often better at acting piously than living thus.<\/p>  <p>  However, we cannot blame this Government for the failings of previous ones, and so we welcome this Bill.  Certainly, it is better late than never to have these reforms.  It is unfortunate that the Bill has been introduced so close to the campaign for equal marriage rights for same-sex couples.  It has given those who wish to muddy the waters, confuse the public and sow misinformation an opportunity that they have leapt upon.  If one only listened to some commentators who are invited on TV and radio to trot out antiquated notions of how men and women should live, one would easily be led to believe that this Bill was seeking to deny children parents, to remove rights from people, and to cast Ireland into some kind of immoral mire on which the sky would surely fall.<\/p><p>The reality is that there always have been and always will be same-sex couples in Ireland.  They are no different, by and large, from any other couples and for some time they have been able to adopt, although not formally as a couple.  This legislation will formalise their ability to be a parental unit to their adopted children and so provide children with a recognised two-parent family under law.<br\/><br\/>This is not an insignificant piece of legislation in what it seeks to achieve or the depth into which it goes on these topics, and I understand these things cannot be rushed.  With more than 170 sections, it provides an extension of guardianship, custody and adoption rights to different types of family.  Couples who live together, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation, will now be able to provide a loving home for a child.  That is what family means in 2015.  It is not about laws, genes, religious rites or strict ideas of how people should live.  It is primarily about a loving home, especially where a child is involved.<br\/><br\/>The Bill and the ideas behind it are not about gay rights, but about all our rights as equals to have and to be part of a loving family, and to have that recognised and respected rather than denied and vilified for not meeting someone else's code.  I also welcome that the Bill deals with leave for parents in cases where leave would previously have been unavailable or difficult to obtain.<br\/><br\/>Despite all these positives, the Bill fails to go far enough in ensuring fair and equal treatment of fathers in disputes over custody.  While adopted children's rights must be protected and enhanced, most of the children who have been affected by Ireland's failure to update family law have been children born to unmarried parents.  The problem has not been that their parents were not married but that the State was ill prepared to deal with the legal outworkings of these relationships with regard to custody.<br\/><br\/>Even when the State had stopped locking up unmarried pregnant girls, it still fell woefully short of treating them fairly and with compassion or including the fathers, their rights and their responsibilities.  The birth of children outside marriage is ten times more common today than the last time these issues where dealt with in Irish law in the 1960s.  The result of this is a lack of any rights for unmarried fathers.  While women in nearly every case in our society are structurally disadvantaged compared with men, in the case of family law, guardianship and custody, men can get first-hand experience of gender discrimination.  I believe this is a result of a society that saw child-rearing as women's work, and this attitude has not been updated in our law despite the emergence of divorce and separation rights as well as the increasing number of children born outside marriage.  Fathers are now very real victims of this discrimination and so are their children.  Conservatives, who said divorce would mean &quot;Bye Bye Daddy,&quot; did not know how right they were, but it was their own outdated notions of family, of men and women, and of mothers and fathers that allowed this problem to develop.  The law simply ignored how society was changing and the new challenges that it needed to deal with.  Governments and the political elite ignored it, as they were also wedded to these conservative notions.<br\/><br\/>Colette Brown yesterday wrote an excellent article dealing with the issue of fathers' rights.  She perfectly described how, on a daily basis, this lack of rights impinges on a father's ability to care for his child and damages the child.  She wrote:<blockquote>It means that if your partner is away and your child falls ill, you cannot authorise medical treatment.  It means that if your relationship breaks up and your partner decides to move abroad with your child, you are powerless to stop her.  It also means that you have no automatic right to custody or access to your child.  By law, the mother is entitled to sole custody of the child if the father has not been made a guardian.  Imagine a worst-case scenario in which your partner dies and you are left alone to care for your child.  You would have to mount a court battle just to be entitled to care for your own child.<\/blockquote>This is not a new story.  We have all heard of these battles by fathers over the years to have the right to be a parent to their child, but it has taken a very long time and still we have not concluded the matter.  I welcome that the Bill seeks to address this issue.  Unmarried fathers will be now given automatic guardianship rights if they have lived with their child's mother continuously for a year, including three months after the birth, but why should we have such a specific cohabitation requirement that would seem to rule out many fathers who should have that right?  In 1982 the Law Reform Commission advised that there should be an automatic right to guardianship, yet 33 years later we still cannot even do that.  This is not equality and perpetuates discrimination against unmarried fathers.  The Minister describes this as a test of responsibility, but in some cases, for a father to have his own place separate from the mother in order to keep their child from the difficulties they may have is often the most responsible thing he can do.  An unmarried father's rights should not hinge on his ability to live with the mother of his child.  In other cases it is simply not a possibility.  The Bill operates in a reality completely separate from the one in which we live - in the midst of a housing crisis where young people cannot find housing for any reasonable price or quality in most cases.  Should the conditions of the home suffer so that a father can cohabit in order to get his right to guardianship?  This requirement has the potential to cause much familial strife and strain.  Fathers, whom this Bill will not help, can supposedly be given rights through a statutory declaration, but there is no register of these documents in place and no plans to have such a register.  Resources, as always, are to blame.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been clear on this issue.  We need a register to provide protection for the statutory declaration documents that grant guardianship rights to unmarried fathers in respect of their children.<br\/><br\/>Sinn F&eacute;in has raised other issues with this Bill which we will seek to correct on further Stages.  The family law courts are in need of serious reform and modernisation as well as better resourcing.  At present they are not equipped to deal with the increasing number of family law cases that arise.  Low-income families also must be provided with better access to the courts in cases in which they do not fall into the bracket to qualify for free legal aid.<br\/><br\/>We also want to see the establishment of a comprehensive court welfare service.  This would organise the carrying out of assessments of a child's welfare and best interests and ascertain his or her views, while also carrying out family risk assessments.  It would also ensure, where appropriate, that supports and services are available to the child and family, such as mediation services and child contact centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500053#AAA00200","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424886900,"counter":512,"content":"<p>What is considered to be the family in modern Ireland is very different from how it was traditionally viewed when I was growing up.  We need radical and inclusive legislation to reflect this new reality.<\/p>  <p>  In the main, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Bill and recognises that it will finally modernise Irish law regarding children living in diverse family norms.  We have concerns about some of the provisions within the Bill and we will seek to amend them in an effort to enhance and make this legislation more inclusive to those who have previously been excluded.<\/p>  <p>  This is not simple or straightforward legislation.  It has more than 170 sections and it mainly focuses on extending guardianship, custody and adoption rights to different types of family, which is welcome and positive.  It is unfortunate that the Bill has taken so long to get here and is passing through the Oireachtas during this timeframe.  I think we all accept that the timing is particularly bad.<\/p>  <p>  As this particular Children and Family Relationships Bill has now become synonymous with a same-sex couples adoption Bill, it means that some of those campaigning for a \"No\" vote in the marriage equality referendum will attempt to confuse, obfuscate and bewilder people when speaking about the right of same-sex couples to adopt.<\/p><p>The reality is that this already happens in Ireland except that just one parent in a same-sex relationship currently has a legal relationship with the child.  This Bill quite simply extends the right of lesbian and gay couples jointly to adopt a child.  It is always worth qualifying that the upcoming referendum has nothing to do with adoption or parental laws.  I support the sections of the Bill which enable civil partners and cohabiting couples who have lived together for three years to apply jointly to adopt.  This is something they can only do on an individual basis currently.  Thankfully, this Bill means that children living in non-marital and non-traditional families will now be in a position to enjoy a legal relationship with the person who provides them with day-to-day parental care, whoever that may be.  We all know of those types of family units.  This is extremely important.  The Proclamation of the Irish Republic in 1916 promised to \"cherish all the children of the nation equally\".  No doubt, we will celebrating that process.  It was about freedom but it was also about an inclusive Ireland.  For far too long, we have discriminated against children from so-called non-traditional families and have not afforded them their full rights because of the supposed sexual orientation or marital status of their parents.<\/p> <p> Many of us in this House will have major concerns with this Bill.  All of us have been lobbied by groups representing unmarried fathers and since my time in office, many unmarried fathers and the Tallaght Unmarried Fathers group have consistently visited my constituency office.  I know there is a group in Dundalk and other groups around the country.  They are talking about how they want to be included in their child's lives but many of them are excluded.  This Bill opened up a golden opportunity created to rectify some of the grossly unfair treatment faced by many unmarried fathers in the law.  Sadly, that issue has been sidelined, brushed aside, ignored and left out.  Sinn F&eacute;in would like to see the establishment of a central register for statutory declarations for joint guardianship to provide protection for the statutory declaration documents which grant guardianship rights to unmarried fathers in respect of their children.  Currently, around 24,000 children are born every year with no legal or statutory relationship with their birth fathers.  In my experience, many parents initially but mistakenly believe that having a father's name on a birth certificate gives him guardianship rights.  This misinformation and misguided belief has had major adverse consequences for many children and their fathers.<\/p> <p> One particular worry I have is the cohabitation section, which was mentioned by my colleague.  A father living with the child's mother for 12 consecutive months, including at least three months with the mother and the child following the child's birth, will automatically become a guardian, but in many cases this is simply not possible and this section does not reflect reality, especially considering our current housing crisis and high emigration figures.  Sometimes mothers are still living with their parents.  It depends on age and other circumstances.  It is not always appropriate or indeed possible for the father to live there as well.  This is often the case with teenage or unplanned pregnancies.  It does not always mean that the father is in any way shirking his responsibilities or not stepping up to the plate when it comes to rearing the child.  In many cases, the circumstances are just not in his favour.  Additionally, an increasing amount of fathers are being forced to work away from home and abroad in order to provide for the children yet this provision acts against them.  There is nothing in the Bill for unmarried fathers aside from this provision regarding cohabiting for the requisite amount of time.  Everyone else will continue to have to resort to the courts if the mother does not agree to sign a statutory declaration for joint guardianship.  When I was growing up, I was in the lucky position of having a mother and father who were married but for many years in the early years of my life, my father worked abroad because there was no work in Ireland at the time.  That did not mean that he loved me less.  He still had that huge involvement in my life and is one of the people in my life I will never forget.  In line with other jurisdictions such as Northern Ireland, Great Britain, many European countries and Australia, unmarried fathers should have automatic rights to their children when registering the birth.  This is an area that Sinn F&eacute;in will certainly seek to strengthen.<\/p> <p> We also would support the establishment of a comprehensive court welfare service to support the roll-out of this legislation.  This service would provide an appropriate mechanism to carry out assessments of the child's welfare and best interests and ascertain his or her views while also carrying out family risk assessments.  It would also ensure, where appropriate, that supports and services are available to the child and family such as mediation services and child contact centres.<\/p> <p> The Bill will be judged by many on who it includes and excludes.  Sadly, many will feel let down, left out and left behind.  I think an opportunity was missed.  I empathise with the Minister.  If she tried to include many things, would we be pushing it nearer the referendum?  If it is possible, we should look at the anomalies and gaps in this Bill at some stage in this House.  It is like dealing with any issue.  If you leave someone or a group behind, it is unfair.  We are including people in this Bill but by not legislating for those we have left out, we are leaving them behind.  It was a missed opportunity.  Perhaps the Minister might address some of the issues we raised in her reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500054#BBB00200","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424887500,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I warmly welcome this new, radical legislation and will be strongly supporting it.  It is a major and historic Bill that is child-centred and addresses the needs of children in diverse families.  That is the direction we should go in this country.  It will provide for access to parentage, guardianship, custody and access across a range of family situations that are not covered in current law.  This is the important thing in this legislation and what is important when we talk about the rights of children and the new situations in which families find themselves in Ireland in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  We must emphasise the importance of putting children and families first.  It is appropriate for us to look at the situations in which some families and children live.  When we talk about putting children's rights at the heart of legislation, we must also point out that the number of children living in poverty must be dealt with.  The rate has increased from 7.7% in 2012 to 8.2%, which is a national scandal.  A total of 1.4 million people or 31% of the population are unable to afford basic items.  There are 135,000 children in poverty.  A total of 25% of the population are unable to afford to heat their homes.  Again, I emphasise that these are families.  Problems are most acute among the unemployed and people with disabilities.  I will deal with this situation later.  Ireland ranks 37 out of 41 OECD countries in terms of child poverty.  Supporting these families is important.  When we talk about the rights of children, we should not forget the 8,000 cases of child abuse, neglect and welfare concerns over children at risk waiting to be allocated a social worker.  This makes a mockery of any children's referendum because this is blatant neglect.  We need to up our game in respect of protecting the rights of children.<\/p><p>Earlier today the issue of undocumented migrant families in Ireland was discussed by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  There are between 20,000 and 26,000 undocumented migrants in this country, many of whom entered Ireland legally and have been living and working here for many years.  Some 87% of these people are in employment and 81% have been living in Ireland for over five years.  During the meeting I took the opportunity to stand up for these families and asked that the committee appoint a rapporteur to compile a report and recommendations for the introduction of a regularisation scheme and to report to the Minister for Justice and Equality in this regard in the next couple of months.  I take this opportunity to call on the Minister for Justice and Equality to introduce during the lifetime of this Government a once-off time-bound regularisation scheme with transparent criteria.  I raise these issues on behalf of the families concerned.  The following is a quotation from one of the people who attended the committee meeting today on behalf of the Justice for the Undocumented Campaign:<blockquote>My name is Jason.  I am from the Philippines and am living and working in Ireland for 11 years.  I am undocumented.  <\/blockquote>He also said:<blockquote>When I first left, my youngest was five.  He kept asking when I was coming back.  He's seventeen now and has not stopped asking.<\/blockquote>I raise this issue in the context of the severe damage being done to the relationships of these people.  I ask the Minister to be brave and support the regularisation of undocumented migrants in this country.  It is important to look at the cost implications in this regard.  A regularisation scheme would bring in annual income of in excess of &euro;7.5 million through direct taxation.  A once-off fee would generate in the region of &euro;11.5 million.  Income generated through employer PRSI contributions would generate &euro;20 million per annum.  In total, the scheme proposed by the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, of which I am supportive, has the potential to generate &euro;185 million over five years.  This would offset any resource implications arising from the introduction of the scheme and would contribute significantly to the tax purse.  I raise this issue in the context of the legislation before us.<br\/><br\/>I commend the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  It is important we modernise Irish law in regard to the parental rights of children living in diverse families.  This Bill addresses the needs of children living with married parents, unmarried parents, a parent and the parent's partner and a grandparent or other relative who is parenting the child.  It also includes provisions for children born through assisted human reproduction and being parented by same-sex couples.  I have met many such couples in my clinics over the last number of years.  I know of many same-sex couples who are doing an excellent job raising young children and teenagers.  They are making a massive contribution to our society.  This should be recognised in the context of this debate and any future debate on the forthcoming referendum, which I will be supporting.  One either believes in equality, or one does not.  One either believes in the rights of our citizens, or one does not.  There can be no fudge on these issues.  Regardless of opinion polls and commentary around soft under-currents we must stand up for equality and our friends, neighbours, children, distant relatives and family members who are demanding equality.  Likewise, in this legislation.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the many foster parents who, in terms of the help they are providing for young children from dysfunctional and poor families, are doing an excellent job.  We need to support them more.<br\/><br\/>It is imperative that this Bill is passed.  If enacted it will impact significantly and positively on many families and children.  However, I am concerned that there is nothing in this Bill for unmarried fathers unless they have cohabited with the mother of the child for 12 months, including three months minimum post-birth.  Fathers who do not meet this criteria will continue to have to resort to the courts if the mother does not agree to sign a statutory declaration for joint guardianship witnessed by the Peace Commissioner or Commissioner for Oaths.  While, as I said earlier, this legislation is historic and ground-breaking, sadly it fails to address the current discriminatory situation of unmarried fathers.  In line with other jurisdictions such as Northern Ireland, the UK and many European countries unmarried fathers should have automatic rights to their children when jointly registering the birth.  In my experience the majority of parents and professionals mistakenly believe that inclusion of the father's name on a birth certificate gives him guardianship rights.  This misinformation has major adverse consequences for children.  At the very least the Children and Family Relationships Bill should make mandatory the provision of information to all unmarried parents at the time of birth registration.  The information provided should state the legal position of unmarried couples, in particular the lack of rights for non-cohabiting, unmarried fathers.  The provision of mandatory information could be aligned with the current changes being brought about by the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014. <br\/><br\/>Where a statutory declaration for joint guardianship is signed and subsequently mislaid or destroyed there is no evidence that the father has guardianship rights to his child.  This can have dire consequences, such as a father losing contact with his child, particularly where the mother moves residence or country, or his not being able to consent to medical treatment for his child.  The Bill should make provision for the establishment of a central register for joint guardianship agreements to ensure retention of a record of statutory declarations agreeing guardianship rights.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and the Law Reform Commission have both recommended the establishment of a central register for joint guardianship agreements.  However, it appears this will not be provided for in this legislation.<br\/><br\/>I welcome this legislation and will be supporting it.  I again compliment the Minister on the manner in which she has presented it to the House.  As I said earlier, it is historic, child-focused legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500055#CCC00200","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424888100,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister's officials for their briefing on the Bill.  I have no doubt they put a great deal of work into this very detailed and progressive legislation, which I welcome.  The Bill seeks to acknowledge the reality of family life in Ireland today and, in that sense, is long overdue.  We have moved a long way from the conception of certain people of what a family is supposed to be.  It is good that we are finally acknowledging the diversity of family life in Irish society, be that families comprising same-sex couples, lone parents, new relationships following break-ups and the often complex interaction of new and old relationships in terms of children.  The Bill also deals with the issue of assisted human reproduction and how advances in this regard have helped people who otherwise would not be able to have children to have them; adoption issues and the rights of the children in situations of adoption in terms of parentage and the right to know their biological parents and so on.  Things have gotten complicated but, to my mind, in a good way.  Our society is better for it.  Ancient Irish society is often romanticised a little too much.  Family relationships in ancient Ireland were very different.  At that time we had more tribal extended families and multiple people bore responsibility for children.  The nuclear family comprising a mother and a father and their children, which some institutions in this State believe is eternal, is not eternal at all.<\/p><p>It never was.  In fact, for most of human existence on this planet, human relations were much more diverse and they have changed dramatically throughout history in various historical epochs.  Some people in this country and elsewhere, as we are not unique in this matter, had a single notion of what a family looked like and everything that was outside the conception of the nuclear family was considered abnormal or defective.  It was perceived as a lesser relationship.<br\/><br\/>There was the appalling, obnoxious concept of illegitimacy.  It was awful.  Certain words were used to refer to children who were supposedly illegitimate, that I will not mention in the Chamber, which became curse words.  Some of that was not so long ago.  I am old enough to remember the incredible stigmatisation of lone parents in the 1980s and how awful it was.  That emanated at the time from some in the political establishment.  It has not gone away, although I am pleased to say such a blinkered, utterly conservative view of family life still exists to some extent but thankfully it is no longer dominant.  We can almost laugh at it now.  Some of the headlines have been bordering on the hilarious in terms of the attitude of some religious institutions.  One headline in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>referred to a bishop saying there was no obstacle to gays marrying, just not to each other.  That is brilliant.  It is the sort of view which I will not call prehistoric because in those times there were far more enlightened conceptions of human relationships, and gay and lesbian relationships were par for the course.<br\/><br\/>A particular mentality developed, largely in the latter half of the 19th century, spearheaded by some of the worst and most reactionary elements in British society and, sadly, adopted by the Catholic Church in this country.  Some of the early victims of that mentality were people such as Oscar Wilde.  People tried to create a particular notion of family relations and set that up as the norm and anyone who stood out from that was literally persecuted.  Their reason for doing that was often very crudely about social control and cost efficiencies.  Rather than providing decent child care for people they essentially forced the cost onto the nuclear family, often with pretty awful consequences in terms of the pressures that were subsequently put on families which contributed to domestic violence.  This is a very welcome and progressive attempt to move the situation on, acknowledge the reality and, as speakers have repeated throughout the debate, put the child and the interests of the child at the centre but also to try to be fair and reasonable to all the parties involved.<br\/><br\/>Some concern has been expressed, some of which I suspect has been disingenuous on the part of opponents of the legislation - people who oppose it on principle and fundamentally - but they try to cloud the issue by saying we should not rush the legislation.  There is probably a legitimate concern and we must be careful in terms of something so complex that there are not unintended consequences, anomalies or problems.  Other speakers have alluded to issues we must consider but that should not stop the passage of the legislation.  I hope the Minister will be open to genuine, well-intentioned amendments on Committee Stage and Report Stage.  I hope she will say that the Bill is a work in progress and that we can always come back to aspects of it if there are any particular difficulties further down the road.  That would also help to dispel some of the red herring arguments.  Almost inevitably, issues will arise.<br\/><br\/>Assisted human reproduction is an anomalous area.  It is a very good thing that we can help couples, or individuals for that matter, to have children who might not otherwise be able to do it, but it does create new dynamics, the consequences of which we might not fully know.  That is not a reason to be fearful of it, but it is a recognition that things might subsequently happen for which we had provided.  For example, the offspring arising from assisted human reproduction might decide he or she wants to have a relationship with the original donor.  The question is what we would do then, and how such a situation would be managed.  Situations will emerge but we should not be afraid of them.  We must put the interests of the child first and be fair to all the parties involved.<br\/><br\/>In the short time remaining I wish to make one point by way of defence of the legislation.  I am shocked and bedazzled by the hypocrisy of certain of the opponents of the Bill and of the forthcoming marriage equality referendum when they say they must defend the right of children to have a mother and father.  The institutions that are shouting loudest in opposition to the legislation and to the proposed marriage equality legislation are the very institutions that separated more children from their parents, often by force, than any other institution in the State.  The hypocrisy is unbelievable.  It is stunning.  They forced mothers to give up their children.  They imprisoned the mothers of those children because they were not married.  They forced adoptions.  They put every obstacle in the way of those children and their mothers to make contact with each other and then they have the effrontery to say they are championing the rights of children to have both parents.  Give me a flipping break.  It is unbelievable stuff.  I am completely onside.  The point has not been made strongly enough in some of the debates and it is just beyond belief.<br\/><br\/>I very much support the Minister.  A couple of issues arise, however.  The stipulation providing for guardianship rights is problematic in terms of 12 months cohabitation prior to a child&rsquo;s birth and three months after the baby is born.  There are so many reasons why a father who might want to play a very serious role in bringing up his child might not fulfil those criteria.  Fathers should still have the automatic right to be a guardian and not have to jump through extra hoops others do not have to go through.  We must examine the matter.  The Minister will respond that a declaration can be made but the provision is somewhat discriminatory and a little unfair and should be re-examined.  Broadly, I very much support the Bill and I hope it passes through the House but we will obviously have to examine the details in the coming Stages.  Finally, Ireland is moving into the 21st century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500056#DDD00200","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424888700,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I might take more time to speak tomorrow but I will move the adjournment of the debate in two minutes.

It is quite clear at this stage that what they envisage a family to be is quite different to what a family is in the society in which we now live.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Boyd Barrett pointed out in his contribution, it is not that long ago that the status of illegitimacy was removed from Irish law.  I suppose there were people at the time who forecast that the sky would fall in but that has not happened in any way.

the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s (CSO) Survey on Income and Living Conditions shows the number of households suffering deprivation has risen from 24.5 per cent in 2011 to 30.5 per cent in 2013 and the number living in consistent poverty has risen from 6.9 per cent to 8.2 per cent;\r\n\r\n&mdash; the CSO also shows that the levels of deprivation and persistent poverty among one parent families are even more shocking, with the number of one parent families suffering deprivation rising from 49.5 per cent in 2012 to 63.2 per cent in 2013 and the number living in consistent poverty rising from 17.4 per cent to 23 per cent in the same period;\r\n\r\n&mdash; according to Barnardos, in 2013, 12 per cent of children (aged 0-17 years) lived in consistent poverty - up more than 137,000 from 9.9 per cent in 2012 and double the 6 per cent figure of 2008;\r\n\r\n&mdash; UNICEF found that child poverty rose by 10 per cent to 28.6 per cent between 2008- 2012, an increase of 130,000 more children living in poverty;\r\n\r\n&mdash; poverty among older people rose from 1.1 per cent to 1.9 per cent between 2009 and 2011; the deprivation rate has increased from 9.5 per cent to 11.3 per cent over the same period and deprivation among older people living alone is even higher at 15.3 per cent;\r\n\r\n&mdash; the Age Action survey on Budget 2014 found 90 per cent of respondents said 487 budgetary measures affecting older people were unfair, noting prescription charges, telephone allowance, changes in income limits for medical cards, property tax, fuel allowance and other recent budgetary measures;\r\n\r\n&mdash; according to the CSO, 45 per cent of people with disabilities experience income poverty and 36 per cent of people with disabilities experience basic deprivation;\r\n\r\n&mdash; Social Justice Ireland states that a total of 750,000 people, including more than 232,039 children, are living in poverty in Ireland;\r\n\r\n&mdash;

shocking increases in poverty, deprivation and hardship have occurred at the same time that total net household wealth in Ireland has increased, corporate profits have risen, and a small minority of top earners continue to enjoy extremely high earnings; and\r\n\r\n&mdash; significant evidence exists suggesting that a very wealthy minority at the top of Irish society have been fully insulated from the deprivation and hardship suffered by so many Irish citizens;notes, in this regard, that:&mdash; according to the Central Bank (Quarterly Bulletin Q4 2014) total net household wealth in Ireland stood at &euro;508 billion, marking its seventh consecutive rise since the second quarter of 2012 - an increase of 13.7 per cent in total household wealth; and\r\n\r\n&mdash; while no definitive statistics on the distribution of this wealth are currently kept by the Department of Finance, a number of reports and analyses exist which all point to a heavy concentration of this wealth in the hands of a small percentage of the wealthiest households and individuals;notes, for example, that:&mdash; the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report 2014 states the wealthiest 1 per cent of households own 27.3 per cent of all wealth, the top 10 per cent own 58.5 per cent of all wealth and that there are currently 92,000 millionaires in Ireland;\r\n\r\n&mdash; Think-tank for Action on Social Change estimates, based on an Economic and Social Research Institute study carried out in 1991 and extrapolated onto current total wealth figures, that the top 5 per cent of households hold 28.7 per cent of all wealth (i.e. 82,919 households hold &euro;145 billion), 10 per cent of households hold 42.3 per cent of all wealth (i.e. 165,824 households hold &euro;215 billion) whereas the bottom 50 per cent of households (829,122) hold just 12.2 percent of this wealth (&euro;62 billion);\r\n\r\n&mdash; the CSO&rsquo;s Household Finance and Consumption Survey 2013 suggested that the top 20 per cent of incomes have almost 40 per cent of the wealth, while the bottom 20 per cent have only 11.4 per cent;\r\n\r\n&mdash; Social Justice Ireland states that the richest 10 per cent of households received 24 per cent of total disposable income, whereas the poorest 10 per cent of households received only 3 per cent of total disposable income;\r\n\r\n&mdash; the deeply unequal distribution of wealth suggested by the above is broadly in line with the rest of Europe, where the European Central Bank&rsquo;s 2013 Household and Finance and Consumption Survey shows a similar distribution of wealth across Europe, where the wealthiest 10 per cent of households hold 50.4 per cent of all household wealth and the top 5 per cent hold 37.2 per cent;\r\n\r\n&mdash; according to the Department of Finance, the top 1 per cent (21,650) of earners have an annual gross income of &euro;8.7 billion, with average earnings of &euro;403,703 per year - more than ten times the average industrial wage; and\r\n\r\n&mdash; according to the Revenue Commissioners latest available statistics, corporate profits are also increasing, with gross trade profits increasing to &euro;73.8 billion in 2011 up from &euro;70.8 billion in 2010;resolves to:&mdash;

Children, older people and people with disabilities go without heating in their homes, a warm coat or enough food.  It also highlights the growth in low pay, a measure on which we are beaten only by the United States of America out of all the countries in the developed world.  The fact that half a million people have zero money left at the end of the month once they pay essential bills shows how bad austerity has been.  This stark reality for the many can be contrasted with the cushioned and cosy existence of the few who own almost 30% of the country&rsquo;s wealth while making up just 5% of our population.<\/p>  <p>  What has brought us to this horrific indefensible situation?  I can think of a few things.  When in government, Fianna F&aacute;il cut the weekly working age social welfare payment rates twice.  It slashed young people&rsquo;s jobseeker's allowance and the Labour Party and Fine Gael Government finished the job, cutting it further.  Fianna F&aacute;il cut rent supplement, abolished the Christmas bonus and cut child benefit across the board.  Then Fine Gael and the Labour Party, who promised to do things differently, did the exact same as their predecessors.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party cut farm assist, the fuel allowance, the household benefits package and the back to school allowance.  They cut child benefit twice.  They targeted working mothers, first taxing maternity benefit and then cutting it.  They cut jobseeker's benefit and the invalidity pension, and closed the diet supplement scheme.  They took &euro;325 from family carers in need of respite.  They more than halved exceptional needs spending at a time of exceptionally high and rising needs.<\/p>  <p>  The motion tabled by some of the Independent Deputies rightly condemns and rejects austerity.  It rightly calls for the reversal of cuts.  The public needs a Government with the moral compass and the capacity to develop and implement credible solutions.  In our fully-costed alternative budget published last October, and in those we published in other years since this Government and its predecessor have implemented austerity, we outlined options for the Government to begin to reverse austerity.  We proposed a range of social welfare increases, targeting those experiencing some of the worst deprivation.  We proposed increasing family income supplement by 10% to families working on low incomes.  We proposed raising the lone parent income disregard so that work pays in a positive way.  We proposed restoring equality to young jobseekers.  We also proposed increasing the fuel allowance by three weeks to help with home heating bills.  We have been lucky that this winter has not been as cold as in previous years.<\/p>  <p>  We also proposed introducing a landline allowance, so that vulnerable people living alone could have a panic alarm.  We also proposed restoring farm assist and re-opening the diet supplement scheme, which assists sufferers of coeliac disease, motor neuron disease and others with the high cost of their nutrition.  We proposed increasing the back to school allowance by &euro;50 to help our poorest children with the costs of education.  We also proposed reversing in full the cut to the respite care grant, one of the cruellest cuts of all.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has never had a mandate to heap misery on so many, or to heap misery upon the misery the previous Government inflicted.   It is long past time for an election so the people can give a fresh mandate to Deputies who will stand up to austerity and implement radical solutions to the problems of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500058#FFF00700","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1424889300,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the motion tabled by the Technical Group.  Not only has there been a significant increase in income disparity and inequality in general since the economic downturn began, but there is no sign of things improving.  This is not just our take on it as it is what the ESRI has shown.  The Government may claim the economy is picking up, but the most recent statistical evidence shows the number of people subject to deprivation continues to increase.  In County Laois 16% of mortgage holders are more than 90 days behind on their payments.  I meet many of these people and see not only the suffering and deprivation but the mental torture and anguish they go through.  They do not have a solution because there is a hole in the legislation which was passed several years ago.  The banks were given a veto, which we pointed out at the time.  This needs to be revisited and there needs to be a level playing pitch for people.  The small people stuck with these mortgages do not have a NAMA.<br\/><br\/>The number of people living in material deprivation and the number of children living in poverty are high.  One sixth of people with a job, and 28%<i><\/i>of children, are in poverty.  I heard the Taoiseach state the best way out of poverty is a job.  I agree with him, providing the job pays a wage.  The social welfare system is propping up much of this low-wage economy because without family income supplement, FIS, payments many people could not go to work. I  am not arguing against FIS but we should not be so dependent on it to subsidise employment in companies making profits.<br\/><br\/>While the Government points to a revival in GDP growth and a fall in unemployment statistics, which are welcome, unfortunately this may not be reflected in an improvement in the circumstances of a large part of the population.  The numerous cuts inflicted by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have had a disproportionate effect on low income groups such as lone parents, people with disabilities and the unemployed.  This is clearly shown by the ESRI findings.  Cuts to child benefit, the carer's respite grant and jobseeker's allowance have all hit these groups very hard.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, having a job is not a guarantee that a person or a family will be free from poverty.  A total of 16% of adults with an income below the poverty line are working.  Surely this is unacceptable, even for the most fervent supporters of unbridled capitalism.  The fact so many working people live in poverty is a consequence of the successful campaign by powerful interests to drive down wages.  So successful have been low-wage employers that the previous Government cut the minimum wage, as if it were not already low enough.  I need not say any more about this.  I welcome the fact the Government restored it but we need to re-examine it, because, apart from the period it was cut, it has been at the same rate for approximately eight years.  People on the minimum wage are living in poverty.  We meet them in our local supermarkets every Saturday.<br\/><br\/>Yesterday, ISME made a bizarre claim.  It stated the minimum wage has not addressed poverty, which is partly true, but then it made the somewhat illogical deduction that even lower wages would help in this regard.  What does it suggest?  Does it suggest a rate of &euro;6 or &euro;5 an hour and that people work 80 hours a week?<\/p><p>Is that their way out of poverty?  Even if someone was earning &euro;500 per week, which is counted as a liveable wage, and working serious hours at that, what about the rents?  The fact that a major portion of income is going on rent is a serious problem, particularly in large towns and the capital city.<\/p> <p> The boom was built on a bloated and unsustainable property market and by people selling overpriced houses to each other.  We know what that was about and how that was created.  However, what is termed the recovery is being built on the exploitation of workers.  The need to tackle poverty goes beyond the austerity policies of the State.  It involves ensuring that working people are paid properly, have proper working conditions and are able to afford a place to live.  There should be proper conditions, a proper diet and clothes and the basics of life.  Combating poverty also means having access to good public services, including health services, education, housing and public transport.  All citizens are entitled to that.<\/p> <p> The thrust of the motion includes reference to many of the costs.  However, there is one line in the motion suggesting that the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, should go and find the money.  That is a little glib.  I want those cuts undone, as does Sinn F&eacute;in.  However, the motion does not include the cost or what it would take to undo them.  While we support undoing those cuts over a period, we have to be realistic.  We have to target the most serious cuts first, undo those having the worst effects, including those I mentioned, and then try to lift people who are really on the floor out of poverty again.  Anyone making that proposition needs to set out what the cost of this would be and where the money will be found.  Our party will continue to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500058#FFF00800","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424889900,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Derek Nolan.

Perhaps one person lost a job and this put them under incredible pressure.  That was real and it got worse.  However, the way out is not to reverse every cut or put money into the social welfare system exclusively.  The way out is to get people a job so they can get up in the morning, go to work, bring the children to school and provide for themselves.  That is the discussion we should have in this House rather than a fantasy-land discussion about pouring more and more money into social welfare.

It is not enough simply to get jobs.  We need to get well-paying jobs.  That discussion has to happen in this House and in the country.  If we only get people into low-paid jobs and they are finding it difficult, then poverty will continue.  We need well-paid jobs.  This is why we are giving workers the ability to protect themselves and bargain for their rights.  Collective bargaining agreements will help improve working conditions for those who have jobs.  Protecting employment registration agreements and the Labour Court agreements that have been struck down will help also.  Legislating for these again, as well as the introduction of a low pay commission to consult and make recommendations to improve people's living standards, will help.<\/p>  <p>  The idea is that a person will get a dividend every morning for surrendering the only thing he really has and which is individual to him, that is, his individual labour and contribution.  That should be rewarded fairly.  It should be acknowledged and it should be something that he can live on when he goes out to make a contribution to society.  Work should pay.<\/p>  <p>  On top of that, there will always be a need to examine the market and assess whether the housing model works.  Prices are going through the roof.  People are priced out of it and the rental market is not working properly.  The answer is State intervention and that is exactly what we have announced.  A total of &euro;3.7 billion has been announced in public and private funding to provide 35,000 social houses in the coming five or six years.  What will that do?  It will provide quality homes for people who will never be able to afford their own homes.  It will take the pressure off the private rental market and the building market.  It will create the space to allow those who can earn income and provide for themselves to do so.

We can focus on the ability to increase wages.<\/p>  <p>  It is time for a practical conversation.  It is time to be straight with people.  It is true that things are difficult and it is extremely difficult for people in poverty.  We need to do everything we can to get them out of it, but the way out is not by telling them that it is terrible for them.

The most significant finding of the report is that, basically, after tax and social welfare, Ireland has below EU average levels of income inequality.  It starts out with high levels of inequality in the context of market incomes, but when the State kicks in and redistributes income, then it falls below average EU levels of inequality.  Unfortunately, the newspapers did not lead with that information.  Indeed, TASC did not particularly highlight the finding, although it was very much contained in the think tank's report.<\/p>  <p>  The point is we have the most progressive income tax and social welfare systems.  This was borne out in reports as well.  A recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection discussed the impact of social transfers on income distribution.  All speakers set out how our tax and social welfare system is highly progressive.  When speakers were asked which country was the exemplar in terms of having the most progressive tax and social transfer systems, the answer was Ireland.  This is because we have a progressive income tax system and a targeted social welfare system, such that those who need help most get the most.  These things need to be acknowledged and highlighted by social democrats.  If we do not, there are people who would have it dismantled.  Some people do not fully realise the work done in terms of redistribution by our tax and social welfare systems.  Of course that progressivity should be built upon.  However, it should be acknowledged that it is working well in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support the comments made by Deputy Nolan.  At our committee meeting, John FitzGerald pointed out that of &euro;30 billion in cuts made over the course of the recession, one third of the total, approximately &euro;10 billion, was ploughed back into extra social welfare spend.<\/p><p>Basically, that was to cover the cost of giving a hugely increased number of people unemployment benefit and other benefits such as family income supplement.  For example, the Government is spending &euro;100 million more per year on family income supplement at present than when it came into office.  Far more money is being spent by this Government in supporting families who are at work and on low pay.<\/p> <p> This idea that we cut social welfare spending is not true.  In fact, this Government spent the most ever in the history of the State on social welfare in its first year in office, and that level of expenditure has been kept up throughout its term of office.  That in itself is progressive.  We kept a basic income floor for people during the recession despite the need to reduce our deficits, which has been important in reducing income inequality.  I support what Deputy Nolan said and reject this simplistic idea that it is all about reversing particular cuts.  It is not about that; it is about responding to people's needs.  That is why the Minister for Social Protection has invested so much in Intreo offices and making sure that people who are on social welfare are given supports to help them get back to work.  They need to get the necessary education and training and to be helped to get places on labour market activation schemes in order to help them get back into the workplace.<\/p> <p> It is not just about reversing cuts.  We are actually spending more on social protection now than ever before.  It is about how we spend the money to make sure we help people and that we do not create poverty traps.  Ultimately, it is about supporting people to get jobs and to get the education and training they need.  One of the most important statistics that has come out in recent years is that this country has a very high rate of jobless households.  That in itself is a huge contributor to income inequality, which is an issue we need to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500059#GGG01400","speaker":"1010","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424890500,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak.  I agree in some ways with the thrust of the motion in the sense that vulnerable people need to be protected in our society, especially those who have suffered most since the economy crashed onto the rocks in 2008.  We all agree that, once funding becomes available, those who have suffered the most should be looked after.  Where we differ is in how we actually do that.  As previous speakers pointed out, the best way to do it is by bringing jobs to the country and giving people sustainable jobs so they can raise their standard of living.  There are 80,000 people working in this country now who did not have jobs and were supported by social welfare.  As Deputy Tuffy said, that funding can now be put into something else.<\/p>  <p>  Since we took over in 2011, various measures have been taken in an incremental way.  For example, our first budget took an extra 330,000 people off the universal social charge and raised the minimum wage.  These measures may have been well regarded at the time but they are almost forgotten now.  It should also be noted that the universal social charge was increased in the recent budget for very high earners while a further 80,000 people were taken off USC, and this will continue.  Some 40% of workers do not pay any income tax, admittedly because of their low wages.<\/p>  <p>  There is general agreement that there needs to be restoration of jobs and funding targeted at lower income earners.  We are all agreed there is a need to restore a reasonable standard of living for people.  However, we cannot do that at the stroke of a pen.  We put so much effort into the economy, and the people were so patient in allowing us to do this, that we cannot wreck it all again by trying to do everything in one go.<\/p>  <p>  I have not seen any costings on the measures proposed in the motion, although there is a suggestion they would cost &euro;4 billion.  Where will that come from?  Will it come from higher taxes that will run people out of the country again and lead to a loss of competitiveness which we had to struggle to achieve?  For example, we made ourselves competitive again in the tourism and hospitality sector, thereby creating 30,000 jobs.  If higher taxes are introduced, those people would have to get higher wages, again making us less competitive.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, there is agreement that lower and middle income Ireland needs to be first on the list for the restoration of the standard of living.  The best way to do this, of course, is to create employment.  As I said earlier, 80,000 extra people are now working and have sustainable jobs, which will continue this year, for which we have a target of 40,000 extra jobs.  That is the best way of demonstrating to people that there is light at the end of the tunnel.<\/p>  <p>  There is another issue that affects all of us living in rural Ireland.  While everybody accepts there is a recovery in the economy in the urban areas, there is an issue with spreading that through the regions.  I have no doubt this is something that needs to be and is being attended to.  I believe the jobs announcement on Monday for Athenry, a small town in Galway, is an indication that there is more to come on this and that there will be a regional spread of the recovery as the year goes on <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500060#HHH00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1424890500,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I am very grateful for the opportunity to address some of the points made by Members of the Technical Group in their motion.  They paint a very dismal picture of this country and its people, a picture which I reject strongly.  Of course, there are still many areas of society that need support and investment, but we have come a long way in the last four years and will continue to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I accept there are high levels of poverty in some areas.  I am very aware of this and I do not deny more needs to be done to address child poverty in particular.  However, this Government is making steady progress.  I read a report card published by the Children's Rights Alliance.  It is important to recognise the progress being made in areas such as education, including in regard to the free preschool year, school buildings and literacy.  Our primary focus is to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty.  The Department of Social Protection has begun work in this regard through planning and implementing of the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures framework.  I believe this is a very positive step.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, over 70% of people living in poverty are in households where no one is at work.  I have said it before and I say it again: the best way to tackle poverty is through education and employment.  While I am not saying this is easy, we need to ensure there are no barriers in the way for those who can and want to work to support their families.  The Action Plan for Jobs has proven very successful and has resulted in almost 80,000 new jobs being created since 2012.  Attracting investment and creating jobs is not an easy task but the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and his colleagues have invested hugely in the initiatives and are putting people back to work.  Similar proposals from the Department of Social Protection, in the form of programmes such as JobBridge, Jobs Plus and the back-to-education schemes, are making a real difference in every community.<\/p>  <p>  The at-risk of poverty rate has fallen from 50% to 15% due to the impact of the social welfare supports.  In 2014 Government supports for children and families amounted to &euro;2.3 billion from the Department of Social Protection alone.  This money does not appear out of thin air; it is our income tax system that pays for it.<\/p><p>Let us not forget that approximately 40% of income earners are not liable for income tax at all.  <\/p> <p> The budget in 2015 introduced a &euro;5 per month increase in child benefit, which will benefit more than 600,000 families this year.  A working family dividend scheme has been introduced for lone parents and long-term job seekers with children who want to return to work.  This will help to support those affected by the changes to the one-parent family payment.  The Government currently invests over &euro;250 million in child care each year.  An interdepartmental group has been set up by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, to re-examine future investment in child care, which is a very positive step.  We in the Chamber need to strongly support that.<\/p> <p> The Government has a plan and it is working.  We will keep moving forward and making positive changes, bringing people back into their jobs and out of poverty and giving them an opportunity for their families and futures.  We will give hope to their children and grandchildren.  It is impossible to stand here and say that things have not changed in the past four years, because they have.  I hope the Technical Group will give some credit to some of the positive things that have happened in communities across the country, which have allowed young people back into education, particularly lone parents and one-parent families.  This is making a significant difference to their lives, self-esteem and, above all, their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500060#HHH00300","speaker":"1029","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424891100,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  There is no doubt that inequalities exist in society.  They are a product of complex economic ideologies over time.  There is no getting away from the fact that Ireland practises so-called democratic capitalism.  Often we have to play by rules in which we had no say in the first place.  I refer in particular to our approach to promissory notes and sovereign debt in any deals entered into on behalf of the State, which we have to fulfil if we are to consider ourselves players on the international stage or in the global village where we compete for investment as a small open economy.<\/p>  <p>  Having said this, we have created a social welfare system to address the imbalance that naturally occurs in society, not just now but forever.  It occurs because of unequal opportunities and the disadvantages that arise from them.  It is always very important, however, that we continue to strive to create a fair and equal society, because we all know in our hearts that no matter what one achieves in a society or what one has, if one's neighbour does not have something there is no way one is not affected by that.  <\/p>  <p>  Sometimes it seems as if a line has been drawn and people in government do not know what is going on.  Those in touch with their constituents know what is happening.  A different approach is needed which involves tangible solutions and, as I said, not selling populism to people and making gains from their pain.  <\/p>  <p>  This Government has taken an approach of encouraging economic prosperity through free enterprise and work.  In turn, the money generated by that will mean more work will be created and individuals and their families can be empowered.  The returns to the Exchequer from that would allow us to invest in things like poverty, inequality, health services and anything else we, as a society, deem to be a noble objective.  Money has to come from somewhere and, as we know, we are still borrowing money to keep the country going.  <\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that great strides have been made since the last general election in terms of jobs creation.  Some 80,000 jobs have been created and the unemployment rate now stands at 10.6%, having been at a high of 15.1%.  These are facts which need to be talked about to give people some hope, and not the despair generated by disproportionate arguments which are grounded not in reality but in the hope of generating some political capital or gain and causing instability in the process.  <\/p>  <p>  When the budget was announced last year I was delighted to see that it included a back-to-work dividend for families and an increase in child benefit.  There was a commitment by the Government to address the cost of child care, which is a problem for families.  We had a debate on the issue last week.  Some families feel they are better off not working at all.  I understand the low pay commission will convene this week.  It needs to be more attractive for people to work rather than be on social welfare.  <\/p>  <p>  It is very easy for politicians to bandy about phrases like \"the so-called rich.\"  I know people in my town who might fit that category.  The only real definition of \"higher earners\" in this country is under our income tax regime.  One is a high earner in this country if one earns in excess of &euro;33,800 a year, which is not a lot of money.  The reality is that in my town people who had business and made investments have run into financial difficulties.  Some are practically bankrupt and when their businesses went to the wall they were not able to claim an social welfare, despite jumping through hoops, even though they had supported jobs for years.<\/p>  <p>  People in receipt of reasonable middle incomes cannot afford to send their children to college, but if they were unemployed their children would receive a higher education grant.  Such people are experiencing great difficulties and have nowhere to turn to in the State.  They are worried and hope for the best for their children.  I do not think any sector of society, especially where I am from, has not been affected.  That is the truth about the difficulties which exist.  <\/p>  <p>  The motion cites many statistics.  I refer to balanced regional development.  It involves dealing with the long-term unemployed and providing broadband, water and sewerage services.  We are now benefitting from Irish Water projects.  None of those things have been mentioned, but they are real issues where I live.

It is important that, given that the economy is improving, those on lower incomes see the benefit proportionately more than those on higher incomes.  The difficulty up to last year was that the economy was stagnating.  We had growth of 4.7% last year and it is forecast that this will continue over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  We should ensure that we tackle the economic and social issues present in society.  We know difficult decisions had to be taken, and if I have time I will deal with them briefly.  One of the areas where we can improve people's standard of living is employment creation.  The benefits of growth in the economy must be focused on increasing employment and eliminating poverty.  To date, we know that 84,000 new jobs have been created, and there are plans for 40,000 more.  This will have a positive impact, but we must strive for full employment for all who want it by 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the worst areas of unemployment is youth unemployment.<\/p><p>This must be tackled and we must build on the fall in the level of youth unemployment by 8% over the past two years, with schemes such as JobsPlus, JobBridge, First Steps and the Action Plan for Jobs having an impact on the level of all unemployment and particularly youth unemployment.  We must endeavour to increase our contribution to ensuring that our young people can obtain work.<\/p> <p> The income tax system has been seen as a disincentive to work but there is sometimes a contradiction in this argument.  The system may be a disincentive to work as people must factor in the cost of having a job, which often outweighs the increase in the level of payment in not having a job.  Ireland has the most progressive tax system in EU OECD countries and the second most progressive system in all OECD countries.  The changes introduced in the 2015 budget will be such that the top 1% of taxpayers by income will pay 20% of all income tax and universal social charge, USC, collected in 2015.  In contrast, the bottom 76% of income earners will pay only 21% of the income tax and USC collected.  Internationally, we are seen as a progressive tax system so why is the income tax system seen as a disincentive to work in such circumstances?  We must examine this issue as many other elements have an impact apart from income tax itself.  We need an efficient, fair and competitive tax system to ensure growth and that our tax system can be fair to all sections of society.  The budget has made an important start on the middle and low incomes but we must do much more to ensure the process remains progressive.  We must continue to reduce the USC and phase it out over time.  The reduction of the rate from 4.5% to 3.5% for those with medical cards with incomes below &euro;60,000 should be extended to other groups and the concentration should be on reducing the USC rate further.<\/p> <p> There has been mention of the need to spread the recovery to the regions, which needs a full debate rather than just a mention at the end of this contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500061#JJJ00300","speaker":"1056","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424891700,"counter":548,"content":"<p>Deputy Halligan is sharing time with Deputies Joan Collins, Tom Fleming, Ruth Coppinger, Shane Ross, Paul Murphy and Mick Wallace.

It is interesting that we have heard expressions such as \"quality of life\" and \"enriched country\", as well as how good this country is to live in.  I have always believed that a country should be judged by the quality of life of people living in it.  There are guiding principles in this respect.  It is interesting that Social Justice Ireland has argued that the Government should be guided by the principle of protecting the needy and vulnerable.  We must ask who are the poor and vulnerable.  The Technical Group has been accused of using disproportionate arguments but all our statistics emanate from data made available by the Government; these include Central Statistics Office figures and so on.<\/p>  <p>  The most current of these relating to poverty in Ireland is the survey conducted by the CSO and published in April 2014.  Chart 4 on page 2 of that report indicates, using the EU poverty line set at 60% of median income, that just over 16 from every 100 people were living in poverty.  This does not include a percentage of people above this who are on the poverty line or just above it.  From the statistics we can see that 750,000 adults and 220,411 children are living in poverty.  Social Justice Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and other organisations have been at pains to point out that another 300,000 or 400,000 could be added to the figure who are on the poverty line or just above it.  In other words, these people have no quality of life.<\/p>  <p>  It has always been at the core of labour party ideology throughout the world to protect those who are most vulnerable.  These are people on low incomes and who are less well off.  Labour and the left have always had guiding principles and beliefs in fairness enshrined in policies and directed towards disadvantaged people in society.  One can consider the statistics from when labour parties were in power in England, Norway or even in South America and across the world: irrespective of how bad an economy was, those labour parties have been able to deal with disadvantage, decrease poverty levels and increase quality of life for those less well off in society.  It is interesting that the only party which has failed to do this is the Irish Labour Party.<\/p>  <p>  I do not find it fun to criticise anybody who might be perceived to be on the left of politics and it is unfortunate that the left is divided.  There are some very good people both within and outside the Labour Party.  The statistics are there nonetheless.  Very many people have found themselves abandoned by some trade unions, pillars of society like the church and the major political parties.  These people rely on those of us on the left or those with a conscience who recognise fairness.  We want to do what is right for those who are less well off in society and are the only ones to which these people can turn.  Those people feel they have been abandoned particularly by the party which was supposed to stand by them and made the promises that those who are less well off would be fine.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know who said that the poor will always be with us.  That may as well be enshrined in a constitution for the next election as the Government has left us with 750,000 people and 225,000 children in poverty and another 400,000 on the poverty line.  It would not matter who came to power when we consider what people would have to deal with.  We can check what labour parties have done in Europe and across the world and at the very least they tried to look after those less well off in society.  The current Government has not done so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500062#KKK00300","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1424891700,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for bringing this motion to the D&aacute;il.  I will speak to the Government's amendment to the motion.  The first two points are incredible.  The claim that austerity has affected all groups and has had the greatest effect on the disposable income of the top 10% of earners can no doubt be backed up by statistics.  The effect of the universal social charge on the take-home pay of somebody earning &euro;200,000 per year is far greater than it is for somebody on the minimum wage.  That is only a very small part of the story.<\/p>  <p>  If we take the 1% of people who earn 10% of all income, or the top 10% of people who earn 24% of all income, we know they do not rely on public health services.<\/p><p>They send their children to private schools.  A cut in child benefit is irrelevant to them.  They would not even know what a lone parent family payment is; the effects of austerity are minimal for them.  Two thirds of the &euro;30 billion in austerity cuts have been in the form of spending cuts.  These cuts have crucified the bottom 10% who earn a measly 3% of all income.  Austerity has hit the poorest and the most vulnerable hardest, and no amount of spin can hide that.<\/p> <p> The claim that a strong economic recovery is under way is questionable, if not spurious.  The figures for gross domestic product, GDP, and gross national product, GNP, for the economy are simply unreliable.  This is due to the distorting role played by the multinational sector.  There are very serious questions regarding the real levels of exports from the economy.  The distortions in export figures are due to contract manufacturing and profit shifting.  It is estimated that up to 50% of service exports are tax related and effectively fake.  The Central Bank has stated that the activity in the Irish Financial Services Centre is for the most part unrelated to the domestic economy in terms of personal consumption, investment or export activity.  Multinationals' exports in computer services per employee are 12 times higher than they are per employee in indigenous companies.  That does not add up.  That figure is just not possible.  What the Government is putting forward is spurious.<\/p> <p> Economic activity is better measured by domestic demand, that is, consumer and Government spending and investment.  Domestic demand fell by 20% in the crisis and has been more or less stagnant since 2010.  In 2011, it was &euro;34.5 billion and in 2014 it was &euro;35 billion and 15% below the level of 2008.  There is some growth in the economy and in jobs, but nothing like the levels claimed by the Government.<\/p> <p> I will conclude with a point about lone parents.  I have heard much talk about how social welfare has protected the most vulnerable in our society, but I challenge the Government and the Minister in that regard.  According to the EU survey on income and living conditions, SILC, report in 2013, lone parents have the highest rates of deprivation at 63.3% and consistent poverty rates of 23%.  The deprivation rate among lone parents is 230% more than in the general population and 33% more than among the unemployed, yet this Government is implementing the legislation it passed in 2012.  The Minister for Social Protection said in 2012: \"I am undertaking tonight that I will only proceed with the measures to reduce the upper age limit to seven years in the event I get a credible and bankable commitment on the delivery of such a system of child care by the time of this year's budget.  If it is not forthcoming, the measure will not proceed.\"  The Government is proceeding with the measure to cut lone parents' payments when the child reaches seven years of age, but there is no affordable child care in place.  It says it wants people to get back into employment but those who are most affected by these cuts are lone parents in work.  Their wages will be cut by at least 20%.<\/p> <p> The Government need not give the message that it is protecting the most vulnerable.  It is actually pursuing the most vulnerable, and I hope the people resist it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500062#KKK00400","speaker":"1193","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424892300,"counter":552,"content":"<p>Recently released Central Statistics Office findings in the first household finance and consumption survey on the financial state of Irish homes identified that almost 57% of families were in debt, with two thirds owing money on their mortgages.  The average amount of debt on the mortgage is &euro;129,000.  However, for people aged under 35 years the average debt on a mortgage is &euro;204,000, compared to a figure of &euro;30,000 for households headed by a retired person.  The survey also found that Irish people are still very reliant on dipping into overdrafts and are relying on credit cards to make ends meet.  The average amount of debt on an overdraft in 2013 was &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,400 for credit cards.  The average amount of debt faced by struggling householders was &euro;63,000.<\/p>  <p>  The survey showed that there are 698,000 people still in poverty in Ireland.  Even though the poverty line has fallen by 16% since 2008, nearly one in seven people in Ireland are living in poverty.  Over 211,000 of those are children.  This is an indictment of Government policy and highlights its failure to protect the most vulnerable in society.<\/p>  <p>  Numerous studies clearly show that the route out of poverty is education.  The education system in Ireland is a first class example of a situation where those who can afford it get the best education.  Families that can afford fee paying schools can also afford grinds and extra-curricular activities to enhance the life chances of their children.  There are no such opportunities for the families at the bottom of the income spectrum.  Third level attendance is another example of the gap between basic State education versus fee paying schools.  The way out of poverty is education but real action is required from the Government to allow children from disadvantaged backgrounds to realise their ambitions and dreams and to equalise the unequal system that exists.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the most equal countries in Europe have consistently demonstrated a commitment to subsidised child care.  In Ireland, a household with one child could be paying &euro;800 to &euro;1,200 per month in child care fees.  This obviously would increase for every subsequent child.  In Europe, child care costs can be as little as just over &euro;200 per month.  If the Government adopted this policy each household would have &euro;600 and more in disposable income per child per calendar month, which would be circulated back into the economy.  Other actions that would affect inequality include free school books and transport and free third level education for students from lower and middle income households.<\/p>  <p>  To return to the mortgage issue, the CSO figures released today show that Irish mortgage holders are carrying the highest mortgage debt ratio in the eurozone relative to the value of their homes.  The figures show that the median loan-to-value ratio for owner-occupier mortgage holders in Ireland is nearly twice the European average at 73% compared to the eurozone average of 37%.  The Netherlands has the next highest rate after Ireland at 52%.  This reinforces the situation.  The Government must step up its endeavours to take the pressure off people who are facing repossession orders at present.  The banks are cherry-picking, and they are picking the easiest victims.  If they are allowed to continue with this, we will have many more homeless people and it is obvious that we do not have the houses to house them.  The Government must step up to deal with this venture by the banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500063#LLL00200","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1424892300,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I will start with the Government's amendment.  It is quite surreal that it would argue that the top 10% have lost the most in the last seven years of austerity.  It is more of the Alice in Wonderland delusion.  It must be the reason the Fine Gael Party was barricaded in Mayo last weekend and the Labour Party will be barricaded this weekend.  They are living on another planet.<\/p>  <p>  A total of &euro;31 billion has been taken out of the economy in cuts and increased taxes in the last six years.  It has had a catastrophic effect.  It was quite incredible to hear a Labour Party Deputy in the last half hour dispute that there is real inequality in Ireland, using the same arguments as neoliberal, right-wing economists, and say that our inequality compares very well with the rest of the EU.  Individual consumption costs in Ireland are 20% higher than the EU average.  These are the costs of energy, going to a doctor and so forth which people pay every day and week.  The Government obviously does not have any time for the Deputies on this side of the House who tell it this, but UNICEF has condemned this Government from a height for increasing child poverty to one in four and it says that people have lost ten years of income because of austerity.<\/p><p>Even John FitzGerald, an establishment economist with the ESRI, has stated that Ireland has the most unequal market incomes in the OECD and that the taxation system does nothing to correct it.  I will not waste time arguing this.  Everyone knows that there is no recovery and they know what they are feeling.<\/p> <p> I wish to focus on an issue which was mentioned earlier, that is, where the money will come from to reverse the austerity and to give people a decent standard of living.  The Anti-Austerity Alliance would say to repudiate the debt which is eating up &euro;1 of every &euro;8 earned in this country.  We did not create and build up this debt.  The debt was &euro;47.4 billion in 2007.  In 2014, it was &euro;215 billion.  So much for people partying.  This debt was not created by ordinary working people.  The Anti-Austerity Alliance budget statement calls for four measures.  These are the introduction of an emergency millionaire's tax, an increased tax on the top 10%, the introduction of a financial transactions tax and making the corporations pay their taxes at the effective rate.  These are just some of the measures which could be taken to take control of wealth in this country and to end austerity.<\/p> <p> We are led to believe that there is no money in the country.  The Government is telling us the top 10% have lost out.  They have not.  The 250 richest people in this country own &euro;57 billion and they increased their wealth by 12% during the recession.  Their wealth did not go down.  Just 1% of the population owns 20% of the wealth.  I assume the Minister of State does not think the Central Bank is telling lies when it estimates that household wealth in this country is &euro;504 billion.  The potential to tax this wealth is incredible if only the Government were willing to do it.  The trend is global and Ireland is no different.  Oxfam has pointed out that one busload of people has the same wealth as the bottom 3.5 billion people.  This is obscene.  I would not hark back to the past glories of this Government and the Labour Party, in particular, in the post-Second World War situation.  The Labour Party has now bought lock, stock and barrel into the establishment.  It is part of the problem and it is to be hoped that it will be decimated in the next election for its betrayal of working class people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500063#LLL00300","speaker":"1195","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424892900,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Any kind of lingering difficulties which I had with this motion were removed when I saw the Government's amendment.  No Government on the economy has a greater welcome for itself than this Government, in particular given that it is not responsible for a large number of the measures for which it claims credit.  The Government knows perfectly well that a lot of what is imposed and a lot of what it is claiming credit for is as a result of diktat from outside this country.<\/p>  <p>  This particular attitude is articulated in a great deal of hubris which is very evident from recent Government statements.  I was particularly surprised by the attitude of the Minister for Finance when he took on the issue of the Greek debt and the problems which have been afflicting that unfortunate country recently.  It was strange to hear the Minister for Finance ridiculing the Greek finance Minister.  This man is in the same position in which the Irish Minister for Finance found himself four and a half years ago in 2010.  Not only did he say that he was behaving like a film star, he went on to be gratuitously insulting by saying that he reminded him of the economists of the boom.  He said that they were great in theory and pretty bloody awful in practice.  He would not say that about the German finance Minister, Mr. Sch&auml;uble.  He would get a flea in his ear if he did that.  It is very unhealthy that those of us who were in that position then are now hiding behind the skirts of Mrs. Merkel and others when we are in a stronger position now.  It may be a stronger position, and maybe not, but it is certainly not one for which we as a people, or as a Government at least, can claim credit.  This particular austerity which we have imposed has been at the behest of an outside power.  Let us be honest about it.  To be turning on the Greeks now and saying it will be good for them and ridiculing them is unforgivable.  This is something the Government has taken upon itself.<\/p>  <p>  It is also very foolish to be talking about growth in this rather cavalier manner.  The growth figures are very doubtful.  The Fiscal Advisory Council has already stated that it questions the growth figures for 2014 and it certainly questions the 3.9% figure for 2015, as projected, because of a thing called contract manufacturing, which will, mark my words, come back to haunt us.  This is a product of the multinationals operating in this country.  The Government must be very careful about multinationals.  Everyone welcomes the fantastic contribution they make.  Everyone welcomes the announcement from Galway this week, the spin-off and the jobs.  However, there is a danger.  While we are going gangbusters-like for the United States' multinationals and others coming from abroad, there is a danger.  There is no strategy or vision in this motion.  We are going headlong for the multinational jobs and we are going to depend on the multinationals as a sector in the economy.  We could end up with a similar dependence to the one we had on the construction industry.  The Government has to examine and acknowledge an alternative to this strategy.  If we depend on those multinationals and they take a sour look at what is going on here or go elsewhere, we are then in a particularly difficult situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500064#MMM00200","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1424892900,"counter":556,"content":"<p>The recent TASC report, Cherishing All Equally: Economic Inequality in Ireland, proves the point about the extreme rise of inequality in Ireland.  The 1% has an average income of &euro;373,000 a year compared with the bottom 90% who have an average income of &euro;27,400.  Ireland has the highest level of gross income inequality in the European Union.  This is rooted in, in particular, the fact that one in five workers are low paid, the highest number in the EU, and the fact that almost one in five households are entirely jobless.  This gives a picture of the very strong recovery the Government talks about in its amendment.  This is the recovery it has in mind for working class people.  It is a recovery which has deepened inequality.  It is a recovery for the rich and for the corporations and it is based on the increased exploitation of large sections of working class people.  It is based on low wage, precarious employment.  This is the reality and it is part of a global picture.  It is the reason why Piketty's book is so popular and has become such a talking point.<\/p>  <p>  Inequality is undoubtedly growing right across the world.  It is in the nature of capitalism, as we currently have it, to increase inequality in a gross way.  Hence the very notion of the 1% and the 99%.  This has a real cost.  The Government's response is that inequality is some abstract notion of interest to academics.  The share of the 90% of the national income has fallen from 72.7% in 1977 to 63% in 2012.  This has a real impact.  It is worth &euro;11 billion.  If that income share was reversed at the moment, every single household in that 90% would have &euro;7,400 more in income per year.  This is the cost of inequality and it has a real impact in terms of poverty and the material deprivation experienced by 1.4 million people in this State.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise a question.  We have a series of measures set out in this motion, with which I agree.<\/p><p>What happens when a government on the left that is committed to those policies comes to power?  We now have an example, in Greece.  What happened was an attempted and largely effective annulment of the Greek election results.  The wishes of the Greek people were entirely ignored by the European establishment, with the Irish Government lining absolutely behind them to stab the Greek people in the back, while at the same time stabbing ordinary people in this country in the back.  The European Commission is unelected.  Mr. Juncker declared that there are no democratic choices possible outside the framework of the European treaties.  The unelected ECB, which has been the key player in two silent coups against governments, basically said to the Greeks that it would bring down their banking system if they did not implement the kinds of austerity policies that were desired.  The question has to be asked: how it is possible for a leftist government to implement progressive, pro-equality policies under the framework of the EU rules and the rules of monetary union?  The answer is that it is not.  The EMU is a straitjacket for neoliberalism, as is the European Union.  Therefore, it is necessary for the left to prepare, in advance of being in power, for the kind of battle that is necessary if it is to take on the interests of capital in Europe - to say that the euro is not a fetish, and to say that if the choice is between leaving the eurozone and destroying our society, it will refuse to destroy our society.  It is a question of putting forward bold measures, such as capital controls and public ownership and control of banks so that they can be used as an instrument for developing the economy, as opposed to using society and the economy simply to benefit the banks, and for investment in important sections of the economy to create jobs.<\/p> <p> Capitalism in Europe has really bared its teeth over recent days.  Those concerned have no interest in democracy whatsoever.  We will need governments on the left in this country and other countries across Europe that are willing to stand up to the capitalist interests and take the measures that are necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500064#MMM00300","speaker":"1197","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424893500,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I heard a few Labour Party Deputies earlier and I believe they protested a bit too much.

That is a bit much.<\/p>  <p>  Austerity policies have been implemented over the four years of this Government's term.  This was obviously started by the previous Administration.  Austerity is not just about balancing the books; it has a purpose.  It is very much like an aspect of neoliberalism in that it is an effort to undermine the social contract.  Many people with good jobs lost them, and now we see new jobs being created, but most are for less pay and have poorer working conditions attached.  There have been serious cuts in social services.  This is part of the neoliberal plan and part of what we signed up to with the Nice and Lisbon treaties.  Neoliberalism is about a smaller group of people controlling more of the wealth and having greater control over social life to maximise their personal profits.  It has been the dominant ideology, probably since the time of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.  Milton Friedman was the genius who introduced it and there has been strong adherence to it since.  It has led to serious inequality.  For Labour Deputies to come in here and pretend that inequality is not increasing is not honest.  There was recently a meeting of G20 finance Ministers in Istanbul at which it was warned that the gap between the rich and poor had widened following the financial crisis of 2008.  That is not rocket science; it has happened.<\/p>  <p>  According to Mr. Robert McChesney of the University of Illinois, neoliberal initiatives are characterised as free market policies that encourage private enterprise and consumer choice, reward personal responsibility and entrepreneurial initiative, and undermine the dead hand of the incompetent, bureaucratic and parasitic government.  A generation of corporate-financed public relations efforts has given these terms and ideas a near-sacred aura.  Mr. McChesney states also: \"The economic consequences of these policies have been the same just about everywhere, and exactly what one would expect: a massive increase in social and economic inequality, a marked increase in severe deprivation for the poorest nations and peoples of the world, a disastrous global environment, an unstable global economy, and an unprecedented bonanza for the wealthy.\"  The defenders of neoliberalism claimed that the tide was going to rise, that all the boats would rise with it and that it would be great for everybody, but we know that is not true.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. McChesney outlines that neoliberalism works best when there is formal electoral democracy, but when the population is diverted from information, access, and the public forums necessary for meaningful participation in decision-making.  We know our media play a very strong role in that.  The neoliberal system, according to Mr. McChesney, therefore has &ldquo;an important and necessary byproduct - a depoliticized citizenry marked by apathy and cynicism.&rdquo;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500065#NNN00200","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1424893500,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I am glad of the opportunity to conclude the debate on the Private Members' motion on income and living conditions and to support the Government's amendment.<\/p>  <p>   I have listened to and considered the points raised by the speakers from the Technical Group and noted the various reports that they have highlighted to support their arguments.  Fundamentally, I believe the points they advance are not sustained by the evidence.

Again, the Government is leading policy here by setting for the first time a child poverty target as part of Better Outcomes, Better Futures, the national policy framework for children and young people.  We are now implementing a multidimensional plan to meet this target, in consultation with stakeholders, including children's organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, meeting these ambitious targets has been a great challenge in the face of the major economic crisis confronting Ireland for the past few years.

The recent CSO SILC data show that the at-risk-of-poverty rate was 15.2% in 2013.  This is a welcome reduction on the 2012 rate of 16.5%.  It is lower than the pre-crisis average rate of 16.6%.  Despite the economic crisis that has hit Ireland so hard, our at-risk-of-poverty rate is lower than the European average, according to EUROSTAT, with Ireland ranking 7th out of the 28 member states.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the crisis, social transfers have continued to play a crucial role in reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate.  In 2013, social transfers, excluding pensions, lifted 23% of the population out of being at risk of poverty.  If pensions are included, the share of the population lifted out of the at-risk-of-poverty category increased to 35%.  This equates to a poverty-reduction effect from social transfers of between 60% and 70%.  According to EUROSTAT, Ireland is the best performing country in the EU at reducing poverty through social transfers, excluding pensions, at 63%.  This compare to the EU average of 35%, while the figure for Greece is only 17.5%.  Ireland has a similarly strong performance in tacking child poverty, as social transfers lift a quarter of all children out of the at-risk-of-poverty category.  This shows how the Government has protected low-income households since coming into office by continued investment in the social protection system and the maintenance of core weekly rates of social welfare payment.<\/p>  <p>  In budget 2015, the Government was in a position to target additional moneys to help families and to support the most vulnerable.  The Department of Social Protection recently published a social impact assessment of the budget.<\/p><p>It found that for the first time since the economic crisis, welfare and income tax policy will result in an increase in average household incomes of 0.7%, equivalent to about &euro;6 per week, and this includes the effect of the water charges.<br\/><br\/>Now that the Government has restored financial stability, exited from the EU-IMF bailout programme and delivered a return to job creation and economic growth, we can prioritise the decisions needed to broaden and deepen the economic recovery in a manner that is felt in the daily lives of individuals, families and communities across the country.  The strongest antidote to poverty is to move people and their families back into paid employment.  This is evident in the data, which shows that if even one person in the household is in work, the consistent poverty rate falls from 20% to less than 7%.<br\/><br\/>Under the Government's Pathways to Work strategy to assist those on the live register return to work, unemployment has fallen from a crisis peak of 15.1% to today's figure of 10.4%<i>.  <\/i>The new JobPath employment programme will assist an estimated 115,000 long-term unemployed jobseekers return to work over its duration.  The new back to work family dividend will provide very significant financial assistance to families where a parent is returning to work, and ensure that work pays and families can build financial independence over time.<br\/><br\/>The economy is growing, unemployment is falling, and confidence is slowly returning.  The Government has completed the first phase of the recovery and we are now starting the second, the process of restoring living standards.  The Government will deliver a social as well as an economic recovery to ensure that everyone, every family and every community will benefit from the recovery.  Through this, I am confident we will achieve the national social target for poverty reduction and the child poverty target by 2020.  I commend amendment No. 1 to the House.<br\/><br\/>I wish I had time to respond to individual points made.  Many of the points raised by some members of the Technical Group are tackled on a regular basis but Deputy Ross gave the House some figures, and his wisdom.  I normally seek his wisdom on page two of the business supplement in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, which is well supported by that paper, but we should remember that the Deputy is the man who wanted to put Mr. FitzPatrick in charge of the country.  He is the man who questioned whether we could get 100,000 people back to work, but we have created 90,000 real jobs already, and we still have over a year of this term to run.  We will achieve and surpass that target of 100,000 jobs in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500065#NNN00300","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424894100,"counter":561,"content":"<p>Badly paid jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500066#OOO00200","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1424894100,"counter":562,"content":"<p>Sorry, Minister, Deputy Clare Daly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500066#OOO00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1424894100,"counter":563,"content":"<p>They are not badly paid jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500066#OOO00400","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1424894100,"counter":564,"content":"<p>They are badly paid jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500066#OOO00500","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1424894100,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Sorry, Minister, we are over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500066#OOO00600","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1424894100,"counter":566,"content":"<p>They are full-time, well paid jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500066#OOO00700","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1424894100,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Minister, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500066#OOO00800","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1424894100,"counter":568,"content":"<p>They are badly paid jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500066#OOO00900","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1424894100,"counter":569,"content":"<p>That is beneath the Deputy, who is normally quite fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500066#OOO01000","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1424894100,"counter":570,"content":"<p>Minister, you are way over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500066#OOO01100","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1424894100,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I will finish on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500066#OOO01200","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1424894100,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

There is propaganda being trotted out about Ireland being in a recovery, that a corner has been turned and a statement almost to the effect that unless someone is in utter deprivation and destitution, they are not really poor; they are grand.  That type of approach seems to be emanating from the Government benches.<br\/><br\/>It is quite clear the Government Members have no idea what it is like for people outside this House now.  Even behind respectable doors in nice areas, people are losing sleep due to having no money and the fear of the unexpected event that will knock them off track.  People are sick of managing, and not being able to afford the luxury of going out for a meal or whatever.<br\/><br\/>Poverty is not just about having an inadequate income.  It is about a poverty of lost opportunity, not being able to raise one's children or spend time with them because one is so stressed about money and so on.  It is not inevitable.  It is not because some people are lazy or not clever enough.  It is not even that there is not enough resources to go around.  The reason it exists is a deliberate consequence of a society where the wealth is owned and controlled by an ever-shrinking number of people who are becoming wealthier than ever before.  These people control Governments.  That is obvious in countries like the United States where the cost of running the country means they have to pay back their paymasters.  It is obvious in countries like Britain, as outlined in excellent books such as that written by Owen Jones, <i>The Establishment: And How They Get Away With It<\/i>, and it is the same in Ireland as well.  It is a consequence of unfettered neoliberal capitalism, and it is bad for everyone.<br\/><br\/>I find it an affront that on a global scale, when we live in a world where resources are greater than at any time previously, we face the prospect of our children being the first generation in decades to be poorer than us.  How could that be the case?  Rights that people thought were the norm, such as the right to a roof over their head, which is denied to hundreds of children here in Dublin tonight, the right to health if they are sick, which was denied to Gerry Feeney from Raheny, whose case was on the news tonight, who died in Beaumont Hospital two months ago in the most horrendous circumstances, the right to an education, which is not available for Traveller children as we saw in the courts yesterday, and the right to a pension, which is not there for the thousands of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta workers, were never in perpetuity.  They were not given.  They were fought for, and now the establishment is using the economic crisis, which was not of our creation, to claw some of that back.<br\/><br\/>It is a race to the bottom.  The idea of a secure, permanent, pensionable job is now put out there almost as a luxury.  People who are in that situation go around in fear that someone will blame them.  The attack on the public service was to the effect that at least they have a job, and what about the rest of us?  We had the same type of approach from Deputy Mulherin, who talked about hard-pressed middle income families not being able to send their children to college but then said that all the people on the dole can get a grant.  It is divide and rule.  The reason things exist is that we have had a subsidisation of the rich on a global scale and a transfer of wealth, and the figures back up that scenario.<br\/><br\/>I attended some interesting talks recently, hosted by Dr. Conor McCabe, evaluating the Irish economy.  It is interesting that Labour Deputies are quoting John FitzGerald and slating Michael Taft, who until recently was a member of their party.  He made the point that the Government is funded by three categories: taxation, charges and fees, and borrowings.  Of the tax element, two thirds comes from income tax and VAT, which is shouldered in the main by workers.  <br\/><br\/>What we have had is a transfer of wealth, involving tax breaks for the wealthy.  These are funded by cuts in social services.  The money the wealthy save in invested and they earn interest on it, and the Government has to borrow money to subsidise and meet the shortfall of the economic crisis.  One could not make up this stuff.  That is the background to this scenario.<br\/><br\/>The Government can doctor all the figures it likes but the reality is that it is not just about people being out of a job and that if they are given a job, everything will be okay.  Half the workforce earns &euro;27,000 or less and it onto their shoulders that the Government is foisting extra charges like water charges when there is an alternative.  There is wealth that can be taxed progressively in a meaningful way that would transform the living standards of ordinary people.  That is not an inevitability; it is a political choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500066#OOO01400","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1424894100,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank all my colleagues in the Technical Group for their contributions, and all the people who contributed to this discussion.  I do not want to spend a lot of time on the global picture in terms of Europe, Greece and so on except to say how right Deputy Ross is about the outrageous stab in the back this Government has given the Greek people when they are fighting to improve a dire situation.  If they had succeeded it would have benefited everybody in Europe, including the citizens in this country, yet the main concern of the Government seems to be not to get embarrassed by any success the Greek people might have because it would put it in a bad light.  That is disgraceful.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever happens in Greece and in Spain, it is a beacon of hope that, finally, there is some movement challenging the austerity agenda which has done such awful damage and which has the European economy on the floor.  It is stagnating, and at last somebody is challenging it.  I will leave that aside because many of the responses from the Government have been dishonest and disingenuous.  There have been diversions and red herrings, but it is not addressing the issue.<\/p>  <p>  The motion I put forward was not a comprehensive alternative economic strategy.  Many of the responses from the Government about costings and so on were disingenuous.  It was not about growth.<\/p><p>It was very specific.  If the Minister of State wants to see our document on jobs, growth and costings for an alternative economic programme, he should look at our pre-budget submissions and quiz them.  We put another one in this year, but that was not the point of this motion.<\/p> <p> The point of this motion was specifically to address deprivation, poverty and inequality.  We are pointing out that the levels of all those things in society are unacceptable.  It is not a defence to say they are even worse somewhere else, because they are unacceptable here.  The levels of inequality and deprivation are absolutely shocking.<\/p> <p> The Government's idea is to reduce consistent child poverty to 4% by 2020, but it will not eliminate it.  The policy formally announced by the Government is that the poor are always going to be with us, but that is not good enough.  We do not believe the Government when it is in its fourth year of office.  This motion served to point out that deprivation and child poverty have got worse under this Government.  In addition, the housing crisis and homelessness have also got worse.  The age profile of poor people has risen under this Government, so can Ministers at least acknowledge that?  They should admit the problem and address it, instead of giving us a load of nonsense announcing plans for three, four or five years' time, which mean nothing.<\/p> <p> Even the ESRI and EUROSTAT have said the budgets in 2012 and 2013 were aggressive, hitting those at the lowest level hardest and disproportionately.  They have driven more people into deprivation.  That is a fact.  What is the Government going to do about it?  Is it willing to reverse the measures that have indisputably contributed to that situation?<\/p> <p> Whatever justification the Minister of State may give for water charges or property tax, is he saying they are not regressive compared with an income tax system for funding the same thing?  Is he also saying that a person on or below the poverty line will not be driven further into deprivation through having to pay for those things?  That is self-evident.  The Minister of State could possibly argue that those charges are justified on other people, but he cannot say that the situation of somebody who cannot currently pay his or her bills and receives a property tax bill through the letterbox has improved.  It is obvious that such a person's situation has disimproved.<\/p> <p> It is also obvious that child benefit cuts have hurt lone parents, while rent allowance cuts and caps have contributed to homelessness and the housing crisis.  It is obvious that the Government's policy adopted in its first year in office, for whatever reason, to abandon the direct provision of social housing construction by local authorities and outsource it to the private sector has contributed to longer housing waiting lists.  A few years ago the delay was six or seven years but now it is 14 or 15 years.  Those on the waiting list will not get a house any time soon.<\/p> <p> Can the Minister of State seriously say that cutting the jobseeker's allowance for young people under 26 has not contributed to homelessness?  Perhaps he could argue that if young people happen to be living at home then it is bearable.  I might disagree with him, but he would have an argument.  If someone under 26 is not living at home, does not have a job and has only &euro;100, then they are homeless.  One cannot get a house on that kind of money.  The rent allowance cap means it is impossible.<\/p> <p> We are asking the Government to reverse the cuts that have indisputably contributed to a growth in deprivation for children, lone parents and others on low incomes.  The USC has crushed the low-paid sector.  While the Government's policies have gone too far, there has been some acknowledgement that the USC has been an intolerable burden for the low paid.  Ireland has the second highest level of low pay in the OECD.  The Government partially acknowledged that with some of its recent budget measures, but the matter has not been fully addressed.<\/p> <p> Other measures, as Deputy Halligan said, are actually moving things in the opposite direction.  Jobs that were lost when the crash occurred have been largely replaced with less well-paid jobs, schemes or internships.  The Minister of State may argue that that is best he can do, but he cannot seriously suggest that somebody who was working in construction on &euro;700 or &euro;800 a week but is now on a Gateway scheme, is in a better position.  That is a joke.<\/p> <p> One Government myth that needs to be dispelled is that we do not care about jobs or growth.  The Government says it will cost &euro;4 billion to do what we want, and the money will be poured down the drain.  The Government says it is responsible in caring about jobs and growth.  I will make an obvious point.  If we built more council houses it would put people back to work and save the State money.  The Government does not factor that into its &euro;4 billion figure.  It would save all the money currently going to rent allowance, as well as reducing the social welfare bill.  If money were put back into the poorest people's pockets, it would boost the high street.  If young children were not living in poverty, they would have more chance of getting work or education.  However, none of those multipliers is taken into account in the Government's figures, so it is disingenuous.<\/p> <p> Similarly, the Government tries to blur the issue of wealth concentration, which is shocking.  The Minister of State said the reason net household wealth has gone up is because property prices have risen.  I am sorry but he should read the Central Bank's quarterly report which said the rise in household wealth over the last year was a result of increased financial household assets.  There was a &euro;3.6 billion increase in financial household assets, not in property.<\/p> <p> The top 10% has either 40%, or maybe up to 58%, of the wealth totalling &euro;508 billion.  That is &euro;260 billion but is that in property assets such as a family home?  Of course not.  It is the people who own multiple properties.  They are the big corporate investors who bought up all the property at rock bottom prices.  Is that not a visible example of the increased concentration of wealth?  Big corporate investors bought up the homes of all the people who were repossessed.  The super-rich waited for prices to hit rock bottom and then moved in to buy, before jacking up all the rents.  Only rich people can afford to rent now.  Those on low incomes seeking to rent property are in danger of becoming homeless, even if they are working.  That is how bad it is, yet none of this is acknowledged by the Government.<\/p> <p> I am not being prescriptive in detailing how to reverse these cuts and regressive charges.  Let us agree with the principle that these are regressive and have contributed to deprivation.  We must eliminate poverty and deprivation, so let us examine the options for finding the funds to do this in a way that will not worsen or perpetuate deprivation.  We should examine corporate profits, the super-high earners and the financial transaction tax, but the Government will not even look at those things, despite that this is all this motion is asking the Government to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022500066#OOO01500","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424894700,"counter":576,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.
