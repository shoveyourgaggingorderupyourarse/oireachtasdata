It is critical that companies, and people, acquire technical skills and transversal skills, such as leadership, creativity, team working, problem solving and emotional intelligence, and that our talent pipeline meets these dual needs.<\/p>  <p>  Central to this is the partnership approach between the Further and Higher Education system and Government, Industry, the National Skills Council, the National Training Fund Advisory Group, the Regional Skills Fora and the Apprenticeship Council. <\/p>  <p>  The National Skills Council (NSC) within its remit advises on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and on how to secure delivery of these needs.

The Department facilitates the development of skilled professionals across all economic sectors through a well planned skills infrastructure and a responsive tertiary education system. <\/p>  <p>  The identification of skills priorities to help inform and shape planning for graduate output from higher and further education is guided by the National Skills Strategy. The Strategy provided for the establishment of the skills architecture that we have today, the National Skills Council and the nine Regional Skills Fora. Underpinning both the skills agenda and architecture are the skills forecasting and intelligence systems, made up of the contribution of a number of public bodies including, at present, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in SOLAS and the statistical analysis and assessment carried out by the HEA.  The detailed research and analyses carried out by these bodies feed into the work of the Skills Council in defining the priorities and delivering responses in the area of skills needs.<\/p>  <p>  The development of apprenticeships, upskilling and retraining existing professionals and other tertiary educational interventions feed into providing for the availability of sufficiently skilled operatives across the workforce. These include targeted interventions such as Springboard+, the Human Capital Initiative at higher education level and also Skillnet Ireland which supports training and development for employed people from short courses and awareness raising measures to level 9 Masters programmes.  <\/p>  <p>  A key strength of the apprenticeship model, is that it is a demand-led approach to meeting workforce and skill requirements in our economy. Therefore the number of places is determined by employers with off the job training delivered to all registered apprentices.  Actions in the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 continue to be implemented, to work towards delivering a flexible and responsive system for employers and potential apprentices, which is attractive and easy to engage with and delivers high standards and sought after qualifications. <\/p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme has supported a significant recovery of apprentice registrations in 2020 and into 2021 and has enabled apprentice registrations to exceed registrations for 2019.

Underpinned by a capital investment of &euro;20 million in 2021 and agreement on changed workpractices to support a time-limited response, the waiting list will be reduced by 40% by the end of 2021 and cleared by end 2022. <\/p>  <p>  Of the 62 apprenticeship programmes currently available, leading to qualifications at level 5-10 on the National Framework of Qualifications. A further 17 programmes are in development in sectors such as agriculture, ICT, hospitality, construction, engineering, horticulture and commercial driving.  The development of a new apprenticeship is employer-led, with consortia comprising employer groups and educational providers coming together to identify a skills need and appropriate apprenticeship response in their sector. In addition curricula in apprenticeships are being updated on an ongoing basis to keep pace with changes in industry practices and regulations. <\/p>  <p>  FET provides a diverse range of programmes and supports designed to meet the needs of individuals at different stages of the learning pathway. Courses focused on foundation or transversal skills development, including literacy and numeracy and digital skills, build the core capabilities that allow participants to move on to more advanced learning opportunities. A range of programmes are focused more formally on facilitating pathways to other education and training opportunities and often bridge the gap between foundational learning and accessing vocationally focused programmes. These vocational programmes focus on providing skills that enable direct progression to the workplace, while also enabling pathways into higher education. Vocational programmes typically have a strong work-based component.<\/p>  <p>  The traineeship model combines learning in the classroom and experience in the workplace to improve employment outcomes for participants and increase retention and productivity in the sector. Trainees may include school leavers, older learners, those in employment and those who are unemployed.  Traineeships are between 6 to 20 months in duration, with at least 30% of learning being on-the-job and lead to a level 4 to 6 award on the National Framework of Qualifications.  Over 75 programmes are available nationally in a range of industries with new Traineeships being developed on an ongoing basis by Education and Training Boards. Further information and a list of traineeships available is available on www.traineeship.ie.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of key strategies in place at all levels to ensure we meet existing and future skills demands. These include policies designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified Higher Education graduates, and initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands. These strategies and initiatives include: Springboard+; the Human Capital Initiative and Modular Skills Provision. Springboard+ complements the core State-funded education and training system and provides free or 90% funded upskilling and reskilling higher education opportunities in areas of identified skills need. <\/p>  <p>  The Human Capital Initiative (HCI) programme was announced as part of Budget 2019, with a primary objective of underpinning the provision of additional capacity across the Higher Education Sector to meet priority skill needs for enterprise.  Funding of &euro;15m provided 11,597 places on 538 Modular courses in 32 higher education institutions in 2020. Following the success of the 2020 July Stimulus programme a further 4,119 places are being made available on Modular Skills Provision courses in 2021. All courses are shorter and more focused and will be offered in a flexible manner, allowing people to gain important skills without taking a considerable period away from the labour market. They will represent a new route into lifelong learning, and provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities for those who need it, while ensuring that they remain close to the labour market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300065#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Education","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300065#WRB02150"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[49757\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300065#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the detail of the official advice from his Department regarding in-person lectures and classes in third-level institutions (details supplied).","asker":"1605","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>Following Government approval, I published A Safe Return: Plan for a safe return to on-site Further and Higher Education and Research in 2021\/22 on June 15th.

As in any statutory scheme, a core principle of the scheme is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for applicants as part of the means assessment process. All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. <\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. <\/p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020.

If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. <\/p>  <p>  Such a change in circumstances would clearly include no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment.

This is an issue which has gained momentum in the last number of years and consideration needs to be given to how this could be best articulated and supported through the national strategy.   <\/p>  <p>  Research is a strategic national asset. The engaged research&ndash;policy dialogue is an important agenda for Ireland as it seeks to utilise all of the resources available to it to meet current and future challenges to the best of its ability. This is also an area where, if we can get it right, Ireland can be a leader within the EU and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  There are specific programmes in place which support this agenda. As Ireland&rsquo;s national science and engineering funding agency with in depth knowledge of the capabilities available in our (publicly-funded) research institutions, Science Foundation Ireland is developing a portfolio of programmes that aim to broker the collaboration between the academic research community and government departments, agencies and local councils, to contribute to solving challenges of strategic national importance by providing researchers with support to work hand-in-hand with policy and decision makers.<\/p>  <p>  A key goal for SFI is to promote and strengthen the engagement between public service bodies and science and engineering researchers based in Ireland, to promote effective collaboration in the pursuit of solutions to pressing global and national challenges. Science has a critical role to play in tackling the complex global problems we as a society are facing including, but not limited to, pandemic preparedness, climate change, energy supply, food sustainability, environmental pollution, increased prevalence of mental health, challenges facing an ageing population, housing shortages and equality and inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  The SFI Public Service Fellowship, which was launched in 2019, is a pilot initiative which offers researchers a unique opportunity to be temporarily seconded to Government departments, agencies and the Library and Research Service of the Oireachtas, to work on specific projects where they can add value, resulting in mutually beneficial outcomes.

Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. The core allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million per annum currently supports circa 14,000 students.  This includes &euro;1 million which was added to the fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups. Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only.  As part of the package of COVID supports provided by Government again this year, &euro;10 million was allocated to an Access Funding package of which &euro;8.1 million was allocated to the Student Assistance Fund. &euro;1.9m has been allocated to COVID19 Contingency Fund for Access Services. The total funding available in 2021 under the Student Assistance Fund to &euro;17.2m.<\/p>  <p>  The principal funding source for students with disabilities is the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD). The purpose of the Fund is to provide funding to higher and further education institutions to assist them in offering supports and services to eligible students with disabilities so that they can participate on an equal basis with their peers.  <\/p>  <p>  The FSD aims to support the personal, educational and professional development of the participating student and contribute to the achievement of their full potential. Eligible students can receive assistance from the FSD from further education level 5 up to doctoral level 10, and it can be applied for during any year of study. The FSD operates as a funding allocation to approved higher education institutions and PLC colleges. The actual level of support to be provided to individual students is decided by each HEI who carry out a needs assessment to determine the types of supports and accommodations needed. Funding can be used to provide supports and accommodations for assistive technology, equipment and software, non-medical helpers, academic or learning support, deaf supports and transport. <\/p>  <p>  There are three strands to the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) with an overall funding envelope of &euro;41m. Strand 1 supports access to initial teacher education from the target groups identified in the National Access Plan. Strand 2 provides bursaries to students who have been identified by their higher education institution as being the most socio-economically disadvantaged students in the target groups under the National Access Plan. Strand 3 supports regional clusters of higher education institutions with the aim of attracting additional students from groups currently under-represented in higher education. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of PATH 2 for the 2021\/22 academic year, three tiers of bursaries will be available for awarding to the most socio economically disadvantaged students from National Access Plan Target groups across six clusters. Tier 1 is &euro;5,000 per annum for the duration of studies awarded to a total of 203 students across the six clusters ; Tier 2 - &euro;2,000 per annum for the duration of studies to a total of 120 students across the six clusters who met the criteria for the 1916 Bursary but who did not ultimately qualify for a Tier 1 bursary; Tier 3 &ndash; Once-off bursary of &euro;1,500 payable for the 2021\/22 academic year only to students who met the criteria for the 1916 Bursary but who did not ultimately qualify for a Tier 1 or Tier 2 bursary. The provision of this once-off bursary is in recognition of the exceptional circumstances that incoming students will experience when starting college in 2021\/22 and the impact of Covid-19 on family incomes of students from target groups.<\/p>  <p>  Ring-fenced funding of &euro;300,000 is available in HEIs for targeted supports to address the implications of COVID-19 for Traveller transfer to and progression within higher education. The funding, which has been secured through the Dormant Accounts Fund, will help ensure expected increases in Traveller participation in higher education remain on track. <\/p>  <p>  Students may also be eligible for Tax Relief at the standard rate of tax in respect of tuition fees paid for their course. Further information on this tax relief is available from the student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.<\/p>  <p>The third National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education (2015 &ndash; 2021) was launched in December 2015. The vision of the National Access Plan is to ensure that the student body entering into, participating in and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland's population. The Plan identifies the target groups that are currently under-represented in higher education. These include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education, Irish Travellers, students with disabilities, first time mature student entrants, part-time\/flexible learners and further education award holders. Lone parents are also included in this grouping. Work on the development of the next National Access Plan (NAP) 2022 - 2026 is currently underway. The consultation process, which closed on 18th June 2021, invited all interested parties to make their views known on this matter and other matters related to access to higher education particularly for groups who are underrepresented in the higher education population.  One-to-one stakeholder meetings around the specific target groups to be supported for the period of the next NAP are currently underway.  Colleagues in my Department are working closely with the HEA on the development of the new Plan with the intention of publishing the plan in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  FET provision is largely free or heavily subsidised. The only fees are PLC fees which are a nominal &euro;200 per student (not including those entitled to a medical card or SUSI grant). About 40% of students pay the fee. Fees are collected at the start of the academic year.<\/p>  <p>  Apprentices are paid an allowance equivalent to their on-the-job wages for periods spent in education and training institutions. In addition, unemployed participants on training courses are paid a training allowance by ETBs based on their DEASP payment.  In the case of training for unemployed people, these allowances are integral parts of the programmes, as (i) they facilitate the participation of individuals who would not otherwise be in a position to take up training and (ii) they ensure that only individuals who are active participants in the training are in receipt of the allowances. Your local Intreo Office can advise if you are entitled to any allowances whilst on a training course.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, accommodation, meal and travel allowances are paid to learners to assist them with the cost of actual attendance on some courses.<\/p>  <p>  A Mitigating Against Educational Disadvantage (MAED) fund worth &euro;8 million was allocated in Budget 2021 to the FET sector. The MAED fund was managed by SOLAS and provided funds to support educationally disadvantaged learners in accessing and participating in FET. It also enabled investment in building the digital infrastructure of FET providers and their capability to ensure that online learning can be delivered in a way that meets the complex needs of all FET learners, and that these learners have the skills that will allow them to effectively participate. <\/p>  <p>  In light of the great successes of the MAEDF and in recognition of the continuing challenges in this area, a further &euro;10 million is being allocated to the fund for next year. The purpose of the second MAED fund is to assist Education and Training Boards to increase their capacity and that of community education providers to address the decline in participation of disadvantaged learners particularly those on literacy and basic skills programmes at NFQ levels 1 to 3. The Fund places a strong focus on community education as a mechanism to continue to support and engage with disadvantaged learners. In addition, there is a focus on enabling the investment in building the digital infrastructure of providers and their capability to ensure that online learning\/blended learning can be delivered in a way that meets the complex needs of learners.

The FSD is one of the main funding sources supporting participation by students with disabilities in approved further and higher education courses in Ireland. It also supports students from Ireland to study on approved courses in EU countries and in the UK, including Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>Higher education institutions (HEIs) receive block grant funding in respect of FSD for a full calendar year (the allocation is based on the Resource Allocation Return (RAR) for the previous academic year). It is a matter for disability support sta? in HEIs to complete a needs assessment in respect of each student. On completion of the needs assessment, disability support sta? determine the appropriate supports required by students and FSD funding may be used to provide these supports provided that they are consistent with the categories of eligible expenditure listed above. <\/p><p>HEIs must operate within the FSD budget that they are allocated on a calendar year basis and the HEA will not provide additional funding to a HEI if it exceeds its allocation. A contingency fund to provide additional support to HEIs which experience significant year-on-year increases in applications for support, in particular from high needs students, has also been established. <\/p><p>In the Irish higher education sector, the number of students eligible for supports funded under the FSD has increased from just over 10,097 in 2016\/17 to 14,358 in 2019\/20. Since 2018, and included in the overall figure, part-time students have been eligible for support under the FSD &ndash; 463 part-time students were supported in 2019\/20. 987 postgraduate students were supported in 2019\/20. In the case of the further education sector, the number of students has increased from 1,614 to 1,966. <\/p><p>The current National Access Plan set targets for participation in higher education by people with disabilities. In the case of the FSD, targets were set for three specific groups. These targets were already exceeded by 2019 and the numbers of students in these groups has continued to increase.<\/p><p>New targets were set for 2021 following the progress review in 2018 which extended the current National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019 by 2 year to 2021. The revisedtarget for the number of students with a physical\/mobility disability was 767. Based on 2019\/20 data this figure currently stands at 867. For students who are deaf or hard of hearing the revised target was set at 352 and the 2019\/20 data reflects a figure of 364, and finally for students who are blind or have a visual impairment the target was 200 and based on 2019\/20 data this currently stands at 234, an increase 34. <\/p><p>In addition, the number of students with disabilities as a percentage of new entrants in higher education has increased and was 12.2% in 2019\/20, thus exceeding the National Access Plan target of 12%.<\/p><p>This current Plan will expire at the end of the 2021.  This Department along with the HEA are currently working on implementing the next Plan which will span 5 years from 2022 &ndash; 2026.  It is hoped to publish the new Plan at the end of 2021 or early 2022.<\/p><p>For 2020 the HEA allocated &euro;7.085m to the higher education sector. HEIs&rsquo; expenditure returns (submitted in Q1 2021) indicated overall expenditure of &euro;6.666m.  <\/p><p>In 2019\/20 academic year a total of 14,358 students in higher education institutions received supports eligible for funding under the FSD. This represents an increase of 8.7% compared to the previous year. 987 of these were postgraduate students and 463 were part-time. <\/p><p>In January 2021 I announced approval for strategic initiatives aimed at supporting students with disabilities. The funding for the projects comes from historical underspends in the Fund for Students with Disabilities. The initiatives, which now encompass 24 HEIs and &euro;5.4m in expenditure, are broad and are aimed at improving access to higher education for people with a disability, to improving college campuses and to assist staff with training and development. The following examples outline the projects that are being implemented by HEIs using the fund which include<\/p><p><b>Sensory Spaces<\/b>: A number of projects focus on establishing autism friendly spaces. Nine HEIs are designing spaces of respite for students with sensory needs to avoid overstimulation and also for the general student population to have a quiet space to retreat to. These spaces will include advanced technology and equipment such as sensory pods and modules, low lights, sensory projectors and music software etc. This will have a huge impact for students with autism and will create a much more inclusive campus environment.<\/p><p><b>- Development of Assistive Technology (AT<\/b>). A number of HEIs are also using the fund to develop assistive technology for students with disabilities. This includes allocating and developing specific rooms for the use of AT hardware. HEIs are also introducing AT software (JAWS, TextHelp, Read&amp;amp;Write, ZoomText etc.) and AT hardware (height adjustable desk, fixed computers with AT software, large screen monitors etc.) into campus meeting spaces.<\/p><p><b>- Wayfinding Apps<\/b>. HEIs are designing Wayfinding apps to help students with disabilities navigate their way around campus. These apps can be used by students with physical disabilities to find accessible routes around campus, they can act as a guide for visually impaired students, and students with ASD, anxiety and mental health issues can use a wayfinding app to locate their closest sensory space or quiet zone.<\/p><p><b>- Universal Design for Learning (UDL).<\/b>HEIs are using the underspend to fund projects that are specifically aimed at promoting UDL within their institution. These projects include the creation of an online module and guidelines for teachers which will ensure students with disabilities can participate equally, the development of HEI UDL strategies focused on fostering the development of academic teaching and professional staff practices to align with the principles of UDL, and the introduction of Universal Design champions and specialists into HEIs.<\/p><p><b>- Accessibility Audits and Improvements<\/b>. A number of HEIs are also using the fund to make minor but important accessibility improvements to campus. These include wheelchair accessible doors and bathrooms, accessible lab benches, and carrying out accessibility audits to evaluate current campus accessibility and improvements that need to be made in the future.<\/p><p><b>- Mental Health Support and Resources. <\/b>HEIs are also using the fund to the provide additional mental health supports and resources to students. These include online counselling support, the recruitment of mental health and wellbeing coordinators, and building on existing one-to-one and small group supports. <\/p><p>While the FSD provides disability supports in both higher education and further education and training (FET), up until last year the HEA administered the entire Fund. However, it should be noted that &euro;1.9m of the Fund transferred to SOLAS in 2020 to assist with disability supports in the FET sector, and SOLAS will continue to manage the FET element of the FSD going forward. Supports in the FET sector available through the FSD include academic\/learning support, assistive technology equipment &amp;amp; software, hearing impaired supports, examination supports, non-medical helpers and transport supports for learners with a disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300067#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Adult Education Provision","counter":169,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300067#WRD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":170,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[49626\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300067#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way it is envisaged higher and further education institutions will assist in the provision and expansion of adult literacy, numeracy and digital skills courses as provided for in the recently-launched strategy.","asker":"1566","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":171,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[49828\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300067#WRD01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to increase the number of learners engaging with literacy and language support by 20,000 by expanding the range of courses available over the first half of the Adult Literacy, Numeracy and Digital Literacy 10 Year Strategy&rsquo;s lifetime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1456","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[49825\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300067#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to reduce the share of adults in Ireland without basic digital skills from 47% to 20% as committed to in the Adult Literacy, Numeracy and Digital Literacy 10 Year Strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1519","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":173,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 72 and 163 together.<\/p>  <p>  I was delighted to launch the Adult Literacy for Life Strategy on International Literacy Day, 8th September.

As in any statutory scheme, a core principle of the scheme is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for applicants as part of the means assessment process. All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. <\/p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for SUSI to determine. For the 2021\/22 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the reference period 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. <\/p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit\/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. <\/p>  <p>  However, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. <\/p>  <p>  Such a change in circumstances would clearly include no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment. Students will no longer receive the PUP from early September, in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.<\/p>  <p>  An applicant can request a review by contacting the SUSI Support Desk at 0761 087 874 or emailing support@susi.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The change of circumstances provision is a well-established procedure and it can also operate at scale.  For example, over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in the 2020\/21 academic year and some 40% of these applications related to COVID-19. I am confident that the application of this provision will continue to allow the scheme to be flexible and responsive to people's circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Any student who believes his\/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.<\/p>  <p>  Under Article 22(5)(b) of the Student Grant Scheme 2021, income from an applicant&rsquo;s employment which represents holiday earnings outside of term time but within the reference period up to a maximum of &euro;4,500 can be deducted from the total reckonable income assessed. <\/p>  <p>  This holiday earnings disregard under the Student Grant Scheme can only be applied to income from employment earned by the student in the manner described. The holiday earnings disregard pertains specifically to income from employment only; there is no provision to offset this disregard against any other sources of income, such as a social welfare payment.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that restrictions were eased during the summer months and the Christmas period which enabled many students to return to work. Those students, who engaged in work during non-term times when restrictions were eased in 2020, can avail of the holiday earnings provision and have that income excluded from their reckonable income up to the value of &euro;4,500 for the 2021\/22 grant scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300067#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further and Higher Education","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300067#WRD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[49874\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300067#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the specific proposals there are to expand the further education sector in 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":179,"content":"<p>The further education and training (FET) sector plays a critical role in labour market activation and in upskilling and reskilling people.

The student contribution applies annually to all FFI eligible students and the current rate is &euro;3,000 per annum.<\/p>  <p>  In considering the appropriate level of student contribution it is important to consider that the student contribution charge replaced the previous Student Services Charge which were up to &euro;1,500 in 2010\/11. Importantly, the Exchequer pays the student contribution, in full or part, on behalf of students who qualify under the student grant scheme.  In 2020\/21 over 65,000 or approximately 45% of free fee eligible students had all or part of their student contribution funding paid on their behalf through student support grants. We are reviewing grants available through SUSI to ensure that students supports are appropriate, <\/p>  <p>  The student contribution costs as shared between the students and the state is a significant element of the overall income of our higher education institutions. In this regard the student contribution rate requires consideration in the context of a sustainable model of funding for higher education. <\/p>  <p>  My Department's statement of strategy, which I published on 8 March, contains a commitment to put in place that sustainable funding model for higher education. This is essential in ensuring our higher education institutions can effectively meet high standards of quality and performance and achieve critical outcomes for society and the economy.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, I am very encouraged by the recent completion of a comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options presented in the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education (2016) as supported under the European Commission DG Reform Programme.

As a first step, this Budget provides for &euro;222 million in funding for higher education institutions including university superannuation funding over two years, which will strengthen university balance sheets.  This funding allocation will also provide continued additional investment in capacity building and additional places in the higher education sector in response to demographic pressures, Covid and the exceptional demand from this year's calculated grades leaving certificate.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of funding, in advance of and since the publication of the 2016 a significant programme of re-investment in higher education has been implemented.  Since 2015 annual expenditure allocated to higher education has increased by more than 40%.   In 2022 this allocation will be in excess of &euro;2billion<\/p>  <p>  This significant allocation of public resources is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to meeting the funding needs of the higher education sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300067#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":192,"content":"<p>Question No. 72 answered with Question No. 65<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Staff","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300067#WRD02650"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[48750\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300067#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he is satisfied that all contracts issued to staff who teach and research in all higher education institutions are secure and provide for progression.","asker":"1514","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>Third-level institutions have autonomy in relation to human resource policies, subject to the requirement to comply with employment legislation.

The number of apprentices in any specific sector is therefore determined directly by employer provision. <\/p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme was established to ensure that apprenticeship plays a key part in supporting economic recovery during and immediately following COVID-19 measures.  It comprises a &euro;2,000 payment when employers register a new apprentice, followed by an additional &euro;1,000 payment one year later where that apprentice is retained.  The scheme has supported the continued recruitment of apprentices over the COVID-19 period, with almost &euro;11m approved for payment in respect of 5,471 apprentice registrations by the first of October. <\/p>  <p>  From the 1st July 2021 access to the scheme has included a requirement to either have published the apprentice vacancy on apprenticeshipjobs.ie or provide a stated rationale for non-advertisement of the post.  This facilitates increased accessibility of apprentice jobs and is also providing information on the rationale behind employer decision making on non-advertisement of opportunities.  This will support future policy in relation to advertising of apprenticeship openings.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment, funding and success of the scheme is a strong demonstration of both my and the Government's commitment to the development and growth of apprenticeship in Ireland. This growth will be sustained and intensified through the implementation of the Action Plan on Apprenticeship 2021-2025 which sets out a five year pathway to make apprenticeship accessible to employers and learners. <\/p>  <p>  Targeting 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025 the Plan addresses the clear need to broaden the awareness of apprenticeship as a work-based route to internationally recognised qualifications and experience for people of all ages, be they progressing in their career, school leavers or career changers. Growing that message is a key feature of planning for apprenticeship in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  A new National Apprenticeship Office will make accessing information on, and engagement with, apprenticeship more straightforward for both learners and employers.  In 2022 we will launch financial supports for employers of apprentices and the public service will set out a roadmap for the recruitment of apprentices. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan the impacts of, and outcomes from, existing access to apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programmes as well as other interventions across the sector will be examined to provide an evidence base for best practice and future interventions to deliver an apprentice population which better reflects the general population.  Enhanced cooperation with the State's Public Employment Service will also increase visibility of apprenticeship to career changers and job seekers.<\/p>  <p>  Supporting students to make informed choices on future careers, information on apprenticeship and further education and training opportunities will be available on the CAO site from late Autumn 2021.  The development of apprenticeship taster courses is also being explored as part of Transition Year and Senior Cycle reform with the NCCA. <\/p>  <p>  Under actions set out in the plan, linkages to and from major career guidance and further and higher application resources will drive initial recognition of the range of offerings available to learners across the system. Apprenticeship will also be positioned within career guidance websites and support structures, as a clear route to qualifications and a career in areas of proven skills need for learners of all ages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300068#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":250,"content":"<p>Question No. 93 answered with Question No. 37.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300068#WRE02500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits","counter":251,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300068#WRE02450"},{"type":"question","counter":252,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[49993\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300068#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"his plans to remove hospitality workers from the ineligible list of occupations for employment permits in view of the ongoing recruitment issues facing the hospitality sector as it continues to reopen in line with the Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":253,"content":"<p>The employment permits system is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and\/or labour shortages, in circumstances where there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.<\/p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where there is a surplus of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market.<\/p>  <p>  In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy and to ensure their ongoing relevance to the State&rsquo;s human capital requirements, they undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews.

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention. <\/p><p>I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway. <\/p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 7 October over 264,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed and over 108,000 premises are under construction across 30 Deployment Areas. The first premises are connected in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Monahgan.\u00a0 Surveys are complete or underway in County Cork in Midelton, Cullen, Templebreedy, Carrigaline, Ballyfoyle, Douglas, Ballyphehane, Glasheen, Mahon, Kilpatrick, Ballydesmond, Kiskeam, Umeraboy, Knocknagree, Rineen, Cullen, Coolinarna, Millstreet, Hollymount and Caherbarnagh.\u00a0 Main works are ongoing in\u00a0 Carrigaline, Fountainstown, Ballinhassig, Monkstown and Upper Rochestown. Pre-works ongoing in Midleton.<\/p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.<\/p><p>In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. <\/p><p>Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.<\/p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 1 October, 379 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Aubane Community Centre, Whitechurch Community Centre, Mealagh Valley Community Centre, Lissavard Community Centre, The Old Schoolhouse Dromina, \u00a0Ballindangan Community Centre, Bere Island Heritage Centre, Sherkin Island Community Hall, Col&aacute;iste Phobal Cl&eacute;ire, Aghabullogue Community Centre, Courtbrack Community Centre, Castletownkenneigh Community Centre, Laharn Heritage Centre, T.O.

My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP.

Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions they apply to those policies.<\/p><p>Insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, including for motor trade insurance policies.  Factors may include those such as the driver&rsquo;s age and experience, the relevant claims record, and so on.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices vary across the market. Consumers are accordingly free to choose whatever product best meets their needs, with price obviously being a relevant factor. Insurance companies will also price and offer cover in accordance with their own past claims experience.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the above, seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government. It is my intention, along with Minister of State Fleming, to work to ensure that the commitments outlined in the <i>Programme for Government <\/i>are progressed in accordance with the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform<\/i>.

This shows that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 34 of the 66 actions now completed. The Sub-Group&rsquo;s focus now is on implementing the outstanding actions on time.<\/p><p>In relation to motor insurance prices more generally, I would note that, according to Central Statistics Office (CSO) data for July 2021, motor insurance prices are continuing to decline. Motor insurance prices in June were 34.7% lower than their peak in July 2016; and 5.7% lower than when the Government&rsquo;s Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform was established in September 2020. It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that this positive downward trend continues as the reform agenda progresses.<\/p><p>With respect to the correspondence highlighted in the question, it may interest the individual involved to know that Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers in this country, operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover.

In addition, Brokers Ireland can be contacted at . <\/p><p>I would also note that a person who is unable to secure a motor insurance quotation on the open market, may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement process.  Under the terms of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA), which is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking motor insurance if he or she has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.

The survey, undertaken by the Central Statistics Office, is a census of all enterprises that are believed to be engaged in R&amp;amp;D activities in all business sectors of the economy.

Pillar One will see a reallocation of a proportion of profits to the jurisdiction of the consumer. This means that, in effect, corporate tax revenue streams which now flow to the Irish Exchequer will flow to the Exchequers of other countries when implemented.  Pillar Two will see the adoption of a new global minimum effective tax rate of 15% applying to multinationals with global revenues in excess of &euro;750m.<\/p>  <p>  While the final cost is very difficult to predict, my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have previously estimated that the cost of the agreement could be between &euro;800m and &euro;2 billion annually when both pillars come into effect. These figures are included in the Stability Programme Update and the Summer Economic Statement (SES). Given the uncertainty over the potential implementation of any agreement, this costing was phased in over a number of years, with the SES assuming a &euro;1 billion impact in 2023, rising to &euro;1.5 billion in 2024 and &euro;2 billion in 2025.<\/p>  <p>  There have been significant changes to the original proposals since then, both in relation to Pillar One, in which there is now a higher re-allocation than was originally foreseen, and on Pillar Two.  However, it should be stressed that while there is now a broad high level agreement in place on the main features of a solution, discussions are continuing and will continue into 2022 on how the Agreement will be implemented in practice. For instance, the discussions on Pillar One will need to examine the rules in respect to reallocation from entities within a group. Further, it remains to be seen what additional tax will be paid by MNEs under Pillar Two when substance based carve-out rules are applied which can reduce the effective tax rate paid. <\/p>  <p>  As technical discussions on the implementation framework continue, officials from my Department and from Revenue will keep the position under review and, when and if necessary, my Department will provide an update on how the agreement is expected to impact the public finances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300069#WRF03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illicit Trade","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300069#WRF03500"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[50080\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300069#WRF03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the action that will be taken by statutory agencies in relation to the threat posed to retailers and communities by criminal gangs selling illicit roll your own tobacco and the impact that this criminality has on areas such as the Border region; if his attention has been drawn to the relatively minimal infrastructure required for criminals to produce counterfeit tobacco; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[50081\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300069#WRF03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the recent large scale seizures of raw tobacco reported by the Revenue Commissioners indicate the possible presence of one or more illegal tobacco factories operating on the island of Ireland; if he has discussed this threat with enforcement authorities with a view to protecting communities and legitimate retailers from the availability or illegally manufactured tobacco; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 114 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that Revenue uses a range of measures to identify and target the smuggling, supply or sale of illicit tobacco products, with a view to disrupting the supply chain, seizing the products and where possible, prosecuting those involved. Revenue&rsquo;s strategy involves developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources on a risk-focused basis. This strategy plays a key role in targeting the activities of organised crime groups responsible for much of this criminality who operate across multiple jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  I am also aware that Revenue monitors trends in the illicit tobacco trade on an ongoing basis and adjusts its actions and redeploys its resources in response to new developments or methodologies employed by the criminal gangs involved in that trade. The smuggling of tobacco products has a transnational and cross border dimension and in addition to Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing involvement in the Cross-Border Joint Agency Task Force (JATF) and cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this area, I am advised that Revenue also works closely with international bodies including OLAF (the EU&rsquo;s anti-fraud agency), Europol and the World Customs Organisation.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it is conducting ongoing joint investigations with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) as regards the illicit production of tobacco products. Since March 2018, Revenue has seized over 100,000kgs of raw tobacco. Four illicit cigarette manufacturing facilities have been discovered and dismantled on the island of Ireland as result of investigations by the JATF. These successful outcomes include the discovery of an illicit cigarette manufacturing facility in Co. Armagh in July this year as a result of a joint investigation by Revenue and HMRC. I am further advised that increases in the detection and seizure of illicit tobacco are due to continued cooperation and intelligence sharing with other national and international law enforcement agencies and Revenue&rsquo;s advanced profiling methods and strategic use of appropriate detection technology. <\/p>  <p>  I commend Revenue and all the relevant State agencies for their work in this important area and I am satisfied that there is an appropriate focus on tackling this form of criminality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300069#WRF03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":312,"content":"<p>Question No. 114 answered with Question No. 113.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":313,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300069#WRF04000"},{"type":"question","counter":314,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[50154\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300069#WRF04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the supports available to older and vulnerable households in order to assist them in submitting their local property tax revaluation given that many persons are unable to access the online valuation tool and other information online; if he will establish a helpline in order to provide assistance to persons for this process; if he will arrange a follow-up awareness campaign to inform persons that such a helpline exists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":315,"content":"<p>Revenue has issued over 1.4 million notices to property owners in recent weeks, setting out what is required to meet Local Property Tax (LPT) obligations for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; (2022 to 2025).

These included a major expansion of the Substitute Teacher Supply Panels.  These were extended and currently almost 380 newly appointed supply panel teachers are employed, providing substitute cover to over 2,500 primary schools across the country.  These substitute Supply Panels are not the only means whereby schools source substitutes but are set up to work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers such as the national substitution portal service &quot;Sub Seeker&quot;, operated by IPPN or through a school&rsquo;s own panel of regular substitutes.<\/p><p>As a measure of last resort, and in the context of the uncertainty surrounding Covid-19 related absences schools were permitted to use non-mainstream class teachers last year to provide cover for teacher absences.  Almost 20,000 substitute days were &lsquo;banked&rsquo; by more than 1,000 schools while schools were opened during the 2020\/21 school year.  School buildings were closed in January and February 2021.<\/p><p>Department Circulars 0044\/2019 and 31\/2011, provide that schools are required to employ appropriately qualified and registered teachers and ensure that unemployed teachers should be offered employment in preference to those who have retired. The circulars set out the sequence of recruitment for substitute appointments, which include contacting a person on the substitute list established by the employer, or by using a national substitute service such as <i>SubSeeker<\/i>, or advertising. <\/p><p>Due to the successful roll out of the vaccination programme and changes to the rules around close contacts and the requirements to restrict movements, teacher absences due to Covid-19 should be reduced this year.  In this context using non-mainstream class teachers should no longer be necessary and schools should revert to using the normal sequence of filling substitute positions.  It will therefore no longer be necessary to &lsquo;bank hours&rsquo;.  This will ensure that children with special education needs get access to their specialised teaching on an ongoing basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300070#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":354,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[49994\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300070#WRG01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an application for increased SNA support by a school (details supplied) in County Cork; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1456","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":355,"content":"<p>The NCSE has responsibility for planning and coordinating school supports for children with special educational needs including the allocation of SNAs and reviews.<\/p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work. My Department spent a total of &euro;4.7 billion on illness, disability and caring payments in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In March of last year, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to illness benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19.  Expenditure on the enhanced Illness Benefit was &euro;57 million in 2020, in addition to &euro;593 million spent on standard Illness Benefit.  Expenditure on the enhanced payment was &euro;68 million from January to the end of September this year and is expected to be circa &euro;84 million for all of 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure. It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19. <\/p>  <p>  This payment was designed to ensure that, where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected. This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system. <\/p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides means-tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for Illness Benefit.  The Department may also make an Exceptional Needs Payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income. <\/p>  <p>  As a comprehensive set of income supports is in place for those experiencing illness and disability that impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work, I do not intend to introduce additional payments at this time. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the public health situation and to review its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300071#WRH02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300071#WRH02500"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[50069\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300071#WRH02600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will respond to correspondence from an organisation (details supplied); if she will ensure that senior representatives of her Department, the organisation and other key stakeholders can have further engagements in relation to the most pragmatic and collaborative way forward and ensure constructive discussions regarding the continued provision of local employment services for communities in Ireland by members of the organisation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":425,"content":"<p>I have noted the correspondence from the ILDN that the Deputy refers to and will issue a response shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The current procurement process for employment services follows extensive consultations by my Department with the existing service providers over the last number of years.

The vision of National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 is that the student body entering, participating in, and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland&rsquo;s population. <\/p>  <p>  Work on the development of the next National Access Plan (NAP) 2022 - 2026 is currently underway. The consultation process, which closed on 18th June 2021, invited all interested parties to make their views known on this matter and other matters related to access to higher education particularly for groups who are underrepresented in the higher education population.  One-to-one stakeholder meetings around the specific target groups to be supported for the period of the next NAP are currently underway.

The PATH fund has a current investment envelope of &euro;40.4 million over the period 2016 to 2022, across the three strands which are currently supporting access to initial teacher education, enables the award of bursaries to the most socio economically disadvantaged students and through the Higher Education Access Fund is supporting institutional capacity in developing regional and community partnership strategies for increasing access to higher education.<\/p>  <p>  - Student Assistance Fund includes ring-fenced funding &euro;1m for part-time students.<\/p>  <p>  - Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD)  &ndash; over &euro;9m in funding every year covering both higher and further education sectors. The purpose of the Fund for Students with Disabilities is to provide funding to higher and further education institutions to assist  them in offering supports and services to eligible students with disabilities so that they can access, fully participate in and successfully complete their chosen course of study. Since 2018 the fund covers part-time students.<\/p>  <p>  - A study commissioned by the Higher Education Authority on the challenges facing mature students in participating in higher education is nearing completion and will be considered in the context of the new National Access Plan currently under development.<\/p>  <p>  - The Action Plan for Increasing Traveller Participation in Higher Education 2019-2021 was launched in 2019 and its aim is to advance Traveller participation in higher education within the context of approaches on retention and transition of Travellers across the education spectrum.<\/p>  <p>  - Persons in the protection process (asylum and subsidiary protection) or leave to remain process are not eligible to access the statutory based SUSI grant scheme. However, the administratively based Student Support Scheme provides supports along similar lines to the SUSI grant scheme and is available to persons in the asylum, subsidiary protection or leave to remain process. <\/p>  <p>  Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training Strategy (FET) 2020-2024 is built. The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, with the aim of enabling every citizen to participate fully in society. <\/p>  <p>  FET provision is largely free or heavily subsidised. The only fees are PLC fees which are a nominal &euro;200 per student (not including those entitled to a medical card or SUSI grant). About 40% of students pay the fee. Fees are collected at the start of the academic year.<\/p>  <p>  Apprentices are paid an allowance equivalent to their on-the-job wages for periods spent in education and training institutions. In addition, unemployed participants on training courses are paid a training allowance by ETBs based on their DEASP payment.  In the case of training for unemployed people, these allowances are integral parts of the programmes, as (i) they facilitate the participation of individuals who would not otherwise be in a position to take up training and (ii) they ensure that only individuals who are active participants in the training are in receipt of the allowances. Your local Intreo Office can advise if you are entitled to any allowances whilst on a training course.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, accommodation, meal and travel allowances are paid to learners to assist them with the cost of actual attendance on some courses.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of Budget 2022 I am currently giving consideration to the scope, to commence the process of making prioritised improvements to the student grant scheme for the academic year 2022\/2023. This would allow early progress in addressing key themes emerging from the Review's consultations and research and recent trends in the cost of living. I am also giving consideration to the ringfencing of some funding for supporting the implementation of the new National Access Plan when published in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300072#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":471,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[50142\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300072#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the degree to which the higher level education sector is in discussion with business and enterprise with a view to matching requirements in the workplace with suitable graduates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":472,"content":"<p>My Department places a fundamental focus on working with the Higher, as well as Further, education sector, to ensure delivery of suitable graduates to match what business and enterprise needs and requirements in the workplace. <\/p><p>A core focus of the Department's Statement of Strategy is to enable individuals to access the skills required to progress in a way that meets the needs of our economy as it evolves and recovers. <\/p><p>Ireland has an advanced system of skills provision, across Further and Higher Education, lifelong learning and human capital development, which is agile and responsive to changes in the world of work.

The enterprise sector provides quality employment which is important for our standard of living and inclusivity.<\/p><p>The enterprise sector is hugely important in driving innovation in this country. An estimated 75% of all Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) expenditure in Ireland is by private enterprises. <\/p><p>Results from the 2019-2020 Business Expenditure on Research and Development survey show that almost &euro;3.26bn was spent on RDI activities by enterprises in Ireland in 2019, an increase of 46% since 2015, the year in which Ireland&rsquo;s previous research and innovation strategy <i>Innovation 2020<\/i>began. These investments have been instrumental in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and growth in the past decade, and will continue to be of critical importance as we face our current and future challenges.<\/p><p>Productivity is the primary determinant of long-term growth. Investment in knowledge-based capital, and innovation in particular, drives productivity through new, higher value-added products and services, and more efficient business processes. The value of services in the Irish economy exceeds that of manufacturing, and consequently investment in knowledge-based capital is increasingly important for driving future economic growth. This economic reality means that Ireland must be among the top-ranked nations for innovation if it is to realise its potential.<\/p><p>To that end, my department officials and I have worked to continue to foster and develop existing links with the enterprise sector. Public consultation on the new R&amp;amp;I strategy was held in June &amp;amp; July earlier this year. In total, we received over 115 submissions to the online public consultation from a range of stakeholders, including business representation groups, companies, and individuals in the enterprise sector. In June, my Department hosted and I attended an online stakeholder event where a wide range of stakeholders from across Ireland&rsquo;s R&amp;amp;I system came together to discuss the issues raised in the consultation paper and inform the strategy. My Department has also held a number of targeted meetings with key stakeholders over recent months. Maintaining links with enterprise &ndash; both indigenous and FDI&ndash; ensures we can keep up to date with domestic needs and global trends.<\/p><p>This year I have held several constructive meetings with industry leaders and enterprise representative groups and will continue to work with them in driving Ireland&rsquo;s vision to become a Global Innovation Leader. We also closely liaise with our colleagues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its agencies to ensure a consistent approach in aiding the enterprise sector to increase its innovative activities.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s agency SFI has developed a suite of dynamic funding programmes which facilitate industry\/academic collaboration. These funding programmes enable companies and academics to work together on specific programmes of research to address industry needs, support technology transfer and grow skills and expertise. Developing its industry facing programmes to deliver significant public\/private partnership, increase collaboration, support FDI and engage SMEs in research and innovation across all sectors will continue to be a priority for the agency as it embeds within my Department.<\/p><p>The manufacturing sector is one in which SFI has already made significant investments which involve industry participation. One of those investments is CONFIRM, the SFI Research Centre for Smart Manufacturing. The Centre very recently opened its new, cutting edge headquarters in Limerick. This facility includes a testbed to house Ireland&rsquo;s future factory demonstrators, an innovative virtual reality cave, 10 Gbps internet access, Ireland&rsquo;s first private 5G digital manufacturing network and a digital manufacturing lab with 3D printing and non-contact 3D part-scanning facilities. The headquarters will be a space for industry to come together with academic researchers. It is a significant milestone &ndash; heightening Ireland&rsquo;s position as a leader in smart manufacturing.<\/p><p>Other significant investments in the manufacturing area include IFORM, the SFI Research Centre in Advanced Manufacturing. Like CONFIRM, IFORM is a world leading SFI Research Centre with deep industry collaboration and co-investment. IFORM is delivering the next level of understanding and control for complex manufacturing processes. Ireland is already recognised as having one of the most advanced manufacturing sectors in Europe. These, along with other investments by SFI will support Ireland to become the leading digital manufacturing powerhouse globally.<\/p><p>Access to highly skilled graduates is a critical success factor for businesses in Ireland. SFI has established six SFI Centres for Research Training. These Centres will support advanced skills and training (PhDs) in collaboration with industry, for the new economy. The six current SFI Centres for Research Training support over 700 PhD students in ICT and Data Analytics. Future skills can be addressed through further development of this programme in other areas, including Innovation in Business Services and Advanced Manufacturing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300072#WRJ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[50147\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300072#WRJ02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to ensure that in future years the effect of Covid-19 will not materially affect the supply of qualified academic and technical graduates to the workplace; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>The challenge to deliver adequate numbers of suitably qualified academic and technical graduates to meet the demands of the country is a fundamental focus for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. <\/p>  <p>  The higher and further education sectors responded in an agile fashion to the challenges of Covid-19 and continuity for the most part was maintained throughout the pandemic.

The Strategy provided for the establishment of the skills architecture that we have today, the National Skills Council and the nine Regional Skills Fora. Underpinning both the skills agenda and architecture are the skills forecasting and intelligence systems, made up of the contribution of a number of public bodies including, at present, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in Solas and the statistical analysis and assessment carried out by the HEA.  The detailed research and analyses carried out by these bodies feed into the work of the Skills Council in defining the priorities and delivering responses in the area of skills needs.<\/p>  <p>  Two key initiatives in the higher education system which ensure that places are funded in courses in identified areas of skills need are Springboard + and the Human Capital Initiative (HCI). Springboard+ 2021 was launched on 14th June 2021. As a result of multi-annual funding of graduate conversion courses, there is a combined total of 13,444 places on 408 courses available in the 2021\/22 academic year under Springboard+ 2021 and HCI Pillar 1. This year, there is a broad range of courses in Engineering, ICT and Science. There are 46 Springboard+ 2021 courses with 1,657 places in total in engineering. In ICT and ICT-related areas are there are 81 Springboard+ 2021 courses with 2,910 places and in Science and Science related areas, there are 14 Springboard+ 2021 courses with 354 places.<\/p>  <p>  A broad range of engineering courses are provided through Springboard+, with approximately 27% of all places falling within the engineering, manufacturing and construction category, 29% in ICT and 4% in Science related disciplines.<\/p>  <p>  Under HCI Pillar 1, places are available on courses in a wide range of skills areas, including artificial intelligence, smart factory technology, sustainable energy, medical device technology and cybersecurity. In 2021, year 2 of the Pillar 1 programme funding is being provided to create 1,768 conversion course places. 432 (24%) of places on Pillar 1 are in the engineering, manufacturing, and construction category, with a further 710 (40%) in ICT. 14 HCI Pillar 1 courses are in science related disciplines offering 323 places (18%).<\/p>  <p>  The new Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 which was launched on 19th April last sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship accessible to employers and learners. The actions set out in the plan seek to deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025. A key strength of the apprenticeship model, is that it is a demand-led approach to meeting workforce and skill requirements in our economy. Therefore the number of places is determined by employers with off the job training delivered to all registered apprentices.  <\/p>  <p>  There are currently 62 different apprenticeships leading to qualifications at level 5-10 on the National Framework of Qualifications, with over 7,500 employers employing almost 22,500 apprentices. <\/p>  <p>  Of the 62 apprenticeship programmes, 25 are craft apprenticeships with a standardised seven phase programme of on-the-job and off-the-job training.  Off-the-job training is delivered in phases 2, 4 and 6 of a craft apprenticeship. <\/p>  <p>  The expansion of apprenticeship across all sectors of the economy has widened the range of impact of apprenticeship in areas of skills shortage such as Engineering, Retrofitting, Technology Skills, Engineering and FinTech. Under action 5.1 of the plan the online visibility of apprenticeship engagement and apprenticeship development processes for employers\/sectors who wish to assess the potential for new apprenticeship development will be increased. Applications for new apprenticeship development are now open on an ongoing basis, allowing employers to progress the development of programmes in response to emerging skills needs on an as-needed basis in all sectors including engineering, ICT and Science. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue working with enterprise agencies and industry groups, as well as the higher education institutions, to assess the future demand for higher education graduates and apprentices as well as our ability to meet this demand, and ensure we are prepared for the challenges ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300072#WRJ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":491,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[50149\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300072#WRJ03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of new educational programmes and qualifications in the past three years developed to reflect the demands of the workplace; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":492,"content":"<p>Quality and Qualifications Ireland approves programmes offered at a variety of schools, colleges and further and higher education and training institutions.

Combatting it is, and will continue to be, a priority for this Government. Over the past year we have introduced significant measures to combat trafficking, to create a more victim-centred approach to identifying and supporting victims, and to raise awareness and provide training, such as:<\/p><p>The approval by Government last May to revise the National Referral Mechanism framework  to make it easier for victims of trafficking to come forward, to be identified and to access advice, accommodation and support;<\/p><p>The drafting of a new National Action Plan on Human Trafficking;<\/p><p>The development of training, through NGOs, targeting front line staff in industries such ashospitality, airline and shipping who may come into contact with trafficked persons;<\/p><p>The improvements being made to the Criminal Justice System to support victims through the implementation of <i>Supporting a Victim's Journey<\/i>;<\/p><p>The launch of a new awareness raising campaign this month in partnership with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to build on the success of previous campaigns:<\/p><p>An increase in funding for supporting victims of crime generally and increased funding dedicated specifically to supporting victims of trafficking.<\/p><p>In addition to highlighting the ongoing work underway to combat human trafficking and support those who are victims of it, it is also important to note the significance of the recent sentences for human trafficking handed down by the Courts and to acknowledge the dedication of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in investigating and tackling this hideous crime.<\/p><p>Human trafficking cases are complex and it can be challenging to secure convictions, for a range of reasons including difficulties in securing sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of coercion or deception of the victim.<\/p><p>The majority of victims of human trafficking are vulnerable and traumatised by their experience. Estimating the prevalence of human trafficking is difficult due to the clandestine nature of the crime, its overlap with other illegal activities and there can be a reluctance on the part of victims to report the crime, often due to the trauma they have suffered. In some instances, victims may also be concerned about potential repercussions that reporting human trafficking might have for their extended family. <\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the changes we propose making to the National Referral Mechanism acknowledge that, in addition to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, other state bodies and NGOs have a role in identifying victims of human trafficking and linking them in with the various supports and services available. <\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is excellent in its role as our competent authority for identifying victims but we know some victims, because of interactions they may have had with law enforcement officials in other countries, have a perception that police cannot be trusted.

It also provides advice, support and where necessary, operational assistance to investigations at district level.

It promotes a more compassionate and humane approach to people who use drugs, with drug use treated first and foremost as a public health issue. The Programme for Government endorses this health-led approach. By treating the use of substances as a public health issue, rather than solely as a criminal issue, we can better help individuals, their families and the communities in which we live. <\/p>  <p>  The Government established a working group to consider alternative approaches to the possession of drugs for personal use in December 2017. The work programme of the group consisted of meetings with experts from other countries, commissioning research on other jurisdictions and undertaking a public consultation. The consultation process received a response of over 20,000 people and included the views of many people who use drugs. <\/p>  <p>  The working group examined the option of decriminalising drugs. The report did not deem this an appropriate option in the Irish context due to legal difficulties (which could lead to the de facto legalisation of drugs), and operational problems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The report of the working group was published in 2019 and is available here.<\/p>  <p>  The Government accepted the views of the working group on the decriminalisation of drugs. Accordingly, there are no plans to decriminalise drugs, including cannabis.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the working group&rsquo;s recommendations, the Government agreed a health-led approach to the possession of drugs for personal use. This approach will connect people who use drugs with health services and a pathway to recovery, avoiding a criminal conviction, which can have far-reaching consequences for people, particularly younger people. <\/p>  <p>  The commencement of the Health Diversion Programme is currently being finalised. As outlined in the Programme for Government, the Health Diversion Programme will be reviewed following the first full year of implementation, to ensure it is meeting all of its aims and to make any necessary changes. <\/p>  <p>  The importance of a health-lead approach is reflected in the significant number of treatment episodes (2,120) provided to people who use cannabis in 2020. Cannabis, behind opioids and cocaine, was the third most common main drug reported by people accessing treatment in Ireland, accounting for 21.9% of cases treated in 2020. In addition, presentations to Child and Adolescent Addiction Services indicate that cannabis is the main substance causing harm for those under the age of 18. <\/p>  <p>  We cannot be complacent about the risk to health posed by illicit drugs. The Government is committed to a public health approach to drug use, that will lead to better outcomes for individuals and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300073#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300073#WRK01400"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[42546\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300073#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the development of the central sterile services department at Roscommon hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":534,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare infrastructure projects, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300073#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":535,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300073#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":536,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[42547\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300073#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current status of the Portiuncula Hospital 50 bedroom ward block development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":537,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare infrastructure projects, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300073#WRK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":538,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300073#WRK02000"},{"type":"question","counter":539,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[48277\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300073#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of plans to introduce a no-fault vaccination compensation scheme for severe adverse reactions to State-promoted vaccination programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":540,"content":"<p>There is currently policy development work underway in relation to the potential establishment of a vaccine compensation scheme.

It should be noted that the figures relate to the number of admission orders issued rather than the number of people admitted on an involuntary basis.<\/p>  <p>  Of the 1,919 involuntary admission orders issued, 32% were by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, 29% were by a spouse, civil partner or relative, 13% were by Authorised Officers of the HSE, and 26% were by other persons.  The Deputy should note that 'other persons' may include doctors in an emergency department.<\/p>  <p>  Under Section 9 of the Mental Health Act 2001, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, along with Authorised Officers, family members or other relevant persons (such as neighbours or friends) may make an application for involuntary detention. Section 12 of the Mental Health Act 2001 provides for a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take a person into Garda custody if the Garda believes the person is suffering from a mental disorder.<\/p>  <p>  In its Annual Report, the Commission highlighted that there had been an increase in the use of Section 12 compared to 2019. While the specific cause of this increase is not known, the Department is generally in favour of the limited use of Section 12 to detain people because being taken into Garda custody can have a traumatising effect on people. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will understand, the proportion of applications for involuntary detention reflects the unfortunate reality that Garda&iacute; often encounter persons with severe mental health issues and may be called upon by members of the public or family members where a person is experiencing high levels of distress.  Very often, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are the first available frontline service to whom people will turn in such situations.<\/p>  <p>  Applications for involuntary detention are never made lightly and applications made by any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take full account of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&lsquo;s obligation to protect the human rights and welfare of individuals and communities. The only statutory option available to Garda&iacute; responding to people in a mental health crisis and potentially posing a risk of harm to themselves or others is to invoke Section 12 of the Mental Health Act, 2001.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice has confirmed that all trainee Garda&iacute; are trained over two days in an internationally recognised Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) workshop which is delivered in collaboration with the HSE.  This workshop is a suicide first aid programme which equips trainee Garda&iacute; with the necessary skills to discuss suicide with a person at risk and to make an intervention to reduce immediate risk of suicide if necessary. Trainee Garda&iacute; also study the Mental Health Act 2001 and the procedures that are required if they have to invoke their powers.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Continuous Professional Development core programme for operational members, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided training on awareness of mental health difficulties in keeping with the Mental Health Act 2001. The programme also covers types of mental health difficulties, Garda powers and procedures, and the transportation of people in mental health crisis.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may also be aware, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland concluded that societal issues such as the mental health of individuals should not be the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alone and the Commission recommended the establishment of multi-agency teams that would include Garda&iacute; to respond to the needs of individuals with mental health issues.  A pilot crisis intervention team is being developed in the Limerick Garda Division. This pilot is being progressed in close collaboration with the HSE and it is hoped to begin the rollout of the pilot team early next year.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a General Scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act was approved by Government on 13 July and is available on the Department of Health's website at gov.ie - Draft Heads of a bill to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 (www.gov.ie).<\/p>  <p>  The publication of the General Scheme follows a review of the Mental Health Act which took account of the 165 recommendations of an Expert Group Review of the Act that were published in 2015, along with extensive consultation with the HSE, the Mental Health Commission and other key stakeholders, and a public consultation in March\/April 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Proposed amendments to Section 9 in the General Scheme provide for changes to who may make an application for involuntary admission and would allow only &lsquo;Authorised Officers&rsquo; to make an application.  The proposed changes were recommended by the Expert Group and included in the current Programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  Proposed amendments to Section 12 in the General Scheme provide for updated powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take persons into custody who they believe fulfil the criteria for detention set out in Section 8 of the Act.

They are highly valued by the Irish agricultural sector for this reason. Live exports however are only possible with the highest of animal welfare standards during transport, and EU legislation allows for these journeys to take place as long as these standards are adhered to throughout the journey including those parts of the journey that lie outside the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The trade in and the export of animals is a private commercial activity but it is heavily regulated by European Law which my Department enforces. All live export shipments from Ireland are conducted in full compliance with legislative requirements. All proposed journeys must be notified to the Regional Veterinary Office in advance, and veterinary certification will only be provided where the journey complies with all animal transport and animal welfare regulations. This includes a requirement to notify the Regional Veterinary Office of the outcome of the journey once completed, and the condition of the animals on arrival. <\/p>  <p>  I readily acknowledge the genuine concerns expressed by animal protection organisations in Ireland about standards of animal welfare in countries outside the EU. My Department, in cooperation with our EU partners, works closely with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) with a view to improving animal welfare practices worldwide. The OIE is the global standard setting body relating to animal health and animal welfare. It is through this forum that we influence standards in other countries. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been a member of the OIE European Platform Steering Committee on Animal Welfare since its creation in 2013 and has offered financial support and technical inputs for the development of the OIE Platform action plans, with a particular focus on the transport and slaughter.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to this particular trade opportunity, I would like to point out that these animals in question are high value, high genetic merit animals and as such are handled particularly carefully by their owners and transporters. The EU has one of the highest standards in the world of animal welfare. Trade with the EU can be a stimulating factor for other countries to attain EU standards. <\/p>  <p>  In summary, live exports are highly valued by Irish farmers, and the Department facilitates this commercial trade while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300075#WRM02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes","counter":663,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300075#WRM02200"},{"type":"question","counter":664,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[50054\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101300075#WRM02300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the level of drawdown under TAMS of the grant aid for installation of solar panels; if a review has been carried out on the effectiveness of this initiative; if changes are envisaged to the eligibility and technical criteria involved with a view to increasing participation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1454","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":665,"content":"<p>Some 172 applications for solar panels have been approved under the TAMS scheme.
