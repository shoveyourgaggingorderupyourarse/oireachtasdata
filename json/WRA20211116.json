The disposal programme for these specific properties began in January 2014, but was delayed because of a request from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) in 2016 to postpone further disposals while two policing reviews were undertaken.  The Reviews by AGS were completed in December 2018 and the OPW restarted the disposal process in January 2019.  The programme of disposals was further interrupted by Covid-related lockdowns in 2020 and 2021, though the OPW progressed a number of transfers or disposals where it was feasible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600063#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Parks","counter":54,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600063#WRB00800"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[54119\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600063#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the reason that generator-powered mobile floodlights have been installed in the Phoenix Park given the refusal by the OPW to upgrade lights on Chesterfield Avenue to accommodate walkers and cyclists on the grounds of light pollution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[54118\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600063#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to restore and open the public toilets on the west side of Infirmary Road, Dublin 7 adjoining the Phoenix Park and beside the entrance off the North Circular Road, in line with the restoration of the Magazine Fort; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 90 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Phoenix Park is a historic landscape of international importance and one of the largest designed landscapes in any European city. The Park extends to 1752 acres and represents a unique natural and cultural landscape that is both a historic park and a city park and which provides a setting for a range of activities and amenities. The location, size and use of The Phoenix Park can be compared to similar large urban parks in other cities, including Regent&rsquo;s Park in London, the Bois de Boulogne in Paris and Central Park in New York.<\/p>  <p>  The Park is a complex place comprising many components that serve a variety of functions. It is often referred to as Dublin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Green Lung&rsquo; as it offers citizens and visitors an extraordinary opportunity to engage with nature and the outdoors right in the heart of our capital city.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works, together with its strategic partners F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the then Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, commissioned an independent strategic review of the visitor experience in the Phoenix Park in 2018. Following extensive public consultation in late 2019, a number of key visitor priorities were finalised including the conservation of the Magazine Fort, the upgrade of the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre along with sustainable transport and mobility recommendations for implementation. In all over seventeen significant visitor experience actions were identified. <\/p>  <p>  Investment for the enhancement of the Phoenix Park as a heritage destination under the National Development Plan will facilitate the implementation of the agreed priorities identified in the Phoenix Park Visitor Experience Strategic Review.  To this end, the planning application for the restoration and improvement of visitor facilities at the Magazine Fort was lodged with Dublin City Council on the 5th of November this year. This will include provision of new toilet facilities at that location. Upgrades to the toilet facilities at the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre are currently being undertaken and these will be re-open to the public in late December 2021.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the toilet facilities located on Infirmary Road, that the Deputy is referring to, these have not been in use for over 15 years and when in use, Dublin City Council employed a caretaker who opened\/ closed and maintained the toilets. Unfortunately, the toilets were subject to considerable anti-social behaviour and arson. This led to the decision by DCC to close them to the public. The premises is currently in poor condition. The restoration of the closed public toilets on Infirmary Road was not identified as a priority in the visitor experience review or through the detailed public consultation that followed. Therefore, they have not been prioritised for upgrade in the short to medium term.<\/p>  <p>  I can advise that there are several toilet facilities located within the Park and these are all open during daylight hours where cleaning staff provide passive surveillance and security. The provision of toilet facilities in the Park is kept under continuous review. <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the provision of temporary public lighting; The Phoenix Park is a key location for a range of national and local events presented by internal stakeholders such as Dublin Zoo and third parties including charities, semi state bodies and concert promoters. This is a significant aspect of the Parks operations with in the region of 550,000 people taking part in major road races, pitch sports and attending large public events such as Concerts &amp;amp; Bloom in the Park.  (Pre-Covid).<\/p>  <p>  Dublin Zoo attracts 1.2 million visitors annually to the Park.  The hugely successful &lsquo;Wild Lights&rsquo; event attracted 214,000 ticketed visitors over 47 nights in 2019. The income generated from this event is essential to support Dublin Zoo&rsquo;s year round operations.  The mobile lighting that the Deputy is referring to, close to Dublin Zoo on Chesterfield Avenue, has been erected on a temporary basis and specifically for patrons visiting Dublin Zoo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wild Lights&rdquo; event, which runs for 57 days from 28th October 2021 &ndash; 9th January 2022.  These temporary lights allow for the safe ingress\/egress during darkness for members of the public, including children, the elderly and people with disabilities, who will be visiting this event at the Zoo. The temporary lights are powered by HVO - hydro-treated vegetable oil - which is a direct replacement for diesel, is 90 % cleaner than burning diesel, is carbon neutral and renewable.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will note that in order to facilitate the significant increase of pedestrian users during the pandemic, the 8km bicycle lanes along Chesterfield Avenue, were converted to a pedestrian footpath which had the added bonus, of increased lighting level for pedestrians who walk in this area at night due to this paths closer proximity to the gas light standards. Pedestrian are no longer restricted to the low light areas behind the mature trees on Chesterfield Avenue but rather can now walk adjacent to the lights for the entire length of the Avenue.<\/p>  <p>  The Phoenix Park is one of the few remaining public areas in Europe that still relies on gas for public lighting. The decision to preserve this unique system was made to support the conservation of the historic fabric of the Park and to retain low levels of light pollution, so that the Park can remain one of the few locations in Dublin where star gazing is possible. Gas was first introduced into the Park in 1859 by the Hibernian Gas Company and is a major visual element in the Park's landscape. <\/p>  <p>  The conservation and preservation of these features along with the architecture, built environment, archaeology, biodiversity and landscape are key objectives in the Phoenix Park Conservation Management Plan 2011.  The Phoenix Park has over 25 different types of habitats and support over 50% of the mammals and 40% of bird species found in Ireland. The Park was designed as a Deer Park in 1662 and is still maintained as one, to support over 600 wild Fallow Deer. The deer graze and feed across all areas of the park and the installation of additional artificial lights throughout the Park will affect their movements across their various habitats at night. <\/p>  <p>  There is a specific objective (SO 8.9) in the Phoenix Park Conservation Management Plan under Architecture and the Built Environment \"to maintain the current lighting levels within the Park so as to minimise the levels of light pollution\" and therefore the OPW has no plans to install additional lights within the Phoenix Park, other than the traditional gas lights.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, recent studies are now highlighting the impact that artificial lighting is having on nocturnal pollination species and this in turn is having negative consequences for plant pollination, worldwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600063#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Development Plan","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600063#WRB01200"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[55859\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600063#WRB01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide an overview of NSO 8 of the National Development Plan 2021-2030; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>At the outset it should be noted that my Department, in carrying out its role in coordinating the NDP Review, does not consider the merit of individual projects or sectoral policy strategies as this is primarily a matter for individual Departments and Agencies.<\/p>  <p>  With that point noted, I would be glad to give a summary of the NSO 8 which seeks the Transition to a Climate-Neutral and Climate-Resilient Society. The next ten years are critical in order to address the climate crisis and we have significantly stepped up our climate ambition by committing to reduce our overall greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by 2030, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  This is set out in the new Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. Under the new legislation, the Climate Action Plan must be updated every year so that our actions keep step with the trajectory required to achieve our targets.<\/p>  <p>  The sectoral strategies for flood risk management are outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Climate Change Sectoral Adaptation Plan for Flood Risk Management. These strategies play a critical role in identifying the goals and priorities for the sector and are therefore critical in informing the investment projects set out in the NDP.<\/p>  <p>  Over the period out to 2030 an additional &euro;5 billion of the expected &euro;9.5 billion in additional carbon tax receipts will be invested in energy efficiency. In terms of strategic investment priorities for the energy sector, this includes supporting the delivery of offshore renewable energy, retrofitting of 500,000 homes, and the installation of 600,000 heat pumps. Specific projects include the Celtic Interconnector, which will be, when completed in 2026, Ireland&rsquo;s largest electricity interconnector. Strategic investment priorities for Transport include the transition to a low or zero emissions public bus fleet, an additional 500,000 sustainable journeys per day and nearly one million electric vehicles on the road by 2030. In addition, there are a wide range of major flood risk management projects planned throughout the country, for example the Lower Lee flood relief scheme. <\/p>  <p>  These are just some of the many investments which will be delivered under this NSO in the coming years to support Project Ireland 2040.

This is to ensure that Government is making decisions with a full picture of the proposal, its costs, risks and benefits.<\/p>  <p>  The revised National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2030 pledges to restructure the oversight and implementation of capital projects to strengthen scrutiny of major public investment proposals and to drive improved project performance and value for money.<\/p>  <p>  In order to achieve this, my Department has put in place an External Assurance Process (EAP) to provide independent project scrutiny at key decision stages. It is a mandatory requirement for all funding departments to participate in the process for major projects over &euro;100m. My Department has established a framework of suitable suppliers who can provide a range of independent specialist expertise, to conduct reviews at critical points in the decision-making and project development stages. This framework is in place and will be utilised once projects over &euro;100m reach the key decision gates for Government approval.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the EAP is to improve value for money and support funding departments and Government with expert insight relating to project risks, delivery feasibility, and robustness of costings, governance and procurement.  The EAP for major public capital projects (projects which cost in excess of &euro;100m) will focus on issues such as cost, risk and ability to deliver, at two key points in the project lifecycle, Decision Gate 1 (Approval in Principle) and Decision Gate 2 (Pre-Tender Approval). <\/p>  <p>  To support the External Assurance Process a new Major Projects Advisory Group (MPAG) has been established to further strengthen project management. As a prerequisite to seeking Government approval for projects at the relevant decision gates, project proposals and external reviews will be scrutinised by the MPAG in advance of the decision to proceed. The new arrangements bring Ireland into line with leading international performers and meet a recommendation of the IMF&rsquo;s Public Investment Management Assessment of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  These updates are due to be actioned imminently within November 2021 and have been discussed at Government in recent weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600063#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Spending Code","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600063#WRB01800"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[55586\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600063#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the methodology to ensure that public capital projects and public procurement avail of every opportunity to minimise carbon footprint and avail of opportunities for sequestration of carbon; and if he is planning to put in place a reporting format to ensure that it will happen.","asker":"1549","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>My Department has already introduced a range of measures which consider the climate and environmental impact of public capital projects at key points in the development of those projects.  <\/p>  <p>  The recent NDP Review included an assessment of the impact that each of the Exchequer-funded measures contained in the NDP is likely to have on climate and environmental outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Spending Code requires every public investment project with a value above &euro;20 million to conduct a full analysis on all the potential costs and benefits associated with that project - including a quantitative assessment of the net impact on greenhouse gas emissions the proposal will have.<\/p>  <p>  As projects proceed to detailed design and construction stages both operational and embodied carbon must be considered when determining the carbon footprint of a construction project.

In brief, this includes a public consultation on the scope of the review, the publication early in the new year of a consultation paper informed by stakeholders' views on the themes to be addressed and a full consultation in which my Department will seek detailed submissions on the issues.  <\/p><p>In addition, my Department is developing a customer satisfaction survey to gauge perceptions of the FOI process, as well as a methodology for estimating the administrative burden and cost of the FOI system.  As the review progresses, these key information gathering activities will be supplemented by a desk-based review of international best practices, interviews, focus groups, regional events and other activities as required.<\/p><p>This is a ambitious programme of work in the interests of a careful and thorough review of the FOI system.  The review will conclude with a report and recommendations, which is scheduled for mid-2022.<\/p><p>I want to encourage all stakeholders to get involved in this important review, from the public sector to the media, academia, activists and interest groups, as well as individual requesters.<\/p><p>In line with this approach, my Department last week launched the initial public consultation on the scope of the review.  The consultation includes a convenient online web form through which individuals can have their say, as well as submissions from public bodies, advocacy and other representative groups.<\/p><p>This has received a very positive response to date, with more than 200 responses received within 24 hours of launch, and a steady stream of further submissions since then.  The consultation will remain open until 17th December.<\/p><p>In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question, a table is included below setting out the total number of requests, the numbers granted in full, in part, refused and the numbers transferred, withdrawn or handled outside the FOI system.<\/p><p>In general terms, the Freedom of Information Act means that any record held by an FOI body relating to its business can in principle be requested. The legislation also contains exemption provisions  which allow a record to be redacted or refused in full where, for example, it contains the personal information or commercially sensitive information of third parties. This is decided on a case by case basis having regard to the specific record concerned.<\/p><p>Please note that an outright &quot;disallowance&quot; of a request is not a feature of the FOI system.  The legislation does place certain obligations on requesters to state their request clearly and in a way that allows public bodies to identify relevant records by carrying out reasonable searches.  This is a necessary safeguard to ensure the best possible outcomes for all concerned, particularly the requester, and to ensure a reasonably efficient use of state resources.<\/p><p>However, if a person who wishes to make an FOI request does not state clearly what they are looking for, that is not the end of the matter.  From there, the public body is obliged by law to assist or offer to assist the requester in making their request.  It is often the case that a request that was initially found to be invalid is framed appropriately with the assistance of the public body concerned and then processed in the normal way.<\/p><p>In other cases, a request may be made to a body that holds no relevant records, but that may be aware of another body that may have material of interest to the requester.  The legislation requires that the request is transferred to the relevant body in such cases, which amount to roughly 2% of cases in most years.<\/p><p>It may happen that a person makes an FOI request seeking to achieve something that FOI cannot do, for example in order to make a complaint or to appeal against a decision.

A summary of this work can be found in chapter two of the new NDP which is titled &ldquo;Benefits of Investment&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  Using the Economic and Social Research Institute&rsquo;s COSMO model, it was possible to project the economic impact of the planned increases in public investment. <\/p>  <p>  The COSMO model projects that employment will increase by 3 per cent more by 2030 compared to a scenario where investment remained constant at 2021 levels. It is important to note that in 2021, core Exchequer capital expenditure in Ireland is &euro;9.7 billion, the highest level in the history of the state. For the construction sector specifically, an assessment published alongside the NDP estimates that an annual average of up to 80,754 direct and indirect construction jobs will be sustained as a result of public investment over the period 2021 to 2030. <\/p>  <p>  The COSMO model also projects that GDP or output at basic prices is set to increase by 1.6 per cent more by 2030 compared to a scenario where investment remained constant at 2021 levels. Potential output, which captures the underlying growth of productivity, is set to increase by approximately 2 per cent compared to the scenario where investment remained constant at 2021 levels. Furthermore, an analysis carried out by my Department estimates that, of the &euro;165 billion investment plan, approximately &euro;104 billion is related to direct spending on construction. This direct construction spending of &euro;104 billion will in turn have a multiplier effect. An additional &euro;60 billion of output is projected to be generated indirectly through the construction supply chain. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that while these results are based on robust and sophisticated modelling, the results are accompanied by caveats and limitations. <\/p>  <p>  Having said that, it is clear from the substantive analysis and evidence base created by my Department that we as a country can expect significant benefits, from the investment planned under the NDP over the coming years.

One fundamental design principle of the dashboard is non-complexity, and therefore the number of indicators was limited to approximately three per dimension. Indicators were chosen based on a clear set of criteria (as set out in the Governments first report), and in consultation with the CSO and the Inter-Departmental Working Group on a Well-being Framework. The outputs (e.g. trends and international comparisons) had no influence on selection. Each chosen indicator is disaggregated to explore inequality across groups. The cohorts chosen for disaggregation are based on existing research, consultation across Government and with experts in the field, and data availability.<\/p><p>The dashboard is necessarily based on available data and will improve over time as data gaps are progressively addressed. As evidenced internationally, fully developing a Well-being Framework and related data improvements are considerable pieces of work and will require significant time and resources.<\/p><p>The indicators for the Income and Wealth dimension are:<\/p><p>- Median real household disposable income, disaggregated by Principal Economic Status of head of household and household composition;<\/p><p>- Median household net wealth, disaggregated by tenure status and household composition;<\/p><p>- Households making ends meet with great difficulty, disaggregated by household composition and household disposable income quintile.<\/p><p>The indicators for the Work and Job Quality dimension are:<\/p><p>- Labour Underutilisation Rate, disaggregated by sex and age group;<\/p><p>- Employment Rate, disaggregated by sex and age group;<\/p><p>- Mean Weekly Earnings, disaggregated by sex, nationality and age group.<\/p><p>The indicators for the Time Use dimension, which deals explicitly with work-life balance (alongside general time use) are:<\/p><p>- Long Working Hours in Main Job, disaggregated by sex, NACE economic sector and age group;<\/p><p>- Carers providing at Least 20 Hours Care per Week, disaggregated by sex, age group and level of disadvantage;<\/p><p>- Population satisfied with Time Use, disaggregated by sex and household composition<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600065#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Risk Assessment","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600065#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[56129\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600065#WRD00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the status of the National Risk Assessment.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>The National Risk Assessment provides an opportunity to identify and discuss significant risks that may arise for Ireland.

It is managed by my Department and administered by Enterprise Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  DTIF focuses on the ability of Irish SMEs to drive disruptive innovation through collaboration on research with other SMEs, multinationals and research institutions. The Fund is open to partnerships working together on projects that have the potential to significantly alter markets or the way businesses operate. <\/p>  <p>  The &euro;235 million allocated in the first three calls of the fund has been disbursed across 270 project partners from the enterprise sector and research performing organisations across the country. A key condition of DTIF is that the amounts allocated by my Department must be matched by private sector investment.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2020 the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) completed and published a Spending Review of the Fund, which is available on their website. The review was a comprehensive evaluation of the Fund aimed at systematically assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of DTIF and ensuring that the Fund remains in alignment with its policy objectives. The review acknowledged a strong rationale for a publicly funded programme making significant investments in disruptive technologies which are high-risk, high-return. It found that the programme is working towards achieving its stated objectives, including maintaining a focus on collaboration and building on publicly-funded research.<\/p>  <p>  The Spending Review also set out a proposed framework &ndash; a Programme Logic Model (PLM) &ndash; for measuring the impact of the DTIF in the years ahead particularly as the first projects come to fruition from mid-2022.

The objective of the Strategy is to ensure that remote work is a permanent feature in the Irish workplace in a way that maximises economic, social and environmental benefits.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy highlights the opportunities presented by remote working. In particular, it outlines the possibilities remote working options hold for increasing labour market participation. It underlines how remote work can offer a substantial opportunity for people with a disability or a chronic illness, by removing a commute and allowing for a more flexible schedule.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy further acknowledges how the sudden onset of remote working has led to broader acceptance of remote\/home working as a viable long-term possibility, with many companies seeing the benefits of retaining working from home as an option in the long-term. <\/p>  <p>  The potential benefits of a broader acceptance of remote working are significant for people with disabilities.

My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. <\/p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 5 November, 388 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs.

The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 5 November, almost 274,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed or have surveys underway and over 125,000 premises have build currently underway. NBI has also advised that the first premises are connected in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan and over 30,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 12 counties.\u00a0Surveys are complete in County Cork in the Deployment Areas of Tallow and Templemartin, main works are underway in the Deployment Areas of Midleton and Youghal and network build is complete in the Deployment Area of Carrigaline. My Department has investigated the premises referred to and can confirm that the premises is part of the Intervention Area and will be delivered with high speed broadband under the NBP.<\/p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the Intervention Area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. <\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 5 November, 388 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Ballydaly Community Hall, Aubane Community Centre, Mealagh Valley Community Centre, Courtbrack Community Centre, Laharn Heritage Centre, Ballindangan Community Centre, Clogagh Community Hall, Ionadh &Aacute;ise, Aghabullogue Community Centre, Castletownkenneigh Community Centre, The Old Schoolhouse, Bere Island Heritage Centre, Col&aacute;iste Phobal Cl&eacute;ire, Lissavard Community Centre, Whitechurch Community Centre (14.5km from premises referred to), Glash Community Centre, T.O.

This includes the Hydrogen Mobility Ireland (HMI) multi-stakeholder group and the Galway Green Hydrogen Hub (G2H2) group.  <\/p>  <p>  The evaluation of the Hydrogen bus trial by the National Transport Authority (NTA) in collaboration with Bus &Eacute;ireann, involving three new hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric double-deck buses on commuter services in the Greater Dublin Area, will also help to inform the future potential of this new technology within our public bus transport system. <\/p>  <p>  I will also shortly publish the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement, which will set out the future trajectory of increase in renewable fuels use in land transport. It will seek to incentivise future deployment of developing alternative fuels such as bio-methane and green hydrogen to a greater extent in the transport sector. <\/p>  <p>  In the road transport sector, this will be complemented through existing supporting measures. The alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicles grant, launched in March 2021, will continue in 2022. This grant scheme is aimed at supporting take-up of technologies such as CNG, biogas and hydrogen to decarbonise the heavy-duty freight sector. In addition, the accelerated capital allowance scheme for natural gas propelled vehicles and related equipment, include hydrogen vehicles and equipment, and the reduced excise rate on natural gas, will continue into 2022.<\/p>  <p>  As yet the transport market demand for hydrogen infrastructure for transport fuelling remains to be established, whether for national land transport modes or for international shipping and aviation.

The conditions under which motor vehicles can be placed on the market in the EU have been harmonised through the EU&rsquo;s internal market competence under Article 114 TFEU; in principle any vehicle meeting the requirements of the Type Approval Framework under Directive 2007\/46\/EC2 should be permitted to be sold anywhere in the EU. <\/p><p>Ireland was signatory to a non-paper to the Commission earlier this year requesting a phase-out date for the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the EU in line with the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 as well as the introduction of a legal framework that allows Member States to move ahead by taking action at national level to incentivise early phase-out of new petrol and diesel cars and vans.

However, the Deputy will appreciate that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis.  This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which specifically prohibits Member States from doing so. <\/p><p>Nonetheless, in order to address issues of cost and availability of insurance, the Government has prioritised the implementation of the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform<\/i>. The first Action Plan Implementation Report published in July, shows that significant progress has been made, with 34 of the 66 actions contained therein now completed. <\/p><p>One of the key achievements in the first half of this year was the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines some six months ahead of schedule. Early data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) shows that since the commencement of the new Guidelines award levels have reduced by an average of 40%. This is an encouraging development; it is my hope that this trend will continue and result in lower costs for insurance cover.  As the insurance reform agenda progresses, we will continue to hold the industry to account on its commitments to pass on savings from the Guidelines, and other elements of the reforms, to customers. Minister of State Fleming, in his ongoing engagement with the sector, has emphasised the need for insurance providers to reduce premiums and increase their risk appetite to provide cover in new areas. He will be meeting with the major insurance providers this week to reinforce this message. A further element of the Action Plan with particular relevance to these outdoor and equestrian activities involves reviewing the Duty of Care. The Minister for Justice, who is leading on this action, has noted to Government her intention to bring forward legislative proposals to reform the law in this area. My officials understand from Department of Justice officials that these proposals are at an advanced stage. <\/p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the implementation of the Action Plan can continue to have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for all individuals, businesses and community groups across the country, including for leisure, sporting and outdoor activities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600069#WRH02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":442,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[55495\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600069#WRH02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the options available a couple in full-time employment with the clear expectation of being able to repay the mortgage over a lifetime of work in circumstances in which they require life insurance to secure a mortgage for a home loan and such insurance is unavailable due to a congenital illness; if there is a requirement for the insurance industry to offer life insurance in these circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1620","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":443,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[56076\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600069#WRH02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that persons with eating disorders are currently being denied access to mortgage protection insurance policies at times on a near permanent basis in respect to persons with long-term conditions; the steps he is taking to address the issues faced by persons unable to access life insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":444,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 and 227 together.<\/p><p>I note that both questions refer to access to life insurance products for individuals with specific illnesses or medical conditions in the context of applying for a mortgage.  At the outset, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products, nor can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).<\/p><p>It is my understanding that generally, insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer life insurance and what terms to apply.  These can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle. In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration.  In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the repayment schedule. In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors.  Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.<\/p><p>My officials have previously engaged with Insurance Ireland about accessing life insurance in similar circumstances to those referenced. According to Insurance Ireland, it is not standard practice to automatically decline cover for any cohort of applicants.  It stated that insurers are obliged to assess the risk involved as part of any application for a life insurance policy, which will be specific to the individual applicant, and that the availability of cover depends on a number of factors.  In this regard, I understand that applicants are asked questions about various conditions in order for insurers to assess the risk involved, and that all applicants are assessed against the same criteria.  If higher risk is identified as a result of this assessment, Insurance Ireland has advised that the policy will be adjusted accordingly, and cover may be declined if the applicant poses a risk beyond the insurer&rsquo;s threshold.<\/p><p>Finally, with regard to mortgage protection insurance and securing a home loan, I am aware that under Section 126 of the <i>Consumer Credit Act 1995<\/i>, lenders can provide a mortgage in situations where a borrower may be unable to obtain life insurance, or where such insurance is unduly costly compared to that payable by borrowers generally. In this regard my officials have consulted the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) which has indicated that it estimates that, on an annual basis, 2% of mortgage approvals to consumers have been granted a waiver, and only 0.05% of mortgage applications approved by its members did not proceed to draw-down due to a lack of mortgage protection insurance. Importantly, consumers who feel they have been treated unfairly by any financial service provider, including an insurer, can make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600069#WRH02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Business Regulation","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600069#WRH03000"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[55569\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600069#WRH03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration has been given to making it mandatory for retailers to accept card payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>Retailers must consider a number of factors before choosing to accept any type of payment instrument. In the case of accepting card payments, one of the most relevant factors considered by a retailer are the fees that it must pay, of which consumers are generally unaware. One of the most common fees affecting merchant card acceptance across the EU is the interchange fee, i.e. the fee paid between the payer&rsquo;s bank (the card issuer) and the payee&rsquo;s bank (the bank used by the retailer) to cover handling costs etc. <\/p><p>The European Commission has acknowledged the negative impact that excessive interchange fees can have on merchant card acceptance. In an effort to address this issue (among others) in the market, the EU introduced  Regulation (EU) 2015\/751 on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions (the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR)), which introduced interchange fee caps for both credit and debit card transactions. <\/p><p>In June 2020, the Commission published a report on the application of the IFR, in which it noted that <i>the growth in domestic and cross-border card transactions is partly due to the implementation of the IFR, as they reflect higher acceptance of cards by merchants, driven in part by lower interchange <\/i>fees. <\/p><p>This growth trend in card payments is reflected in the Irish market.  As per the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Payment Statistics, the value of card payments initiated at the physical point of sale (POS), i.e. in store, steadily grew from approximately &euro;27bn in 2016 to approximately &euro;40bn in 2019. The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s figures show a decrease in the value of card payments initiated at the physical POS during 2020 (to approximately &euro;36bn), and a corresponding 26% increase in the number of remotely initiated (i.e. online) card payments. These trends are likely attributable to the restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic. <\/p><p>The continued trend of increased card usage in Ireland, particularly at the physical POS, does not appear to be indicative of a widespread issue of non-acceptance of cards by retailers. However, we are aware that it is considered best practice across the retail sector to clearly display at the point of sale or the entrance to their establishment if they do not accept a particular form of payment. <\/p><p>In this regard, my Department has not considered any policy proposals to recommend making it mandatory for retailers to accept card payments to this date. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600069#WRH03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":448,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600069#WRH03300"},{"type":"question","counter":449,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[55595\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600069#WRH03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total carbon tax collected in 2019; the amount raised in the transport and buildings category by category in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":450,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[55596\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600069#WRH03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total carbon tax collected in 2020; the amount raised in the transport and buildings category by category in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":451,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[55597\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600069#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total carbon tax collected in 2021; the amount raised in the transport and buildings category by category in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":452,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212 to 214, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the only available breakdown of receipts from Carbon Tax is by the relevant fuel type as this is the basis of which the tax is charged.

Having considered the possible inequities and administrative challenges of such an exemption or waiver structure the group recommended instead a deferral scheme that would assist property owners in a number of different scenarios including low income. The interdepartmental group recommended that where taxpayers are entitled to, and have elected for, deferral of LPT, interest due on deferred payments should be at a lower rate to the rate charged on overdue LPT which is 8% per annum. The Government accepted these recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) accordingly includes arrangements whereby a person may opt to defer, or partially defer, payment of the tax if certain conditions are met. Any LPT that is deferred between 2013 and 2021 carries an interest charge of 4% per annum.  Interest will accrue on the deferred amount until such time that it is paid off. In providing for the possibility of deferral of the tax, the reduced rate of interest recognises that the circumstances in which a person defers the tax charge are very different from those where the property owner simply fails to pay the tax.  <\/p>  <p>  A review of the interest rate on deferred LPT took place this year, in advance of the next LPT valuation period (i.e. 2022 to 2025).   The review took account of the Covid initiative on the warehousing of tax debts, in respect of which a reduced interest rate of 3% applies for late payment of outstanding liabilities.  In the interests of consistency and fairness, the Government decided to  reduce the LPT deferral rate to 3%.  The 3% rate will apply to any LPT that is deferred on or after 1 January 2022.  It will also apply to any LPT that was deferred between 2013 and 2021, to the extent that it is still outstanding in 2022.  The recently enacted Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 also provides that for 2022 the deferral income thresholds will be increased to &euro;18,000 for a single owner (from &euro;15,000) and &euro;30,000 for a couple (from &euro;25,000).  <\/p>  <p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for or does not wish to avail of a deferral there are a wide number of phased payment options available to assist with budgeting.

This position is reinforced by the EU Solvency II Directive insurance framework. <\/p><p>Having said that, this Government is acutely aware of the concerns felt by many sectors, including the equestrian ones highlighted by the Deputy, regarding the cost and availability of insurance. It has therefore prioritised the implementation of the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform<\/i>. As the Deputy may be aware, the first Action Plan Implementation Report, which was published in July, shows that significant progress has been made, with 34 of the 66 actions contained therein now completed. <\/p><p>One of the key achievements in the first half of this year was the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines some six months ahead of schedule. Early data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) shows that since the commencement of the new Guidelines award levels have reduced by an average of 40%. This is an encouraging development; it is my hope that this trend will continue and result in lower insurance costs.  As the reform agenda progresses, we will continue to hold the industry to account on its commitments to pass on savings from the Guidelines, and other elements of the reforms, to customers. Minister of State Fleming, in his ongoing engagement with the sector, has emphasised the need for insurance providers to reduce premiums and increase their risk appetite to provide cover in new areas. He will be meeting directly with the insurance sector representatives, including the CEOs of the main firms operating here, this month to reiterate this message. <\/p><p>A further element of the Action Plan with particular relevance to these types of activities involves reviewing the Duty of Care. The Minister for Justice, who is leading on this action, has noted to Government the intention to bring forward legislative proposals to reform the law in this area. I understand from Department of Justice officials that these proposals are at an advanced stage and it is my hope that these will significantly assist the sporting and outdoor activity sector. <\/p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the implementation of the Action Plan can continue to have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for all individuals, businesses and community groups across the country, including in the equestrian sector as well as other leisure and outdoor pursuits. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600069#WRH05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":471,"content":"<p>Question No. 220 answered with Question No. 219.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Action Plan","counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600069#WRH05700"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[56021\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600069#WRH05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the planned examination of green budgeting practices from a tax perspective as per action 69 of the Climate Action Plan 2021 is due to take place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance commenced green budgeting analysis of tax measures in Budget 2022. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, green budgeting is a process which seeks to consider the effects of fiscal policy and the budgetary process on the transition to a more sustainable and climate friendly economy.  <\/p>  <p>  The publication &ldquo;A Review of Green Budgeting from a Tax Perspective&rdquo; was published on Budget day along with the Budget 2022 documents, and is available on the Budget website at the following link: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/7e491-taxation-measures\/.

My Department does not have any further or more detailed information on this specific data.<\/p>  <p>  However, more generally the BPFI has indicated that financial institutions always seek to ensure the right outcome for the customer by taking all aspects of the specific mortgage application into consideration and, in reviewing any case where an exemption to the requirement to arrange mortgage protection insurance is sought, lenders will engage closely with each customer on a case-by-case basis to understand the credit and other risks which may arise in each individual case. Of most concern in such cases is understanding if any surviving party to the mortgage would have the ability to repay the facility in the event of the death of the uninsured party. There are situations where it is deemed in the customer&rsquo;s best interest to waive the requirement and others where it is deemed not to be in the customer&rsquo;s best interest to waive the requirement for mortgage protection. This is likely to be particularly relevant where the mortgage is on the family home or the primary residence of the customer.

This is the case with both the NDP and Budget 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The NDP therefore includes indicative Exchequer allocations for each Department for a five year period (2021 to 2025) and overall capital expenditure ceilings out to 2030. This expenditure is aimed at supporting the delivery of the ten National Strategic Outcomes (NSOs) identified in the National Planning Framework (NPF), which sets the overarching spatial strategy for the next two decades. The ten NSOs are Compact Growth, Enhanced Regional Accessibility, Strengthened Rural Economies and Communities, Sustainable Mobility, A Strong Economy, supported by Enterprise, Innovation and Skills High-Quality International Connectivity, Enhanced Amenity and Heritage, Transition to a Climate-Neutral and Climate Resilient Society, Sustainable Management of Water and other Environmental Resource and finally Access to Quality Childcare, Education and Health Services.<\/p>  <p>  The NPF targets 75 per cent of growth to take place outside Dublin, with 25 per cent of growth to be across the four regional cities combined (Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford) and 50 per cent of growth to occur in key regional centres, towns, villages and rural areas, as determined in the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs) and local authority development plans. <\/p>  <p>  As the NDP is a high-level financial and budgetary framework it does not outline a comprehensive list of all the public investment projects that will take place over the next ten years. However, where sufficient planning and evaluation has already taken place, the NDP contains a large range of expenditure commitments for a range of strategic investment priorities which have been determined by the relevant Departments.  <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, it should be noted that DPER, in carrying out its role in coordinating the NDP Review, does not consider the merit of individual projects or sectoral policy strategies as this is primarily a matter for individual Departments and Agencies. Individual projects are generally selected by Departments or Agencies based on a detailed process which begins with setting their own sectoral strategy and goals, and then subsequently identifying specific needs or challenges to be addressed, whether that be through regulation, taxation, education or potentially expenditure on an investment project. Appropriate options are then assessed in line with the Public Spending Code.<\/p>  <p>  For an extensive list of projects that are currently planned as part of PI2040, the Deputy might consider the publications that were published alongside the NDP, particularly the updated Investment tracker, which provides a composite update on the progress of all major investments with an estimated cost of greater than &euro;20 million. The NDP is also accompanied with MyProjectIreland mapping tool which provides details on specific projects by county, including smaller investments such as schools and social housing projects. Please access the gov.ie\/2040 page in order to check out the tracker and map. <\/p>  <p>  The earlier these projects are in the project life cycle the higher the level of uncertainty in relation to risks and costs. It wouldn&rsquo;t be wise to try and provide a false sense of certainty on exactly how projects will fare as they proceed through all the necessary approval processes.  As such, projects which are further along the project life cycle have more accurate cost and timeline estimates. A project without a finalised business case, a developed design, or planning approval is unlikely to have accurate estimates, particularly where these projects are potentially large and complex.<\/p>  <p>  An analysis of this data was undertaken as part of Phase 1 of the NDP review published in April 2021 on gov.ie\/2040. The analysis examined whether investment in the NDP was aligned with the targets set out in the NPF. The data examined shows a clear spread in the number of investment projects across the three regions, largely in line with the NPF growth targets. The regional cities in particular appear to have a lower share of investment projects over &euro;20 million and &euro;100 million compared to their planned growth, suggesting investment may be taking place in the wider regions rather than within the regional cities at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Spending Code","counter":544,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK01100"},{"type":"question","counter":545,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[56020\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the updates being considered to the Public Spending Code; the timeline for these updates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":546,"content":"<p>As part of ongoing reforms to strengthen existing guidance in ensuring the efficient and effective management of public investments, my Department is undertaking a number of updates to the Public Spending Code. These are described below. <\/p><p><b>Capital projects<\/b><\/p><p>In relation to the Public Spending Code capital expenditure guidance, <i>A Guide to Evaluating, Planning and Managing Public Investment<\/i>, 2019, the update of the Public Spending Code in 2019 highlighted the need for strengthened assurance of major projects over &euro;100m. There are currently over fifty of these projects in the Exchequer funded element of the NDP. Major projects are usually complex, bespoke, and the risks associated with them tend to materialise. Cost overruns and\/or delays on these projects can have a significant knock on impact on the rest of the capital programme. International evidence suggests that the single most effective guard against major project failure is the incorporation of an independent external review prior to project commencement.<\/p><p>My Department is introducing an External Assurance Process for major public capital projects in excess of &euro;100m. This will involve independent expert reviews at two key stages in the project life cycle under the Public Spending Code (Approval in principal and prior to tender). This will allow for robust scrutiny of the costs underpinning major public investment proposals, and the consideration given to issues such as risk, delivery and governance in the business case for the proposal. This change is due to be actioned imminently within November 2021 and has been discussed at Government in recent weeks.<\/p><p>My Department has established a framework of appropriate external reviewers to conduct the assurance reviews at key milestones in project delivery. It is a mandatory requirement for all funding departments to participate in the process for major projects over &euro;100m. This framework is in place and will be utilised once projects over &euro;100m reach the key decision gates for Government approval.<\/p><p><b>Current expenditure <\/b><\/p><p>In relation to the Public Spending Code current expenditure guidance, <i>Guidelines for Evaluating, Planning and Managing Current Expenditure<\/i>, <i>2012<\/i>my Department has received support from the EU Commission to review and improve the existing process for <i>ex-ante<\/i>appraisal of current expenditure proposals. The purpose is to strengthen the existing guidance to better align the <i>ex-ante<\/i>appraisal process with International best practices that are relevant to Ireland and the project also aims to highlight new ex-ante appraisal methods and ongoing evaluation processes stemming from the national wellbeing budget framework. <\/p><p>It is expected that the revised elements of the Public Spending Code relating to the <i>ex-ante<\/i>appraisal of &lsquo;current&rsquo; expenditure will be published in Q1 2023. <\/p><p><b>Climate Change <\/b><\/p><p>I am conscious that it is critical that the Public Spending Code provide a realistic assessment of the likely climate and environmental consequences of public investments.<\/p><p>My Department has a full programme of works for the evolution of the Public Spending Code to ensure that it is compatible with the Government&rsquo;s enhanced climate ambition. In the first instance, the priority will be to significantly increase the cost associated with any release of additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. <\/p><p>Each cost benefit analysis must provide an assessment of the net impact of the proposal on greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions are then priced according to a schedule of values based on the estimated marginal cost society will incur to reach specific climate targets. In other words, any project that results in greenhouse gas emissions must price these emissions at what it will likely cost society to reach our climate targets by adopting an offsetting measure that will reduce emissions. It is expected that my Department will undertake and publish an assessment on the suitability of existing PSC appraisal methodologies (such as marginal abatement cost (MAC) &ndash; derived shadow cost of carbon) in light of 2050 statutory target. The expected date for this work is Q4 2023.<\/p><p>In 2019, my Department tripled the price of carbon applied in the Code. This re-appraisal of the cost of carbon was based on the estimated costs associated with achieving a 30 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Since then, the Government&rsquo;s climate ambitions have been considerably strengthened. Now Ireland intends to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 51 per cent by 2030 and to reach a carbon neutral economy by 2050, with any remaining emissions balanced by the removal of greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere. This means that the price applied in the Public Spending Code must be updated to reflect this enhanced ambition. It is expected that a new shadow price of carbon will be applied to all Government investment appraisal, this work is expected to take place in Q2 2022.<\/p><p>In addition, work has commenced with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on evolving further aspects of the Public Spending Code. A new model for assessing the emissions impact of infrastructure investment will be progressed to ensure that the full range of potential consequences for this type of investment are captured and valued appropriately. This work will consider how such assessments are performed at the moment and what reforms might be implemented to improve these assessments. The project will also examine how investments that may be vulnerable to the impacts of climate change should be appraised. My Department plan to publish a study in Q4 2022 that determines whether the climate and environmental treatment of infrastructure emissions is appropriate in the PSC and implement any reforms deemed necessary.<\/p><p>Finally, work will be progressed on understanding the role of an instrument like the Code, in a scenario where net zero greenhouse emissions must be achieved by 2050 and the role that the Public Spending Code can play in the achievement of broader environmental objectives.<\/p><p>Ultimately, the objective of this programme of work is to allow Government to take decisions that are fully informed by the best possible evidence on the consequences of these decisions.<\/p><p>Public Spending Code guidance will be updated periodically as appropriate to ensure that it continues to reflect best practice and best available analysis, remains relevant and is as user-friendly as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":547,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK01400"},{"type":"question","counter":548,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[56072\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the reason the contracts for the construction of the new Bailieborough Garda station have not being signed; when it is expected this will happen; the reason for such delays given that the design plans were signed off on as far back as 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":549,"content":"<p>The contract for this project has been placed and it is expected that construction works will begin before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Expenditure Policy","counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":551,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[56138\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his Department has identified particular tendencies in the context of public spending, current or capital, including inflationary elements which may require corrective measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":552,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[56141\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied that public spending continues to proceed as anticipated notwithstanding the ongoing impact of Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":553,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[56145\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his preferred options to meet ongoing social and economic requirements in the context of current and capital expenditure in line with prudent management but placing sufficient emphasis on important structures such as housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":554,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 248, 251 and 255 together.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-October was &euro;67.5 billion. While this is almost &euro;2 billion ahead on the same period in 2020, it is over &euro;2.4 billion or 3.5% below the level of spending that had been profiled for this period. Of this, gross current expenditure at the end of October of &euro;62.5 million was &euro;0.9 billion or 1.5% behind profile. Capital spending of &euro;5.1 billion was &euro;1.5 billion or 22.9% behind profile with the public health restrictions in place earlier in the year, including the shutdown of construction, impacting on the spending plans of Departments.  <\/p>  <p>  Departments may carryover up to 10% of the capital envelopes by way of deferred surrender to the following year for spending in that year on priority capital programmes and over &euro;0.7 billion was carried over from 2020 into 2021. As outlined in the Expenditure Report 2022, based on estimates provided by Departments it is currently expected that a broadly similar amount will be carried over from 2021 into 2022. <\/p>  <p>  Responding to the challenges posed by both Covid-19 and Brexit has been a key priority in recent budgets, with significant funds allocated to provide counter-cyclical supports. Indeed, to respond to the pandemic, approximately &euro;30 billion in funding has been made available for direct Covid-19 related expenditure supports throughout 2020 and 2021. This provision has enabled the introduction of a wide range of support schemes and measures across Government and has been targeted at supporting our health service to respond to the crisis, to provide income supports to people who lost their jobs, and to ensure the survival of enterprises beyond Covid.<\/p>  <p>  While such a counter-cyclical approach was both appropriate and necessary, the ongoing cost has been significant. As we look forward, this Government remains committed to improving the long-term potential of the economy through carefully planned investment. Accordingly, Budget 2022 was prepared in line with our medium term fiscal strategy and reflects our commitment to:<\/p>  <p>  - Return the public finances to a more sustainable position;<\/p>  <p>  - Address our infrastructure challenges including in the key areas of housing and climate action;<\/p>  <p>  - Invest in our health care system;<\/p>  <p>  - Continue to enhance our other core public services and social supports; and<\/p>  <p>  - Ensure a balanced recovery from the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Key to this strategy is the commitment to grow core expenditure programmes broadly in line with the trend growth rate of the economy, or by an annual average of just over 5 per cent, over the period to 2025 in tandem with the phased withdrawal of the exceptional funding for Covid supports and measures introduced to deal with the adverse consequences of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Adopting this approach to expenditure growth will ensure an appropriate buffer against the risks of pro-cyclicality and inflation. Furthermore, the expenditure strategy also allows for steady improvements in public services while, at the same time, narrowing the deficit and stabilising the debt-income ratio.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pay","counter":555,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK02200"},{"type":"question","counter":556,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[56139\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK02300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which FEMPI restoration has been completed across all income brackets throughout the public sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":557,"content":"<p>The process of unwinding the Financial Emergency (FEMPI) legislation commenced under the Lansdowne Road Agreement 2016 &ndash; 2018, with the remainder of the process largely completed under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 &ndash; 2020 (PSSA).

Implementation of the report's recommendations is now at an advanced stage. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the OECD recommendation to develop an equalities data strategy, the CSO completed a data audit in cooperation with my Department, to ascertain the availability of public service data that is disaggregated by equality dimension. A report on this audit was published in October 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In order to support the continuing development of performance budgeting in Ireland, the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform has been successful in its application to the EU&rsquo;s Structural Reform Support Programme (SRSP). The project that the EU is funding under this Programme is providing Ireland with the opportunity to work with technical experts from the EU and OECD as well as other international experts in order to take stock of how effectively performance budgeting has been working and to consider future directions for ongoing reform drawing on international best practice (e.g., enhance accountability and transparency, upgrade existing budgeting and financial management systems and processes). This project also takes cognisance of the other reform initiatives (e.g., equality budgeting, green budgeting, and well-being budgeting).<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Government agreed to the establishment of an inter-departmental group for Equality Budgeting to facilitate the embedding of the initiative across all Government departments. This group has met twice this year and will meet again this week, and plays a key role in guiding the continued progress of Equality Budgeting. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Project Ireland 2040","counter":566,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK03200"},{"type":"question","counter":567,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[56144\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600071#WRK03300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which he expects the various targets in Project Ireland 2040 to be achieved on time and within budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":568,"content":"<p>The NDP 2021-30 was published on 4<sup>th<\/sup>October, committing to an overall investment of &euro;165 billion in the years from 2021 to 2030. <\/p><p>It is important to acknowledge that the majority of public investment projects are delivered on budget and on time and there is a high level of professionalism across the sectors.

This movement away from regulations and population-level restrictions is only possible if individuals, organisations and communities ensure that there is adherence to best practice in infection preventions and control, like observing good respiratory and hand hygiene, wearing a face covering in crowded and congregated settings and staying home and self-isolating when symptomatic.<\/p>  <p>  At its meeting on 19 October 2021, and following consideration of the public health advice, Government agreed that additional aspects of society could reopen only with the full range of protective measures in place. As such, current restrictions under the Government&rsquo;s plan state that organisers of indoor and outdoor group activities should ensure that appropriate protective measures are in place. For indoor sports, this means:<\/p>  <p>  - The use of the EU Digital COVID Certificate (vaccine or recovery certificate) will be required for accessing indoor sporting activities and events. <\/p>  <p>  - Where individuals have mixed immunity status, pods of up to 6 participants will be permitted (excluding adult coaches\/instructors).<\/p>  <p>  - Multiple pods will be permissible subject to protective measures.<\/p>  <p>  - The overall number of pods will have regard to the size of venue and there should be substantial social distance between individual pods.<\/p>  <p>  - For Vaccinated individuals no fixed capacity limits apply to these activities.<\/p>  <p>  - Vaccinated spectators attending indoor sporting events should be fully seated.<\/p>  <p>  Sport Ireland has been in regular communication with the National Governing Bodies of sport about safeguarding concerns through the pandemic.

These changes include expanding the scope of costs covered to sub vent the all-in development cost of delivering the housing; accepting applications as they are developed on a rolling basis as opposed to time constrained funding calls; and, allowing funding support to now exceed the current maximum of &euro;50,000 per affordable dwelling on a stepped scale to &euro;100,000, based on location and density.<\/p>  <p>  Cork City Council is currently on site at Boherboy Road where, under the SSF, they will deliver 116 affordable homes with the first phase being delivered by year end. They will also submit an AHF application for 21 affordable units, previously approved under SSF, for Churchfield, to be delivered in 2023.<\/p>  <p>  The &lsquo;First Home&rsquo; affordable purchase shared equity scheme is designed to enable first-time buyers to purchase a newly-built home in private developments.  It will do so by bridging the gap, by means of an equity stake, between the purchaser&rsquo;s available deposit and mortgage, and the price of the new home they wish to buy. Work on the design of the scheme is ongoing, in advance of the scheme&rsquo;s introduction next year.<\/p>  <p>  The affordable purchase schemes will not have a single or universally applicable income limit.  Eligibility assessments will consider income on a household specific basis.  Broadly, where a household is unable to purchase the new home in question using their deposit and maximum mortgage entitlement, and where the available equity support can bridge the gap between their available finance and the cost of the home, they will be eligible to apply.   The price of new homes being made available under the First Home scheme will be limited by price ceilings linked to the median price of new build first time buyer homes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600072#WRL03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Stations","counter":628,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600072#WRL03400"},{"type":"question","counter":629,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[55585\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600072#WRL03500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the new Dunleer fire station in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":630,"content":"<p>The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003.

Introduced in 2014 with the original aim of tackling long term vacant units, the programme is now increasingly targeted at ensuring minimal turnaround and re-let times for local authority vacant stock. <\/p>  <p>  As per Circular 17\/2021, and in line with previous year&rsquo;s programmes, local authorities were notified that only the minimum works required to comply with the Housing (Private Rented Standards) Regulations, 2019 should be carried out to ensure these properties are turned around as quickly as possible and to maximise the budget available. Furthermore, my Department receives regular updates on the status of each local authority&rsquo;s programme of works and actively encourages the remediation of all local authority owned vacant properties as expeditiously as possible. <\/p>  <p>  It must also be noted, vacancy figures and turnaround times are impacted by a number of different factors and a portion of the dwellings currently vacant would not necessarily fall into a normal vacancy\/void programme for reasons detailed below;<\/p>  <p>  - Dwellings awaiting demolition or major regeneration<\/p>  <p>  - Dwellings vacant and are set aside for sale<\/p>  <p>  - Not for letting pending resolution of legal disputes<\/p>  <p>  - Second hand acquisitions awaiting repairs and vacant pending those repairs<\/p>  <p>  - Repaired and awaiting letting<\/p>  <p>  - New build\/Turnkey awaiting letting<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that my Department and local authorities supported by the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach to housing stock management and maintenance to a planned maintenance approach as referenced in Housing for All, policy objective 20.6. This will require the implementation of centrally hosted ICT system within the LGMA to support the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes which will be supported by my Department&rsquo;s stock improvement funding programmes.

The input of the EIB is also relevant in ensuring that there is a full understanding of the banks&rsquo; strategic lending needs and priorities, which in turn, will help to inform a wider national model for Cost Rental.<\/p>  <p>  The principle of Cost Rental is that the rent for the homes made available will be a function of the costs incurred in financing, building, managing and maintaining the homes.  As such, it is essential for costs to be managed carefully, in order to deliver rents that are as low as possible.  In determining viability, there is a clear need ensure that the design and specifications of Cost Rental homes is balanced appropriately with cost. <\/p>  <p>  A net household income limit of &euro;53,000 has applied to the first Cost Rental projects, so that a household could not spend any less than 25% of net income on a &lsquo;reference rent&rsquo; of &euro;1,100 per month, which is reflective of the rents for Enniskerry Road and the first Cost Rental homes funded by the Government&rsquo;s Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme. Cost Rental projects can benefit from State supports, such as grants for infrastructure works, the provision of public land at no or low cost and State assistance with financing. All three of these methods are being used by the Department to support initial Cost Rental projects.<\/p>  <p>  As the design and other key metrics for the Emmet Road development have not yet been finalised by DCC, it would not be prudent at this juncture to comment on exact finances to be allocated to it nor on the ultimate Cost Rents that may emerge. However, as previously stated, my Department fully supports this development as a 'pathfinder' project and DCC will be able to avail of State supports to achieve its realisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defective Building Materials","counter":661,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM00925"},{"type":"question","counter":662,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[55751\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM00950","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the contribution anticipated from financial institutions to the various schemes to restore buildings which have suffered from building product defects, in view of the benefit they enjoy in the value of the security of their portfolio of property as a result of the restoration of these properties at the taxpayer's expense.

Some streams of funding are delivered directly from funding departments to local authorities, while others are routed through departmental agencies.  <\/p>  <p>  Most of the funding sourced from Central Government and provided to local authorities must be used for specified services. These can be grouped into 5 broad programme categories: recreational, education, environment, housing and transport. In 2020, funding from central government to local authorities totalled &euro;6.08 billion, an increase of 46% on 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Additional detail on Central Government funding of local authorities is provided in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Annual Report, accessible at the following link:  <\/p>  <p> www.audit.gov.ie\/en\/find-report\/publications\/2021\/chapter-3-central-government-funding-of-local-authorities.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, population distribution, public service demands, infrastructure and other income sources, all factors which must be taken into account when comparing levels of funding in different local authority areas.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has a wide and diverse business agenda, covering a broad range of functions, including local authority housing, voluntary housing, homeless services, estate regeneration, energy efficiency retrofitting, housing grants, rural water schemes, urban renewal\/regeneration, and fire services.   In order to achieve its objectives, my Department allocates significant resources to an extensive range of organisations, including local authorities, dedicated agencies, and other bodies; some allocations, depending on the programmes concerned, are made on a national or other non-county basis in the form of grant funding.  <\/p>  <p>  The local government funding model changed in 2014, primarily due to the establishment of Irish Water. Its financial relationship with the local government sector had a considerable impact on local authority financing at that time. In allocating General Purpose Grants from the Local Government Fund for 2014, my Department took account of the movement of certain water related activities from local authorities to Irish Water.  In this context, it was necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the LPT to be retained in each local authority and the setting of LPT baselines until 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Local retention of LPT began in 2015 and is now established as an important source of funding for the local government sector, which reduces reliance on central funding. In accordance with decisions taken by Government regarding the distribution of LPT funding, every local authority has a minimum level of funding available to it known as the LPT baseline. The redistribution of the 20% of LPT from all local authority areas assists in providing equalisation funding to those authorities that have lower property tax bases. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government 'Our Shared Future', commits to bringing forward LPT reforms. These reforms will bring new homes, previously exempt from LPT, into the taxation system as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. This will also be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":683,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM02900"},{"type":"question","counter":684,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[56015\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM03000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when new maps of the approximate 9,000ha of land which will fall under the scope of the new zoned land tax will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":685,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance has the lead responsibility for the new zoned land tax, with legislation setting out the provisions relating to the tax measure included in Finance Bill 2021.

These extensive natural heritage sites are managed from a conservation perspective, and attract in excess of 4 million visitors annually. Given the resources available for capital investment within our National Parks and Nature Reserves, my Department is ever mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing Parks and Reserves lands and have no plans at present to increase the number of National Parks in the country.<\/p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment and contribution to protecting our heritage and improving our tourism and recreation product, we have been exploring ways to optimise the sustainable potential of heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives. <\/p><p>In this context, it should be noted that in late 2016 my Department negotiated the extension of Wicklow Mountains National Park by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole at a cost of &euro;800,000. The purchase underpins the Government&rsquo;s on-going commitment to the preservation of our natural heritage for future generations of citizens and visitors alike to enjoy.<\/p><p>In 2017 the entire Wild Nephin area was consolidated into the ownership of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department. This creates a state-owned wilderness project of over 11,000 hectares and aims to provide increased nature conservation benefits and biodiversity as well as  enhanced recreational and social benefits through the &lsquo;re-wilding&rsquo; of the forest which adjoins the National Park. Thanks to the acquisition, we will be returning the area to a natural wilderness state.<\/p><p>My Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, launched a strategic partnership in 2017 with a view to growing tourism revenues in the rural areas where the parks are located and increasing Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a recreation destination.  One of the outputs from the partnership with F&aacute;ilte was Experiencing the Wild Heart of Ireland &ndash; an interpretative master plan for the development of our National Parks and Reserves, which sets out a road map for investment at these important nature conservation, public amenity and tourism sites and underpins the objectives of Project 2040 as well as Heritage 2030.  <\/p><p>The investment in our National Parks will create memorable and meaningful experiences of Ireland&rsquo;s landscapes, wildlife and culture. This will be done though sensitive design and the development of authentic experiences, providing better access to nature and an increased understanding of society&rsquo;s conservation responsibilities, as well as supporting significant investment in recreational facilities, including upgrading and development of the trails network, increased visitor facilities and improved signage and branding. These will be designed and delivered with a strong emphasis on conservation and allow us to protect and preserve our most fragile environments and, by investing in our culture, language and heritage, provide a well-being benefit for all.  <\/p><p>The recent land acquisitions as well as ongoing and future projects described above reflect some of the key objectives of <i>Heritage 2030<\/i>, including increased investment in our heritage, improved access, and better quality of information, guidance and advice as a resource for stakeholders, visitors, researchers and the general public.<\/p><p>So while I have no plans to expand the National Park network at present, my Department is actively ensuring the preservation, protection and presentation of the assets we already own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Persons Supports","counter":692,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM03800"},{"type":"question","counter":693,"qnumday":298,"qnumall":"[56074\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 320 and 321 of 9 November 2021, if the homeless HAP numbers in the third table in the question are active HAP tenancies or set-up HAP tenancies.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":694,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the figures given for total number of homeless HAP tenancies in Dublin, at the end of each quarter from Q1 2016 to Q1 2021 and used in the third table of the reply to Parliamentary Question Nos. 320 and 321 of 9 November 2021, represent cumulative Homeless HAP tenancy set-ups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defective Building Materials","counter":695,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM04100"},{"type":"question","counter":696,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[56080\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM04200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a list of all reports commissioned by his Department or reviewed by his Department on defective buildings in the past five years including the authors of the report and if the reports have been or are due to be published.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":697,"content":"<p>A list of relevant reports commissioned by my Department is set out below. <table>    <tr>       <th>The Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings where concerns arise<\/th>       <th>Eamonn O&rsquo;Boyle and Associates <\/th>       <th>Published July 2017<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Report of the Expert Panel on   Concrete Blocks<\/td>       <td>Expert panel <\/td>       <td>Published June 2017<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>In the course of its work on the development of policy in relation to defective housing, my Department receives and\/or considers a broad range of material, including from local authorities and other stakeholders as well as material available from other countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":698,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM04400"},{"type":"question","counter":699,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[56148\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM04500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a list of local authorities that do and do not have biodiversity officers;

The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to him\/her. In order to meet this legal requirement, each person must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship in his\/her passport application.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the identity and citizenship verification process, the Passport Service requires applicants themselves, or the applicant&rsquo;s guardian in the case of applications for children, to submit all necessary supporting documents in order to establish the applicant&rsquo;s identity and entitlement to citizenship.<\/p>  <p>  For example, in the case of a child born on the island of Ireland to an Irish citizen, who themselves were not born on the island of Ireland, proof of the parent&rsquo;s Irish citizenship at the time of the applicant&rsquo;s birth is required. In such cases, parents must submit a certified copy of their Irish passport along with their child&rsquo;s first time passport application. <\/p>  <p>  In a similar manner, In the case of Irish-born children claiming Irish citizenship through a parent who is a naturalised Irish citizen or received Irish citizenship through Foreign Birth Registration or Post Nuptial Citizenship Declaration, evidence must be given that the parent was in fact an Irish citizen before the child was born.<\/p>  <p>  The current processing time for first time passport applications is 40 working days for Passport Online and 8 weeks for applications submitted through An Post's \"Passport Express\" service.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing a high demand for first time passports. There are currently 62,000 first time online applications on hand with the Passport Service. Over a third (23,000) of online first time applications are incomplete and require the applicant or their guardian to submit the documents necessary to complete the passport application. These cannot be processed by the Passport Service until all relevant documents have been submitted and the application is fully complete. The Passport Service engages with all applicants who have not submitted the required documentation to ensure that their application is completed correctly and can proceed through the processing system.<\/p>  <p>  To protect the integrity of the Irish Passport, first time applications require careful processing in order to validate the identity of the applicant and their entitlement to Irish citizenship for the first time. Additionally, in the case of children, the consent of guardians must be validated. Accordingly, the current processing time for first-time online applications is longer than for that of a passport renewal application.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of children born abroad to an Irish citizen, who themselves were not born in on the island of Ireland, but received Irish citizenship through descent, naturalisation, Foreign Birth Registration or Post Nuptial Citizenship Declaration before the child was born, the child may apply for Irish citizenship through Foreign Birth Registration. Once the child is entered onto the Foreign Births Register, they are an Irish citizen and are entitled to apply for an Irish passport. Information on how to apply for Irish citizenship through Foreign Birth Registration is available on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.dfa.ie\/citizenship\/born-abroad\/registering-a-foreign-birth). <\/p>  <p>  Operations at the Passport Service were severely disrupted by public health restrictions brought about by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. During this period, unfortunately, it was necessary to pause Foreign Birth Registration processing in order to focus also on the provision of urgent passport services. As of Monday, 15th November, the processing of Foreign Birth Registration has resumed on a phased basis. My Department is fully committed to allocating resources over the coming weeks to assist with the high volume of applications, with a focus on reducing turnaround times.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times, including examining the processes around the verification and processing of the supporting documentation for first time passport and Foreign Birth Registration applications. The Passport Service is also working closely with the Department&rsquo;s Human Resources Division and with the Public Appointments Service on an ongoing basis to recruit additional staff to meet the current and forecasted demand for passports and Foreign Birth Registration. We are planning for the recruitment and assignment of an additional 384 permanent and temporary staff between now and the end of January 2022, bringing total staff numbers to 920 and effectively doubling the number of staff at the Passport Service since June of this year.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":710,"qnumday":304,"qnumall":"[55603\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600073#WRM05600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of a passport renewal in the case of a person (details supplied);

Notwithstanding that disruption and the necessary restrictions put in place to protect public health, the Passport Service provided service to our citizens facing a medical emergency of death of a family member abroad at all times since the onset of the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service has issued over half a million passports to date in 2021 and 45% of simple adult renewals issue within one business day. <\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing a high demand for first time passports. These first time applications are necessarily complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the citizenship status of applicants. In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the extra measures involved, processing time for first time online passport applications is 40 working days.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Offices in Mount St, Dublin 2 and in Cork are now offering an Urgent Appointment Service for the renewal of passports. The Urgent Appointment Service ensures that, for those who unexpectedly require a very urgent turnaround of a passport renewal, there is an option available that is transparent, predictable and clear. It means that an applicant can book and pay for their appointment, safe in the knowledge that they will have their passport within a day, or a few days. To avail of the Urgent Appointment Service for Passport Renewal, applicants must first book an appointment to attend the public office in Dublin or Cork. Applicants can book an appointment through the Department of Foreign Affairs website (www.dfa.ie\/passports). Over 800 urgent appointments have been facilitated since the Passport Service launched this service on 27th September 2021. The Passport Service is following public health guidelines in relation to this service in order to protect the health and safety of customers and staff in our public offices and will continue to do so for as long as is necessary. <\/p>  <p>  The processing, printing and dispatch of passports operates on an automated system which handles thousands of passports per week. Passports are delivered very efficiently throughout Ireland by An Post and are generally received by the applicant within one working day. The collection of passports is currently available to people who book an Urgent Appointment at the Passport Offices in Mount St, Dublin 2 and Cork. The collection of passports by online and postal customers cannot currently be facilitated by the Passport Service as this significantly impacts the dispatch of passports for all other customers.<\/p>  <p>  The current passport processing times are:<\/p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult renewals<\/p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex renewals<\/p>  <p>  - 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online<\/p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service<\/p>  <p>  The passport processing times are based on current average application turnaround times and apply to passport applications that are fully complete, where all required supporting documentation has been correctly submitted to the Passport Service by the applicant. The projected passport issue date provided to applicants on the online Passport Tracker provides an indication only of the estimated issue date based on current averages and is not an intended guarantee of service. The projected passport issue date by the Passport Tracker provided does not include postage time. <\/p>  <p>  Applications can take longer than the average turnaround time if applicants have not provided all of the required documentation to correctly complete their application. There are currently 10,000 postal applications and 98,000 online passport applications on hand at the Passport Service. Of the online applications, 34,000 or 35% of applications are incomplete and require the applicant to submit additional documents. The Passport Service engages with all applicants who have not submitted the required documentation to ensure that their application is completed correctly and can proceed through the processing system. Of the online applications that are currently with the Passport Service for processing, approximately 8% are past the estimated issue-by date. These applications are being prioritised by the Passport Service who are working very hard to eliminate these delays. <\/p>  <p>  In 2020, 34,000 passports were issued beyond the initial estimated issue-by date. In 2021, that figure was 135,000. It is important to note that due to pandemic-related restrictions, between January and May of 2021, only emergency passports were issued by the Passport Service. This citizen-critical service required staff to be on site to process and issue emergency passports during Level 5 restrictions.  As a result of well implemented safety protocols, 67,000 passports were issued between January and May of this year. <\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service commenced the scaling-up of operations on 4 May 2021 in line with the phased easing of restrictions set out in \"COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Plan Ahead\". By the end of July 2021, substantial progress had been made in clearing the COVID-19 backlog. All backlog applications which had been completed correctly had been processed and passports issued to applicants. The Passport Service had also been in contact with applicants who needed to submit additional documents. Once those documents were received, the issuance of passports was expedited. <\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants, particularly in light of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the Passport Service and the high demand for passports seen in recent months as international travel resumed. <\/p>  <p>  Adequate staffing of the Passport Service to respond to demand remains a priority for my Department and is an issue that is kept under constant review. My Department is actively working with the Public Appointments Service on an ongoing basis to recruit and assign additional staff to meet the current and forecasted high demand for passports. We are planning for the recruitment and assignment of an additional 384 permanent and temporary staff between now and the end of January 2022, bringing total staff numbers to 920 and effectively doubling the number of staff at the Passport Service since June of this year. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Passport Service is working with relevant divisions within my Department to ensure the health and safety of all staff and is finalising plans in co-operation with the OPW to ensure that additional staff will be accommodated to meet the anticipated increased demand for passports expected in 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.  Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.<\/p>  <p>  I urge citizens to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to ensure that they apply in plenty of time. In the case of people planning to travel in 2022, whose passports are already out of date or who have children who are first-time applicants, I would encourage them to apply now online.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Online service continues to be the fastest and most efficient channel for passport applications and is available to first time applicants, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600074#WRN02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":739,"content":"<p>Question No. 312 answered with Question No. 311.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":740,"content":"<p>Question No. 313 answered with Question No. 311.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":741,"content":"<p>Question No. 314 answered with Question No. 311.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":742,"content":"<p>Question No. 315 answered with Question No. 311.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":743,"content":"<p>Question No. 316 answered with Question No. 311.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":744,"content":"<p>Question No. 317 answered with Question No. 311.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":745,"content":"<p>Question No. 318 answered with Question No. 311.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":746,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600074#WRN03200"},{"type":"question","counter":747,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[56013\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600074#WRN03300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the supports or measures Ireland on its own or in conjunction with others is putting place to assist the populace of Afghanistan who are threatened with starvation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1605","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":748,"content":"<p>I am gravely concerned by the situation in Afghanistan, which is now one of worst humanitarian crisis in the world.

Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will a psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. In relation to the school to which the Deputy refers, the NEPS North West\/North Midlands Region (Sligo Team) provides a service to this school.<\/p>  <p>  Special schools generally cater for children with the most complex needs.  Accordingly, these schools have enhanced staffing levels with greatly reduced pupil: teacher and SNA staffing allocations.  The provision of training and support for these schools is prioritised including access to training and post graduate programmes tailored to meeting the needs of children with complex needs.  On an ongoing basis, these schools have access to the NCSE advisory support service which advises on children with the most complex needs including behavioural needs. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the School Inclusion Model (SIM) which has been developed in collaboration with the Departments of Health; Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth; the NCSE and the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE is currently piloting this new model in 75 schools in the CHO 7 area. As part of this new model, NCSE teams have been enhanced to include Occupational Therapists, Speech and Language Therapists and Behaviour Practitioners to support schools build capacity to include children with special educational needs. The evaluation of this pilot will inform future policy in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600075#WRO03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":799,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600075#WRO03600"},{"type":"question","counter":800,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[55472\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600075#WRO03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to increase the pay scale of special needs assistants and in particular for those fully qualified as Irish Sign Language interpreters and teachers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":801,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[55473\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600075#WRO03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to ensure all children who happen to be profoundly deaf have access to fully qualified in-classroom Irish Sign Language teachers and interpreters; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":802,"qnumday":339,"qnumall":"[55474\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600075#WRO03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to provide support and resources to special needs assistants who wish to become fully qualified Irish Sign Language interpreters and teachers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":803,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 337 to 339, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Very significant levels of financial provision are made to ensure that all children with special educational needs, including children who are deaf\/hard of hearing, can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs. <\/p><p>The State currently spends approximately &euro;2 Billion - almost a quarter - of its annual educational and training budget on making additional provision for children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 Billion per annum was provided.<\/p><p>Included in this provision is an extensive range of supports to assist students who are deaf or hard of hearing.<\/p><p>In line with the Department's policy that children with special educational needs access appropriate education intervention in mainstream settings where possible, many deaf or hard of hearing pupils are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level, while other children who are deaf or hard of hearing and have more complex needs may attend special schools or classes, which have lower pupil teacher ratios.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published the Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme on 30th May 2018 and the Government has noted the contents of the report.

Following the completion of audits of our sites, the websites&rsquo; accessibility statements will include a statement of commitment and a compliance status statement as required under the European Union (Accessibility of Websites and Mobile Applications of Public Sector Bodies) Regulations 2020. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600077#WRQ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services Card","counter":918,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600077#WRQ04100"},{"type":"question","counter":919,"qnumday":378,"qnumall":"[55576\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600077#WRQ04200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons waiting for an appointment for a public services card, in tabular form; and the expected waiting time before they will receive an appointment.","asker":"1460","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":920,"content":"<p>The SAFE registration process, which involves the authentication of a person's identity in a face-to-face interview, results in the issuing of a Public Services Card (PSC), which can be used as proof of identity when accessing public services.<\/p><p>  At the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, my Department temporarily suspended the SAFE registration process and the centralised online appointment system used to manage those interviews.

It proposed that the current &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system, be replaced with a &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; (TCA), which would make the level of pension directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life, with significant pension credits granted to people who have taken time out of the workplace to perform caring duties.  <\/p>  <p>  In January 2018, the Government announced an Interim Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to calculate the entitlement of pensioners who reached state pension age on or after 1 September 2012 (i.e. those born on or after 1 September 1946) and who had a reduced rate pension entitlement based on post Budget 2012 rate bands.  All pensioners who have reached state pension age since September 2012, therefore, have seen both YA and interim TCA methods applied and they receive whichever rate is most beneficial.<\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment.  The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  The Commission has completed its work and its report was published on 7th October 2021.  That report, the Commission's Technical Sub-Committee's working papers and the submissions received by the Commission as part of its public consultation are available on the Commission&rsquo;s website, pensionscommission.gov.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission recommends that the full transition to a Total Contributions Approach and the abolition of the Yearly Average approach to calculating entitlement to the State Pension Contributory rate of payment should be implemented as soon as possible, pending the passage of necessary legislation and IT system changes.  It further recommended that for those who are better off having their pension entitlement calculated under the Yearly Average approach, a phased transition to the Total Contributions Approach should apply gradually over a 10 year period.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and of future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully.

The central tenet of the report&rsquo;s findings was that mortgage interest supplement did little to assist families in improving the long-term difficulty in addressing their mortgage difficulties The scheme only covered the interest payments on the mortgage; it did not reduce the value of the outstanding mortgage and, in effect, acted as a subsidy to the lending institution while creating a potential welfare trap for the customer, with customers accumulating arrears whilst receiving support. <\/p>  <p>  The mortgage interest supplement scheme was discontinued for new entrants from 1 January 2014.

Under the CCMA, lending institutions encourage customers to contact them at the earliest opportunity regarding their concerns and any particular circumstances which may impact on the customer&rsquo;s financial well-being.

My Department cannot ignore this legal advice and note that this is also in line with good governance and best practice.<\/p>  <p>  There has been extensive engagement in relation to this matter, both at Ministerial and official level since 2019. In addition to site visits by officials to every contracted public employment service in the State, including Monaghan, there has been continual engagement with stakeholders through numerous meetings with the representative body, the ILDN, and other stakeholders.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is now at an advanced stage in its first phase of procuring new employment services.  This phase involves the procurement of regional employment services for seven counties in the Midlands and North-West across four lots.  These counties do not have an existing local employment service and represent the first phase of an expansion of similar employment services across the State.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies that no new privatisation is being undertaken in relation to employment services.  No service previously undertaken by civil or public servants is being outsourced.  Local Employment Services and Job Clubs have always been contracted out services and provide employment services for those who are long term unemployed.  <\/p>  <p>  The Phase two procurement, which will see the Regional Employment Service model rolled out across the State will consider the learnings from the first phase. This is a significant expansion of employment services and will result in State-wide coverage of employment services for those furthest from the labour market for the first time. These new services were due to commence at the start of next year.  However, on foot of requests for additional time from the sector to facilitate existing providers working collaboratively to submit joint tenders, the commencement of these new employment services under phase two has been postponed by six months until July 2022. It is intended that the Requests for Tenders will issue by the end of this year but additional time for submissions has now been included in the revised timeline.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to consult with its service partners prior to the finalisation of the Phase two procurement process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600078#WRR02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance","counter":968,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600078#WRR03000"},{"type":"question","counter":969,"qnumday":394,"qnumall":"[55938\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600078#WRR03100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a person (details supplied) in County Kerry will be given credited contributions for periods they were unemployed in 2018 and 2019; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":970,"content":"<p>Credited contributions (credits) are social insurance contributions designed to protect the social insurance entitlement record of insured workers who are not in a position to make PRSI contributions.

In particular, the Pathways to Work strategy seeks to increase labour market participation among groups that would not traditionally be considered as &lsquo;unemployed&rsquo;. This includes lone parents, people with disabilities and members of minority ethnic groups, as well as those people who may have taken time out of the workforce and would now like to return.<\/p>  <p>  Parents, who are not on Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance and who exited the workforce to care for their children, can access a number of the schemes, allowances and initiatives outlined in the Pathways to Work strategy, subject to meeting the relevant eligibility criteria. <\/p>  <p>  For example, access to the new Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) is not limited to those on Jobseeker payments, but rather is also open to those on a range of other qualifying social welfare payments, including the One-Parent Family payment, Disability Allowance and Blind Pension. Furthermore, individuals in receipt of these payments can automatically qualify for WPEP without the required qualifying timeframe. The WPEP aims to provide those looking to get back into work, or who have never had a job or who have lost their employment, with an opportunity to gain meaningful work experience in a supportive environment with a view to increasing their employment prospects.<\/p>  <p>  The Training Support Grant (TSG), which is designed to fund quick access to short-term training that can support individual jobseekers seeking employment (including self-employment ) to access work opportunities, is also open to those on other qualifying social welfare payments, such as One-Parent Family payment and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance. It is also open to those who are qualified adults on a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment and are seeking employment. The grant can be provided when an Intreo Case Officer or Job Coach has identified the immediate skills gap that represents an obstacle to the person taking up a job offer.<\/p>  <p>  Both the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) and Back to Work Enterprise Allowances (BTWEA) are also open to those on other qualifying social welfare payments, apart from Jobseeker&rsquo;s, subject to meeting other eligibility criteria and timeframes.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, Community Employment Programmes, which are designed to help people who are long-term unemployed (or otherwise disadvantaged) get back into work by offering part-time and temporary placements in jobs based within local communities, are also available to those on a number of other qualifying social welfare payments apart from Jobseeker  payments,  including One-Parent Family Payment among others. In general, an individual must also be getting one of these qualifying payments for at least 12 months to be eligible.<\/p>  <p>  Alternatively, if a parent who previously exited the labour force is not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment and now wishes to return (and\/or benefit from the supports listed above), they can do so by applying for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. By demonstrating their underlying eligibility for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment at an Intreo Office or online at MyWelfare.ie., they will qualify for a range of employment services and supports. It is important to note however, that some schemes offered by my Department &ndash; such as the WPEP &ndash; require an individual to have received a minimum number of qualifying payments before becoming eligible.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising the additional difficulties people with disabilities experience in securing and maintaining employment in the open labour market, my Department contracts for the provision of the EmployAbility Service to help address these challenges. Individuals, including parents returning to the work force, wishing to access the EmployAbility Service must be referred by Intreo or the Local Employment Service (LES). The individual does not have to be in receipt of a disability or illness payment to access the service. The service is open to people with disabilities including those recovering from injury or illness, that are &lsquo;job ready&rsquo; and need the support of an EmployAbility Job Coach to get a job in the open labour market. <\/p>  <p>  With regards to training and further education supports, Case Officers within Intreo can refer individuals in receipt of a qualifying payment to these opportunities. Some courses offered by the further education and training sector, including Education and Training Boards (ETBs) , may also be available to those without a qualifying payment but further details on that would be more appropriately directed to my colleague Simon Harris, T.D., Minister of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to highlight the commitments and supports set out in the Pathways to Work strategy that are specifically focused on increasing labour market participation, including, but not limited to, developing and implementing a new &lsquo;Returners&rsquo; programme. This 'Returners' programme will aim to encourage and support people who left the workforce, and have been outside of the workforce for some time, to take up employment. It is envisaged that the programmes will be of particular benefit to older workers, carers and parents, hoping to re-join the labour market. These programmes, which will be developed jointly by my Department and the Department for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, are currently scheduled to begin from Q1 2023.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600078#WRR05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Eligibility","counter":998,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600078#WRR06000"},{"type":"question","counter":999,"qnumday":404,"qnumall":"[56109\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600078#WRR06100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason 234 calendar days is not used to assess eligibility for the back to education allowance; if 234 calendar days are not being used, if 273 calendar days are being used; if so, if this can be stated clearly on the website of her Department; if it is the case that recipients of the pandemic unemployment payment automatically qualify for the back to education allowance, whereas persons who were made redundant during the Covid-19 pandemic do not; if so, the reason for same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1000,"content":"<p>The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) provides income support for jobseekers and certain others in receipt of social welfare payments who pursue courses of education at second or third level, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions. <\/p>  <p>  To qualify for BTEA, a person must be in receipt of a social welfare payment for a minimum period of 3 months if pursuing a 2nd level course, or 9 months prior to the date of commencement of their 3rd level course. <\/p>  <p>  Jobseekers who are awarded statutory redundancy may have access to the BTEA Scheme immediately on being made redundant or within one year of the award of Statutory Redundancy.

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that every eligible child can meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme and reap the benefits of quality early learning and care in any mainstream pre-school. AIM is based on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting. It does not require any diagnosis, recognising that many children do not have a diagnosis of a disability when starting pre-school. <\/p><p>AIM has seven levels of progressive support, moving from universal supports (levels 1-3) to targeted supports (levels 4-7), based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting they are attending. <\/p><p>Universal supports (Levels 1-3):<\/p><p>- Level 1, which aims to embed an inclusive culture in services, includes the national inclusion policy and guidelines for ECCE, the funding of the Leadership for Inclusion (LINC) training programme, the establishment of Inclusion Co-Ordinator (INCO) roles in ECCE settings, and a small increase in capitation of &euro;2 per registered ECCE child, for services with qualified Inclusion Co-ordinators.<\/p><p>- Level 2 involves provision of information for parents and providers on AIM, through the AIM.gov.ie website and information provided by County\/City Childcare Committees.<\/p><p>- Level 3 recognises the requirement to continue to develop a qualified workforce that can confidently meet the needs of all children participating in the ECCE programme. Supports include funding of training courses such as Hanen, L&aacute;mh and Sensory Processing E-Learning (SPEL).<\/p><p>Targeted supports (Levels 4-7):<\/p><p>- Level 4 addresses the needs of early years practitioners to have timely access to advice and support from experts in early learning and care (and disability in particular) to assist them meet each child&rsquo;s needs. This is delivered by Better Start early years specialists.<\/p><p>- Level 5 recognises that some children require specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and\/or that some early learning and care settings may require minor structural alterations to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme. Supports include grants for equipment and some minor capital building works.<\/p><p>- Level 6 provides access to therapeutic supports where they are critical to enable a child be enrolled, and fully participate, in the ECCE programme.<\/p><p>- Level 7: Additional assistance in the pre-school room involves additional capitation for service providers where an application process has demonstrated that supports Level 1-6  have not, or will not, by themselves, meet the child&rsquo;s needs. Funding can be used by the provider to buy in additional support, or reduce the staff \/ child ratio, supporting the pre-school leader to ensure the child&rsquo;s optimal participation.<\/p><p>It should be noted that targeted AIM supports are not guaranteed, as it may be found that existing supports are sufficient to ensure a child&rsquo;s meaningful participation in the ECCE programme.  More information on eligibility is in the AIM programme rules 2021\/2022, available at: aim.gov.ie\/app\/uploads\/2021\/08\/AIM-rules-2021_2022-FINAL-3.pdf  <\/p><p>In their current form, the targeted supports within AIM are exclusively tied to the ECCE pre-school programme, and so targeted supports are not available in after-school settings. Some of the universal supports within AIM, however, such as Equality, Diversity and Inclusion training, may benefit all children attending services that take part, which include some services that offer both early learning and care and school-age childcare.<\/p><p><i>First 5, the Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families<\/i>, commits to consider enhancements to, or extension of AIM, following completion of the evaluation of AIM. Such an extension might involve younger children, longer hours of availability of targeted supports, children with additional needs other than a disability, or children attending school-age childcare services. Any decisions on extension or reform of AIM will be informed by the findings of the end-of-year-three evaluation of AIM, which is currently underway, with the final report due to be published in February 2022.<\/p><p>My Department officials have contacted Pobal and Better Start Early Years&rsquo; Service, who have confirmed that the named service has not applied for any AIM universal or targeted supports, for this programme year 2021\/2022. I would recommend that the service provider contact their local Better Start Early Year&rsquo;s Specialist for information in applying for AIM supports. The turnaround time from application of AIM supports to approval, is a matter of weeks. AIM supports such as Level 1 can be applied for via the HIVE on Pobal.<\/p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been significant additional funding for services made available via the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), and this funding is still available. The EWSS covers on average 50% of normal operating costs of early learning and care services.  <\/p><p>EWSS provides wage subsidies for relevant staff members. Level 7 of AIM (additional assistance in the pre-school room) provides financial assistance to service providers that may be used to cover or subsidise the wages of specific staff members. With the introduction of EWSS, AIM rules were amended to allow the wages of an employee delivering additional assistance in the pre-school room to be supported through either the EWSS or AIM Level 7 capitation, but not both. It is open to a service provider approved for AIM Level 7 funding to choose whichever of EWSS or AIM Level 7 funding is most appropriate to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600079#WRS01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Community","counter":1013,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600079#WRS01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1014,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[55704\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600079#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he will restore the budget for a group (details supplied).","asker":"1463","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1015,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, while I have oversight of the implementation of the actions under the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS), funding is provided across a range of Government Departments to support and address the specific needs of the Traveller and Roma Communities and all of the relevant Departments have their own specific budgets.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, my own Department has provided just over &euro;4.9m to provide core funding to a number of NGOs and to progress actions under the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy.

Investment under the NDP will consist of three pillars : Modernisation, New Capacity and First 5 Initiatives. This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during the lifetime of the NDP as follows:<\/p>  <p>  (1) Modernisation: Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency. This investment will prioritise follow-up funding for buildings that were funded through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP), with funding also available for previously non-funded infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  (2) New Capacity: Ireland is approaching the limits of capacity, with shortfalls for early learning and childcare places already evident in some areas and for some cohorts. The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase.<\/p>  <p>  In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.<\/p>  <p>  (3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future. First 5 envisages a range of innovative initiatives for the early learning and childcare sector, including piloting Family and Early Childhood Centres and piloting outdoor early learning and childcare provision, piloting meal provision.

AIM is a programme of supports designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access and meaningfully participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) pre-school programme. <\/p><p>The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) is a needs-based model and, as such, does not require a formal diagnosis of disability. It should be noted that a formal diagnosis of disability does not guarantee additional supports under AIM, as it may be found that existing supports are sufficient to ensure a child&rsquo;s meaningful participation in the ECCE programme. Eligibility for AIM supports depends on the ECCE Programme rules and the AIM Policy Rules 2020\/2021. The latter is available at: <i>aim.gov.ie\/app\/uploads\/2021\/08\/AIM-rules-2021_2022-FINAL-3.pdf<\/i><\/p><p>AIM level 7 support provides additional funding to pre-schools who have a child requiring extra support. Providers can use this funding either to reduce the child-to-adult ratio in the pre-school room or to fund an extra staff member as a shared resource with other children in the ECCE setting. In its current form, the targeted supports within AIM are exclusively tied to the ECCE pre-school programme, and so targeted supports are not available in after-school settings. Some of the universal supports within AIM, however, such as Equality, Diversity and Inclusion training, may benefit all children attending services that take part, which include some services that offer both early learning and care and school-age childcare.<\/p><p><i>First 5, the Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families<\/i>, commits to consider enhancements to, or extension of AIM, following completion of the evaluation of AIM. Such an extension might involve younger children, longer hours of availability of targeted supports, children with additional needs other than a disability, or children attending school-age childcare services. Any decisions on extension or reform of AIM will be informed by the findings of the end-of-year-three evaluation of AIM, which is currently underway, with the final report due to be published in February 2022.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 has ensured an additional &euro;78 million for early learning and childcare, which will support my Department to introduce a range of new measures in 2022. Among these measures are reforms to the National Childcare Scheme (NCS). Specifically, in 2022, the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours will be discontinued. This will benefit an estimated 5,000 children from low income families. Moreover, the NCS universal subsidy &ndash; of up to &euro;1,170 per child per annum &ndash; will be extended to all children under 15, benefitting up to 40,000 children. Currently, this universal subsidy is available to children before they start the ECCE programme.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 will also allow my Department to introduce a new core funding stream from September 2022. This core funding stream &ndash; which has an estimated cost of &euro;69 million in 2022 and &euro;206.5 million in a full year &ndash; will be a payment directly to early learning and care and school-age childcare providers who sign up to participate, enabling services to better attract and retain staff, including degree-qualified staff; establish career structures; and introduce or improve other factors that contribute to high-quality provision, such as non-contact time, planning, training and curriculum implementation. In return for this investment, a commitment will be sought from providers not to increase parents&rsquo; fees.<\/p><p>In the course of these Budget negotiations, I also secured the continuation of the exemption to the turnover rule for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) for early learning and childcare employers and this support will remain in place until April 2022. <\/p><p>A one off Transition Fund of up to &euro;37million will be established by my Department to cover the period leading up to the introduction of the new funding stream (i.e. May-August 2022) that will provide the necessary resources to support early learning and care and school-age childcare services to ensure there continues to be no increases in parent&rsquo;s fees.<\/p><p>In addition to this, the 12 month review of the NCS, which I initiated in accordance with Childcare Support Act 2018, is close to completion and a report of the findings will be published shortly. I have asked my officials to accompany this report with further steps that can be taken to address any issues identified in the course of this Review &ndash; some of which are outlined in your correspondence &ndash; to ensure the NCS meets its stated policy objectives and functions in the best interests of families and children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600079#WRS05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":1052,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600079#WRS05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1053,"qnumday":423,"qnumall":"[56028\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600079#WRS05300","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the definition of an enhanced medical card; the services it will cover for those that have suffered in mother and baby homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1452","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1054,"content":"<p>As part of its response to the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation, the Government committed to establishing a Restorative Recognition Scheme for survivors of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions.

Progress toward reaching the digital skills target will be measured using the annual DESI reports.

Crime counting rules are not applied. <\/p>  <p>  Spiking a person&rsquo;s drink or spiking someone by injection are very serious offences. They are, in effect, poisoning and are criminal offences under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 that can result in a 3-year prison term.  <\/p>  <p>  Any incident of this type of crime including those with evidence to suggest a link with &lsquo;spiking&rsquo; will be investigated by either local Garda&iacute; supported by, or attached to, Divisional Proactive Services Units.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has been widely recognised as a landmark piece of legislation dealing with consent and exploitation in sexual activity. For the first time, it set out in statute what consent actually means - a free and voluntary agreement between people to engage in sexual activity.<\/p>  <p>  The 2017 Act amended the Criminal Law (Rape) Amendment Act 1990, to set out certain circumstances where consent is impossible, such as when a person is asleep or unconscious, or if they are so drunk or intoxicated that they are in no position to consider the activity and make up their mind.<\/p>  <p>  The commitment of this Government to combatting domestic, sexual and gender based violence and to supporting victims is reflected in the funding allocated under Budget 2022, with a total of &euro;13m allocated to the Department of Justice in this area. This represents an increased allocation of &euro;5.35m and will enable the roll out of specific awareness raising and training programmes to combat domestic, sexual and gender based violence. It will also provide additional supports to NGOs and specific domestic violence intervention programmes, and it will support a number of front-line activities.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has been running a three-year national awareness campaign to tackle domestic and sexual violence. The &lsquo;No Excuses&rsquo; campaign is focused on sexual harassment and sexual violence. The aim of the campaign is to intensify the public&rsquo;s awareness of sexual violence, to bring about a change in long-established societal behaviours and attitudes and to activate bystanders.

In effect, this will replace a 5 year residency requirement with a 3 year residency requirement with the requirement of one year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of application continuing to apply.<\/p><p>If enacted this provision will be applicable in cases where such children are not entitled to citizenship upon birth due to the foreign national parent&rsquo;s non-fulfilment of the current provision<i><\/i>requiring a three year reckonable residency period prior to the child&rsquo;s birth and would allow children<i><\/i>who are currently on a pathway to citizenship to attain this status at an earlier stage.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government committed to introducing new pathways to status regularisation within 18 months of its formation.

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will a psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. In relation to the school to which the Deputy refers, the NEPS North West\/North Midlands Region (Sligo Team) provides a service to this school.<\/p>  <p>  Special schools generally cater for children with the most complex needs.

There are currently 29 Irish people in receipt of ex-gratia monthly payments from the Department of Health.  The annual figure for the Irish monthly payments ranges from &euro;6,175 to &euro;13,313 for each individual.  The rate of payment is related to each survivor&rsquo;s level of thalidomide related injury.  <\/p>  <p>  The German monthly payments are made by the Contergan Foundation, which is established under German legislation.  From 1 August 2013, the Foundation substantially increased its monthly payments to thalidomide survivors, including Irish survivors.  Both the German payments and the Irish ex-gratia payments made to the survivors are exempt from tax, including DIRT and are not reckonable as means for the purpose of Social Welfare payments. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the initial lump-sum and monthly payments for life, the supports provided by the Irish State to each Irish survivor include a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of means, provision of appliances, artificial limbs, equipment, housing adaptations and access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services.  There is a designated senior manager in the Health Service Executive who liaises with Irish thalidomide survivors and assists them to access supports towards their ongoing health and personal social service needs.<\/p>  <p>  Work is underway in the Department to bring forward Heads of a Bill to provide these health and personal social supports on a statutory basis to Irish thalidomide survivors. While it is not possible at this stage to provide a timeframe for these legislative proposals, the Government is committed to the ongoing support of Irish thalidomide survivors.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the German Contergan Foundation has confirmed that since 2013 it is accepting applications from individuals for compensation for thalidomide related injury.  It is open to any Irish person to apply to the Foundation for assessment of their disability as being attributable to thalidomide.  Any Irish person who establishes that their injury is attributable to thalidomide will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government, commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600083#WRW02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive","counter":1265,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600083#WRW02925"},{"type":"question","counter":1266,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[55521\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600083#WRW02950","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount spent by the HSE in contracting debt collection agencies to pursue unpaid statutory charges in each of the years 2013 to 2020 and to date in 2021, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1267,"content":"<p>Patient charges are a key element of the overall funding envelope of the Irish health system and are taken into account when agreeing the Annual Estimates and the subsequent preparation of the HSE&rsquo;s annual National Service Plan.  <\/p><p>These charges typically include:<\/p><p>-  Out-patient charges;<\/p><p>-  In-patient charges; and<\/p><p>-  Long-term stay charges.<\/p><p>Certain cohorts of people may be exempt from some or all of these charges.<\/p><p>In addition, patients who opt for private in-patient services in public hospitals are liable for a range of private in-patient charges.

All applicants are now invited to initiate an application for registration as soon as they have submitted a complete application file to the Recognition Department.<\/p><p>This is part of a suite of innovations which have been initiated following my discussions with CORU.  Further steps underway as part of this programme for change include:<\/p><p>- Continued reorganisation of work processes to respond to the evolving working from home context (this has changed over time requiring step adjustments as the situation develops)<\/p><p>- Full transfer to an online application system<\/p><p>- Increased frequency of regulatory decision making (Registration Board meetings)<\/p><p>- Additional temporary staff resources<\/p><p>- Recruitment of additional expert assessors in &lsquo;under pressure&rsquo; professions<\/p><p>In respect of the level of online support offered to applicants CORU&rsquo;s reliance on email as its primary means of communication with applicants, CORU is aware of the inconvenience that this can cause applicants. Consequently, CORU is testing a new telephone system that will allow for improved engagement with applicants in the context of remote working.  This Voice over IP (VoIP) solution is currently being tested for external use having been trialled internally.<\/p><p>My department will continue to support CORU in achieving its strategic vision and improving timeframes for all applicants into the future.  <\/p><p>I have forwarded your query regarding a specific applicant to CORU for direct reply.

These aids and appliances are provided by the HSE through community services known as Community Funded Schemes. Each application within a Community Health Organisation for eligible persons is assessed by the local Resource Allocation Group and a determination is made regarding approval based on priority and the funding available. At times, due to the demand for resources exceeding the available capacity, waiting lists may apply for some categories of items provided through the medical and surgical aids and appliances budget in a particular Community Health Organisation. A HSE Primary Care led National Service Improvement Programme has the aim of improving the equity of access, value for money, and functional processes of the Community Funded Schemes through the establishment of national guidelines for the provision of medical and surgical aids and appliances. As the situation involving the Covid-19 pandemic improves, this Programme will gather pace.<\/p>  <p>  The Long Term Illness Scheme, established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), allows patients to receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. The conditions covered by the scheme are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge. Further information regarding these schemes is available at www2.hse.ie\/costs-schemes-allowances\/ <\/p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%. Details on how to claim are at www.revenue.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Reimbursement for medicines under the community drugs schemes is for licenced indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in Ireland. In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. <\/p>  <p>  In May 2019 the drug Ataluren (Translarna&reg;) indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene, in ambulatory patients aged 5 and older was approved by the HPRA under the high tech arrangement and is therefore included in the listing of reimbursable items. It is important to note that the medical decision to prescribe or not prescribe any treatment, for an individual patient is strictly a decision for the treating clinician, in consultation with their patient. I, as the Minister for Health, have no role in this clinical decision-making process and Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, while I make every effort to meet with as many stakeholders as possible, it is not always possible to commit to every meeting request.

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone, and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  Within the NHSS, the asset value of a resident's home, known in the Scheme as the \"principal residence\", is assessed for 3 years, with 7.5% of its value going towards the cost of care (3.75% in the case of a couple). After 3 years on the scheme, the value of this property is no longer assessed. In practice, this generally reduces the nursing home fees of those maintaining their home, from year four onwards. However, under previous rules, if it was sold, the resulting cash asset was assessable in full for the entire length of stay in care. This could act as a disincentive for those who might otherwise consider selling their homes.

The General Scheme is primarily based on the 165 recommendations of a 2015 Expert Group Review of the Act, as well as the results of a 2021 public consultation, extensive consultation with key stakeholders such as the Mental Health Commission and HSE. The General Scheme takes account of domestic legislative changes, including the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018, and Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations, including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p>The Department of Health will work with the Office of the Attorney General to prepare the final Bill in line with the General Scheme. Pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill by the Sub-Committee on Mental Health commenced on 2<sup>nd<\/sup>November 2021.<\/p><p>The Department has included a statutory right to engage an advocate under numerous heads of the General Scheme, including a definition of advocate under Section 2, information on advocacy to be provided to people in approved inpatient facilities under Section 16, 79 and 91, access to an advocate during a review board under Section 16B, during inquiries carried out by the Inspector under Section 55, or when making decisions about treatment under Sections 56 and 104. <\/p><p>The HSE currently provides some advocacy supports, including a Peer Advocacy Service in mental health which costs approximately &euro;800,000 per annum. This service is concentrated on inpatient services and is delivered by an external agency on behalf of the HSE. <\/p><p>The HSE has estimated that the cost of extending a minimal advocacy service to all adult mental health community services, as well as inpatient units, would cost in the region of an additional &euro;600,000, depending on the model used.<\/p><p>In addition to adult advocacy services, HSE National Mental Health Services currently provide an advocacy service through an external provider for young people and their families using Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Currently the CAMHS advocacy service is provided in two of our inpatient units at a cost of &euro;80,000 per annum. This cost also covers some community advocacy in CHO2. To provide a baseline national CAMHS Advocacy service for both inpatient and community child and adolescent mental health services would cost approximately &euro;240,000 per annum.<\/p><p>Therefore, based on the above, the full estimated cost of providing a National Advocacy Service for both adult and child mental health services would be in the region of &euro;1.64 million per annum. It is important to note that this is a broad estimate and all expanded or new services would be subject to current contract arrangements, procurement rules and HSE National Financial Regulations.<\/p><p>The National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities (NAS) provides a free, confidential service to people with mental health difficulties, particularly people with complex needs. NAS is funded and supported by the Citizens Information Board, which has a mandate under the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the Comhairle Act 2000 to provide advocacy for persons with disabilities. <\/p><p>Sage Advocacy also provides some advocacy support to people with mental health difficulties, particularly older people, in their role in supporting and enabling vulnerable adults and older people to make their voices heard in their healthcare decisions.<\/p><p>Access to advocacy supports forms part of Sharing the Vision, our national mental health policy, and the right to consult an advocate will be included in the updated Mental Health Act. While advocacy supports are currently available through the HSE and other actors, such as Sage Advocacy and the NAS, the Department recognises that services will need to expand in order to reach all people accessing mental health services, be that on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Discussions on how advocacy supports for people accessing outpatient mental health services will continue in the context of the implementation of Sharing the Vision. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600086#WRZ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"question","counter":1464,"qnumday":561,"qnumall":"[55738\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600086#WRZ04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the breakdown of the &euro;7.65 million of revenue funding and &euro;6 million of once-off funding allocated to purchasing additional capacity for mental health services; the amount spent to date; the breakdown of services provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1465,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600086#WRZ04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Services","counter":1466,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600086#WRZ04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1467,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[55745\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600086#WRZ04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will commit to fulfilling the three year review of abortion legislation by 1 January 2022 as set out under section 7 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018; the length of time he plans to leave open the period of public consultation during this process; his views on whether this period will be sufficient time to receive and reflect upon submissions adequately before the full report is submitted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1468,"qnumday":612,"qnumall":"[55958\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600086#WRZ04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the details of the review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 which is due to take not later than three years after its commencement under section 7 of the Act; the format the review will take; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1469,"qnumday":630,"qnumall":"[56032\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600086#WRZ04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the person appointed as the independent expert to lead the abortion legislation review; when consultation with service users and providers will begin; when public consultation will begin; if the review will be completed by 1 January 2022 as per section 7 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1470,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 562, 612 and 630 together.<\/p><p>The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 was signed into law on 20 December 2018 and commenced on 1 January 2019.

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.<\/p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p><p>On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack.<\/p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.<\/p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p><p>Details regarding the the number of persons waiting to see a consultant paediatric maxillofacial surgeon at South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital are set out in the link.<\/p><p>\">Waiting Times<\/p><p>The NTPF has advised that the health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times. In particular, the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected. The NTPF collects data on patients currently on the waiting list and the average time that these patients have been waiting is provided here. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600087#WRAA04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":1528,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600087#WRAA04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1529,"qnumday":583,"qnumall":"[55781\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600087#WRAA04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of vacancies by job title in the children's disability network teams in CHO1;

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p><p>In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p><p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p><p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p><p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p><p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p><p>My Department has asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:<\/p><p>- girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and<\/p><p>- women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.<\/p><p>If NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600088#WRBB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1570,"qnumday":598,"qnumall":"[55865\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600088#WRBB03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the regional take up of the HPV vaccination programme for each year since it first rolled out for schoolgoing girls and later boys by percentage and numbers.

As such, definitive publication and updates on outturn costs cannot be provided. However, updates on progress have been shared with key, relevant stakeholders, as appropriate, noting among other things that:  &lsquo;Topping out&rsquo; at the main hospital building at Rialto was achieved last March, the stone and glazed facade is well advanced and the hospital is expected to be largely weathertight before the end of the year, and the main mechanical and electrical plant at basement level is nearing completion, with the primary distribution under construction up the building. The fit out of the south fingers comprising Outpatients, Cardiology Wards, and Therapies is progressing well, and the fit out of the &lsquo;Hot Block&rsquo; comprising Emergency Department, Critical Care and Theatres is well underway. <\/p>  <p>  Construction work at the paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Tallaght University Hospital was also recently substantially completed in line with the contractor's schedule and the facility was open on 15 November 2021, following a period of operational commissioning.<\/p>  <p>  Building on this progress, the NPHDB and the main contractor are working to do everything they can in order to complete the project as quickly and efficiently as possible. However, this contract is operating in a very dynamic construction environment, one where Brexit and the global COVID-19 pandemic have severely impacted supply chains and material lead times. The NCH project is not immune to these external risks. However, every effort is being taken to mitigate risks, wherever possible.

It is also an inter-generational issue, as some families and children are caught in a cycle of parental drug use, addiction, trauma and hidden harm.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health will shortly announce funding of &euro;1m to increase access to and the provision of community-based drug and alcohol services.

The lead party in an application must be a State funded body.<\/p><p>The Fund seeks applications under two categories. Category 1 relates to large scale ambitious capital projects with all necessary planning and other consents in place and which are ready to proceed.  The minimum request from the Fund for Category 1 projects is &euro;500,000.  Category 2 relates to detailed project development and enabling initiatives to reach Category 1 readiness.  There is no minimum request for funding for Category 2 projects.<\/p><p>The application process for proposals under the Fund is competitive in nature.  Applications are assessed by my Department under the oversight of the Project Advisory Board, comprised of representatives from key Government Departments and independent experts.  Once the assessment process is complete, my Department submits a report to me setting out projects which have emerged from the assessment process as suitable to be recommended for funding.I then consider that report and make the final decision in relation to the allocation of funding.<\/p><p>It is important to note that success in Category 2 calls relates only to securing grant funding for the cost of project development.  It does not follow that any proposal which is successful in any Category 2 call will automatically be in line for funding under future Category 1 calls.  Category 2 projects which are progressed to Category 1 readiness will be subject to a competitive application process under future calls.  Proposals invited under Category 1 calls are not required to have previously received Category 2 funding.  <\/p><p>The third call for Category 2 applications closed on the 30<sup>th<\/sup>July 2021 and I expect to be in a position to announce the successful applications before the end of the year.  The fourth call for Category 1 applications will also be announced before the end of 2021.<\/p><p>Tables outlining the funding awarded under both Categories are set out at the following links.<\/p><p><ahref=\"https:\/\/data.oireachtas.ie\/ie\/oireachtas\/debates\/questions\/supportingDocumentation\/2021-11-16_pq695-696-16-11-21_en.pdf \">Successful Projects Category A<\/p><p><ahref=\"https:\/\/data.oireachtas.ie\/ie\/oireachtas\/debates\/questions\/supportingDocumentation\/2021-11-16_pq695-696a-16-11-21_en.pdf \">Successful Projects Category B<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111600093#WRGG02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1856,"content":"<p>Question No. 696 answered with Question No. 695.<\/p>"}]
