We are both from coastal areas and realise the importance of the fishing fleet to coastal and rural communities.  The figures in my area are stark.  There has been a significant contraction in the Ros a' Mh&iacute;l offshore fishing fleet since 2003, with it more than halving at an unprecedented and alarming rate.  Fifteen boats have been extracted from the fleet, ten of which were owned by people from the Aran Islands.  Currently, nine Ros a' Mh&iacute;l and Aran offshore fishing boats are licensed.  One is not fishing and seven are owned and skippered by Inishmore fishermen.<\/p> <p>The contraction is particularly alarming for the Ros a' Mh&iacute;l Harbour area, which was the subject of an independent technical report commissioned in 2013 and undertaken by the Ros a' Mh&iacute;l Harbour centre, entitled A Socio-economic Profile of Ireland's Fishing Communities.  It stated that, in terms of the number of boat owners per thousand of population, fishing was approximately 20 times more important to the local economy than to Ireland as a whole.  A 2016 report on the harbour calculated that 92% of annual economic turnover in the Ros a' Mh&iacute;l area relied on the seafood sector.<\/p> <p>At least &euro;22 million was spent on Ros a' Mh&iacute;l Harbour between 2004 and 2014.  Therefore, the contraction of the fleet raises serious questions about the future return on the State's investment and the need to ensure a vibrant fishing community in the area.<\/p> <p>I welcome the review of the management of the fleet's capacity and the tonnage that is available to boats.  A number of issues arise in this regard and fall into two categories - the safety of the boats in question and the viability of the fishermen's businesses.  The number of fatalities and sinkings in the past 20 years is shocking.  According to figures with which I have been supplied, there have been 40 sinkings and 30 fatalities in that time.  Given that the majority of those fishing vessels were under 40 m in length, smaller vessels seem to be more prone to sinking and fatalities.  When one breaks down the figures, a high percentage of the boats that sink are wooden and tend to be older vessels.<\/p> <p>There are issues that need to be addressed and we must ensure all fishermen are as safe and remain as viable as possible.  If that means they must upgrade their boats, the technicalities around tonnage and so on need to be addressed and the Department should not stand in the way.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I appreciate that is the purpose of the review, but it needs to be progressed as quickly as possible, as stated by the Minister a number of months ago when he set the review in train.

As Minister, I have responsibility for policy in relation to sea-fishing boat licensing under section 3(3) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, as amended by section 99 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  In this context, and as referred to, section 3 of the 2003 Act makes provision for ministerial policy directives to issues to the independent licensing authority for sea-fishing boats.  I am, however, precluded from exercising any power or control in regard to individual cases or a group of cases with which the licensing authority is or may be concerned under section 3(5) of the 2003 Act.  <\/p><p>I received proposals from a producer organisation, which, in summary, relate to the possibility of reducing the requirement to provide 100% replacement capacity with the relevant track record to 80%, the balance being sourced from capacity without track record.  The producer organisation subsequently clarified that this request covered all aspects of fleet policy and replacement capacity policy, including flexibility between segments of the fishing fleet, flexibility between sub-segments and flexibility in regard to fishing effort relating to cod recovery for area VIa and area VIIa, and scallop effort.<\/p><p>Separately, another producer organisation has regularly raised the issue of a review of the effort regime in place for vessels in the RSW pelagic section of the fleet.  I undertook a public consultation process on these proposals and made available a consultation paper which set out the background to fleet policy and carried out an analysis of the current situation.  The consultation paper examined the implications of the proposals made by the producer organisations and also put forward alternative options.  This consultation concluded on 28 February 2017 and 26 submissions were received, seven from industry representatives and 19 from individuals or companies.  A number of respondents supported the <i>status quo<\/i>and are opposed to any change in the current replacement capacity requirements.  Some expressed concern that a change could result in an increase in the value of capacity and others are concerned about the impact on vessels of certain sizes.  Others support the proposal of the producer organisation regarding the 100% capacity requirement, indicating, <i>inter alia<\/i>, that it would allow for upgrading of vessels for enhanced safety and efficiency while some respondents support some degree of flexibility with regard to replacement capacity but are not in favour of that specific proposal.  A smaller number of respondents commented on the RSW pelagic effort regime proposal.  Differing views were also expressed regarding a potential alternative option put forward in the consultation paper, that is, that polyvalent vessels to be licensed in the tiered - mackerel - and-or ringfenced - herring - portions would be able to source up to 10% of the required replacement capacity from non-tiered and non-ringfenced vessels in the same sub-segment at a ratio of 4:1. <\/p><p>The Senator will appreciate that diverse views have been expressed in the context of the consultation process, particularly on the proposal of the producer organisation regarding the 100% capacity requirement.  All submissions are currently being examined in detail and they are now available to view on my Department's website.  I will carefully consider, following any further analysis needed, the case for amendments to current licensing policy taking into account the submissions received.  I will have my conclusions published on my Department's website at the earliest possible date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#C00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's response, particularly that the submissions can be viewed on the Department's website.<\/p> <p>Since 2011, the Department has been made aware of these issues.

Many public representatives are concerned we are living in a city full of what are in effect tinder boxes and that fire regulations need to be strengthened or reflected upon.  The fire safety of buildings constructed in the past 20 years is raising much concern for residents and their representatives.<\/p> <p>There is a particular difficulty in that when questions are raised about the fire safety of houses or an apartment block in an individual estate, there is a reluctance among residents to use the normal engagement process with their public representatives, with councils or with the media because they are terrified the value of their properties will collapse.  They are stuck in a bind of wanting to do something about the fire safety concerns around the places in which they live.  They are also worried that the obvious resolution mechanisms they would normally go through are closed off from them because they do not want hurt the value of their properties.  This is completely understandable.<\/p> <p>We are coming to the conclusion that we need a dedicated agency where people can make confidential reports about fire safety concerns.  In turn, these can be dealt with on a confidential basis to bypass this issue about the value of properties being undermined.  In many of these cases, the issues can be rectified without any reputational damage to the properties in question as well as the significant investment people have made in them.  The last thing we need is where people make a determination about the value of their property versus the value of their lives and those of their families, taking a risk their home will never go on fire.  We cannot have them deciding that, because the mortgage on the property is so huge and debilitating to their quality of life, they take a risk on the property&rsquo;s fire safety.<\/p> <p>This is an issue that has been going during the lifetime of for several Governments.

I am anxious to know what the report contains.<\/p><p>This matter relates to the overall general standard of fire safety throughout the country.  Fire safety is the responsibility of the local authorities, but the level of resources varies from council to council.  The responses of councils also vary.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to oversee this issue and ensure that there is a mechanism in place whereby people can raise their concerns and by means of which we can conduct an effective audit of all construction carried out in the past 20 years, when regulations were not as tightly controlled in respect of dwellings where people's lives are at risk.  We all know of individual apartment blocks in our localities and constituencies that are fire hazards.  The risks exist but the residents are terrified of raising concerns about them lest the value of their properties collapses.<\/p><p>I appreciate the Leas-Chathaoirleach's patience in allowing me to put my point of view.

As he has outlined, it is a serious issue.<\/p> <p>The Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014 set out a clear statutory framework for construction activity.  The 1990 Act provides for the making of building regulations and building control regulations to protect the health, safety and welfare of people in and around buildings.  The Second Schedule of the Building Regulations 1997, as amended, sets out the statutory minimum performance requirements for the construction of new buildings.  In particular, Part B of the Building Regulations 1997, as amended, sets out the legal requirements relating to fire safety in respect of new buildings and in respect of existing buildings undergoing works involving an extension, material alteration or a material change of use.  The requirements under Part B represent the national statutory minimum standards of fire safety provision applicable to the construction of new buildings, including dwellings.<\/p> <p>Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the building regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings.  Enforcement of the building regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, which have extensive powers of inspection and investigation under the Acts.  Fire authorities have no powers of inspection in respect of dwelling houses occupied as single dwellings.  The Fire Services Acts 1981 to 2003, however, apply to premises providing sleeping accommodation, that is, apartments.  Furthermore, section 18(2) of the Fire Services Act places the responsibility for fire safety on the person or persons having control over the premises, which in the case of an apartment block includes the owners and management companies.  This is appropriate in a situation where there are some 2 million housing units in the State.<\/p> <p>In response to building failures that have emerged over the past decade, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, which provide for greater accountability regarding compliance with building regulations, in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.  The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 were reviewed following their first 12 months in operation and it is clear from this review that the reforms have brought a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects.  To complement these reforms, work is at an advanced stage in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government on the general scheme of a Bill to place the Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, on a statutory footing and to provide in law for the registration of builders.  This is seen as an essential consumer protection measure giving consumers who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.<\/p> <p>One of the two proposals outlined by the Senator relates to a dedicated agency for making confidential reports.  My understanding of what he suggested is that this agency would also conduct an audit of buildings constructed in the past 20 years.  Perhaps he will clarify that.  As regards the report in the Department, I have not had an opportunity to speak to the Minister about it but I will ask him about the status of the report and when and how it will be made public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#E00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I have with me a response to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Clare Daly on 22 June 2016.

It is exactly the same as the reply in June 2016, almost one year ago.  Without any disrespect to the Minister of State, it appears that the Department has not moved on very much in a year, particularly in view of the fact that it has provided - word for word - the same response.

The person would make this confidential request to the Department which would then conduct an audit.  However, a more robust audit has to be carried out nationally and must not be dependent on councils.  Either that or we must demand that councils conduct these audits because otherwise cases will continue to arise throughout the country.  It will take until the fire actually happens because although residents are concerned by fire safety, they are restricted by their concern for the value of their properties and worry over reputational damage.  I am not trying to have a political go on the response given to me.  I understand what happens here, that cut-and-paste jobs are done all the time for ministerial responses, but we cannot wait for another estate or apartment block to go on fire.

A few years ago, when I was in India on St. Patrick's Day to represent the Government, I was informed by the Indian people there that the only reason they had heard of Ireland was because of cricket and our having beaten Pakistan, so the power of this particular sport to promote our country abroad should not be underestimated.<\/p><p>These planned facilities are located beside Lusk soccer club with 19 teams and 325 playing members and rising, Round Towers GAA club with 600 members and growing, Rush and Lusk Educate Together national school, with 420 pupils, Lusk community college, now at 350 pupils but with a new extension planned for later in the year which will bring it to 1,000 pupils, and Lusk national school with 850 pupils and new classrooms under construction.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Three Government cranes dominate the skyline of Lusk at the moment and we expect a fourth later in the year.<\/p><p>The population of this area was around 500 to 700 when I started in practice many years ago.  It was 7,000 in 2011 and has now grown to 10,000.  It is expected to grow to 12,500 in the coming years.  As the Minister knows, it has excellent bus and rail links and is in proximity to Dublin, Dublin Airport and Swords.  It is an attractive place to live and to start a home and young family.  Therefore, the demand for these facilities will continue to grow.<\/p><p>In short I have two requests of the Minister.  First, I ask him to consider communicating with Fingal County Council to encourage it to continue to press for the release of these promised open-space lands from the developer, as per the planning permissions granted and the master plan for the area.  I commend and acknowledge the determination and commitment of all the volunteers from all the Lusk clubs who have campaigned and engaged in planning this excellent sports facility.  The Lusk sports hub committee has lobbied Fingal county councillors, including Councillor Tom O'Leary, to get this key strategic open-space land made available to the community as soon as possible.  In fairness, I understand the process is nearing completion but a ministerial letter might just give it the push towards completion it needs.<\/p><p>Second, taking into account the well thought out, future-proof plan for sports facilities for Lusk the sports hub group has produced in conjunction with the community and Fingal County Council, I ask the Minister to favourably consider assisting the Lusk community sports hub group and Fingal County Council in funding this excellent plan, which seems to be a very fine example of best practice in community sports development and planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#F00400","speaker":"1421","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this very important matter.  I will certainly try to address those two specific questions in a few minutes, probably in the second part of my reply, after he has responded to what I have to say.<\/p> <p>In respect of securing lands required for the sports facilities set out in the Lusk 2020 sports plan, as the Senator knows and has acknowledged, this is obviously primarily a matter for Fingal County Council.  I understand, however, that the council is at an advanced stage of taking the land bank referred to into charge and I look forward to being kept informed of progress made. <\/p> <p>On the Government's role in the provision of sports facilities, the sports capital programme, as administered by my Department, is the Government's primary vehicle to support the development of sports facilities and the purchase of sports equipment.  It aims to foster an integrated approach to developing sports and physical recreation facilities throughout the country.  The programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improvements in the quality and quantity of sports facilities in virtually every village, town and city.<\/p> <p>We are committed to ensuring this progress continues and on 21 December 2016 it was announced that &euro;30 million was being made available under the 2017 sports capital programme.  The application process was open from 23 January to 24 February.  By the closing date, a record 2,320 applications had been received.  All applications are currently being assessed with allocations expected later this year.  I understand a number of applications have been received from the Lusk area.  More generally, the sports capital programme has already invested heavily in facilities in Dublin with &euro;34 million provided for sports infrastructure and equipment since 2011.  Fingal County Council itself has benefitted from almost &euro;1.3 million in grants in the same period.  This is separate to the substantial funding many sports clubs in Fingal have drawn down from their own developments.  Furthermore, a number of clubs associated with the Lusk 2020 sports plan have benefitted from funding under recent rounds of the programme.  <\/p> <p>The programme for Government contains the aim of allocating sports capital grants annually in future.  My Department is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about how best to implement this commitment.  In this regard, once the necessary land for the Lusk proposal is in council ownership, it can apply for sports capital programme funding for any suitable project under future rounds of the programme.<\/p> <p>Regarding the Government's policy for funding of sports facilities in the future, last November the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, and I launched a major consultation process for the development of a new national sports policy framework.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The examination of responses received is being finalised and we expect to present the framework to Government before the summer recess.  Several key challenges will be addressed in the framework, with the overriding principle being the investigation of how to increase the number of people participating in sport and physical activity.  All people, regardless of their age, gender or ability, should be able to participate in sport.  The new framework will consider how best to ensure access to facilities nationally, regionally and locally.  The new framework will also consider how programmes and initiatives can be developed in tandem with newly-constructed facilities to connect with traditionally non-participant groups.  The framework also considers how local authorities could play an enhanced role in getting people involved in sport.  It is pleasing, therefore, that the overall objectives of the Lusk 2020 plan are in accordance with these principles.<\/p><p>In terms of the funding of sports facilities, I mentioned the aim of running the sports capital grant programme annually.  Furthermore, as part of my Department's submission to the mid-term review of the capital plan, additional funding has been sought for large-scale sports infrastructure.  If the additional funding is received, it will allow consideration of the funding of large facilities requiring more than the maximum amount available under the sports capital programme.  It would be open to all local authorities, including Fingal County Council, to submit applications under the terms that will apply.  I reiterate the Government's commitment to improving the stock of sports facilities throughout the country.  The Lusk 2020 plan is welcome, particularly in terms of setting out how a local community and relevant local authority can work together to get more people to participate in sport.  As the council advances the project, my Department will consider any applications for capital funding from the council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#G00200","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

I also welcome that the Department will consider the application for capital funding.<\/p><p>We have an opportunity to buck the former trend for houses to be built in an area, followed by roads and, latterly, facilities.  We have an opportunity.  We know that Lusk will grow and that there is a housing issue.  We know that a place such as Lusk, which is in central Fingal, will be the site of further development.  Facilities should be built in anticipation of housing development.  The facilities are needed now but will be needed even more in the future.<\/p><p>As Members know, this is the month of mental health awareness.

Outdoor exercise, healthy competition, learning about teamwork and the value of volunteerism are all embodied in this worthwhile project.  I call on the Minister to facilitate it.  He could play a pivotal role were he to accede to my two requests.  He has indicated that the second of my requests will be considered by the Department.  In terms of my first, if the Minister were to write a letter encouraging Fingal County Coucil to acquire these lands from the developer - who has agreed as part of planning permission to hand them over - it would give great heart to the many people in Lusk who have worked very hard to make this plan a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#H00200","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>The case being made by the Senator is very powerful and compelling.

While I was pleased to receive a comprehensive account regarding some public transport projects being funded from the Exchequer capital transport envelope, I am disappointed it is proving difficult to draw a clear line between investment in the greater Dublin area and the rest of the country, specifically Cork city and county.  The most recent figures from the Central Statistics Office indicate that 44% of the State's total urban population lives in Dublin.  We must also remember, however, that 11% of the population lives in Cork city and the recent census indicated the city's population had increased by 5.4%.  In addition, 37% of the population of the State lives in rural areas.  The population of Cork county showed one of the largest increases in population in the country.  The percentage population growth in Cork city and county is comparable with growth in any of the local authority areas in greater Dublin, with the exception of Fingal.<\/p> <p>My independent colleagues in Cork city and county councils, in particular, Councillor Marcia D'Alton, inform me that in the recent joint submission to the national planning framework, Cork 2050, the councils identified a sustainable transport network to underpin spatial, social and economic expansion as being of critical importance.  The councils believe the transport network should facilitate the prioritisation of public transport, walking and cycling.  The joint councils correctly identified Cork city and county as a complementary location to Dublin with strong international connections and as a primary driver of economic and population growth in the southern region.  While the councils are working hard to achieve these goals, how can their plan be progressed if essential figures on a breakdown of capital transport expenditure are not readily available, particularly when this is such an important part of A Programme for a Partnership Government and the strategic investment framework for land transport?<\/p> <p>I am disappointed and bewildered that while the Government is in the process of undertaking a mid-term review of the infrastructure and capital programme, the figures for projects in cities and regions outside Dublin are not readily available.  Without such information, we are to assume that most of the investment is being directed either towards the greater Dublin area or, failing that, towards other metropolitan areas and is not being quantified.  Either scenario is a disaster for citizens, elected representatives, planners and businesses.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for his time and hope his Department or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be able to throw some light on this issue for me and independent councillors, particularly in the Cork city and country area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#J00300","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell for raising this important matter, particularly in respect of Cork city and county, and for the opportunity to address the House on the issue.  As the Senator pointed out, funding of &euro;3.6 billion has been allocated for public transport in the Government's capital plan.  The funding for the transport elements of the plan is for a seven-year period from 2016 to 2022.  The focus of this investment, particularly in the early years of the capital plan, is on achieving essential steady-state maintenance of our existing public transport network, particularly the heavy rail network, throughout the country to ensure it remains safe and fit for purpose.<\/p> <p>From time to time, a misunderstanding arises that there is a vast sum of money available to develop motorways countrywide.  As the Senator will be aware, we are still struggling to maintain the roads at current standards and even this will not be fully possible for another year or two.  Expenditure on new roads or motorways will result in reduced funding for other projects meaning other roads will suffer.  From 2019 onwards, however, we will spend much more on new infrastructure.  While I accept that is a long time to wait, that is the financial reality.<\/p> <p>In recent correspondence to the Senator, I provided an overview of how the &euro;3.6 billion allocation for public transport will be spent.  As I outlined, it is not possible to draw a clear line between investments in the greater Dublin area and outside the area in all cases.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For example, the funding of approximately &euro;1.3 billion allocated in the capital plan for the maintenance of the heavy rail network, which is more than one third of the total funding available for public transport, will benefit all areas of the heavy rail network within and outside the greater Dublin area.<\/p><p>The Senator specifically requested details of the funding available for capital investment in Cork city and county.  I will outline recent and planned investment in public transport in Cork.  Funding is provided under the capital plan for sustainable transport projects and accessibility programmes in the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  These programmes are administered by the National Transport Authority.  Over &euro;70 million has been allocated over the period of the capital plan for sustainable projects in the regional cities and for accessibility programmes.  Between 2014 and 2016, more than &euro;15 million was allocated to Cork city and county councils under the regional cities and accessibility programmes.  Over the remaining years of the capital plan, it is anticipated that public transport investment in the Cork metropolitan area will represent a continuation of the current focus of the investment programme.<\/p><p>In the case of the Cork City Council area, this investment has been focused on the implementation of the city centre movement strategy on a number of radially-based strategy transport corridors linking the city centre with the city suburbs and county environs.  The principal objective of the city centre movement strategy is to improve access to the city centre through the reallocation of road space, leading to an improvement in the environment for public transport vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists.  The overall city centre movement strategy was approved by the city council and phases 1 and 2 are already at construction stage in 2017.<\/p><p>The full strategy includes a further six phases and these are intended for implementation over the coming years.  Three strategic corridor studies were completed with funding provided between 2013 and 2017.  These focused on the south east, south west, south central and north sides of the city.  The purpose of these studies is to inform the development of a high-quality core bus network and improve walking and cycling links over time, complementing the objectives of the city centre movement strategy.  Several schemes have already been progressed in Mahon.  The intention is to continue on this basis with further schemes being progressed on corridors in the south east, south west and north city areas over the coming years.<\/p><p>In the case of the Cork county metropolitan area, the regional cities investment programme will continue to be focused on the Douglas area based on the recommendations of the Douglas land use and transportation study.  The principal objectives of that study are to reduce congestion, improve local connectivity by sustainable transport modes and improve the performance of the many bus services operating through the area.  The aim is to complement the transport investment in the city centre and strategic corridors.<\/p><p>The Senator will be aware that a mid-term review of the capital plan is currently under way.  I will be seeking to significantly improve the funding available for public transport over the remaining years of the plan to meet increasing demand, to tackle congestion in the greater Dublin area and our regional cities, including Cork in particular, as well as to help to deliver on meeting our climate obligations by reducing emissions from the transport sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#J00400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer.

The huntingtin gene was identified by a Galway-born doctor Professor Michael Conneally in 1993 in the United States.  I wish the folk who are travelling to Rome the very best on Thursday.  I should mention that 18 May is also the birthday of John Bruton.  I thought that might be useful to know.  It was also the date of birth of a former Pope, namely, Pope John Paul II.  Huntington's disease is a difficult condition.  Many people have the huntingtin gene and a great many people live with the possibility of the condition.  When it hits, Huntington's disease has a significant effect on families because it happens at a time when people are in young adulthood.

I seek leave to amend the Order of Business to table the Order for Second Stage for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill 2017.<\/p> <p>I raise with the Leader the issue of the ongoing Garda controversy and question marks over the tenure of the Garda Commissioner, senior Garda management and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  To bring it down to street level, while great emphasis has been put on this controversy, the Garda is dealing with ongoing community issues daily.  In fairness to the Taoiseach, when the north inner city was in the media spotlight for violent crime, he made a significant commitment to engaging with the community and established a commission to report on the situation.  The Taoiseach was very well received, as was the commission report by Mr. Kieran Mulvey.  I ask the Leader to update Members on that report.  These issues have faded from the public eye but people still live in these communities.  I was a school principal in that area and taught in that community for 11 years.  It should not take a killing, a feud or criminal activity for us to notice what is happening in the north inner city.  It is a vibrant community.  A lot is going on there but the implementation of this report will be very important.  While the headlines and the political comings and goings around the Garda Commissioner and other Garda issues in the public domain are very important, garda&iacute; on the ground are doing their best to police a vibrant community in an area which faces major challenges.  The commission report needs to be implemented.  The chairmanship of that report is I believe still to be determined.  <\/p> <p>May I pay a tribute to the Taoiseach?  The Taoiseach visited my local GAA club, Scoil U&iacute; Chonaill GAA club on the Clontarf Road, which is attended by a significant number of children from the north inner city.  He was incredibly well received and to be honest he really was very engaged with the children, the club members and what was happening in that club, which does a great deal of work.  In fairness, nobody on our side of the House wishes to question his commitment to dealing with what was happening in the north inner city but at this juncture, it is important for us to see the implementation of the findings of that report.  We cannot really wait for the next shooting, the next episode of gangland violence or the next headline before that debate happens in this House.  It is at this stage, while we are in a period in which there is relative calm and people are getting on with their lives and want to go to the next level, that we should start talking the rebuilding of communities in that proud area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#Q00200","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>May I clarify the Senator is requesting that No. 16 be taken before No. 1?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#Q00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#Q00400","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>That can be seconded later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#Q00500","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I wish to raise an issue that appeared on the front page of yesterday's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>to the effect that there were 10,000 complaints of anti-social behaviour to local authorities nationwide over a two-year period.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In that two-year time period only 12 evictions arose.

As we are now 13 years on, we now need to ascertain if that legislation is adequate.

The ECJ's ruling is clear: in any investor-state dispute mechanism, which are the corporate courts that the House has debated, ratification by all member states is required.  This important ruling vindicates to some extent the stand that the House has taken.  The European Commission told us that it has exclusive competence in this area, but it was wrong.  It also told us that the comprehensive economic and trade agreement, CETA, between Canada and Europe was entirely legal in EU law.  However, we will not know that until it has been tested before the ECJ.  The court made clear that today's ruling merely relates to who has the competence to agree and that it does not deal with the question of legality, which will be dealt with by means of separate process.  Under Article 218.11 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union, Ireland has the power to refer CETA to the ECJ at any time so that a ruling can be made.  I hope that someone does refer it so that we can make decisions about ratification that are fully informed by the ECJ.<\/p> <p>In the meantime, Ireland will need to decide on whether we want to move the extra step from provisional application, which contains all of the benefits of tariffs and so forth that we have heard about at length, to ratification and bring upon ourselves investor-state dispute mechanisms.

We should take a leaf out of Norway's book in this regard.  It has been implementing incentives for 25 years, so it will not happen overnight in Ireland, but according to the latest figures, 37% of new cars bought in Norway last January were electric.  This represents the highest rate of electric vehicle adoption globally.  In Ireland in 2008, we had an ambition of 200,000 electric cars over the course of ten to 15 years.  To date, however, only 2,000 electric vehicles are on the road despite the infrastructure having been put in place.  Those who purchase electric and hybrid vehicles in Ireland pay a lower rate of VRT, but Norway has many other incentives than this such as, for example, paying no VAT on new cars, free parking in public car parks, driving in bus lanes, free access to toll roads, free road ferries and lower annual road taxes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the 25 years Norway has been working on this, the number of electric cars there has reached almost 50%.

When a person raises the issue of anti-social behaviour on the part of a neighbour with a local authority, he or she is asked to either keep a record of what is happening or to lodge an official complaint against the neighbour.

The Government is committed to a multi-campus provision in all institutes of technology.  As Senator O'Mahony rightly said, there has been engagement with GMIT in a genuine attempt to make the institute economically sound and put it on a firm financial footing.  An independent adviser has been appointed and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has established a working group with the aim of putting together a sustainable plan for the future development of the Castlebar campus.  It is important that we allow that work to be done and brought to a conclusion.  The HEA has already made it clear that it is committed to this and the Minister and the Government have a whole-of- government approach to that commitment.  The working group's report should be submitted at some point during this quarter.  I am happy for the group to be allowed to do its work.  We must all ensure that there is a strong GMIT presence.  <\/p> <p>Senator Dolan raised the issue of Huntingdon's disease.  He mentioned that Pope Francis is hosting a gathering of people with Huntingdon's, the first such meeting with a pontiff, which I think is on tomorrow.  I commend the people from Ireland who are travelling.  I know from my time as Chairman of the Oireachtas committee on health when we held hearings on issues relating to rare diseases, of which Huntingdon's was one, that approximately 750 of our fellow citizens have Huntingdon's disease.  It is a rare disease and one for which we need to develop a strategy and an all-Ireland approach.  I would be very happy to work with the Senator on that issue.  I also join him in wishing former Taoiseach, John Bruton, a happy birthday on Thursday.    <\/p> <p>I am happy to take on board Senator &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in's amendment to the Order of Business.  He raised the issue of the inner city and the Mulvey report and I join him in commending the people of the inner city and that community.  He is right that it must not be about gangland crime or the reaction to an event, such as a death or shooting, but about an investment in people and in the community.  As someone who has spent a lot of time working with communities and developing them, it is important that, as a Government and as a country, we invest in people.  I am confident the Mulvey plan, which is a three-year plan of action, will be driven not only by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, but also by all the stakeholders, including education, community, voluntary and sporting groups.  The Senator is right that it is about people making communities, and the Government must deliver and implement that plan.  There is a commitment to reopen Fitzgibbon Street Garda station and money has been ring-fenced but I share the Senator's view that there must be staging posts along to the way on the points he raised.  I would be happy for the Minister or the Taoiseach to come to the House to discuss this issue.  <\/p> <p>Senator Burke and Senator Murnane-O'Connor raised the issue of anti-social behaviour and the lack of implementation.  I am open to correction, but I think the Senator is incorrect and that there is legislation on this matter.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important that we allow for city and county councils to take action, if needed, in respect of people who are involved------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#X01200","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":155,"content":"<p>The legislation is not working because people are afraid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#Y00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":156,"content":"<p>It is about fear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#Y00300","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>The Senator should raise that matter tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#Y00400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I am not quite sure it is about fear.

As Senator Feighan says, the normalisation of his encounter with the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy Gerry Adams, and other groups around the country makes it all the better.  It is through high-profile events such as this that we can see that the relationship with the British royal family has been normalised.  I commend Senator Feighan for his work on promoting relations between the North and the South and also between Ireland and the UK.  He has been a prolific member of committees, as has the Cathaoirleach.

This is evident from the increased number of Senators seconding Private Members' Bills, the business group that discusses the business of the House and the broad-minded way in which I approach issues, although some Sinn F&eacute;in Members may not agree with that last point.

We consulted widely on the strategy, which has been developed over an extensive period.  I thank all those who contributed, not least Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, whose leadership in the early stages of the process helped us to reach this important milestone.<\/p> <p>Over the past two decades, Ireland has become an increasingly diverse country.  Census 2016 reveals that just over 800,000 of those currently resident in Ireland were born outside the country.  A little over 600,000 people speak a language other than English or Irish at home.  This in an increase of 19% over the 2011 figure.  At the same time, the figures reveal a strong commitment to Ireland among those born elsewhere.  Just over 100,000 people are now dual citizens of Ireland and another country.  This confirms the strong interest among many persons of migrant origin in becoming Irish citizens and in making a permanent commitment to Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Ireland&rsquo;s record on integration has been quite positive so far.  Significant progress has been made over the past two decades to integrate migrants into Irish society.  The actions taken by successive Governments, as well as by the business sector, civil society organisations and local communities, have achieved positive outcomes for migrants in key areas.  The degree to which migrants have integrated into many Irish workplaces is a particular success story.  Social inclusion measures have ensured that migrants do not experience significantly higher risks of poverty because of their migrant status.  In 2012, the differentials in the \"at risk of poverty\" rates for citizens and third country nationals were narrowest in Ireland of all EU member states.  <\/p><p>Integration plans have been devised for key sectors.  The intercultural education strategy has focused on enabling students to experience an education respectful of diversity while assisting education providers to ensure that integration becomes the norm within an intercultural learning environment.  The National Intercultural Health Strategy 2007-2012 provided a framework for action by the health service to respond to increasing cultural diversity.  A new intercultural health strategy will be developed as one of the actions foreseen under this integration strategy.<\/p><p>Equally, many businesses recognise the importance of managing workplace diversity successfully.  Some 50 companies in Ireland representing well over 100,000 employees have signed up to the diversity charter to demonstrate their commitment to diversity.  Many more companies have developed expertise in managing workplace diversity well.  However, we cannot be complacent.  We know that there will be challenges ahead.  The record of other EU countries demonstrates that ghettoisation, isolation, or indeed poorer outcomes, particularly for second generation immigrants, can create problems very quickly.  We also have to avoid the growth of racism within the host population.  If we are to realise the benefits of integration we need firstly to avoid some of the pitfalls that have developed in other countries.  There are great benefits for Irish society if we get our integration model right.  <\/p><p>This migrant integration strategy has been framed in the understanding that the integration process is becoming increasingly complex.  The composition of the migrant population is ever more diverse.  Migrants come from diverse cultures, religions, backgrounds and experiences.  Some are English-speaking and some are not.  While the recent focus has been on the refugees coming to Ireland under the Irish refugee protection programme, many migrants are now well-established in Ireland and have been here for some time.  The strategy needs to be sufficiently flexible to encompass refugees and economic migrants, those who are new to Ireland and those who have spent their lives here.  <\/p><p>The context within which this strategy has been developed is also complex and subject to change.   We are currently experiencing a migration crisis on Europe&rsquo;s borders.  It is likely that this crisis will continue for the years ahead, with migrants continuing to try to come to Europe to escape conflict, persecution and limited economic opportunities.  Undoubtedly the countries of origin of those migrants may change but the pressure to move northwards and westwards may not.   Brexit introduces another variable into the equation.  Its impact is not yet known.  What is known is that it will be an additional factor that migrants will take into account when considering future life choices.  The risks of populist, anti-immigrant movements and the radicalisation of some of those of migrant origin in other EU countries have been well signalled.<\/p><p>We have the opportunity to avoid the mistakes of other societies.  We must avoid in particular the segregation and isolation of migrant communities.  Segregation can fracture shared understandings between migrant and non-migrant populations.  This can lead to the growth of racist sentiment.  It can also lead to the loss of economic and social opportunities for migrant communities.      <\/p><p>The principal aim in this strategy is to promote the ability of migrants to participate actively in Irish society and to foster a sense of belonging within this society for them.  The strategy builds on the foundation of what has been achieved so far.  It recognises that mainstream services have to place a renewed focus on integration to ensure that migrants gain equal access to such services.  Equally, it proposes a range of targeted measures to address barriers which prevent migrants from realising their full potential.  We have to recognise that some migrants, particularly the refugees coming into Ireland under the Irish refugee protection programme, may have complex needs and may need targeted services.   <\/p><p>The migrant integration strategy is intended as the framework for the Government&rsquo;s action on migrant integration for the period from 2017 to 2020 and has been devised to respond to the new challenges that we anticipate in the years ahead.  It will run from 2017 until 2020 and is targeted at EU and non-EU nationals, including refugees.  It is also targeted at foreign-born Irish citizens and their children.  <\/p><p>Our focus for this strategy is to build on the good practices already in place and to provide further supports where necessary.  We must replicate existing successful initiatives.  Equally, we must ensure that areas needing attention are identified and measures taken to address any problems.  The actions and recommendations contained in this strategy cover a wide range of very important areas including, among others, access to public services and social inclusion, education, health and employment.  It builds on the existing approach to combine mainstream services and targeted initiatives to address specific needs.  Its key message is that integration is a two-way process that will involve change and responsibilities both for migrants and for Irish society.  It aims to communicate the message that successful integration is the responsibility of Irish society as a whole.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It seeks to encourage action by Government, public bodies, service providers, businesses, NGOs and local communities, and encouraging action by local communities will be a key element of the strategy.<\/p><p>One issue that emerged repeatedly in the consultation process for this strategy was the need to ensure individuals and families are fully integrated into local communities.  They risk being unaware of information or opportunities if they are not linked to the community and official networks on which others rely.  The strategy puts forward a number of initiatives to reach out to groups and families that may be isolated from mainstream society.  It proposes to use networks as a means by which migrant and non-migrant groups and organisations can get to know one another and through which migrants can raise issues of concern.  Dublin City Council, for instance, will set up a network targeted at hard to reach migrant groups building on a model pioneered by New York city.<\/p><p>Similarly, a network will be established for schools outside the established system to inform them of child protection and health and safety obligations.  We intend to use this network as a means of establishing relationships with such schools, many of which operate outside any form of oversight but which are interested in being compliant on child protection etc.  It is intended that such networks will be used as a means of communicating information but also of building shared understandings with regard to norms and expectations.<\/p><p>Reaching out to young people is a particular concern within the strategy.  Older teenagers and young adults can turn away from existing youth structures, particularly if they experience family pressures not to mix in opposite sex groups.  The strategy proposes that the youth sector will look at ways of engaging with these young people of migrant origin in order that they get the chance to develop and maintain relationships with their peers within Irish society.<\/p><p>The strategy seeks to address areas where migrants are under-represented.  It includes actions that seek to improve the representation of migrants throughout the public service.  It proposes that a target of 1% will be established for the employment of European Economic Area, EEA, nationals and people from minority ethnic communities within the Civil Service.  This will be monitored for progress towards the target.  Initiatives will be taken to raise awareness within migrant communities of the opportunities presented by careers in the Civil Service.  I see this as an important step towards ensuring the Civil Service is more representative of the population of Ireland as a whole.<\/p><p>Similarly, an awareness-raising initiative is planned to encourage under-represented groups, including migrants, to apply for appointment to State boards.  The aim is to raise awareness among migrants and persons of migrant origin of opportunities on State boards in order that they can be encouraged to apply for such opportunities.  Getting more diverse voices onto State boards should yield benefits in two directions.  Migrants will gain access to wider decision-making opportunities in society.  In turn, State boards will benefit from a wider pool of talent and expertise.<\/p><p>The consultations held with migrant groups during the process of drafting the strategy confirmed that migrant organisations are especially interested in the area of political participation.  They want to see higher turnout by migrants in relevant elections.  They also want the political parties to encourage more migrants to become involved, including as potential candidates.  In response, the strategy includes a number of actions to encourage greater participation in political life by migrants.  The first step is to encourage more migrants to register for and vote in elections.<\/p><p>Ensuring mainstream services understand and are responsive to migrant needs is very important.  The strategy proposes that integration will be mainstreamed into the work of all relevant Departments and agencies.  It proposes ongoing intercultural training for front-line staff of Departments.  It also reiterates the need for information for migrants in language-appropriate formats.  English language proficiency emerged as a key concern in consultations with migrant groups.  They want to see more targeted language training and greater opportunities for progression.  The strategy proposes to include a language component in education and training programmes for unemployed migrants with a poor knowledge of English.  The role of the education and training boards will be crucial in ensuring these opportunities are available, including to enable migrants to develop the language skills to access skilled employment.<\/p><p>While employment rates are broadly similar for migrants and non-migrants, one group, namely, Africans, have much lower rates of employment than the norm.  The Department of Social Protection is undertaking an initiative to examine the reasons Africans have lower than average rates of employment.  Our concern is to ensure employment opportunities are available to African migrants on an equal basis with other groups.  We also want to tackle any risk that Africans might get locked into intergenerational exclusion from the labour market.  More broadly, initiatives are planned to ensure migrant needs in skills acquisition and labour market activation are addressed.<\/p><p>As I have said, many employers have gained experience in managing diversity effectively.  Many businesses have developed expertise in managing diversity in their customer base.  There is a role now for business to communicate that expertise within the wider society.  The strategy seeks to encourage businesses to focus more on using their corporate social responsibility activities to promote integration.  The work to engage with the business sector to encourage its ongoing activities to manage workplace diversity will continue.  Equally, initiatives are being undertaken to promote migrant entrepreneurship using EU funding streams.<\/p><p>The health service is a very good example of a system that has adapted to meet the challenges of diversity.  However, some of the refugees coming into Ireland at the moment have complex health needs.  This may require additional resources within the health service to deal with their needs.  The proposed second national intercultural health strategy will provide a framework for addressing the needs of this vulnerable cohort.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The issue of data gaps has been raised repeatedly in past years.  While progress has been made in collecting data on ethnicity and nationality, including in the census, there are still gaps in key areas.  The absence of robust data inhibits our ability to understand migrant needs fully or to plan effectively for changes to or for future demands on services.  The issue of reporting of race-related incidents is a facet of this problem.  The strategy proposes to establish a working group under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality to examine data and reporting issues.  <\/p><p>Successful integration starts at local level.  The community is the key to ensuring that families feel truly at home in Ireland.  With this in mind, I have established the communities integration fund which will provide small grants to local organisations and community groups to promote integration across the country.  I am very pleased that there has been a great response to the initiative.  I will announce details of the successful applicants next month.  In addition to this fund, the Department of Justice and Equality separately issued a call for proposals for national projects to promote integration.  Again, the response was exceptionally positive, with a large number of applications received.  I will announce details of the successful proposals soon.<\/p><p>As our population changes, its needs will also change.  I anticipate that the challenges that we are likely to face in terms of integration will evolve over the period to 2020.  I will chair a strategy committee of Departments, agencies and NGOs that will oversee the implementation of the strategy and examine how it needs to adapt to meet the challenges ahead.  Implementation and monitoring of the strategy will be very important.  Having concrete targets that can be measured will also be important.  The strategy committee will begin its work next month.  It will set targets for action and monitor progress towards meeting them.  The inclusion of members of the NGO sector in the implementation process will be of great importance in ensuring that issues of concern are identified and action taken to address them as appropriate.  A review has been built into the strategy in order to enable it to be adapted if significant new challenges emerge over the next 18 months.<\/p><p>The increased diversity of Ireland&rsquo;s population has brought great benefits for our country.  It has enhanced our skills.  It has brought a talented workforce capable of responding to the increased demands of the global economy.  It has enabled us to withstand the economic turbulence of the past decade.  If we are to continue to realise the benefits of diversity, we need as a society to focus more on integration.  We each of us have to play a part in promoting integration, in challenging racism and in ensuring that our workplaces and communities are inclusive of all.  The migrant integration strategy offers the blueprint for engaging Government, communities, workplaces and individuals in the vital task of making integration a success for all of us.<\/p><p>I look forward to hearing the contributions of Senators and to working with them on the strategy into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#CC00200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":201,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will make his closing remarks at 6.25 p.m. and statements will conclude at 6.30 p.m.  Group spokespersons have eight minutes and all other Senators have five minutes.

Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes publication of the new migrant integration strategy.  Strong and effective policies are required to ensure that new Irish communities integrate successfully into society here.  It is also essential that we learn from the experience of other societies so that we can anticipate any problems stemming from migration to Ireland.  The new migrant integration strategy was published in February this year and it foresees actions applicable to all Departments and those intended to address particular issues.  One of the biggest issues is information to migrants and language.  It must be provided in an appropriate format and there must be ongoing intercultural awareness training for all front-line staff.<\/p><p>Language barriers relating to schools and health services, including GP services, also need to be addressed.  The Government must ensure that there is provision of information on local authority housing, welfare benefits and so on.  These issues have to be addressed.  There must also be initiatives to address migrants' needs in terms of skills and labour markets and to encourage the business sector to play a role in promoting integration.  A working group must be established to examine data gaps in respect of migrant needs and experience and a migrant integration strategy development to respond to the challenges of promoting integration in the context of such increased diversity.<\/p><p>There have been many good news stories in this area, including in Ballaghaderreen which welcomed over 80 Syrian refugees in February.  On arrival, these refugees were presented with welcome packs comprising nappies and toiletries provided by local pharmacies, buggies, etc., donated by mothers and books donated by bookshops, including some in Arabic.  A number of weeks ago, there was a fabulous article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>about members of the local community having invited the Syrian refugees to engage with them in a game of soccer.  According to one of the participants, &quot;It was great craic.  Language is a barrier ...&quot;.  We need to address the language barrier issue.  It is heart-warming to hear such stories.  These people have been through so much and we can only imagine that their needs are complex.  Strong and effective policies are required to ensure that the new Irish communities integrate successfully into Irish society.  It is essential too that we learn from the experience of other societies so that we can anticipate any problems stemming from migration into Ireland.<\/p><p>Over 80 Syrian migrants are due to arrive in Carlow over the next few months, in respect of which a protocol is being worked on.  Is there EU funding available to subsidise migrant needs in terms of housing provision and to address the issues for children in particular, including the language barrier issue?  All of this work requires everybody working together.  I will be working with my local authority to address these issues.  A few years ago a community of Rohingya came to Carlow.

I also welcome publication of the migrant integration strategy, which contains a number of concrete, key measures that are worth highlighting.  These include: the establishment by local authorities of networks aimed at reaching out to hard-to-reach migrant groups to help them to engage with Departments and to provide information on their needs; the establishment of a communities integration fund intended to support organisations in local communities, sports organisations, faith organisations and so on to undertake actions to promote the integration of migrants into their communities; the monitoring of current school enrolment policies to address their impact on the enrolment of migrant students; the inclusion of a language component in education and training programmes for unemployed migrants with poor English proficiency; initiatives to ensure that migrant needs regarding skills acquisition and labour market activation are addressed; and initiatives to encourage the business sector to play a role in promoting integration.<\/p> <p>I am more hopeful now than at any point in the past 12 months because anti-immigrant platforms are being defeated across Europe.  The outcome of the US election, along with Brexit, tapped into a psyche across western democracies that pro-migrant policies would push political parties off an electoral cliff.  Chancellor Merkel's brave decision in 2015 to take in hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees on foot of a global outcry regarding the treacherous and often fatal journeys children and adults were taking to get to Europe was broadly heralded at the time as one taken in spite of the political risks involved.  However, it was subsequently panned by public pundits who predicted that the wave of populism which delivered Brexit and the US would crash onto the European Union's shores.  We were told that the people of the Netherlands would elect a person who is openly Islamophobic, but this did not happen; that a candidate from a former holocaust denying anti-immigrant party would be elected president of Austria, but it did not happen; that Marine Le Pen, which her anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant trappings, would become President of France, but this also did not happen; and that Chancellor Merkel would pay a big political price for the decision to open Germany's borders to those fleeing appalling strife.  As recently as last Sunday, however, Chancellor Merkel was winning state elections and looks set to be returned to power in September.<\/p> <p>The US President issued an executive order which, in effect, would have led to Muslims being banned from the United States.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Billy Lawless:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2485\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2485&amp;amp;pid=BillyLawless&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The national outcry created by this action brought people of all races and hues together in what has been one of the strongest fight-backs against any presidential decision I can recall.  From 28 to 31 January, almost 50 cases were filed in federal courts seeking to prevent the order from coming into being.  I was one of thousands of protesters who gathered at airports and other locations throughout the US.  The first Muslim ban was withdrawn and a new one developed but this order was also halted by the US courts thus preventing it going into effect.  <\/p><p>I welcome these initiatives proposed by the Minister and the global tide that is shifting against anti-immigrant rhetoric but I must ask the Minister about the 4,500 people in direct provision in Ireland.  What moves are being made to accelerate their cases for adjudication?  Direct provision was set up as a temporary measure in 2000 and here we are 18 years later, where very little has changed in the lives, conditions and supports for these people.  Some families have been in direct provision for up to ten years.  I know of a case of three women from Africa from different cultures and different countries sharing one room.  I know of parents trying to support children in their home countries on the pittance of &euro;19 per week.  This cannot continue.  The conditions they are living under are unacceptable.  Their children can attend secondary school but cannot receive third-level education.  They are unable to avail fully of social welfare or housing supports.  Can the Minister of State tell me how far advanced is the Department of Justice and Equality in implementing the findings of the working group on improvements to the protection process chaired by Dr. Bryan McMahon, which was published in June 2015?   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#FF00400","speaker":"1429","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  He is a regular visitor at this stage.  I commend my Opposition colleagues on their contributions thus far.  I salute Senator Lawless for the great work he does on behalf of the undocumented Irish in Chicago and throughout the US.  In essence, he is now a roving ambassador on behalf of the people of Ireland in that regard.  The impact of the work he is doing is immense.  This strategy is very welcome and I welcome its publication.  What has been proposed is laudable and I sincerely hope it is achieved.  Measures like 1% of the Civil Service reflecting our new ethnic communities are welcome, positive and significant.<\/p> <p>I will pick up on what Senator Lawless about direct provision.  It is a disgrace.  I know the Minister of State is genuine in this regard because he was chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for five years but it is time the Civil Service was told what to do.  We need to close down direct provision and relocate those families in decent accommodation where they can reach their own potential.  We need to fast-track the application process.  Much has been achieved and the McMahon report is great but what measures in the report have been implemented?  Let us be honest, the easy recommendations have been implemented.  The hard ones have not been implemented yet.  Civil servants trot out the line that 60% or 70% of the recommendations of the report have been implemented but I want to see the difficult recommendations implemented.  I would go a step further.  I believe there should be a timeline in the very near future for closing down direct provision centres.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and I visited a couple of direct provision centres during the lifetime of the last Oireachtas.  One could not but be horrified at the conditions.  The sense of isolation and being cramped and the lack of dignity were frightening.  I repeat what I have stated in this House previously, which is that a future Taoiseach will stand up in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and give an apology to the people, particularly the children, who have been in direct provision for a decade and possibly even longer.  <\/p> <p>Our policy regarding Syrian refugees has been very positive and our communities have had very positive experiences in this regard.  I see Senator Hopkins is present and the leadership she showed in Ballaghaderreen should not go unnoticed in this House.  My home town of Ennistymon has nine Syrian families.  I think it works out at 48 individuals.  They are wonderful people who I meet in the street all the time.  When they are out playing and talking to people in the community, they change from Arabic to English immediately to make it comfortable for the people living around them to engage with them.  They are making an effort and we are making an effort, to be fair.  Although the North West Clare Family Resource Centre based in Ennistymon has received no additional funding, it has set up homework clubs and an English teaching club.  The Syrian children are going to the cr&egrave;che, which is threatened with closure.  It is bizarre.  We pick communities that have services and facilities, and rightly so, but we are not meaningfully putting money into those communities.  I hope the Syrian crisis is resolved very soon but that is wishful thinking.  We probably will be welcoming people from other countries - Syrians and other nationalities from war-torn countries - for many years to come.  We need to establish centres of excellence and identify communities that open not just their homes and hearts but their communities and ways of thinking.  As many ordinary, decent people and communities are showing immense leadership in this regard, the Government needs to support them.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is an incredible Minister in this area.  His heart is in the right place but I fear that he is probably not getting the level of support he should be getting from Cabinet.  Direct provision has been in place since 2000 or 2001.  That is a specific example in this area.  We had a boom and a bust and we now have a recovery but we still have direct provision.  Now we have a recovery, we need to make policy decisions, drive them home and show leadership.  Regardless of whoever the new Taoiseach will be, the first issue I will raise with him or her - I have already spoken to the two main contenders - will be my wish to see definitive action on direct provision.  People like Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in showed immense leadership but unfortunately, he was appointed too late.  Had he been appointed in 2011, direct provision would be gone now.  <\/p> <p>We are where we are.  All we can do is look to the future with positivity.  This House has a unique role to play in showing leadership.  We have all shown leadership.  Even in the previous Seanad, motions were tabled in this regard.  Within Fine Gael, I will be criticised for criticising but we are here to call it as it is and do the right thing.  I believe we are doing good work in terms of the Syrians but we have a lot more to do and a lot more ground to cover.  Certainly, we need to put resources into the communities that have welcomed the Syrians.  Direct provision, however, is a national scandal.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#GG00200","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat a Leas-Chathaoirligh.

We were actually calling for a debate around the International Protection Act 2015, its implementation and direct provision.  Certainly, the integration strategy is very welcome.  It is a very laudable strategy and I welcome it.  There are some fantastic initiatives in it.  The elephant in the room, however, has to be direct provision.  I note that there was no mention of direct provision or the International Protection Act 2015 in the Minister of State's speech.  I might be subject to correction on that, but I do not think either of them were referenced.  They are really the elephants in the room with regard to this issue.  <\/p><p>Will the Minister of State give us a clear statement of where he stands on direct provision?  It is very important.  I have been extremely critical in these Houses over recent years of direct provision and of the way it has been introduced.  Direct provision was dreamt up on the back of a cigarette packet by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  It is a privatised system which has been called an open prison.  For the people who live there the only difference between it and an open prison is that they do not know when their sentences will end.  I engage with people who are staying in the direct provision system regularly and their sense of hopelessness at the moment is much greater now than it was before the McMahon report.  They feel the report was a whitewash and that it has actually cemented direct provision and formalised it within the system, even though, at the time, it was brought in as a temporary measure which was not supposed to last more than a year.  How can a Government stand over a system like this?  There is no HIQA oversight.  I welcome the recent extension of oversight to the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children because there are many issues around direct provision that the people within the system wanted to raise.  <\/p><p>If this is framed in the context of the Minister of State's own migrant integration strategy, there is a vision for that strategy which has a number of key elements.  The first is that, \"The basic values of Irish society are respected by all\".  Most people in Ireland would say it is a basic value to be able to have one's own roof over one's head.  People in direct provision do not have that right.  They are housed within a system in which whole families are living in one hotel room and where, as Senator Lawless has correctly outlined, there may be four individuals of the same sex staying together in one room.  Some of them may have mental health issues.  That is absolutely true.  I can point them out to the Minister of State in the Eglinton Hotel or the Great Western Hotel in Galway if he would like.  Individuals are staying in rooms with other people who are absolute strangers to them and may be there for a number of years.  <\/p><p>The right to education is also something that people in Ireland would certainly respect and honour.  This Government and our State still have not signed up to the EU directives on the right to work and the right to education.  Can the Minister of State tell us when we are going to live up to our international commitments around these rights?  I know there were a number of positive developments in the McMahon report concerning the right to education that would recognise the rights of younger people going on to third level education, but they were very restricted.  Unless children have been in the secondary school system for five years they cannot access the grants available to allow them to access third level education.  There have been some fantastic philanthropic initiatives in which certain people have sponsored people into third level - I know that from my own experience - but the State should recognise the rights of all these young people within the direct provision system.  They should be allowed a right to work and a right to education.  <\/p><p>The second value in the vision which I note is that, \"Migrants are enabled and expected to participate in economic life &ndash; in employment and self-employment\".  How does that pertain to people in direct provision?  I have met bankers, journalists, record producers, nurses, carpenters and an astrophysicist, all of whom are in the direct provision system.  They are fantastic people.  Anybody who has the wherewithal to make it from whatever war-torn country or whatever difficulties they were in, to get to Ireland and land in a direct provision system had huge resourcefulness within them.  They are fantastic people but they feel bereft within a system that does not allow them to work.  What is the Minister of State going to do about that, because it needs to be addressed?<\/p><p>\"Migrants interact with the host community and participate with them in cultural, sporting and other activities while preserving also their own traditions as they wish.\"  That is very important.  Next Saturday in Galway is Africa Day.  We celebrate that every year and it is a wonderful occasion.  My children love it because of the food, the colour, the dance, etc.  A lot of the people there are, again, in direct provision.  They are people who would certainly love to be able to get their own space in the community. <\/p><p>\"Migrants have language skills sufficient to enable them to participate in economic life and in the wider society.\"  There has been a huge issue recently, of which the Minister of State will be aware, around the implementation of the International Protection Act 2015.  The new single procedure process involves a lengthy and quite complex questionnaire.  I have been at a number of public meetings with solicitors who work with people in direct provision, people in direct provision themselves and organisations such as Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, MASI, the Irish Refugee Council, Doras Luimn&iacute;, Nasc, etc.  That questionnaire caused absolute consternation.  I know the deadline for applying was extended.  There were issues around the language used in it.  There were translations of that document available, but my understanding was that the translations were appalling in many cases.  People had great difficulty understanding what they were doing.  There were questions around whether Google Translate had been used.  There was a huge issue around access to people with language skills who could translate for people in asylum.  <\/p><p>There are also issues around access to legal advice on filling out that questionnaire.  There are not enough people available through the legal services for people seeking asylum in this country.  There are issues with the quality of the knowledge that some of those people have and them not having enough expertise in the specific area of asylum, which is a very complex legal area.  The Minister of State might address that and let us know how that process is progressing.<\/p><p>\"Migrants, and particularly their children, benefit fully from the education system.\"  I have mentioned education but the direct provision system is appalling for children.  It is appalling for families that children have to be supervised outside a room if they are in a hotel-type building.  They have to supervised in any of the communal areas because there are child protection issues.  Children are not able to bring others home.  If children have a birthday party, they do not have any space in that building to bring guests up to their own rooms.  The natural domestic life an Irish family would take for granted is not afforded to those people in direct provision.  There has been talk of extending the self-catering opportunities available to people in direct provision.  I am not sure how successful that has been but when one has only &euro;19.80 a week, making food available and being able to cook in those centres is certainly questionable.<\/p><p>I agree that direct provision needs to go.  We are spending above and beyond &euro;53 million a year.  How accountable are the companies for the &euro;53 million that is being spent?  My understanding is that some of these companies have made over &euro;10 million in recent years.  Some of these companies are listed offshore, so we cannot see their accounts, etc.  Why is this system not being run in a more humane way?  Why do we not have a State-run system or one that is run by a non-governmental organisation?  Why do we not have a system in which much more accountability, training and services would be available?  The staff in many direct provision centres are very good people but they have no specific training in the necessary aspects of the job around social work, psychology or health.  I have visited quite a number of centres.  The Oireachtas joint committee produced a report on it as well.  <\/p><p>We will go easy this time, but we will be calling the Minister of State back for another debate on direct provision in the very near future and we will expect movement to have been made toward the eradication of direct provision before we have an international scandal on our hands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#GG00300","speaker":"1377","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the Chamber to discuss Ireland&rsquo;s migrant integration strategy.  It is something that is very close to my heart and I welcome the initiative.  As we know, Ireland is an increasingly diverse country.  CSO data from 2016 show that roughly one in ten people living here define as non-Irish, while last year saw net inward migration to the State for the first time since 2009.  A significant number of people are also seeking to build a life in Ireland to contribute to our communities and our wonderful country.  Immigration is a positive and permanent reality in Ireland, and we must celebrate the diversity that comes with it.<\/p> <p>As the strategy recognises, integration is a two-way process.  It is not about asking people to simply adapt to their new homes, but about recognising that the State and wider civil society must make every effort to do the same.  Real integration is proudly asserting that migrants should not be asked to blend in or to disappear into the crevices and margins of Irish society, but to become a fundamental and central part of it.  Overall, how we treat migrants says a huge amount about who we are as a people.  Since 2011, the citizenship ceremonies held across the country are examples of Ireland at its best &ndash; inclusive, welcoming and open.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They realise the reputation of the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte and look beyond legal acceptance to a sense of social inclusion and belonging.  In the past four years, more than 85,000 people from more than 160 countries have become Irish citizens, widening and enriching our definition of what it means to be Irish.  This is the spirit in which we must proceed.<br\/><br\/>Around the world, we can see an alarming increase in xenophobia as migrants are continually scapegoated, stereotyped and demonised.  We see politicians across the Atlantic and the Irish Sea shamefully exploiting people's fears and whipping up anti-migrant sentiment.  This trend is toxic, and Ireland must lead the fight against it.  We must strongly reassert the positive contribution that migrants make to their new countries.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to see that &euro;500,000 will be made available this year for local community integration projects.  In particular, music, culture and the arts are hugely beneficial in bringing communities together.  Much has been said about how ordinary people in towns and villages like Ballaghaderreen have rallied to welcome Syrian refugees to their communities, and I can only further commend these efforts.  They are a credit to the country.  It is, however, vital that the Government does not simply rely on community and non-profit organisations to do this work.  The State must ensure adequate resources are provided for the provisions outlined in this strategy.  Commitments to expand English language training programmes must be well funded.  Similarly, intercultural awareness training for staff in the public sector is welcome, but we must ensure the proper interpretation and translation supports are provided, especially in the context of health care and education.  The citizenship ceremonies themselves are fantastic occasions but they cost &euro;1,125 to participate.  This is clearly prohibitive for a huge number of people.  The strategy commits to reviewing this fee, but no more.  I hope the Minister will support a reduction in that fee.<br\/><br\/>Beyond this, two stories from last month showcase the best and the worst of how things can work in Ireland when it comes to migration and integration.  In April, a young man named Muhammad made his debut for Michael Davitt's GAA club in Belfast.  Muhammad is a Syrian refugee who arrived in Ireland with his family from war-torn Aleppo.  We cannot imagine the difficulties and hardship that he and his family have faced and the kind of terror that has caused so many to flee in recent years.  He lined out for the Davitt's under 10s last month, scoring two goals in his first game with his new team mates.  Pictures circulated quickly of him standing proudly in an O'Neill's GAA jersey after the game, and it was impossible not to be moved by the beaming smile across his face.  It is brilliant that Ireland can give Muhammad and his family a new chance and a new life, but it should make us reflect on how much more we can do.  Callous inaction and low commitments from European leaders are seeing people die on Europe's borders.  We should not be congratulating ourselves for meeting tiny EU quotas for refugee resettlement.  We should be asking why these figures are so low in the first place.  We can and must do more to show compassion to people fleeing persecution and war.<br\/><br\/>Just a few days after Muhammad played that game in Belfast, a mother living in the direct provision centre in Eglinton in Galway had to carry her sick child for two miles to hospital, because she could not afford the bus fare.  The Galway Anti-Racism Network spoke to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>about the case and others like it, including a woman living in the centre who had to walk the two miles home with her newborn baby because the &euro;19 per week she is forced to live on cannot cover the cost of transportation.  Can one imagine the stress and anguish of that situation and how difficult that must be?<br\/><br\/>The migrant integration strategy does not account for these women because it does not directly address how asylum seekers are treated by the State.  The strategy applies only to EEA and non-EEA nationals, including economic migrants, refugees and those with legal status to remain in Ireland.  This is very disappointing.  How can we talk credibly about the integration of migrants in this country without considering the thousands of people living in direct provision centres throughout the country? The design of this strategy means that direct provision falls outside law and policy again.  Direct provision is a scandal.  I have raised the issue in this House previously, but the treatment of people who are feeling some of the worst abuse in the world is shameful.Some 4,500 people are locked in this system and they are forced to live on &euro;19 per week.  They cannot engage in education beyond the leaving certificate.  They lack basic cooking facilities and sleep in small, cramped, communal rooms.  The disastrous mental health effects are well known.  Research from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has shown that depression and mental health problems are five times as high in direct provision as in the wider community, coupled with feelings of isolation and a loss of self-esteem.  People remain in this system for up to a decade, which has been repeatedly condemned by human rights organisations.  It is shameful.  Who benefits from such a system?  Who benefits from keeping talented, ambitious, enthusiastic people from realising their potential?  It is certainly not the State as it makes a mockery of its commitment to cherish all children of the nation equally.  It is not the people living in carceral institutions who are denied their basic rights and dignity.  Ultimately, the beneficiaries are the network of contractors running these centres on a for-profit basis.  Last year, eight companies were paid &euro;43.5 million to provide these centres.  Is this the best use of our resources?<br\/><br\/>As we try to come to terms with the abuse inflicted on people in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalen laundries and other State and religious institutions, we often look back and ask ourselves how this happened.  This is how it happens.  It happens through endless discussion in committees, through reports left to gather dust and through the slow, cruel inaction of the State.  It happens through a migrant integration strategy that says nothing about the 4,500 migrants trapped in a system that denies them their basic human rights.<br\/><br\/>The strategy also does not apply to the estimated 20,000 or 30,000 people who are undocumented and living in Ireland today.  This is unacceptable.  We cannot on the one hand plead with the United States Administration for justice for the undocumented Irish people living in America while ignoring the plight of those people living here under similar circumstances.  Undocumented migrants' lack of legal status prevents them from accessing basic rights and protection, and a substantial number of people live in a state of constant fear.  Many are concentrated in non-unionised, low-paid sectors where exploitation is common and no reasonable means for redress exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#HH00200","speaker":"1408","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I must ask the Senator to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#JJ00200","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Economic integration is an essential precursor to real integration for migrants.

My contribution will focus on the integration of the individuals who have come to Ireland as part of the Irish refugee protection programme which was established in 2015.  This was a direct response to the developing humanitarian crisis in many countries.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State is aware, I have had, and continue to have, extensive involvement with the emergency reception and orientation centre which has operated in my home town in Ballaghaderreen in County Roscommon since the middle of March.  I was in the centre again yesterday and I am there quite regularly.  It is lovely to hear contributions from other Senators from throughout the country about the leadership shown by Ballaghaderreen in welcoming these people.  It was lovely to see smiles on faces and the fear gone from many faces of those who use the centre.  By the end of this week it is expected we will have approximately 200 refugees in the EROC centre in Ballaghaderreen.<\/p> <p>We know that the mass migration of people is a very complex global issue that could probably be described as the biggest challenge facing the world.  Conflict and violence continue to be the main reasons for so many people having to flee their homes.  An estimated 65 million people are displaced, 40% of whom are children.  We know from the emergency reception and orientation centre in Ballaghaderreen that about half the current refugees are children.  This challenge demands that the international community works together.  Ireland needs to play its part.  Ireland has agreed to accept 4,000 refugees under the Irish refugee protection programme.

This migrant integration strategy is important because it envisages a whole-of-Government approach to assisting the integration of these individuals into Irish society.<\/p><p>From my experience in recent months, I am aware that there are challenges with the process of integration.  Greater co-ordination at the early stages is necessary to ensure that local service providers are fully briefed on their obligations.  In Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, there was an information gap and some of these issues continue to obtain.  We enable refugees to access mainstream services such as those relating to health, education and social protection.  To make this integration process as effective as possible, there needs to be greater communication with local service providers, such as general practitioners, schools, child care facilities, education and training boards and all of the other necessary services, in order to support these individuals at their point of arrival.<\/p><p>The Minister of State indicated that the health service is a good example of a system that has adapted to meet the challenges of diversity.  I disagree with this.  The Minister of State will be aware that I have raised serious concerns about the obligations of the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Department of Health in supporting the refugees who have come to Ballaghaderreen.  The HSE, following significant pressure from the Minister of State, commissioned Safetynet to operate the mobile screening unit.  That was funded through the Dormant Account Fund.  However, it is not good enough that money from dormant accounts is being used to support the health needs of these individuals.  We need to ensure that the Department of Health and the HSE live up to their obligations and responsibilities in providing additional resources to deal with these needs.  When I visited the health centre, the manager highlighted difficulties, particularly with regard to dental care, which are not being addressed.<\/p><p>I commend the people of Ballaghaderreen and the friends of the centre who have done so much in a short time to welcome these people, as has been mentioned, through sport, music, etc.  I continue to receive numerous calls regarding the donation of clothes and time.  This is real integration and it is extremely positive.<\/p><p>I commend our local For&oacute;ige club, which won the national citizenship award two weeks ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#JJ00400","speaker":"1415","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I must stop the Senator.

The Immigrant Council of Ireland has welcomed the strategy but the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland has effectively rejected it on the basis that it does not involve enough time-sensitive elements and needs to be more concrete in the context of what is trying to be achieved.<\/p> <p>I agree with what many other Senators said on integration and immigration issues.  These are scary times.  Notwithstanding what was said about Trump and Brexit, which was effectively an immigration debate, I am not necessarily as positive as Senator Lawless about recent elections in Europe.  Basically, one third of the French electorate voted for a person who is a fascist and a racist.  Up to 49% of the Austrian public almost elected a neo-Nazi as president.  In fairness to Ireland, we have never had a mainstream political party adopt immigration as a platform at a general election.  Minor parties have done so but have had little support at election time.  No major political party has listed as a priority in its election manifesto anything about immigration, curbing immigration or any xenophobic platform.  We need to be thankful for and recognise that.<\/p> <p>We should not be complacent, however.  Notwithstanding what has been said, I was somewhat taken aback by self-congratulatory statements regarding the political reaction to what happened in Ballaghaderreen.  I remember different things being said by political representatives there before the people made their decision as to how they felt about people coming to their villages.  I recall political representatives from that area being a little bit less than welcoming.  It was the people - the local shopkeepers and the community - who welcomed the Syrian refugees into their arms.  Then the political system began chasing after the people.  I found it quite discouraging but then encouraging.<\/p> <p>When I held the Minister of State's position, there was no issue that Senators raised more often than direct provision and no issue on which I worked harder.  I would love to be the person to declare the end of direct provision.  However, when we are dealing with it, we have to work beyond slogans and things that fit neatly into hashtags.  Instead, we must deal with reality.  We have the McMahon report on direct provision, which was a compromise between several NGOs that felt passionately about this matter and the Department.  I was present when the report was launched in July 2015.  The Minister for Justice and Equality said it was something to be considered and food for thought.  The NGOs that signed off on the report did so at massive risk to their reputations.  They are trying hard to improve the system.  They thought, in good faith, that the departmental officials would implement the report word for word.  It was not a discussion document because the NGOs compromised on issues in respect of which they did not want to compromise, namely, work, oversight and length of stay.  When it was signed off, those NGOs felt they could stand over it if it was implemented to the letter.  Almost two years on, this has not happened.<\/p> <p>This is classic Department of Justice and Equality behaviour.  The phrase it always comes back to is \"pull factor\".  It feels that if we show some humanity, we might get pull factor into this country, meaning there might be more of them and what would we do then.  This issue should been resolved years ago before we had a housing crisis, an increasing number of asylum applications and before we agreed to take 4,000 Syrian programme refugees.  In 2015, at the time of the publication of the report on direct provision, there were 2,695 people who had been in direct provision for over three years.  The figure now is 1,200, which means there are 1,500 people fewer in the system than was the case two years ago.  That has to be commended.  However, how is an NGO going to trust the Department of Justice and Equality and compromise with it on an issue if this report is not implemented?<\/p> <p>I am blue in the face saying to the Minister of State that the draft programme for Government contained a commitment to implement the McMahon report.  When the actual programme for Government emerged, that sentence had been deleted.  I do not know who deleted it.  It was not the Minister of State because he did not have this portfolio at the time.  Somebody did, however, and I bet it was the Department.  I know it has a history of being pretty miserable and unsympathetic when it comes to this entire area.  I do not know if we can end direct provision.  I do not want to put 4,500 people on a housing list.  I do not want to be responsible for stories about vulnerable families being homeless and living in parks under trees.  Those were the reports of what happened in 2000.  I am not going with hashtags or slogans.  However, for God's sake, can we not just implement this report to the letter?<\/p> <p>Another issue has been raised in the context of undocumented migrants.  It is to the credit of Senator Lawless that he has been working for years to have the undocumented Irish in America regularised.  It is to our shame, however, that our entire political system has the brass neck to arrive at the White House to tell the Americans to regularise the undocumented Irish when there are 26,000 undocumented workers here for whom we are not willing to do likewise.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->How do we have the gumption or the credibility to ask anybody in that white supremacist, racist regime to do something for the Irish when we will not do it here?  We are talking about 26,000 individuals, comprising 20,000 workers and about 6,000 children.<\/p><p>Those are the issues we need to recognise.  There is immense goodwill in this country for people from overseas.  It comes down to the very essence of who we are as a migrant people.  We understand the Syrian situation because we are the people who travelled in coffin ships.  We understand the dehumanising of people because of their religious beliefs because that is exactly what the Irish went through in America and in Britain.  We understand the signs that said \"No blacks, no dogs, no Irish\".  We understand that stuff instinctively, and that is why I believe no political party will ever go down this line.  It would not be to the credit of the Minister of State's Department if this nonsense with the 26,000 undocumented workers were not addressed and if this report were not implemented to the letter.  I do not believe the Department of Justice and Equality is fit to deal with this issue, because it has to deal with the issues of Garda reform, the prison service, the vast bulk of legislation that goes through these two Houses, all the equality issues and, on top of that, integration, immigration, refugee and asylum issues.  This is a sensitive humanitarian issue and it should be put into a separate Department.<\/p><p>I welcome the strategy, notwithstanding that Migrant Rights Centre Ireland has serious issues with it.  I fundamentally believe we are political hypocrites if we end up in the White House again talking about undocumented workers in the US without doing something here.  I am not asking the Minister of State to end direct provision, but the least we could do, for God's sake, is to implement the report that we commissioned in conjunction with the NGOs two years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#KK00400","speaker":"1410","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's constructive statement and the strategy.  It sets out the pathway for integration.  This is significant because people here often do not understand the issue beyond knowing that people are living in institutions who are known as refugees and they do not interact with them.  Any measures we take to facilitate that interaction helps avoid isolation on the part of migrants and lessens the chances of discrimination, but it also promotes understanding.  Many of the fears and undesirable attitudes towards migrants stem from a lack of understanding both of the circumstances from which they come and of their different cultures.  While we are very proud of our culture and the values we hold dear and that bind us together, notwithstanding differences, many other cultures have different ways of looking at things.  That does not diminish their value in any way, and there are great opportunities there.<\/p> <p>From the point of view of integration, once a charter or blueprint is set out, we are signalling that these people are valid and legitimate and we are acknowledging there are issues on integration that need to be addressed.  When people are embraced and provided for, we are calling on them to be part of our communities and part of our nation, and for them to contribute as well as to enjoy the benefits of living here.  That is a very desirable direction in which to travel.  Often when we think of migrants we forget that we have children of migrants here who are Irish citizens, and there are children of different coloured skin who do not consider themselves any less Irish than white children.  If they feel they are being discriminated against just because of the colour of their skin, what sort of society are we creating for the future and what sort of ghettoisation and discontent are we fostering in people who do not feel we can draw circles of inclusiveness big enough to include all the children of the nation?<\/p> <p>I commend the Minister of State on his approach to all things to do with migration.  I agree with some who have spoken here.  It is not top of a political agenda because migrants do not have a vote, and that is the reality in communities.  They are often from very difficult backgrounds and have ended up here.  If we take stock by looking at international news, we cannot begin to appreciate and comprehend the difficulties.  Syria is very explicit, but we can look at countries that are very impoverished, such as sub-Saharan African countries and Pakistan, and see what people have to live with in their daily life, going from cradle to grave in poverty that we will never know.  We enjoy many benefits in our western democracy, notwithstanding that we are always striving to improve it and to improve equality.  It gives food for thought.  These things should be foremost in our minds when we meet and embrace people of other cultures.<\/p> <p>I commend the people of Ballaghaderreen and also Senator Hopkins.  She has been to the fore at the beginning and was treading water to begin with because there had been bad reactions to people from different countries coming in and misconceptions of what that would mean.  People thought that things were being taken from them, that they were not ready and that we should look after our own first, one among several mantras trotted out.  We all know in our own lives that emergencies do not come at convenient times and that we have to rise to the occasion as a humane society.  We must do that in a responsible way.  When Irish people see that there is a pathway and a way to facilitate people and empower them to participate in our society and to enrich it, it will be considered a very responsible thing to have done.  We will reap the rewards of it.  We are sowing very good seeds for the future.<\/p> <p>In my home town of Ballina and in Castlebar we have welcomed programme refugees, including the Karen people from Burma, and I have to vouch for the community in Mayo that has embraced and helped the children and the adults through the whole culture shock of arriving here after what they had experienced in Burma.  In Ballyhaunis there are people from all over the world.  It must be the most multicultural place outside of Dublin.  From Syrians to Pakistanis to those from eastern Europe and Africa, people are co-existing and working there.  It is a fabulous place to go.  The people are fantastic.  The local GAA gets behind it.  The Minister of State has been there.  The only blemish there is the direct provision centre, and I would like to see us deal with that issue for the people who have had a question mark over their status for such a long time, in particular the children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#LL00200","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>We have three other speakers, so if everyone stays within their allotted time, we will accommodate everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#LL00300","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I was fortunate enough to bump into the Minister of State prior to departing for Ragusa on a 40 hour round trip to Sicily to look at migrant reception centres there.  I commend the Minister of State and his Department on putting this strategy in place, for it has not arrived a day too early.  The crisis of migration across the Mediterranean is in its infancy.  I was shocked by the numbers I saw there.<\/p> <p>It is instructive to read into the record what has happened.  In 2011, fewer than 2,000 people arrived in Pozzallo.  By 2014, that number had gone up to 28,000.  In 2016, it was at 19,000.  This year so far, before the season starts, it is already at 4,168.  However, one of the great problems we have in Europe is that, out of 21 countries that attended the seminar laid on by the Italian Government in Ragusa, it is my belief that at least ten of them have no intention of getting involved in reception centres or the integration of migrants.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

The 19,000 who arrived last year arrived from Eritrea, Guinea, the Gambia, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Sudan and Mali.  This year, the majority of the migrants who have arrived in the part of Sicily to which I referred were from Bangladesh, Nigeria and Guinea.  There is a crisis in migration and it is hitting the EU and coming at us like a train down the railway tracks.  Between 500 and 1,000 people a day are landing in just one port in Sicily.  Traffickers are making massive, absolutely unbelievable profits.  Refugees, asylum seekers, economic migrants - what are they?  We do not know.  They do not arrive with papers because any papers they have are taken from them before they embark to sail across the Mediterranean in what are only buckets, to say the very least.<\/p><p>Co-operation in the EU is far from consistent across all countries.  I am delighted the Minister of State adverted to the issue of our wanting our own people on the ground out there assessing migrants whom we would bring to Ireland.  I brought this up at the meeting and it was met with the most hostile rejection, but I kept my cool and at the end I brought it up again and said we had been told there was a need for solidarity.  They wanted solidarity one way but not the other.  They wanted us to accept whatever they told us and whatever migrants were sent, but they did not want us to have any say on the ground in Italy.  The matter is to come before the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC.  Perhaps people are wondering why I am bringing this up here, but it is a matter of some urgency.  COSAC will meet on 27 May in Malta, when the issue of seconding experts from each of the EU 27 to the refugee reception centres in order that we have experts in migration, experts in medical issues and so on will be discussed.  The Irish should have their own migration experts on the ground in Sicily and Greece, if necessary, in order that we can assess for ourselves those who are true refugees who need to come here.<\/p><p>Europe will have to deal with the issue of economic migrants.  When tens of thousands of young men come in from Bangladesh claiming asylum, \"asylum from what\" is asked.  These are not my words; I am merely reporting what I saw on the ground out there.  There are cases before the European courts at present to stop economic migrants from other countries coming in through the European borders.  There is now a desire - to my mind, a good desire - to set up reception centres on the north African coast in order to deal with the issue in north Africa and put the traffickers out of business.<\/p><p>I wish to deal with the issue of migrants who do get here and the document the Minister of State put together.

I was in the agriculture committee dealing with legislation.<\/p><p>We must always remind ourselves, particularly as public representatives in these Houses, that Ireland is the only country in the world that has a population today lower than it was in the 1800s.  That is our history and our reality.  It is a history of emigration.  In many instances - arguably, in most instances - we were not asylum seekers; we were leaving for economic reasons.  We were leaving for work and new opportunities.  In the recent economic crisis, the reason our unemployment statistics were not as bad as those in, for example, Spain or Greece, was the escape valve - for Government, the safety valve - of emigration.  Huge numbers again emigrated to Canada, Australia, some to the United States and Britain and so on.  This has been our history, and despite this history, we probably have the highest levels of emigration of any country in the world historically <i>per capita.<\/i>Despite this history, our approach to asylum seekers, people who come here in desperation from war-torn areas, has been shameful.<\/p><p>I do not accuse the Minister of State of this because he is someone of integrity who is trying to deal with the system.  However, the former Minister of State, Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, hit the nail on the head.  We have a deal with the people in the Department of Justice and Equality, who always put in one's ear the words &quot;unintended consequences&quot; and &quot;the pull factor&quot; and argue that if we put in place a humanitarian system of direct provision or whatever, huge numbers will come to Ireland.  Ireland is, I think, one of only two countries in the EU that does not allow asylum seekers the right to work.  Even after six months, we do not allow them to work.  I think the other country in Europe that did not sign up to the EU approach actually had better practices than ours in place and it felt the EU standards were not up to its standards.  We are, therefore, the worst offenders in Europe regarding the issue of the right to work, and this has not been addressed.  I was Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  The Minister of State knows that we visited asylum centres and direct provision centres, and we compiled our reports.  I appreciate the Ombudsman has oversight, but so much in those reports remains to be implemented.  Even the McMahon report, as the former Minister of State, Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, said, which represents a compromised position, remains to be implemented.  We must do better than this.  I will not lay into the Minister of State because he is an honourable man and he cares about this matter as much as I do.  However, we must do better and show better leadership on these issues.<\/p><p>I know the Minister of State will meet with Places of Sanctuary Ireland tomorrow and it will make a presentation to the Houses.  It has outlined a number of issues, including the right to work, State-funded third level education and the situation whereby children are left blowing in the wind after sitting the leaving certificate.  We must do better.  Places of Sanctuary Ireland has also identified family reunification and English language provision as issues.  The latter is referred to in the Minister of State's migrant integration strategy but, again, we must do better.<\/p><p>I have come across an issue about which I am worried.  I refer to the placement of Syrian refugees throughout the State.  What is happening is that the Department of Justice and Equality is telling local authorities the number of refugees coming to their areas and that they need to house them.  This will create tension unnecessarily.  Everyone must work with the scheme of letting priorities - that is, the points system - that is in place.  It is a fair and just system for housing allocation, and it is in place across the State.  If one bypasses the system, one creates tensions unnecessarily.  I urge the Minister of State to consider that the Department of Justice and Equality would have a dedicated housing section that works in co-operation with local authorities to identify properties that are available for the housing assistance payment.  This would mean one would not be pitting people on the housing list who are desperate to have housing against incoming refugees.  We do not need that tension.  There is a way of providing secure, safe housing for refugees without pitting them against people on the housing list, and I ask the Minister of State to consider this through the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>This is the second time I have had a chance to engage with the Minister of State on this, and I say again that considering our history, of all the nations in the EU, we should be doing so much better and showing much more leadership on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#MM00600","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad and welcome the opportunity to comment on the migrant integration strategy.

Like millions of Irish people, I was an economic migrant.  I graduated from UCC in the bleak 1980s when there were no jobs or opportunities.  I followed my then boyfriend, now husband, to London.  It was a case of family reunification.  I stayed there for 17 years.<\/p><p>Migration is a complex issue.  It is neither black nor white, all pluses nor all minuses.  It is a balance of give and take.  Reflecting on my own experience, I contributed to and benefitted from the society in which I lived.  During my time in London, I worked and paid taxes - local, the poll tax and even water charges.  I was an active citizen who volunteered at the local disability centre and joined and played a role in a political party.  My husband was a school governor.  We gave back to the community.  However, I also signed on, did a postgraduate degree in Southampton with subsidised accommodation, availed of free health care through the NHS, received child benefit and got free books for my children from a local school where 31 languages were spoken.  That school played a key role in making me feel like a full participant through intercultural exchange and the type of thoughtful local leadership displayed by Senator Hopkins in her home town of Ballaghaderreen.<\/p><p>From that experience, I have a few questions for the Minister of State on our plans for the integration of migrant communities in Ireland.  I am concerned about the habitual residence condition, HRC, which excludes people from supports for their first two years in Ireland.  It arises time and again in the homeless sector and often makes a bad situation much worse.  How many people are affected by the HRC, how consistently is it applied, what is its core purpose and does that purpose still stand in light of Brexit?  In a similar vein, I note there is no mention of any action to support the 26,000 undocumented people in Ireland despite the fact that the Government is pushing for a scheme for the undocumented Irish in the US.  I recognise the hypocrisy in this that Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in outlined.<\/p><p>Access to education is a key driver for integration.  Migrants and NGOs like Nasc in Cork have long called for the expansion of the free fees initiative to include children of migrant parents who are currently ineligible.  Many of these parents, who are working and contributing to the economy, find that they are faced with EU fees when trying to access education for their children.  This is unfair and acts as a barrier to education.  This is particularly true for children of work permit holders.  Will the Minister of State examine this matter?<\/p><p>The definition of \"migrant\" in the strategy remains narrow.  For example, it excludes asylum seekers and there are no measures to address their integration needs.  Like many of our EU counterparts, the integration process should begin from the point of arrival, ensuring that those who eventually remain in Ireland having come through the asylum process can make the smooth transition from institutional living in direct provision to life in the community.  A report by the Oireachtas petitions committee, chaired by Senator Mac Lochlainn, in May 2015 found that segregationist direct provision was not fit for purpose.  This finding was consistent with the McMahon working group report, which was commissioned by Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and published in June 2016.<\/p><p>Like Senators Lawless, Conway, &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Black, Mac Lochlainn and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, I would like to know whether the application process has improved since that report, whether it is still dogged by delays and how many people have leave to remain but are stuck because of a lack of affordable housing.  Senator Mac Lochlainn's helpful suggestion is one that should be considered.  Is direct provision covered by the Ombudsman?  Does freedom of information legislation apply to all of its aspects, including the provision of goods, services and contracts?  Given that people are living for years on end in direct provision, will those centres now be inspected by HIQA?  Have advances been made on giving people the right to work or programmes to help people who have leave to remain to get employment, training or education?  Are there plans to increase the paltry allowance to enable people to live an integrated life?  I am aware of inconsistencies.  For example, one direct provision centre in Cork has a bus service five times per day whereas another centre has one just once per week.<\/p><p>On a related issue, Ireland has promised to take 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers by September 2017.  How close are we to meeting that target?  I support Nasc's call for a new, safe and legal migration route for people fleeing conflict and who have someone willing to sponsor them in Ireland.  The proposed scheme would introduce a humanitarian admission programme for Irish citizens, beneficiaries of international protection and-or legal residents to apply for family reunification, similar to the Syrian humanitarian admission programme that was introduced for a limited time in 2014.  It would also allow members of Irish society to co-sponsor family reunification applications by providing financial, social and institutional backing, thus improving a person's opportunities for integration and easing the financial burden on the host family and the Government.  This is a pragmatic, cost effective and efficient solution that ensures the safety of those seeking protection while promoting integration and reuniting families.  Many people already legally resident in Ireland are desperately seeking to bring family members out of conflict zones and have adequate resources to support them, but the International Protection Act makes that difficult.<\/p><p>From my first-hand experience as an economic migrant, I know how programmes and strategies can make migration a win-win for people like me, our families and the countries in which we find ourselves.  I thank the Minister of State for listening and for giving of his time to this important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#MM00700","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  In his book <i>Good Strategy\/Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why it Matters<\/i>, the American management professor Richard Rumelt says, &quot;strategy is primarily about deciding what is truly important, and focusing resources and action on that objective&quot;.  With this in mind, I welcome the Government's migration integration strategy.  Ensuring that migrants receive all possible State and civic support is essential for their well-being and the well-being of the nation.  I welcome the objective of identifying and removing barriers to integration in Ireland and the plan attached to achieve these goals.  The 76 specific actions in the strategy are comprehensive.  It is encouraging to note that the initiative runs for a four-year period instead of a longer timeframe that could have seen inertia creep in despite the vision expressed in the framework.<\/p><p>Regardless of whether we acknowledge it, a great deal of private and public racism and discrimination still exist in Ireland.  There are people in society who have found it difficult to accept the presence of non-nationals who have arrived in the past few decades.  In some places, migrants are still seen as a threat and as being different in the way they speak, dress, worship or socialise.  They are still seen as the other, as not belonging here, not Irish or just not Irish enough.<\/p><p>Growing pains in a nation facing multiculturalism are not new, but the migration integration strategy is timely, given that it is published against a backdrop of nationalist sentiment around the globe that often seeks to vilify non-nationals, creating associated xenophobia and populism.  Indeed, the Irish Government has tightened immigration through the International Protection Act 2015.  I recently called for changes in the administrative processes involved so as to give asylum seekers a fairer chance of being considered as future citizens of the State.<\/p><p>The social, economic, cultural and political diversity that multiculturalism brings to Ireland enriches our society and is particularly healthy for young children, who are interacting with peers from a variety of countries.  It has brought with it a large number of new denominational, non-denominational and evangelical churches nationwide.  Census 2016 shows that the number of Muslims living in Ireland increased from 49,200 to 63,400 over the preceding five years.  Members of the Romanian, Lithuanian, Polish, British and other communities have built thriving business enterprises that have created employment opportunities, while highly-skilled migrants are working as barristers, doctors, teachers and other professionals.<\/p><p>The aspirations and actions planned in the integration strategy are comprehensive, but ongoing development and, crucially, funding are needed for its implementation so that we can move from the realm of paper to that of progress.  In order for the strategy to succeed, it needs to have greater visibility in the public sphere.  I am concerned that it will remain a worthwhile theoretical document full of guiding principles to be consulted as a reference manual but not something to be delivered upon just because people are not aware of it.  To transform the integration blueprint into a dynamic entity, it needs to be communicated and debated widely.  To this end, it would be worth initiating a public information campaign across radio, television, print and online media.  This would sell the strategy's key message to a larger audience, that message being that successful integration is the responsibility of Irish society as a whole and will, to cite the strategy, require &quot;action by Government, public bodies, service providers, businesses, NGOs but also by local communities&quot;.  It is not a perfect strategy, but it is a good roadmap to have in creating long-lasting intercultural equality.<\/p><p>According to Professor Rumelt, the core content of a strategy is the diagnosis of the difficulty involved, an overall framework for combating the obstacles and coherent, co-ordinated action.  This strategy has identified the difficulties involved, provided a framework and outlined a series of actions that need to be taken, and I hope that the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, will secure as much in resources as is needed and is possible towards implementing it in full.<\/p><p>It would be impossible for me to ignore or not welcome the comments of colleagues in the House about the cruel direct provision system that Ireland still has.  I often think of Voltaire's <i>Candide<\/i>and the idea that it is good to shoot an admiral from time to time &quot;<i>pour encourager les autres<\/i>&quot;.  It seems that this is how the direct provision is meant to work - to discourage others by providing for a system that fails to recognise the dignity of each human person.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In February 2017 the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, claimed in the second progress report on the implementation of the McMahon report recommendations that 92% of its recommendations had been implemented.  This seems like political spin because, absent the fundamental things such as the right to education, work, and normal family life which are essential to the dignity of a person, the percentage of recommendations implemented simply cannot impress.<\/p><p>We need to rethink what type of society we have.  The proclamation in the porch of Leinster House, which Members frequently show to visitors, contains the famous phrase that says we should cherish all the children of the nation equally.  It was never meant to refer to underage persons but rather to Protestant, Catholic and dissenter.  How can we congratulate ourselves on securing any kind of equality in our country when there is an entire class of people on our shores whose dignity is affronted by the lack of basic rights such as the right to work or prepare a meal for one's children in State-provided accommodation?  While we have this system, we have a reason to be thoroughly ashamed of ourselves.  <\/p><p>There are many non-State actors who deserve to be commended on their actions while the State fails to get to grips with this situation.  My alma mater, the National University of Ireland, Galway, awards inclusive centenary scholarships that give high achievers among the new Irish, including refugees, a chance to go on and succeed in college.  I hope the day comes when any young person in Ireland, whether living in a direct provision centre or not and whatever the circumstances in which they came to this country, would not be deprived of the opportunity to better themselves through education because that is the fundamental key to human progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#NN00200","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I call Senator Alice Mary Higgins.

A number of the points I wish to raise have been raised by other Senators.  Others have discussed the question of the habitual residency condition and the obstacles it has caused and the problems of the direct provision system, which we still need to move past.  The message conveyed by the Minister of State and the migrant integration strategy is very committed and displays very positive sentiments.<\/p> <p>There is a need for stronger tangible goals and targets.  I recognise some targets have been set in the area of education and employment but in many other areas, the strategy lacks tangible goals.  Opportunities for employment have been discussed but the right to work is still an issue.  As has been said, Ireland is an extraordinary outlier in not allowing the right to work.  That creates extraordinary vulnerability.  People cannot make gaps in their lives suddenly or magically disappear when they have spent two, three or seven years in the direct provision or asylum system only to be suddenly told they are now migrants who have opportunities.  The asylum process has damaged individuals and families and is still doing so.<\/p> <p>The proposal should be explicitly based on a stronger human rights and equality basis.  The issue is not individuals integrating but rather Ireland being an equal society.  Racism and discrimination, which are the flipside of equality, need to be named more strongly because at a time of much xenophobia and racism across Europe, we need to be robust in having policies that acknowledge discrimination and racism and take action to stem them.<\/p> <p>The International Protection Act 2015 brought in a single application procedure.  The Act has had chaotic consequences for individuals and families, particularly in recent months, as people struggle to fill in multi-page applications under very tight deadlines with thinly-stretched legal support.  There are problems in how we are currently dealing with international protection.  A welcoming committee when an applicant comes out the other side is not enough.  We need to give genuine and meaningful support to people as they attempt to navigate the process.  The International Protection Act has failed to do so and has created difficulty in that regard.  It has had very troubling consequences in respect of family reunification because the concept of family that is allowed to most people in this State is not the same as that which is recognised under our current family reunification laws.  That is discriminatory.  <\/p> <p>I welcome the strategy and the signal it sends for Ireland and the role we want to play in positive integration.  We are a country of migrants and have an international responsibility to give a positive narration in that regard.  I congratulate Senator Hopkins and others who have worked to bring that to a local level.  We will be celebrating Africa Day on Sunday, which is another opportunity for us to celebrate the positive aspects that diversity has brought and will continue to bring to our society.  I commend all those who have worked on such initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#OO00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I have five minutes but I would need five hours to respond to the very good points made by Senators.  I would love to engage longer on many points with Senators.  Perhaps I will be able to do so individually at a later stage.  I thank all Members for their contributions on this very important subject.<\/p> <p>The integration strategy committee will shortly be established.  It will set out clear targets, goals and so on.  I will be chairing the committee.  It will have a co-ordinating and monitoring function, which will be a key mechanism for driving and tracking progress of the strategy.  Integration is an issue for all of society, not just the Government.  Everybody in society is involved as the community and voluntary sector will also be represented on the committee, along with leading NGOs and I look forward to getting stuck in and getting to work on that.<\/p> <p>There are many dimensions to this issue, including local level, political level, schools and workplaces.  There are countless ways we can relate to one another every day.  This strategy represents a long term commitment to proactively addressing the issue.  It is intended to be a living document.  As its implementation will take place in a changing and dynamic environment, it too must be dynamic in its approach and capable of adaptation when required.  <\/p> <p>There has been much discussion of direct provision.  There are approximately 800,000 people living in the State who were born outside of Ireland.  There are approximately 4,500 people in direct provision.  Fewer than 600 of those people have been there for more than five years.  We want to reduce the time people spend in direct provision and the International Protection Act is doing that.  That was the big issue.  If decisions are made in a short period, successful applicants will get the right to work sooner than in a protracted asylum process.  The amount of time spent in the process, which was the issue, has been reduced.   If a person arrives in Ireland tonight and says he or she wants asylum, he or she is guaranteed bed, board, heat, food and safety in a direct provision centre.  I have visited most of them.  We are working extremely hard to upgrade them.  Can any Senator tell me what we can put in their place that would work if people were to arrive to Ireland tonight and claim asylum?  Where would those people go?  Should they be given vouchers or money?  What should be done?  People criticise direct provision.  Many people have never been in a centre or have not been in a centre recently to see the changes that have taken place such as that families are now permitted to cook for themselves.  We want to move people out of these centres by making a decision on their status, after which either they can stay here or they must go back to where they came from.  We also need an immigration policy.  Not everybody who arrives here has a right to stay here so we must keep that in mind.<\/p> <p>I substantially addressed the issue of funding in my opening remarks.  There is funding available.  Each Department is supposed to come up with its own funding.  Each Department, such as the Departments of Education and Skills, Health and so on, is also putting funding into this.  <\/p> <p>I take the point Senators raised about dedicating housing.  We are trying hard to house people.  There are approximately 400 people currently in direct provision for whom we cannot find homes.  The Department is working very hard on that issue.  We are trying to find another emergency reception and orientation centre, EROC.  The EROCs we have are filling up very quickly.  We have attempted to obtain new EROCs but cannot do so.  I also have asked NGOs if they are interested in running direct provision centres.  I am waiting for any of them to agree to do so.  Other countries do that.  If an NGO can prove it can run a direct provision centre, it is welcome to do so.<\/p> <p>The issue of habitual residence condition will have to be revisited.  I am very aware of the issue of undocumented migrants and work is under way on it.  Third-level fees are addressed in the strategy.  It is recognised as an issue and will have to be considered.  Our strategy attempts to address it.<\/p> <p>The issue of language acquisition is very important.  Senator Hopkins mentioned the good work in Ballaghaderreen.  There was initial concern but the Senator is correct that the people of Ballaghaderreen stepped up to the plate and are a positive example for the rest of the country.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I get more people contacting me to ask how they can help and what they can do to assist.  Many community groups do that.  We get many people looking for small sums of money from the community integration fund.  A lot can be done with a small sum of money if there is goodwill behind it, so I want to give people help to do that.<\/p><p>If Senators know about specific issues and problems, I want to know about them.  I would ask them, please, not to make speeches in the Chamber based on a generalisation but to give me specifics.  If there is a family or individual under pressure in a direct provision centre or if there is something going wrong, I ask them to tell me.  I ask also that they please check before that the information is up to date, that it is not something that happened three or four years ago, that it is not a \"d&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i\" type of thing, and that it is true and happening.  I want to know, as do the officials, and we want to move quickly if something is happening that should not be and is a cause for concern.  I promise we will move on it, but I ask Senators if they could, please, be careful about repeating things they have read in the newspapers or that was heard somewhere else.  They should give me specific examples with names, dates and places and I promise I will follow up on them.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their engagement.  I ask them to keep thinking, supporting and working and to stay positive.  There are many good things happening and many very good people are coming to Ireland who can really contribute and be part of our society, but we must integrate and work together.  There are 800,000 people who have come to Ireland and 100,000 new citizens in the last while.  The citizens' ceremonies were mentioned.  They are amazing and absolutely emotional.  If Senators have not been to one, they should try to get to one and they will see what is happening there.  Let us try to be positive in our approach.  Senator Mullen mentioned what was happening in the Mediterranean and other places, which is unbelievable.  We are worried about the global situation and what is happening in Africa and beyond.  There are huge challenges.  We will do our bit as a small country to try to influence change, but the challenges are enormous.  I do not know where it will end up but there is no doubt that Europe is under pressure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#OO00400","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Bill 2016: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1494941400,"counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#PP00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1494941400,"counter":236,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":237,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#PP00500","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1494941400,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 1:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I thank the House for its public consideration of this legislation and the opportunity to take Committee and Remaining Stages of the Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Bill today.  It is a relatively short Bill but it is important legislation designed to counter cybercrime, in particular that involving information systems and their data, and the timeframe and offences and penalties for this kind of activity.  I am pleased to recall that Senators generally welcomed and broadly supported this legislation on Second Stage, displaying a shared determination to combat cybercrime against communications and information infrastructure which is so vital to us all in the modern world.<\/p> <p>I bring forward one Government amendment to the Bill, which is technical in nature, together with a number of minor consequential amendments.  Therefore, I propose to take the three amendments together, dealing with the main amendment first and then outlining the consequential revisions.<\/p> <p>The main amendment is No. 3 on the list of amendments and relates to section 9 which deals with the liability of corporate bodies for offences under the Bill and is designed to give effect to Article 10 of the EU directive on attacks against information systems which this Bill seeks to transpose.  Following further consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, it has been found necessary to revise section 9 to ensure Article 10 is correctly provided for and fully transposed, in particular Article 10.2 which relates to the liability of a body corporate for the commission of an offence by a relevant person under its authority due to a lack of supervision or control by the body corporate.<\/p> <p>Section 9(1) gives effect to Article 10.2 of the directive.  Section 9(2) provides for a defence for a body corporate in respect of subsection 9(1) if it can prove that it took all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of the offence.  Section 9(3) clarifies that where an offence under the Act is committed by a body corporate, liability shall rest with the person acting on behalf of the corporate body as well as the corporate body itself.  This is essentially the wording of the original section 9 which is being replaced by this new provision.  Section 9(4)(a) preserves the common law doctrine on corporate criminal liability which the Attorney General's Office has advised encompasses obligations under Article 10.1 of the directive and is broader in scope.  Hence, it is not considered necessary or desirable to legislate for the narrower provision in Article 10.1.  Section 9(4)(b) provides that criminal proceedings may also be taken against perpetrators, inciters of or accessories to offences under the Act.  Section 9(5) provides a definition of \"relevant person\", as referenced in subsection 9(1), and includes a definition of \"subsidiary\".<\/p> <p>I will turn now briefly to the two small consequential amendments to the main amendment to section 9.  The first consequential amendment is to section 1 which deals with interpretation, and involves including the offence created under subsection 9(1) in relation to bodies corporate, as outlined earlier, within the definition of \"relevant offence\" in section 1(1).  This is necessary to ensure an offence under section 9(1) comes within the broader framework relating to relevant offences under the Bill.  References to \"relevant offence\" have particular significance in relation to the operation of this legislation, such as in section 7 relating to search warrants, section 9(1) itself relating to relevant offences committed by a corporate body due to lack of supervision or control, and section 10 which deals with jurisdiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#PP00600","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Is this on the amendment or the sections?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#PP00700","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":241,"content":"<p>We are on the three amendments, Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive.

I refer to the use of behaviour targeted advertisements and the use of end-user consumer information management.  This is a major source of revenue and it relates to behavioural targeting.  The area is largely unregulated.  It is a major revenue source for certain economic actors.  I am speaking about well-known entities such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn and many others.  These are all major and important actors within Irish society.  They also use this form of profit generation.  In view of the lack of regulation in this area, it is also open to use by any start-up or company.  For example, certain companies used such information in active ways in respect of recent elections in the USA and during the Brexit referendum.  I am not implying that these companies are abusing the data but I am concerned about how consumer rights are being protected in this area.  I am also concerned about the vulnerabilities that are evident.  For example, when data is being gathered without appropriate screening or mechanisms for the protection of such data, it is sometimes used to target vulnerable individuals and, in some cases, provoke extremist political reactions.  There is a question over how content and data are being used and how data is being gathered.  There is also a question regarding transparency in respect of the use of data.<\/p> <p>There is little in existing legislation that would stop any new start-up from dramatically abusing extremely detailed data lawfully collected from the system.  I recognise that the Bill deals with non-lawful action in the criminal area, but I am keen to highlight those areas that may be legal but in respect of which regulation and transparency are required.  For example, it would be positive to consider whether transparent algorithms might be provided whereby people can see the way in which they are being targeted or whereby the scope of material they are getting is being narrowed.  Several practical suggestions are open to us.  I am suggesting to the Minister of State that we might have a chance to discuss this in another way or to bring it forward, if not by means of this legislation then through regulation.<\/p> <p>We need to be concerned about this matter in terms of privacy and consumer protection.  It is also very important in the context of the wider sense of politics and extremism, as well as the targeting of people to be recruited into extremist movements.  There has been strong manipulation.  We have also seen how it has been used in terms of mental health issues.<\/p> <p>Section 6 makes clear that it is an offence for a person who does not have lawful authority to use programmes, code or data for illegal purposes.  Will the Minister of State look into the misuse of data that is collected legally?  Will he consider the regulation of the collection of data in greater detail?  Will he investigate what might be done on a national level to protect Irish citizens and all those who reside in Ireland from this form of manipulation or any potential crime that may flow from it?<\/p> <p>I have a comment in respect of section 10.  This is positive and timely legislation.  It is great to see Ireland taking a grip on these issues and addressing them at a time when they are pertinent.  However, I am trying to unpack some other issues - I know it is complicated.  I would like us to take a lead in the context of jumping into those areas as well in order that we do not see some of the extreme situations that have been experienced elsewhere, particularly regarding interference in electoral processes.  The Netherlands has moved back to a paper system of voting, such is the concern of those responsible.  The authorities there have moved back to a paper system on foot of the concern regarding illegal interference in the voting system.  This is one form of interference.  The legislation is the kind of instrument that will help to protect against such outcomes.  There are other forms of interference, manipulation and exploitation and we need to consider them as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017051600002#QQ00800","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1494941400,"counter":257,"content":"<p>The Senator is correct in identifying that this is timely legislation, especially this week.  We can see the potential damage that could be caused to Government agencies, Departments, State agencies, health systems and God knows what else through unlawful interference with those systems.  We were well prepared for it in Ireland and it has not impacted on us to the same extent as it has in other jurisdictions.  However, we have been informed that this might only be the beginning and that both the emergence of more and more malware and further unlawful hacking are possible.<\/p> <p>The Senator referred to the manipulation and use of data.  I contend that data is the new gold; it is extremely valuable.  The question of how it is used or abused is important.  However, that is not what the Bill covers, as such.  In any event, the Senator is right to raise the issue.<\/p> <p>This is a matter of which we need to be aware and in respect of which we might, perhaps, have a public debate.  It all relates to the use, value, and collection of data and so forth.  That is another debate completely.  The Bill relates to interference with systems without lawful authority.  In particular, it relates to information systems, interference with data and so forth, as it is laid down.  This is a short but extremely important item of legislation.  In one way, it is probably one of the most important items legislation with which we are dealing at present.  It is not getting a great deal of attention.  If, however, our systems had been interfered with at the weekend, people would have been calling for it to be brought forward.  That said, the Bill is here now and I thank the Senators for their support for it.

I wonder about the rationale for limiting or curtailing it.  Surely, if an individual is operating in another state - that is likely to be the case - that person should nonetheless be considered liable.  We may not be in a position to prosecute a person operating out of another jurisdiction, but we should be able to recognise it as being an issue of concern.  We may or may not have an extradition agreement with another country where a person has been involved in large-scale hacking or damage of our information systems.  Let us suppose someone is operating out of the Netherlands and engages in some of the activity prohibited in this legislation.  It seems strange that we are precluding ourselves from trying such a person in respect of a crime.

The vulnerability of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom was highlighted by the hacking attacks at the weekend.

I sound a note of caution, however, and ask the Minister of State to examine my concern in this regard.  As Senator Conway stated, we may seek to amend and strengthen the legislation.  I am concerned about the question of jurisdiction because we need to decide if we will relate the action to which the Minister of State referred to the place from which the perpetrator takes that action or the place where the crime has its impact.  If the crime is perpetrated on a citizen in Ireland, for example, we have a duty to protect that citizen and ensure the perpetrator is held accountable, irrespective of whether we are in position to try the perpetrator here.<\/p> <p>A large number of those who conducted the recent malware attacks in the United Kingdom may not be part of a body corporate or resident in the UK but are, nonetheless, targeting UK institutions and have, therefore, committed a crime.

There is a willingness and eagerness among Senators to keep it under constant review and to respond to events.

The benefits of this new and evolving technology are evident, but reliance on such technology can unfortunately mean vulnerability.  New technology creates opportunities for new forms of crime, or at least crime committed in an online environment in cyberspace rather than in physical space as was traditionally the case.  The widely reported global cyberattack last weekend served as a real reminder of the insidious threat of cybercrime.  The unprecedented attack affected some 200,000 systems across more than 150 countries worldwide.  The scale of the problem should not be underestimated.<\/p><p>Europol's European cybercrime centre reports that cybercrime costs EU member states approximately &euro;265 billion per year, with the figure growing to around &euro;900 billion for the global economy.  That is just the financial side of things.  The inherent nature of cybercrime means that it transcends geographical boundaries and is a transnational problem which recognises no borders.  Senator Higgins is on the button when she talks about the international problem.  By strengthening and harmonising our laws across and even beyond Europe, we present a united front against cybercrime to counter its transnational dimension.  As explained previously during the progress of the Bill, this legislation allows Ireland to give effect to an EU directive on attacks against information systems.  The Bill will also give effect to many of the key provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, known as the Budapest Convention.  The legislation before us reflects these international instruments in that it provides for criminal offences in respect of attacks against information systems and establishes effective, proportional and dissuasive penalties for such offences.  The offences provided for relate to information systems and their data.  I will not got through what those offences are.<\/p><p>It is incumbent on the Government and the Legislature to seek to safeguard these systems, which are part of our daily lives in the modern world, as the Senator has said.  These systems are increasingly relied upon by governments, businesses and individual citizens alike.  It is vital that we seek to protect them and maintain users' confidence in their safety and reliability.  The legislation ensures that unlawful activities relating to information systems are criminalised and that strong penalties are in place to both deter and punish offenders, of up to ten years' imprisonment in the most serious cases.  The Bill seeks to protect vital infrastructures for the benefit of all and to ensure there are no legislative gaps that can be exploited by those who seek to undermine information systems and their data.<\/p><p>I thank the Senators for their support and agree with them that we have to keep this area under observation and scrutiny.  It is changing by the hour and more threats are emerging and will emerge.  This is an important step and the first piece of legislation in this area.
