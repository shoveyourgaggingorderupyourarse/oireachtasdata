These include three schemes with particular relevance to businesses that have been negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme makes lending available to SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees) seeking financing for long-term strategic investment, including in response to the impacts of Brexit and COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in 2019 and initially provided for up to &euro;300m in long-term lending, however in July of 2020 it was expanded by &euro;500m to make a total of &euro;800m available through participating financial providers. <\/p>  <p>  As of 22 March 2021, 3,246 loans have been sanctioned through the Future Growth Loan Scheme to the value of &euro;675.61m.<\/p>  <p>  Funding under the scheme is made available through participating finance providers: AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, Permanent TSB, KBC and Close Brothers. While the scheme is not fully subscribed as of yet, the scheme has seen rapid uptake and as such a number of the participating finance providers are currently closed to new applications as they process a &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; of existing applicants. That pipeline is expected to amount to further tens of millions of lending through those participating providers.<\/p>  <p>  At present, Close Brothers and KBC still remain open to new applications under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, which is the largest loan guarantee scheme in the history of the State, also provides for access to finance for investment purposes. The Scheme provides &euro;2 billion in lending, for terms up to five-and-a-half years and offers a range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1m and is available to SMEs and small mid-caps (business with less than 500 employees), including primary producers (businesses engaged in the farming and seafood sectors). I would strongly encourage businesses that are seeking funding for investment purposes in order to respond to, or to mitigate  the impacts of COVID-19 to consider this scheme as an opportunity for addressing their financing needs at this time.<\/p>  <p>  To date (11 March), 3,575 loans have been drawn down by applicants to the scheme, to a total value of &euro;214.73m.<\/p>  <p>  For businesses seeking shorter-term working capital in response to the pandemic, the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme facilitates loans to eligible businesses as they seek to innovate, change or adapt in response to COVID-19. Loans under this scheme are for terms of up to three years and range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m. This scheme is also open to SMEs and small mid-caps. <\/p>  <p>  To date (19 March), 1,009 loans have progressed to sanction under this scheme, to a total value of &euro;136.69m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500065#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Communications","counter":7,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500065#WRA00600"},{"type":"question","counter":8,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[16002\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500065#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the dedicated email addresses for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to contact his Department and bodies under its aegis as outlined in circular 25\/2016.","asker":"1468","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":9,"content":"<p>The table below lists the email addresses at which members of the Oireachtas can contact the state bodies under the aegis of my Department, as required by circular 25\/2016. <table>    <tr>       <th>State Body<\/th>       <th>Email address<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Personal Injuries Assessment Board<\/td>       <td>oireachtas@injuriesboard.ie <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority<\/td>       <td>oireachtas_members@iaasa.ie <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Competition and Consumer Protection Commission<\/td>       <td>oireachtas@ccpc.ie <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>IDA Ireland<\/td>       <td>Orla.NicMhathuna@ida.ie<br \/><br \/>Mary.Seery@ida.ie <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Intertrade Ireland<\/td>       <td>info@intertradeireland.com <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Intellectual Property Office of Ireland<\/td>       <td>ipinfo@ipoi.gov.ie <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Labour Court<\/td>       <td>info@labourcourt.ie <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Workplace Relations Commission<\/td>       <td>customerservice@workplacerelations.ie <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Health and Safety Authority<\/td>       <td>oireachtas@hsa.ie <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>National Standards Authority of Ireland<\/td>       <td>oireachtasmembers@nsai.ie <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland<\/td>       <td>GovernmentRelations@enterprise-ireland.com<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500065#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500065#WRA00900"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[16028\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500065#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the number of protected disclosures received by his Department in each of the years 2017 to 2020 and to date in 2021; the number that were accepted as a protected disclosure; the number that were in part or fully examined by a third party or consultancy; the number of protected disclosures under investigation over this period; and the number that were finalised and the contents accepted and acted on.","asker":"1489","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[16046\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500065#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the number of protected disclosures received by his Department in each of the years 2017 to 2020 and to date in 2021 from officials within his Department; the number of officials who made protected disclosures over the period and who are now not working in his Department; and the number of protected disclosures received from retired officials of his Department over the period.","asker":"1489","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.<\/p>  <p>  I'm informed that my Department received three matters raised as protected disclosures and was copied on a fourth in 2017; one in 2018; two in 2019; two in 2020 and none to date in 2021.

A key action within the National Remote Work Strategy is to extend the mapping and classifications of hubs - as completed by Western Development Commission on the Atlantic Economic Corridor - across the country to develop national data on hub infrastructure. Enterprise Ireland is actively working to support the implementation of this strategy through mapping and classification of hubs; mapping regional and local need to inform future investment in enterprise centres\/hubs; and investment in remote work hubs and infrastructure in under-served areas thus underpinning the development of the national hubs network.<\/p>  <p>  On 20 November 2020, I announced &euro;8.24m in grants for 95 Enterprise Centres around the country administered through Enterprise Ireland. The funding will ensure that the Enterprise Centres, many of which have been negatively impacted by COVID-19, can sustain their businesses, pivot and further develop their services to support the next wave of Irish start-up companies. Enterprise Centres provide important infrastructure for entrepreneurs and are an essential part of the start-up ecosystem across Ireland. The Centres, many of which are regionally based, provide space, mentoring and support to start-up founders and teams, helping them to scale internationally.<\/p>  <p>  To date, my Department has provided funding of &euro;250 million to support the establishment of approximately 270 enterprise centres throughout Ireland and administered by Enterprise Ireland.

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of their products.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, working to protect insurance policyholders during and after the COVID-19 crisis is a priority issue for Government. As such, it is included within the Programme for Government and the Action Plan for Insurance Reform, launched in December.

Last year, most of the main insurers agreed to offer a range of common forbearance measures, including a reduction in premiums for business customers to reflect reduced level of exposure as a result of COVID-19 restrictions for Employer \/Public Liability and Commercial Motor. \u00a0Insurers also announced that they would maintain cover for unoccupied commercial buildings\/premises not in use due to these restrictions, for a maximum of 90 days (appropriate supervision and security of the premises is required). <\/p>  <p>  I note Insurance Ireland announced a continuance of forbearance measures on behalf of a number of its members in late January.\u00a0 In the coming weeks Minister of State Fleming will again meet with the main insurers to discuss their response to the recently published Personal Injuries Guidelines.\u00a0 The insurance industry&rsquo;s ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic will also be included on the agenda for these meetings.

The Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR)<\/b><\/p><p>The Government intends to further enhance the Central Bank&rsquo;s existing powers through new legislation to be introduced in the Central Bank (Amendment) Bill. <\/p><p>The centrepiece of the new legislation is the Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR), a commitment of the Programme for Government, which seeks to improve the culture of the financial sector and restore public trust in the sector. SEAR is expected to drive positive changes in terms of culture in the financial services industry and enhanced accountability while simplifying the taking of sanctions against individuals who fail in their financial sector roles.<\/p><p>The proposed legislation will seek to address proposals put forward by the Central Bank arising from the recommendations in its Culture Report which was requested by me on foot of the Tracker Mortgage Examination.\u00a0<\/p><p>The legislation is intended to drive greater accountability in the financial sector, raising the standards of expected behaviour for individuals and firms, in order to achieve better outcomes for consumers and improve the sustainability of the financial system.<\/p><p><b>2. Banking Union<\/b><\/p><p>Development of the European Banking Union began in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The European Commission pursued a number of initiatives to create a safer financial sector for the Single Market, consisting of a set of legislative texts that are applied to all financial institutions and all financial products across the EU which are designed to ensure that Europe has a safer banking sector which can support the financing needs of the economy. Specifically, its rules include capital requirements for banks, rules for managing failing banks and improved deposit guarantee schemes. Departmental Officials attend EU working groups to ensure Irish opinions and the specificities of the Irish Financial Sector are considered in the development of new regulations.<\/p><p>The completion and improvement of the Banking Union is a priority and recently, the Department completed the transposition of the &ldquo;Risk Reduction Measures&rdquo; Package of reforms which updated existing rules to keep them in line with standards agreed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. These reforms included new supports for investments in infrastructure and increased supports for lending to SMEs, revised regulations regarding remuneration practices and a new moratorium power to suspend an institution&rsquo;s payment obligations during a resolution process.<\/p><p><b>3. Digital Finance Package<\/b><\/p><p>The European Commission published the Digital Finance Package in September 2020 containing measures developed to further enable and support the potential of digital finance in terms of innovation and competition while mitigating risks.<\/p><p>The Package contained a number of components &ndash; both legislative proposals and Commission Communications &ndash; including a proposal for a Regulation and Directive on Digital Operational Resilience (DORA), a proposal for a Regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) and a Commission Communication on a Retail Payments Strategy.\u00a0<\/p><p>The suite of measures proposed promotes and enables a more digitalised financial services sector across Europe by regulating emerging technologies such as crypto-assets, evaluating existing legislation such as the Payment Services Directive 2 and the Electronic Money Directive and setting out a framework for a more resilient and stable financial services sector. At the same time, the proposals help to protect consumers in this changing environment.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The Digital Finance Package allows for a more digitalised financial services sector in Europe which could in future be less reliant on physical bank branches and traditional payment methods such as banknotes and coins. However, financial inclusion remains a priority and the Commission&rsquo;s proposals include measures minimise financial exclusion such as ensuring cash usage and acceptance across Europe.<\/p><p><b>4. COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme<\/b><\/p><p>The extension of the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is a welcome development that will ensure ongoing availability of credit throughout the remainder of this year to our vitally important SME sector who are facing the significant challenges of not only COVID-19 but also adjusting to Brexit.\u00a0 It demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s broader commitment to ensure that SMEs have the right tools and supports to secure their viability.<\/p><p>In particular, I welcome the recent expansion in the on-lenders to beyond the retail banks, including 19 credit unions spread between three groups and non-bank lenders.\u00a0 This extension means that more SMEs will be able to access credit from an increased diversity of sources in both bank and non-bank credit.<\/p><p>With regard to the provision of financial services in rural areas, the Department of Finance published a paper in 2019 by Indecon Consulting on an Evaluation of the Concept of Community Banking in Ireland (). The report highlighted the large number of post offices and credit unions that are spread right across the country in addition to the bank networks. This was a follow on to a previous paper on Local Public Banking published by the Department of Finance in 2018. The Indecon report concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a public banking system in Ireland, supporting the outcome of the previous report on Local Public Banking.<\/p><p><b>Credit Unions\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p>The Credit Union Act, 1997 (the 1997 Act) and the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 set out the services that credit unions may provide to their members. These include loans and savings under the 1997 Act and a further suite of services under the 2016 Regulations such as third party payments; ATM services; bureau de change and certain insurance services on an agency basis. I understand that a number of credit unions provide some of the services provided for under the 2016 Regulations. Where a credit union wishes to provide other services to its members, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such services in accordance with the provisions set out in sections 48-51 of the 1997 Act.<\/p><p>One such additional service includes the Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS). In 2016, the Central Bank defined and described a suite of additional services known as MPCAS, under which approved credit unions may offer personal current accounts with debit cards, overdrafts and a wide range of payment services within an appropriate risk framework.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>An Post Services<\/b><\/p><p>There is a significant network of post offices in areas where there is no bank branch within five kilometres. In addition, An Post offers financial services including a payment account, personal loans, credit cards, a range of insurances, money transmission and foreign exchange services. An Post offers counter services for AIB, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches.\u00a0<\/p><p>As noted above,\u00a0Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s new partnership with An Post to provide a range of banking services means that\u00a0there will be a post office within, on average, less than 500 metres of the branches that are being closed. The Bank confirmed that the new partnership with An Post will be available to all Bank of Ireland customers before any branch closes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500067#WRC05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500068#WRD00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Communications","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500068#WRD00300"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[16010\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500068#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the dedicated email addresses for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to contact his Department and bodies under its aegis as outlined in circular 25\/2016.","asker":"1468","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":136,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department can be contacted by e-mail at minister@per.gov.ie.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Circular 25\/2016\u00a0states that State Bodies under the aegis of Government Departments must provide and maintain a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members.\u00a0 The relevant information in respect of\u00a0the bodies under the aegis of my Department is set out in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Office of Public Works <\/th>       <th>ministersoffice@opw.ie\u00a0<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Public Appointments Service <\/td>       <td>oireachtasqueries@publicjobs.ie<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>National Shared Services Office <\/td>       <td>oireachtas@nsso.gov.ie<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>State Laboratory <\/td>       <td>SLOireachtasRequests@statelab.ie<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Office of the Regulator of the\u00a0National Lottery <\/td>       <td>oireachtas@rnl.ie <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Office of the   Ombudsman (and Office of the Information Commissioner;

Ireland has endeavoured to share its experiences from the implementation of the Act with the European Commission and fellow Member States throughout the process of development, negotiation and implementation of the Directive.<\/p>  <p>  The first formal proposals for the Whistleblowing Directive were published by the Commission in April 2018. Prior to this, officials from my Department provided input into a number of questionnaires and workshops run by the Commission, which helped inform its thinking in developing these proposals. Officials from my Department were also involved throughout the process of negotiating the final text of the Directive through regular attendance at meetings of the Working Party on Fundamental Rights, Citizens Rights and Free Movement of Persons (FREMP) throughout 2018 and 2019. Since the Directive was adopted, officials from my Department have been active participants in the Commission Expert Group established to assist Member States transposing the Directive. Officials have also been in direct biliateral communication with the Commission on numerous occasions regarding various technical matters relating to Ireland's transposition of the Directive. These engagements will continue throughout the transposition process.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The deadline for transposition of the Directive is 17 December 2021. A public consultation on the areas of the Directive where Ireland has discretion as regards implementation was held last year.

The organisation has confirmed that it will continue to ensure that effective and practical supports are available to businesses to protect them from the effects of COVID-19 and Brexit. It has\u00a0conducted various surveys with its clients in recent months to identify the supports required by Gaeltacht companies and will continue to work closely with my Department and other

It is an important feature of the act that schools can only make a decision on an application for admission that is based on the schools admission policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500070#WRF02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Communications","counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500070#WRF02500"},{"type":"question","counter":266,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[16001\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500070#WRF02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the dedicated email addresses for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to contact her Department and bodies under its aegis as outlined in circular 25\/2016.","asker":"1468","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":267,"content":"<p>The details sought by the Deputy, in regard to dedicated email addresses for both my Department and in regard to the bodies under the aegis of my Department, are contained in the table below.<\/p><p><b>Contact E-Mail Addresses for the Department of Education and Aegis Bodies under the Remit of the Department<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Name of Department<\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">Dedicated Email address for the Members of the Oireacthas<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Department of Education<\/td>       <td colspan=\"2\">Oireachtasqueries@education.gov.ie<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Name of aegis Body under remit of Department<\/td>       <td>Dedicated Email address for the Members of the Oireacthas<\/td>       <td>Designated Official Responsible for assisting Oireachtas Members<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>An Chomhairle um Oideachais Gaeltachta<br \/><br \/>agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (Note 1)<\/td>       <td>oireachtas@cogg.ie<\/td>       <td>muireann@cogg.ie<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Educational Research Centre<\/td>       <td>oireachtas.queries@erc.ie<\/td>       <td>jude.cosgrove@erc.ie<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>National Centre for Guidance in Education<\/td>       <td>oireachtas@ncge.ie<\/td>       <td>Jennifer.mckenzie@ncge.ie<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>National Council for Curriculum and Assessment  (Note 2)<\/td>       <td>oireactasqueries@ncca.ie  <\/td>       <td>Aine.ArmstrongFarrell@ncca.ie<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>State Examinations Commission<\/td>       <td>Oireachtas@examinations.ie<\/td>       <td>Paddy.Quinn@examinations.ie<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>The Teaching Council<\/td>       <td>pqrep@teachingcouncil.ie<\/td>       <td>Tom&aacute;s &Oacute;

This is available at www.gov.ie\/backtoschool\/.<\/p>  <p>  The operational supports include funding of approx. &euro;84.7 million so that schools can employ replacement teachers, SNAs and administrative staff. There is additional funding of &euro;41.2 million, for substitution in primary schools. This funding provides more certainty on the availability of substitutes for primary schools and cover substitutions that are not covered by existing schemes. <\/p>  <p>  The Supply Panel Scheme for primary schools has being expanded nationwide and over 300 posts have been allocated to provide substitute cover through these panels. The purpose of supply panels is to support schools to manage the sick leave and other absences, including Absence due to Covid-19, by having a supply of teachers to meet substitution needs when required. Schools will also continue to be able to access substitute teachers through the normal process, particularly if they are not connected to a supply panel. The arrangements for schools accessing substitution are set out in Circular 0045\/2020.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also put in place a number of measures to support the supply of teachers, including the Teaching Council contacting approximately 6,000 registered teachers who were not teaching, to encourage their participation to support the return to school; new induction arrangements for teachers who had qualified outside of the state; flexible arrangements for post graduate student teachers on placement in post-primary schools to take up paid substitution hours over and above their placement requirements; lifting the restrictions on the number of days that teachers on career break or job sharing may be employed as substitute teachers. All of these measures have increased the availability of teachers for substitution.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recognises that notwithstanding the range of measures put in place, some schools may experience challenges in accessing a substitute in the short term. My Department is working closely with our partners to work through these challenges when they arise in a particular school, and will continue to keep the current substitution arrangements under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500070#WRF03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":272,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500070#WRF03200"},{"type":"question","counter":273,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[16027\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500070#WRF03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of protected disclosures received by her Department in each of the years 2017 to 2020 and to date in 2021;

My Department is monitoring developments in this regard very closely. <\/p>  <p>  From the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, significant work has been undertaken by a stakeholder group chaired by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), and including the representative bodies of education providers and students to address issues relating to the maintenance of the quality and standards of:<\/p>  <p>  -  teaching and learning, <\/p>  <p>  -  assessment, and <\/p>  <p>  -   qualifications. <\/p>  <p>  This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements and methods of delivery, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).<\/p>  <p>  In the case of Social Care, the awards standards in place for these qualifications reflect the accreditation criteria and placement requirements that have been set out by CORU, Ireland's multi-profession Health and Social Care Regulator and consequently the relevant PRB for this profession. <\/p>  <p>  Since March 2020, QQI has facilitated engagement between members of the stakeholders group and CORU which have taken place in parallel to direct engagements between CORU and individual education providers at a local and regional level. The goal of these engagements has been to ensure that, where possible, necessary alternative arrangements are in place to maintain the standards of education and training in this area and that these issues are actively managed. These efforts are to ensure that students can progress in their programmes from one academic year into the next, or, where relevant, graduate with the necessary professional competencies that have been set out by CORU. <\/p>  <p>  While I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts that have been made by CORU, QQI and our educational institutions to identify and implement flexible solutions for students up to this point, I am conscious that further efforts are now necessary. <\/p>  <p>  The current timing and the likely duration of Covid restrictions has created even greater disruption and uncertainty in this space than anticipated and has substantially impacted on the expected level of available social care placements. It is in this context that QQI has been asked, supported by my Department, to facilitate intensified engagements between CORU, education providers and relevant stakeholders on this issue. These engagements are ongoing and are focused on identifying solutions that can be swiftly implemented for the student cohort who are most impacted in the near term while also identifying flexible approaches that can be readily adopted within the system in the medium to longer term as the response to the pandemic evolves and changes. These engagements serve to facilitate dialogue among stakeholders in developing these solutions and, most importantly, will ensure transparency and clarity for those students studying social care. <\/p>  <p>  Students should continue to engage directly with their provider for further information on the arrangements being implemented for their particular year and course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500072#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Communications","counter":368,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500072#WRH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":369,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[16006\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500072#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the dedicated email addresses for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to contact his Department and bodies under its aegis as outlined in circular 25\/2016.","asker":"1468","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":370,"content":"<p>The details sought by the Deputy, in regard to dedicated email addresses for both my Department and in regard to the bodies under the aegis of my Department, are contained in the tables below. <table>    <tr>       <th colspan=\"2\">Contact E-Mail Addresses for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Minister_FHERIS@dfheris.gov.ie<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p><b>Contact E-Mail Addresses for State Bodies under the Remit of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Name of Body<\/th>       <th>Dedicated Email address for the Members of the Oireacthas<\/th>       <th>Designated Official Responsible for assisting Oireachtas Members<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Higher Education Authority<\/td>       <td>Oireachtas@hea.ie<\/td>       <td>Padraic Mellett*<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Irish Research Council (Note 1)<\/td>       <td>Oireachtas@research.ie<\/td>       <td>Padraic Mellett*  <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Grangegorman Development Agency<\/td>       <td>Communications@ggda.ie<\/td>       <td>nora.rahill@ggda.ie<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>SOLAS <\/td>       <td>oireachtasinfo@solas.ie<\/td>       <td>Nikki Gallagher<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Skillnets Ltd<\/td>       <td>oireachtas@skillnets.com<\/td>       <td>t.donnery@skillnets.com<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Quality and Qualifications Ireland<\/td>       <td>ceo@qqi.ie<\/td>       <td>ceo@qqi.ie<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>L&eacute;argas &ndash; The Exchange Bureau<\/td>       <td>oireachtas@leargas.ie<\/td>       <td>fbroughan@leargas.ie<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Science Foundation Ireland<\/td>       <td>ciara.cotter@sfi.ie<\/td>       <td>Ciara Cotter<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500072#WRH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Education","counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500072#WRH01700"},{"type":"question","counter":372,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[16022\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500072#WRH01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to provide higher education facilities with supports and facilities in order to provide practical creative learning experiences in the field of the arts and music.","asker":"1489","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":373,"content":"<p>My Department allocates recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to HEA designated higher education institutions.

Specific targets have been set to increase participation in higher education by students with physical or sensory disabilities. It is expected that the measures that have been implemented through the Plan, including the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) will assist in the realisation of this target.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A progress review of the NAP, published in 2018, shows that the most considerable progress toward realising the targets of the NAP has been achieved amongst the disabilities target group.\u00a0 The target of 8% that was set for the lifetime of the Plan has been exceeded by the Progress Review stage with a new target of 12% set for 2021.\u00a0 Current data shows the percentage of full-time new entrants in higher education with a disability is 12.3% in 2019\/2020.<\/p>  <p>  The Fund for\u00a0Students with Disabilities (FSD) provides funding to further and higher education institutions to assist them in offering supports and services to eligible students with disabilities so that they can access, fully participate in and successfully complete their chosen course of study.\u00a0 Funding can be used to provide supports and accommodations for assistive technology, equipment and software, non-medical helpers, academic or learning support, deaf supports and transport. \u00a0In 2019\/20 academic year a total of 14,358 students received supports eligible for funding under the FSD. This represents an increase of 8.7% compared to the previous year. 987 of these were postgraduate students and 463 were part-time. <\/p>  <p>  I recently approved a number of initiatives under the FSD aimed at supporting students with disabilities to access and engage with higher education. The initiatives, which involve 23 higher education institutions (HEI) and &euro;5.4m in expenditure, are broad and are aimed at improving access to higher education for people with a disability, to improving college campuses and to assist staff with training and development. Among the projects are a number of projects for students with autism including the establishment of autism friendly rooms across nine different campuses, the development of assistive technology including for students with disabilities, an app to help students with visual or hearing impairment navigate their way around campus and specialist assistance for students who are deaf.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020 approximately &euro;42 million within the core funding allocated to HEIs was in recognition of the additional costs of recruiting and retaining students from National Access Plan target groups, including students with disabilities. This enables all HEIs to have an access infrastructure, including disability support services, in place that provides for the pre-entry and post-entry work required to support students from target groups access and successfully complete higher education.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of access to further education and training, the Deputy may be aware that fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is built. The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including for learners with a disability. The FET system aims to ensure that systemic and structural barriers within FET to learner participation and success are proactively addressed so that each learner can access the available learning opportunities and be enabled to fulfil their potential within FET.<\/p>  <p>  In line with SDG4 and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, FET has applied Universal Design for Learning (UDL). Here inclusive systems fulfil every learner's potential by learning from the same flexible curriculum, facilitating formative assessment, providing all necessary accommodations to remove obstacles to learning and providing where required one-to-one supports and assistive technologies to support differentiated learning.<\/p>  <p>  I have engaged with Government colleagues, including the Minister for State for Disability, on this important work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500072#WRH04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500072#WRH04300"},{"type":"question","counter":397,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[16196\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500072#WRH04400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount spent to date of the &euro;2.2 billion in capital expenditure the Government has committed to spending across higher education over the period 2018 to 2027 under Project Ireland 2040; the breakdown of expenditure to date by location and campus in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":398,"content":"<p>Project Ireland 2040\u00a0signals\u00a0Exchequer investment of &euro;2.2 billion in Ireland's higher education infrastructure over the period to 2027.<\/p><p>There are a number of ongoing higher education investment programmes including:<\/p><p>-  Higher Education Strategic Infrastructure Fund, which is co-funding five projects, four in the university sector and one in an IoT.

In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.<\/p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. <\/p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis. Further details are available at the following link:<\/p><p>The next cohort to be vaccinated (Cohort 4) are those aged 16-69 and at very high risk of severe illness and death.

As a member of PRAC, the Health Product Regulatory Agency (HPRA) is involved in the review of all cases of thromboembolic events, and other conditions related to blood clots, reported post-vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  EMA&rsquo;s safety committee PRAC, concluded its preliminary review of a signal of blood clots in people vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca at its extraordinary meeting of 18 March 2021. The Committee confirmed that:<\/p>  <p>  - the benefits of the vaccine in\u00a0combating the still widespread threat of COVID-19 (which itself results in clotting problems and may be fatal) continue to outweigh the risk of side effects;<\/p>  <p>  - the vaccine is not associated with an increase in the overall risk of blood clots (thromboembolic events) in those who receive it;<\/p>  <p>  - there is no evidence of a problem\u00a0related to specific batches of the vaccine or to particular manufacturing\u00a0sites;<\/p>  <p>  - however, the vaccine may be\u00a0associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e. low levels of blood platelets (elements in the\u00a0blood that help it to clot) with or without bleeding, including rare cases\u00a0of clots in the vessels draining blood from the brain (CVST).<\/p>  <p>  The EMA statement stresses these are very rare events. Around 20 million people in the UK and EEA had received the vaccine by 16 March 2021. The EMA had received reports of only 7 cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and 18 cases of Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST). A causal link with the vaccine is not proven. However, because of the rarity of these events a possible association cannot be excluded and deserves further analysis.<\/p>  <p>  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) have convened and reviewed the European Medicines Agency (EMA) statement in relation to the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. <\/p>  <p>  Firstly NIAC acknowledges the vaccine&rsquo;s proven efficacy in preventing hospitalisation and death from COVID-19\u00a0outweighs the extremely small possibility of developing rare clotting events and recommends that the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca&reg; administration should be recommenced for use in all those aged 18 and over.<\/p>  <p>  However, in light of the reports of these rare events of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and cases of CVST,\u00a0NIAC recommends that patients and healthcare providers should be aware of the remote possibility of such syndromes, and if symptoms suggestive of clotting problems occur patients should seek immediate medical attention and inform healthcare professionals of their recent vaccination.<\/p>  <p>  Healthcare professionals and vaccine recipients should be informed that very rare, complicated thromboembolic events have been reported in a small number of people who have recently received COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, NIAC advises that patients need to be alerted to the signs and symptoms that may occur related to these rare events and to this end recommends:<\/p>  <p>  Recipients of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca&reg; should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling and\/or persistent abdominal pain within weeks of vaccination. Additionally, anyone with neurological symptoms including severe or persistent headaches (particularly 3 or more days after vaccination) or blurred vision, or who develop petechiae or ecchymoses beyond the site of vaccination, should seek prompt medical attention. These rare events have usually occurred within 14 days of the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca&reg;. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, NIAC recommends that healthcare professionals need to be cognisant of these rare events and report to the Health Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA):<\/p>  <p>  Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and\/or thrombocytopenia and report any suspected adverse reactions to the Health Products Regulatory Authority.<\/p>  <p>  That a specialist care pathway is established to treat any such cases should these arise.<\/p>  <p>  Healthcare professionals should seek early expert advice from the National Coagulation Centre about the specialised testing and treatment options for patients presenting with thromboembolic events that are associated with thrombocytopenia, (including Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) or Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST)) occurring within weeks following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca&reg;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500075#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":548,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[16117\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500075#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason some elderly persons (details supplied) over 90 years of age are still waiting on the Covid-19 vaccine given they were to be prioritised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1580","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":549,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500075#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500075#WRL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":551,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[16118\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021032500075#WRL02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the zero Covid strategy of a group (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":552,"content":"<p>Since the emergence of COVID-19, the Government has been guided at all times by the emerging scientific understanding of the virus and in particular has been in receipt of advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).

It is recognised that the necessary public health protective measures, such as the need to reduce social contacts, can have adverse effects on social, psychological and emotional wellbeing. The availability of vaccines brings great hope and will play a critical role in protecting the population, especially those most at risk such as older people, against COVID-19. The advanced stage of the vaccination rollout in nursing homes provides an opportunity for cautious incremental modification in some public health measures, including visiting measures.  <\/p><p>New visitation guidance was published on 12 March and came into effect on 22 March 2021. The new guidance incorporates early learning from the positive impact of the vaccine rollout nationally and internationally and will provide enhanced opportunity for visiting in nursing homes across all levels of the Government&rsquo;s Plan &ldquo;<i>COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead<\/i>&rdquo;.<\/p><p>While the guidance in place had provided for visiting on critical and compassionate grounds this new guidance now expands the scope of visiting on general compassionate grounds as well as further refining the guidance across levels 1 to 5, which now provides at Levels 3, 4 and 5, subject to risk assessment and no open outbreak, that residents may be facilitated to receive:<\/p><p><b>- Two visits per week<\/b>, where 8 out of 10 of every resident and healthcare worker in the nursing home has completed their vaccination schedule.  <\/p><p>The guidance re-emphasises <i>specific<\/i>critical and compassionate circumstances such as end of life on which additional visiting can be facilitated. It further notes that the duration of visiting on critical and compassionate grounds should be as flexible as possible subject to the ability of the nursing home to manage the visiting safely. At all times vigilance on the general infection prevention control measures must be maintained. The guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerges.  <\/p><p>It is important to note that nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents. Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.<\/p><p>I have written to all nursing home providers, through HIQA&rsquo;s communication portal, to emphasise the need for all providers to follow the revised guidance on visitation. I have also met with HIQA on this matter to stress the importance of implementation of the guidance. The adoption of a holistic and person-centred approach, noting the key role that visiting, social connections and communication with family and friends has in the context of residents&rsquo; overall health and wellbeing must be sustained. I expect every effort to be made to ensure visits are facilitated to the greatest extent possible, in line with the revised guidance and public health advice.
