As the Minister of State knows well, the Covid-19 pandemic has decimated the aviation industry and tourism sector.  It is having a significant negative economic impact on the businesses and employees in the region.  In County Clare alone, hotels, guesthouses and tourism attractions are such an important part of the economic life of our county and have been decimated as a result of what Covid-19 has done.  We need to see now and to ensure, as we look to the other side of Covid-19 whenever that might be, that vital infrastructure that has been built up over many decades is there and is protected.  The real worry now is that as economic recovery starts to take hold it will be concentrated through the main airport in the country, namely, Dublin Airport. That would be devastating to the future life of regional development and would have a dramatic impact on the capacity of County Clare and the entire west of Ireland to achieve economic recovery.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State is aware of the threat, airlines will not be making money on any of these routes for quite a protracted period of time.  They are threatening to move aircraft to other locations in the world where rules around travel are less restrictive.  We, as a functioning Government, cannot allow that to happen.  We are going to have to put in place State supports to protect the key routes and to provide funding to these private airlines, as much as we would not want to do that in a normal time.  It will be necessary, however, because these routes are so vital to the economic well-being of the region.  There is a public service obligation model which has been used in the past to support air access to routes where they are not profitable for a particular period of time but where their vital importance is recognised for the economic activities in the region.  I am appealing to the Minister of State as a representative of the Government to give every consideration to the demands and needs of these regions to provide the appropriate funding to support airlines and to protect routes, so that these areas can recover when we get to the other side of the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#C00200","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, for being here and I congratulate her on her appointment.<\/p> <p>This is an important debate about, as the task force said, the protecting of public health but also the rebuilding of consumer confidence and regional and international connectivity.  Cork and all of our airports operate in an open economy and we are an island nation.  Our aviation sector, therefore, is critical.  We need clarity on the task force recovery plan, on reform of the red and green list, and we also need to have a comprehensive remodelling of our testing.  In welcoming that the Government has signed up to the European protocol on testing, it is now important in doing so that we recognise the green, orange and red system.  In particular, on the red list, it is important that the option of testing in lieu of quarantine is put in place.  It is about protecting our public health but it is also about rebuilding consumer confidence.  <\/p> <p>If one takes Cork Airport, for example, it has seen its passenger numbers plummet by 90% and faces a loss of &euro;20 million for the year ahead.  We need the reform that Senator Dooley has referred to by giving incentives for route development and retention.  It must also be remembered that Cork Airport is the only airport that has not got funding under regional airport capital funding and I ask that that be given serious consideration.  <\/p> <p>I know that my time is short and that the Minister of State is going to reply but it is important that this debate is the beginning and a catalyst for the recovery of our aviation sector.  This is done in the widest possible manner to support Government but to recognise also that a stimulus package to include Cork Airport is required.  Reform of our testing is also required and if we are serious about signing up to the European protocol then green, red and amber means what it means, but our green and red lists must also be looked at in their entirety.  I want a debate around what a green and red list means and around connectivity.

I can assure all stakeholders that the importance of the aviation industry in terms of its contribution to GDP, FDI and job creation is well understood, and that the Government will do all it can to support it through the very difficult period ahead.<\/p><p>The aviation recovery task force, which delivered its final report in July, made a number of useful recommendations to get the aviation sector back on its feet again.  A number of the recommendations have already been implemented by the Government and others which are aimed at stimulating growth in air travel, are being examined and developed into proposals that will be deployed when the time is right.  Among the actions already taken by the Government are measures to assist the sector financially.  These include the extension of the wage subsidy scheme, tax claw-back measures, and the offer of liquidity support which is available to the aviation sector through the Government's &euro;2 billion ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund.  I am acutely aware of the challenges that our State airports and indeed all Irish airports are currently facing and will continue to face over the coming months as the country adjusts to the new reality of living alongside Covid-19.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I have met with the management of the DAA, the Shannon Group and Cork Airport and have been updated on the challenges facing Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports.  I have seen at first hand the impact that Covid 19 has had on Cork Airport's operations.  In addition, I have also met with our regional airports to discuss the challenges they face.<\/p><p>In addition to the horizontal Exchequer supports provided by the Government which I have mentioned and which the airports are availing of, the Government's commitment to our State airports was most recently demonstrated by a decision we made in recent months to provide an emergency grant of &euro;6.1 million to Shannon Airport to complete its hold baggage screening project, a safety and security requirement under EU regulations.  The provision of the funding ensured that Shannon Airport was in a position to resume passenger flights on 1 July.  Officials in my Department are exploring further targeted support measures which will be considered by the Government as part of further plans to aid broader economic recovery.  These supports would be targeted at maintaining connectivity at Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports.<\/p><p>The key to a meaningful recovery in the aviation sector, however, is to enable safe travel where the risk of contracting coronavirus from travel is low, where that risk can be mitigated through additional measures such as testing, and where travellers have some level of certainty on the public health measures in place during their travel journey.  The European Commission proposal for a co-ordinated approach to the restriction of free movement offers a way forward in this regard.  The Government took the decision to broadly align with this EU approach to international travel, which is expected to be finalized at the General Affairs Council on 13 October next.  With regard to countries other than those on the green list, the proposed new EU approach would involve graduated requirements for testing of passengers.  My Department is consulting with the Department of Health and the HSE as well as maritime and aviation stakeholders, to consider the possibility of introducing testing for Covid-19 in the context of international travel, as an alternative to the current general advice against non-essential travel.  Any testing regime would need to be consistent with public health requirements and cognisant of the resources and capacity for testing available in our health sector.  It is our hope that once the European common approach, including a supporting testing regime, is agreed, the path ahead for aviation and travel will be clearer and we will then be in a better position in respect of the visibility on what still might be necessary to support the aviation sector in the medium term.  Officials in my Department are exploring further targeted support measures which will be considered by the Government as part of further plans to aid broader economic recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#C00500","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The gentlemen have one minute between them for a supplementary question.

The mental health of our young people has rarely been under the level of stress it is at present.  Adolescence and young adulthood is a fraught time anyway, but the added burden of Covid-19 restrictions has disproportionately affected the 12 to 25 age cohort.  Their education has been completely disrupted and along with it their support network and friendships within the school community.  The leaving certificate class of 2020 had to contend with serious uncertainty for several months about their exams and CAO offers without any of the usual rites of passage associated with leaving school.  Of course, those doing their leaving certificate in 2021 also have problems.<\/p> <p>Third level students and those doing apprenticeships have also seen their lives completely changed and they live with continued uncertainty about the coming academic year.  Part-time jobs have been lost and many young people face serious financial pressure combined with the great pressure they face from social media.  The burden on the mental health of young people is immense.  The need for services aimed at this age group is immense.  With this in mind, for some time I have been calling for a branch of Jigsaw to be opened in Newbridge.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have been calling for this since well before the advent of Covid.  I had the opportunity to bring the previous Minister of State with responsibility for mental health to Newbridge to visit one of our volunteer-led charities there, HOPE(D), which does incredible work with young people supporting them with their positive mental health.  A number of years ago I spoke in the D&aacute;il Chamber about the devastating impact of five young men who took their own lives within one month of each other in the town of Newbridge.  It was absolutely shocking.  I therefore do not raise this issue out of nowhere.  Given all the issues we have at the moment, we absolutely need a branch of Jigsaw in Newbridge.<\/p><p>Jigsaw aims to create a more supportive environment for young people.  It also provides online mental health supports for young people, their families and those around them.  It provides a community-based, holistic approach and seeks to inform and support people and educate them about young people's mental health.  Its services are accessible, visible, effective, inclusive and timely and they are very much needed in south Kildare, particularly around Newbridge.<\/p><p>HOPE(D) is a wonderful charity based in Newbridge.  It does great work providing help to those aged 13 and upwards who are battling mental health problems.  Of its clients, 25% are adolescents.  It needs absolute assistance.  It is losing the building from which it currently works and its future is uncertain.<\/p><p>Bringing Jigsaw to Newbridge would be a huge help to the area.  We could look at a collaborative partnership approach between HOPE(D) and Jigsaw to give young people the assistance they need as they face into a difficult winter and a difficult year.  I hope this can be brought to fruition in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#E01300","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman and Senator O'Loughlin for the warm wishes extended to me.  I thank Senator O'Loughlin for raising the issue of the opening of a branch of Jigsaw, the mental health organisation, in Newbridge, County Kildare.  She is quite right that I have heard her talk about this over many years; it is not something I have heard for the first time today.<\/p> <p>As we all know, Jigsaw is an absolutely fantastic organisation.  It has 12 sites nationwide, all of which provide brief intervention and support to young people aged 12 to 25 with mild to moderate mental health difficulties.  When I came into this role 11 weeks ago, I met Dr. Joseph Duffy, the CEO of Jigsaw, and was really struck by the way in which it organises and does its business.  Most importantly, prior to Covid, one could refer oneself to Jigsaw, so a 12-, 13- or 14-year-old could actually walk up to a Jigsaw premises and self-refer.  One can also attend with a sibling, one's parents or an advocate.  What is also very important about Jigsaw is that it continues its supports until the person is 25.  Child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, for example, end at 18 and then one enters into the adult services.  Many 18-year-olds are still in school doing their leaving certificate or they might be transitioning into college, which can be a very difficult time for them.  From that point of view, Jigsaw's ethos is fantastic.  In addition, what Jigsaw has done during the Covid pandemic is phenomenal.  It was able to move online within four days to provide blended support services.  Obviously, with Covid, a lot of the face-to-face interactions had to end, but Jigsaw was able to move online and continue its supports.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, mental health continues to be a priority for the Government, and I intend to progress all aspects of mental health in the context of implementing the current programme for Government and the new policy, Sharing the Vision.  Mental health service users are among the most vulnerable in society.  In recognition of this, &euro;39 million was added to the HSE mental health budget last year, bringing the annual budget to &euro;1.026 billion.  This is significant investment but it has to continue.  I am in budget negotiations trying to extend that amount.  The HSE provides approximately &euro;10 million annually to support 12 Jigsaw sites nationally.  A priority for me and the HSE is to open two new Jigsaw services, in Wicklow and Tipperary, by the end of this year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The question of providing new Jigsaw services for 2021 or beyond can only be taken in the context of agreeing the forthcoming budget and the subsequent HSE service plan for next year.  It should also take account of other similar early intervention services in an area, whether they are provided by the HSE directly or by another agency on its behalf.<\/p><p>The Senator mentioned HOPE(D), the fantastic work it is doing and that their future is uncertain at the moment.  I am happy to visit south County Kildare with her to meet this organisation because it is very important.  The number of organisations on the ground providing help and support is phenomenal.

I was delighted last December when the Minister, by way of reply to a Commencement debate, informed me that the school had finally gotten the green light to proceed.  The news was greeted with great enthusiasm by the entire community of Ballybay.  <\/p><p>Since the new Minister for Education and Skills has taken up office, I have stressed to her the importance of the facility moving forward.  It is disappointing that the project has taken so long but now that we have a green light I hope that it will move swiftly along in order that the school community, comprised of teachers, pupils and parents, will enjoy a much needed facility that they are crying out for.

As the Senator said, the people of Ballybay are completely behind the project.<\/p> <p>I can confirm to him and the House that the Department received an application from CMETB for additional accommodation for the community college in June 2019.  The request was given careful consideration.  I am pleased, on behalf of the Minister, to advise the House that approval has been given for the provision of a stand-alone extension to the existing accommodation of the school.  The extension will include two general classrooms, a science laboratory and a science preparation area.  The project is being funded under the Department's additional accommodation scheme.<\/p> <p>As is usual with such projects, its delivery has been devolved to CMETB.  It is being progressed with a view to resolving the issues referred to by the Senator and increasing the accommodation that it currently occupies.<\/p> <p>I assure the House that the Department is conscious of the need for the accommodation.

This payment is funded by the Social Insurance Fund through the payment of PRSI contributions by workers and employers and, in the event of a shortfall between contributions received and benefits paid, the Exchequer.  This was always the situation.<\/p><p>Under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020, the Government, having regard to the manifest and grave risk to human life and public health posed by the spread of Covid-19, made exceptional provision, in the public interest and to mitigate the effect of the spread of the disease, to amend and extend the Social Welfare Acts to provide for entitlement to illness benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with, or are a probable source of, infection with Covid-19.  The rate of payment of the enhanced illness benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period.  The measures were designed to ensure that, where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate while having his or her income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, keep the number of people affected to a minimum and reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.<\/p><p>I will return now to the Senator Sherlock's question and the nub of the issue.  I take on board the Senator's concerns and I will pass them on to the Minister.  Communication and clarification are extremely important.  The Department does not distinguish between people who are self-isolating and people who are restricting their movements.  It provides the enhanced illness benefit payment to anyone who meets the eligibility criteria, including a certificate of incapacity for work or evidence of HSE contact tracing.  I reiterate the Department does not distinguish between people who are self-isolating and people who are restricting their movements.  It is important people are aware of that.  When a medical practitioner advises a person to stay away from work because an underlying medical condition means he or she is unable to work safely, the standard illness benefit payment may be made, subject to the conditions of the scheme being satisfied.  The purpose of the enhanced illness benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people not to go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  I hope this clarifies the position for the Senator.<\/p><p>On the question regarding numbers, unfortunately I do not have that information, but I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister with a view to her Department providing the information to the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#J00600","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's clarification that if a person has to self-isolate or restrict his or movements, he or she is entitled to the illness benefit payment.  There is an important question with regard to the certification that a person requires to be eligible for that payment.  For example, is a doctor's note required?  Currently, when a person presents for a test and is diagnosed with Covid-19 there is a paper trail, but this is much less the case where a person has a negative result but is still required to restrict his or her movements for 14 days.  I urge the Minister to clarify the certification required and to place emphasis on the need to communicate this to the wider public.  The Minister of State referred to the need to slow down this virus.  Unless we tell people who are restricting their movements that they will receive this benefit, some people may go to work or conduct their activities in public and we need to discourage that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#K00200","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>As I said, payment is made where a medical practitioner advises a person to remain away from work.

There is no doubt that it is an extremely busy time for him and his colleagues so I appreciate his coming here today to discuss a very important issue.  The Minister of State will know too well that the New Decade, New Approach agreement that was signed in January comes on the back of intense and sometimes painstaking negotiations that had been taking place for the year previous.  It is worth acknowledging that at the time of signing the New Decade, New Approach agreement there was a lot of hope in the North of a new decade of politics and opportunities, even when the regional and all-Ireland economy faced unprecedented uncertainty and instability due to Brexit.  There was hope all the same.  The British Government defaulted in its financial commitments to the obligation before the ink had even dried on the agreement.  Fortunately for us, however, we had the Irish Government on our side.  It is with that in mind that I ask the Minister of State to update the House on his Government's commitments under annex A.<\/p> <p>It was welcome news in Derry and the wider north west that the region featured significantly in the document.  In fact, it even had its own section.  This did not happen by accident and I am sure the Minister of State will know that our party played a key role in ensuring that Derry and the wider north west featured heavily in the negotiation process.  It was right that the document recognised that the region was in need of much significant strategic investment.  I acknowledge and thank the Government for its financial contribution towards the north west strategic partnership, which was formed under Fresh Start and has done great work over the years.  In page 60 of the document, the Government commits to exploring opportunities to invest in the Derry, Strabane and wider north west inclusive growth deal.  The deal currently comprises investment of &euro;105 million from the Northern Executive, &euro;105 million from the British Government and &euro;50 million from Derry City and Strabane District Council and Ulster University.  I note that my colleague, Conor Murphy, Minister of Finance in the North, wrote to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, in May this year requesting that consideration be given to contributing to this funding path.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether his Government has explored this and if we could pick it up as a matter of urgency with the stakeholders in the north west.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State will be acutely aware that Derry and the north west have ambitious plans to expand further and higher education through the provision of the Magee campus expansion.  I have met the Minister of State's officials many times over the years and made this point very clear.  The Minister of State will accept that the insertion of the Magee expansion into the document was absolutely essential for our party to buy into its agreement.  Therefore, given that the agreement was signed by the Government, what has it done with the north west further and higher education cross-Border cluster, Ulster University, the Executive in the North or the British Government, which are referenced in the document in respect of the Magee expansion?<\/p> <p>Annex A also states that the Government will enhance and update the national development plan here to commit to additional joint funding and cross-Border investment in infrastructure.  What has happened in respect of this?  I welcome the fact that the Government has committed &euro;75 million towards the A5 but I once again remind the Government of its previous agreement to fund 50% of the overall cost.  I would like some clarification in this regard.  I am very conscious of the range of issues I have brought to the Minister of State today.  However, given the week that is in it and the fact that we could potentially be going over a cliff-edge in respect of Brexit negotiations, has the Government considered targeted funding into the North, particularly in respect of Border constituencies?  I have mentioned a range of projects today.  At the time of signing New Decade, New Approach there was a lot of hope.  There was hope in Derry and I am sure the Minister of State along with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, would not want there to be another false dawn for the people of Derry and the north west.  I would be grateful for specific clarification on the issues raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#L00200","speaker":"1668"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach as an bhf&aacute;ilte a chur s&eacute; romham anseo ar maidin.

The Irish and British Governments, at the same time, each announced their own separate sets of financial and other commitments in support of the resumption of the power-sharing institutions at Stormont, and the work of the North-South Ministerial Council.  The Government is fully aware of the commitments in the New Decade, New Approach agreement, which the Senator outlined, and is determined to ensure maximum progress is made in implementing all of them for the benefit of everyone on the island of Ireland, North and South, including the people of counties Derry and Donegal, and the wider north west.<\/p> <p>I am aware the Senator tabled this matter previously and raised specific issues, which, I assume, are along the lines of those raised today.<\/p> <p>Regarding the construction of the A5 road, which is perhaps the most signature project and will inevitably be the most visible in respect of people moving and travelling, the agreement restates the Government's commitment to provide &euro;75 million up to 2022 for the project.  Governments over the years have committed to this project and little has happened.  However, the Taoiseach and the Government are absolutely committed to making sure that this happens.  As the Senator rightly said, it will require co-operation from the three sides.  She mentioned the Northern Ireland Minister of Finance, Conor Murphy, and the Minister for Infrastructure, Nichola Mallon.  With all parties working together, we are determined that the project will be delivered, and she can be assured that the Taoiseach will provide leadership on this issue.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will no doubt be aware, a public inquiry in Northern Ireland administered by the planning appeals commission into the A5 western transport corridor scheme concluded on 13 March 2020.  Subject to a favourable outcome from the public inquiry and the successful completion of all statutory procedures and environmental assessments, construction work on the first phase of the scheme, phase 1A from New Buildings to north of Strabane, could commence during 2021.  As somebody who travelled in that particular area during the summer, going to north Donegal, I am aware that the road is badly needed and the project will bring significant economic benefits to the area when it is completed.<\/p> <p>The Government welcomes the development of plans for ambitious new higher education provision at the Ulster University Magee campus in Derry.  This investment has the potential to increase access to third level education for young people on a cross-Border basis, enable further co-operation between third level institutions in the north west and underpin broader economic development and opportunities in the region.  <\/p> <p>When I was the spokesperson for education in the previous D&aacute;il, what I found surprising was how little cross-Border movement there is in education.

I do so in the full knowledge that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has a very deep personal connection with Belarus and met Svetlana Tikhanovskaya in Brussels on 21 September.  She is the opposition leader in Belarus who has been displaced by the recent presidential election and has had to flee the country, in essence.  The Minister described her as an extraordinary and brave woman.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State will be aware that, since 1994, Alexander Lukashenko has been President of Belarus.  He was the first president elected after the constitution was established.  Belarus has been independent since 1990 so it is a relatively young country.  During his term as President, Mr. Lukashenko's attitude to the people of Belarus has been characterised by what he has described as his authoritarian ruling style.  That is evidenced in the manner he has behaved.  He has treated the democratic institutions of Belarus with contempt.  In the original constitution, there were term limits on the presidency in terms of the number of years and terms a president could serve.  In 1996, Mr. Lukashenko, in a referendum, extended the number of years of a presidency from five to seven.  As a result of that referendum, he has been barred from membership of the Council of Europe.  In 2004, he held a referendum to remove the constitutional term limits, which was described by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, as unfree.  There is no doubt about his attitude.  In 2006, when he ran in the presidential election, his opponent, Alyaksandr Kazulin, was arrested and beaten by police in Belarus and this is exactly the kind of thing we saw recently in the run-up to the 2020 election.  Mr. Lukashenko seems to get 80% of the vote every time.  Nobody believes that, but that is what is recorded officially.  The OSCE has described these presidential elections as unfair, whereas Russia has described them as open and fair.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->An axis is emerging here and that is highly undesirable from the point of view of international relations.  Again, in 2010 opposition presidential candidates were imprisoned and beaten.

Perhaps it is the highest profile because of the massive public outcry at the result of opposition leader, Ms Svetlana Tikhanovskaya.  Her vote clearly was not reflected in the huge public outcry that came as a result of that election.  <\/p><p>The European Commission High Representative said very clearly the election was neither free nor fair and described last week's secret inauguration by Mr. Lukashenko as lacking any democratic legitimacy.  There is clearly a consensus internationally that this man is a dictator and this is an authoritarian dictatorship.  It is the last one in Europe.  It is right on our borders in Europe.  I want to know what Ireland is doing about that.  The European Union has failed to put sanctions in place and I am aware of the position of Cyprus in that regard.  However, what is Ireland doing to put pressure on them?  Mr. Emmanuel Macron in France said that Mr. Lukashenko must go.  The UK and Canada have put in place sanctions against Belarus.  The UK is not a country we should be following here.  We should be ahead of the curve on this issue.

I repeat that election was not free or fair.  Let us be honest, Mr. Lukashenko is an absolute outrage to European values and the democracies we hold dear.<\/p> <p>There have been many messages from Irish citizens concerned for the welfare of the Belarusian people.  Many of those who have written have opened their homes and their hearts to Belarusian children since the Chernobyl disaster so there is a good link over recent decades between Belarus and Ireland.  Both I and the Taoiseach share those concerns.<\/p> <p>Prior to the election in August, Ireland along with the EU highlighted the worrying situation during the 44th session of the Human Rights Council in July.  However, after the election the situation deteriorated further.  We have seen indiscriminate mass detentions, including of children, credible reports of torture and ill-treatment of those detained, forced exiles and disappearances and curtailments of media freedoms, including Internet shutdowns.<\/p> <p>Ireland has acted quickly and clearly to those events.  Along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, I have made statements expressing our deep concern following the use of state violence against peaceful protestors and we have called for the immediate and unconditional release of those unjustly detained, for an end to violence and for a sustainable and peaceful resolution through dialogue.  That was also the message conveyed by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, during the UN Security Council meeting on 4 September and at the Human Rights Council where Ireland also supported a joint statement expressing concerning at Internet shutdowns.<\/p> <p>We have condemned the actions of the Belarusian authorities and Ireland has continued to work with other EU member states to ensure a firm EU response.  Senator Ward has outlined some of the difficulties at EU level he is obviously aware of that do not involve us.  I am hopeful there will be opportunities this week for further dialogue among our EU partners that have difficulties with this, not regarding Belarus, as the Senator will understand, but other difficulties they have relating to it.  I am hopeful that the European Council may do something on this issue but that depends on every member state agreeing with the strong position the Taoiseach will take.<\/p> <p>We support the imposition of targeted sanctions against those responsible for the falsification of the election result and the use of state violence against the Belarusian people and we will continue to seek their quick imposition.  This is what the Taoiseach will be looking for at the European Council.  However, sanctions are, of course, just one element of the broader response and we are working constructively with our EU partners on a review of EU-Belarus relations.  We must support the Belarusian people in their simple and clear demand to have free and fair elections and to have their basic human rights respected.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Thomas Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2203\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Taoiseach has spoken to the opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has a well-known connection to Ireland, having spent many summers here in her youth.

Their resilience in the face of very real threats to their lives and their liberties is an inspiration to all of us who cherish democratic principles and the rule of law, and we stand by them.

This is an important step.  I regret, as the Minister of State said, that there are difficulties beyond Ireland's capacity that are preventing this from happening.  Europe has to act, however.

We will continue to encourage the authorities to grasp the offer with both hands.  I am hopeful targeted EU sanctions will be imposed shortly, and the Taoiseach will be very strong when discussing the importance of this step at the European Council later this week.<\/p> <p>The European Council operates by consensus.  Two member states have difficulties with this, not because they have difficulties in imposing a sanction on Belarus but because of other issues that are important to them, and I acknowledge they are very important to them.

Be ready for what?  It is a dangerous narrative to come from a sitting US President and it poses a significant threat to world order and to a country that is seen as a great power in the global geopolitical landscape.

Members will be aware that in the last term of the Oireachtas, a review was initiated by EY-DKM.  It was to review the prospect of the western rail corridor being reopened between Tuam and Athenry, and then on into Claremorris, a connection that would bring Mayo and Galway closer together.

As announced this week, the organisation is minded to cut services from Dublin to Belfast, Galway, Limerick and Cork and it appears that the decision is inevitable.  As I am sure everyone will agree, this will have a potentially devastating negative impact on workers and commuters in the first instance, but also on the economies, communities and service providers of these places.  Most ironic of all, it will possibly have an impact on the environment as well.<\/p> <p>We are trying to find a balance, but as we emerge from this pandemic we will of course encourage people to travel, spend money and use our public transport infrastructure in order to visit and stimulate economies across the entire island.

It is unfortunate and disappointing, particularly given the timing after the decade of centenaries and so on.  We need to do much more to ensure the preservation of historical monuments like this one and it was most disappointing to see this development yesterday.<\/p><p>I also wish to express my strong support for the campaign to bring more refugees from the Moria camp on Lesbos island.  This a campaign about which others have spoken in this House and in the other House and I have spoken on it myself.  I urge the Leader to communicate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice and Equality the urgent need to increase the numbers we have committed to taking.  I am aware it is something about which the Leader feels strongly and on which she has spoken and I appreciate that.  It is simply inadequate to say we will take four unaccompanied minors when we know 13,000 women, men and children are left in dire straits on the island of Lesbos in Greece because of the awful fire that broke out there.  We knew before that, however, the conditions in the Moria camp were appalling.  We need to do more by way of humanitarian assistance to people who are suffering and we need to increase our offer.  The ask is that each member state would offer to take 400 people from the camp.  It is not a huge number and we need to be leaders on this, given our history of emigration.  I ask the Leader to convey that strong message.  I believe I speak for all of us in this House on that front.<\/p><p>Finally, I have submitted a Commencement matter that I hope will be heard.  It asks the Minister for Health to make a statement as regards the St. Mary's Centre Telford nursing home in Dublin 4, a home owned by the Sisters of Charity.  It has been before the courts and there has been a good deal of news reporting about it.  I have stood with the staff and residents of the home in seeking to ensure its survival and seeking to ensure adequate provision is made for the vulnerable persons who remain there.  I understand 18 people are still resident in the home and yet it is, apparently, facing imminent closure.  Issues are before the courts concerning liquidation and, as I said, I have submitted a Commencement matter.  I ask, however, that the Minister for Health come into this House and make a statement on the matter as to how he intends to fulfil his responsibility to those who have relied for many years on the existence of this home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#V00500","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I wish to raise today something I feel passionate about and which has come up in many different Departments and realms.

Our committee meetings commenced this week and everybody will see they are on the Standing Orders.<\/p> <p>I draw the attention of Senators to goal 6  in particular on clean water and sanitation.  This is of deep concern to me and I am aware I have raised it before in the Seanad.  It is a huge issue that is now prohibiting people from living in rural Ireland.  As a spokesperson for rural development, there will be no development in rural Ireland unless we take this huge issue seriously.  We have no money for raw sewage treatment in rural Ireland.  We have issues in urban Ireland around lead leaking into the water but we are basically failing humans in Ireland by not supplying them with access to clean, safe drinking water.  Raw sewage is the issue I wish to focus on today.  In particular, shovel-ready projects in many villages in towns are ready to go but they will not be built until we can get funding for proper water sewage treatment in Ireland.  As a result, people are getting poisoned from E. coli and cryptosporidium and many huge issues keep arising.  They have been happening for years and yet we have done nothing about it.<\/p> <p>I want the House to support me today  in asking the Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to come into the Chamber.  I imagine everybody here lives in a place where we have issues around water and water treatment.  If we do not ring-fence proper funding for water, we are going nowhere and now more than ever, we need to try to revive our towns and villages.  They cannot survive, not to mention thrive, until we sort out water.  It is our basic human right that we have signed up to in respect of the UN conference on the sustainable development goals.  I ask all my colleagues here today to support me on this and also to bring it up in their committees under the Standing Orders on sustainable development goals.  We only have until 2030 and we are failing.  We are only one third of the way there since we signed up five years ago.  Let us look at the sustainable development goals, get our heads around them and start prioritising them because we will all end up with better lives for ourselves and our children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#W00200","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I echo the sentiments of Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile on transport and support his proposed amendment to the Order of Business.

I have been following closely the work of a GP, Dr. Claire Dunne, who has been doing amazing work for the families and individuals on Lesbos.  One only has to listen to the accounts emerging from that site to understand why and how promptly we must evacuate people from the island.<\/p> <p>I wish to speak about two employees in County Cork who have campaigned and drawn attention to the fact that they had no toilet facilities in their place of employment.  They were employed by Spike Island Development Company and Members may have seen their campaign online.  They worked at a kiosk at the end of the island's pier.  They had been looking for a portaloo to be placed there and came up against a lot of resistance from the all-male board of the company.  The two women were looking for toilet facilities and were told to use the local library or hotel.  Obviously Covid brings further layers to this story considering the guidelines and the need to have handwashing facilities.  They were directed to use a tap at the end of the pier which is used for washing fish boxes.  They then took the matter to their trade union and eventually got a portaloo.  Their employment contract was until 29 November but they have been let go from their employment as of now.  Two new people are being trained in so it is not as if the women's employment has gone.  It sends out a really negative message when we have two women campaigning for basic toilet facilities and this is the result.  A letter was then sent to their union, which I believe is UNITE, that it must no longer communicate with the CEO of Spike Island Development Company.  The company is refusing to acknowledge the participation and advocacy of the union.<\/p> <p>Toilet facilities aside, there is also the whole issue of periods and sanitary needs and the fact that, having eventually given the portaloo, the all-male board intervened to punish these women for their advocacy.  This may be an issue for the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, who has responsibility for local government.  The kiosk is on Cork County Council's land so it may be able to intervene to ensure that in cases where it rents out land to kiosks such as this one, employment rights are upheld.  These women should be able to finish out their contract until 29 November at the very least.  They are not being allowed to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#X00100","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Yesterday's Cabinet decision to establish a commission on the future of the media in Ireland is to be welcomed.

The people in the NUJ, headed by Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley, know at first hand the real problems and challenges facing the media sector, in particular in the past 15 years, as well as the broken funding model afflicting it.

They included Mr. Gavan Becton, the editor of our local paper, the <i>Meath Chronicle<\/i><b>,<\/b>and its owner, Mr. Frank Mulrennan of the Celtic Media Group.  Indeed, it was Mr. Mulrennan who gave me my first job in local journalism some 20 years ago when he was chief executive of the <i>Drogheda Independent<\/i>.

It is for expenditure incurred up to 30 April 2021 on holiday accommodation or eat-in food and drink.  The minimum spend is &euro;25 per transaction and one must submit a copy of a receipt.  This is a welcome initiative from the Government in terms of supporting the hospitality and tourism sectors which as we know have gone through a torrid time in the past year as a result of Covid-19.

It was commissioned by the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, and it predicts the collapse of the post office network in a short period if drastic action is not taken.  The independent report clearly sets out the need for Government intervention to the tune of about &euro;17 million.  It identifies that by way of the public service obligation methodology that is used in an array of countries, including Spain, Belgium, Italy, France and Poland.  It has been approved by the EU Commission as a methodology to fund and support a service like the post office.  There have been changes to the way the post office operates and the demands and expectations of communities.  The State has been lethargic, to put it mildly, in terms of putting services into post offices that would meet the needs of citizens.  I do not need to lecture anyone in this House but if we look at what has happened during the pandemic, we see people retreating to their communities, being more dependent on the services that are there and moving away from large centres of population.  In light of that, there is a clear demand and need for us to take seriously this independent report.  I ask the Leader to try to organise a debate on this matter with the Minister at the earliest opportunity.  The specific objective of that debate should be fashioning a response that would protect, to the greatest extent possible, the post office network's ability to deliver for our communities.

It is important that we support the network.<\/p> <p>I also wish to raise the issue of the certainty of funding for development officers in various sports partnerships throughout the country.  The challenge for sports partnerships is that they only have certainty of funding for a period of one year.  As a result, there is no option but to employ development officers on temporary contracts for one year.  The level of uncertainty caused by the present arrangements means the partnerships are restricted in their capacity to forward plan and can only plan ahead for a few months at a time.  The arrangement is not conducive to long-term or strategic planning and it means the loss of the investment that any local authority or partnership put into the development of these officers and the expertise they gain.  While it is likely that Sport Ireland will continue to fund these jobs, consideration needs to be given to introducing a multi-annual funding stream to ensure that full-time, permanent community sports development officers and inclusion officers can be employed by local authorities through the sports partnership.  This will enable the partners to become more embedded in the functions of local authorities and help them achieve their objective of creating and maintaining healthy, active and sustainable communities in our towns.<\/p> <p>I also ask that the sports partnerships undertake an audit of sporting facilities throughout the country to ensure that all citizens have access to the large number of sports available and that funding, whether from sports capital grants or Departments, is arrogated to ensure that this happens.  I think of my home county of Longford and the lack of indoor and outdoor athletic facilities.  The Department and Sport Ireland should be financially supporting the local athletics club in order to ensure that these facilities are provided.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I also think of Connacht Hockey, and a number of Members from Galway will be well aware that upgrade from a 2G to a 4G pitch has meant that the grounds are no longer available for hockey.

Yesterday a developer pulled down The O'Rahilly House in Ballsbridge, despite the city council voting to give it protection by listing it on the record of protected structures.  From my understanding, once a local authority moves to put something on the record of protected structures it enjoys the protection of that act until an assessment is made.<\/p> <p>I want to draw the attention of the House to other houses and buildings around Dublin which are not getting adequate protection to protect our built heritage.  The city council did a deal in respect of the Iveagh Markets 20 years ago, which has been massively frustrated by the developer and publican who has done nothing with the building.  An Taisce has it on a list of the top ten endangered listed buildings.  The building is overgrown, there is extensive water damage and it has essentially been used as a car park for a publican from Temple Bar, despite it being in the middle of the Liberties.  It can be a great addition to the city.  It is a former dry market.  The developer is deliberately running the building down and causing damage.  Aldborough House, the second-largest Georgian building after Leinster House, has been left to rot for 20 years.  It is water damaged and its owner allowed it to be run down.<\/p> <p>I moved to have the former Player Wills factory on the South Circular Road put on the record of protected structures and it was voted on by the area committee in 2018.  The city council has not moved on that, despite putting other buildings onto the record of protected structures.  It is of great historical significance and is significant in terms of the industrial heritage of the city.  The developer Hines has bought it and said it would keep the first three bays of the building.

Most local authority swimming pools are operated by private operators.  In the case of Ballinasloe, the swimming pool is operated by an Irish-owned, family-run company, which is a fantastic company that operates seven other pools across the country.  <\/p> <p>Local authorities are under severe pressure and as we approach budget time the choices are being made now.

In Loughrea and Portumna there are no swimming pools.  When I was growing up in Ballinasloe it was considered unique in that we had access to a swimming pool.  We had the opportunity to swim.

The opportunity to swim should be available to everyone.   We hear of swimming pools being referred to as leisure centres.  A swimming pool is not a leisure centre, it is an accessible sporting facility for people of all ages and all abilities.  Both Brothers of Charity in the area use the pool.

I am aware that Members and the House have discussed different technical issues in this area on a number of occasions.  A new initiative has been spearheaded by the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV.  It represents qualified licensed auctioneers, valuers and estate agents, who aim to radically reduce the length of time it takes to sell a property in Ireland.  The IPAV has put together a seller's legal pack, SLP, which is a collection of documents that it proposes should be provided to aspiring purchasers when a property is put on the market, therefore front-loading this process.<\/p> <p>My understanding is that the motivation to change the current situation is rooted in the findings of the IPAV's recent conveyancing survey which revealed that 79% of auctioneers experience conveyancing delays between the point at which the sale of the property is deemed to have been agreed and when the sale is actually concluded.  The average time taken, between the point of agreement of sale and the signing of contracts, is ten weeks. The time taken from the signing of contracts to the conclusion of sale is normally six weeks.  I applaud the efforts of the IPAV to highlight this important issue and I am happy to raise it here today.  <\/p> <p>I understand that the ultimate ambition of the IPAV is to streamline the conveyancing process and to make it more efficient.  This is a move that I am sure all Members of the House would support.  I am assured that the SLP will substantially reduce the delay incurred in the current sales process, which is unaligned and rife with uncertainty, presenting legal risks to both vendors and purchasers.  It will help to limit the terrible practices of gazumping and gazundering, and will create greater certainty around the process for consumers and buyers.  I firmly believe that we must reach the point between all relevant stakeholders and those directly involved in the property transaction to develop a substantial property market where people can buy, sell or rent properties in a cost-effective manner.  Perhaps we can have a debate on this particular issue.

The recommendation is that meetings be for one hour and 55 minutes.  Councillors throughout the country are up in arms about that.  They represent the grassroots, and it is important that they have their voices heard.  The timeframe suggested for a local meeting every month is certainly not enough.  We need to consider this also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#GG00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I call for a debate on aviation, but particularly on our airports.

It will determine the staffing levels in our primary schools for the academic year 2021-22.  There is a serious risk that some schools may lose a teacher this year because a number of children have yet to return to school owing to health concerns associated with Covid-19.  Some pupils may live in a home in which there is an at-risk family member and, for that reason, their parents will have decided not to send them to school.  Since a school may have one or two pupils fewer, there is a risk that this could be the difference between its losing a teacher and holding on to one.  This year, I would like common sense and sensitivity on the part of the Department of Education regarding primary schools that find themselves in this unique position.  Last year, over 428 schools lost a teacher because of lower numbers.  The majority of those schools are in rural parts.  It is vital that sensitivity and common sense be adopted by the Department this year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask the Leader to stress that to the Minister for Education and Skills.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#GG00500","speaker":"1658","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Yesterday, the Future of Media Commission was established.  It is something that both the National Union of Journalists and I have sought for a very long time.  Fully independent and sustainable media that hold those in powerful positions to account are vital to any functioning democracy and recently we have seen that important role played out in golfgate.<\/p> <p>I welcome the establishment of the commission as a first step but I have some concerns regarding some of its terms of reference and some glaring omissions.  There is no reference to media diversity, plurality or ownership structures.  A 2016 report by the KRW Law-LLP firm found that Ireland had one of the most concentrated media markets of any democracy.  Likewise, the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom has repeatedly flagged the lack of media plurality in Ireland.  There is no mention of the role and impact of the digital search engines and social media platforms.  The terms of reference also fail to mention the employment challenges facing those who work in the sector.<\/p> <p>Journalism is increasingly becoming a precarious job and many young journalists have left the field in recent years.  This leads me to my concerns regarding the make up of the commission, and I say this without questioning the calibre of those who have been appointed.  The commission lacks anyone who has direct experience in the Irish news publishing industry at a local or national level.  There is no representative of a digital news platform.  There is no trade union representative who can speak to the employment challenges.  There is no-one with a background in journalism education on the commission and that is for no shortage of the very fine schools of journalism in this country.  Finally, I have grave concern about the absence of anyone from the local and community media sector.  I fear that if they have no voice around the table, community and local media will be completely forgotten despite the hugely valuable role that they play.  I urge the Minister to come before the House to hear these concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#HH00200","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and colleagues.  I will answer the questions in reverse order and I note Senators Boylan and Cassells raised this issue earlier.  It is a glaring omission that people with experience and knowledge of local news, national news, digital news and all the new forms that we have are missing from the committee.  To that end, when the commission was established yesterday, I sought the Minister's time for a debate on the issue.  I have secured a debate and I hope to schedule it for next week.<\/p> <p>In response to the contributions of Senators Burke and Chambers, tomorrow afternoon we hope to have a two-hour debate on aviation at which I expect everybody to raise the concerns that I believe we all have on both inward and outward bound domestic transport and the major employment implications that Covid-19 has placed on the aviation industry.<\/p> <p>Various debates have been sought with the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and  with the Minister for Justice and Equality concerning defamation laws.  I will make suggestions but the issue most raised here this morning has been the changes with the Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway routes.  I will ask for a debate but I remind colleagues, and I assume everybody knows this already, that the reduction of the 18 routes to 14 yesterday is based on the point that Expressway is the part of Bus &Eacute;ireann that is not supported by the public service levy because it is the private and enterprise division of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  There are some heartening key takeaways, including that not one bus driver will lose his or her job because of the amount of work that is available and supported by all the public-supported levied routes, which is a plus.  In addition, every single route of the four routes that were restricted yesterday are serviced by other supported Bus &Eacute;ireann and city journey providers.  That is something from which to take solace.  I will ask for a debate to be had at the earliest possible intervention. <\/p> <p>Lots of colleagues have raised the issue of The O&rsquo;Rahilly house today and they have raised it before.  It is blindingly obvious in this country that sometimes, no matter what we do and the concerns that we raise, when people want to bulldoze through something, just to get the development they want, they simply bulldoze through the development.  Sometimes we find ourselves completely disarmed and unable to do something, which is a real shame.  I do not just mean in normal circumstances.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, in circumstances where we have lost a vital piece of heritage relating to one of the founders of what we understand and enjoy today as modern democracy is an awful shame.  Senator Martin suggested that we should make them rebuild the house.  That misses the value of what we have lost.  We should look collectively at ensuring that something like this does not happen again by giving the relevant bodies the powers to stop something like this happening again.  Closing the door after this particular horse has bolted seems rather weak.<\/p><p>Other colleagues highlighted specific instances regarding St. Mary's.  I will certainly write on our behalf to ensure continuity of the service for the 18 residents.<\/p><p>Many people asked for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to take more refugees from the Moria camp in Lesbos.  We had this kind of discussion some weeks ago.  To that end, on behalf of Senators, I wrote to the Minister suggesting that the four unaccompanied children we had agreed to take was much lower than our heartfelt intentions.  It is nice to hear that he agrees with us and intends to try to take many more.  Senator Keogan knows this to be true.  We need to accept that we are short of foster homes and cannot take unaccompanied children to this country when we have nowhere for them to go.  If anything, today we should put out a call for people to become foster parents because that is the real crux.<\/p><p>The debate on direct provision is ongoing and I hope we will finalise it in the upcoming months and years to provide alternative accommodation.  The reality is that if we take 400 people from Lesbos tomorrow, we will all be having the conversation as to the communities in which they get settled.  Unfortunately, in the past year, we have experienced the ugly side of what people feel, albeit perhaps clumsily expressing themselves.  That conversation needs to be had.  I will again write to the Minister.  It was comforting to hear his public statement last week saying that he will try to bring many more children to the country than the four we have already agreed to take.<\/p><p>Senator Dolan raised swimming pools.  It is outrageous that at this time we would consider closing one of the very few necessary and vital outlets for people to have a bit of sociability.  In the past couple of days, we have seen an outcry in the media, perhaps understandably, that some of our younger people are expressing themselves in ways that some of us older people do not appreciate and do not understand.  I have four young people at home.  They are struggling and finding it hard not to be able to do what they would normally expect to do.  Perhaps it is my fault that I have not instilled this in them, but they do not have the same kind of critical understanding of the emergency, for want of a better word, that we are experiencing.  We need to help them to appreciate the difficulties they are having and not bash them because they happen to be doing something we do not agree with or approve of.<\/p><p>Young people in this country are wonderful.  They go to every country in the world and represent us in work, sports and the arts.  However, we are very quick to demonise them for doing something that they take for granted that they should be able to do, albeit that they are doing it in different ways than they would have previously, particularly when they go back to college.  Instead of demonising them we need to get the message to them that they are as vulnerable as the rest of us are.  It is not just us older people or our parents who are vulnerable.<\/p><p>It is ridiculous to shut down one of the outlets we have because we are short of money when we are spending hundreds of millions of euro, and in some cases billions of euro, to support people through this pandemic.  It is a time to be generous and it certainly is not a time to be stingy.  If it is only Galway, it should be relatively easy to fix because it cannot cost that much.  Senator Dolan said the company runs 700 swimming pools in the country.  I suggest that we all go to our own areas to make sure that it is not a much larger issue than just Galway.  We should support Senator Dolan to ensure it gets the funding it needs.<\/p><p>I was in the Chamber when Senator Byrne raised this issue last week.  I think Google knows more about me than I do myself.  It is scary to hear the Senator put it as eloquently as he did last week.  It is really scary that 33% of the world's data is held on servers in this country in something that we laud as the wonderful data industry that we have.  I am not sure we should laud it.  I am not sure we should encourage more data centres to be built.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will request the Minister for Justice and Equality, my constituency colleague, Deputy Helen McEntee, to come into the House today or at the earliest convenience to talk to the Senator, and all of us-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#HH00300","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>The Senator's former constituency colleague.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#KK00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Yes, my former constituency colleague.

She has raised it here a number of times because she cares, understands and appreciates the value of councillors, as we all do.  Like the Senator, many of us were councillors for years.  Many of us started our political careers on councils, including Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile in Belfast.  We all know the hard work that is put in by councillors and the value they give to constituents in towns and villages in rural and urban areas across the country.  The very least they need is respect and for the language used in the Moorhead report to be retracted.  We also need to put our money where our mouth is and recognise the work that is done.  We sometimes do councillors a disservice in our local and public media.  That is a real shame given the number of hours that they work.

I hope that we manage the system collectively and in an unpolitical way, for want of a better word, because the 60,000 or 70,000 young girls and fellows at home who have been impacted in a major way in recent weeks because of the system that was lauded to have been managed so well are experiencing significant distress today.  A telephone helpline will be announced this afternoon to allow each and every one of them connect with the Department to see what impact it has on them.

I am simply making the point that given all that has happened, Sinn F&eacute;in's position right now is that we need to go back to pre-legislative scrutiny and examine the Bill line by line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#TT01400","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Senator Gavan has made his point and I must work with the order of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#TT01500","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#TT01600","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>We cannot discuss an individual in his absence.

This amendment relates to the introduction of a new section that would require the Minister to lay before both Houses a report looking at the impact and use of the provisions of this Act in terms of compatibility with the OECD base erosion and profit shifting guidelines.  There would be real concerns if we found ourselves in a situation where the investment industry felt that it was ahead of the Oireachtas in the context of this Bill.  With this amendment, I suggest that a report be provided by the Minister within 12 months of the passing of the legislation.  Such a report would be crucial when it comes to compliance with and best practice in the context of the OECD guidelines.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is something we should look at before this Bill passes and why I concur with requests that we have a return to prelegislative scrutiny.  The Bill is not so advanced that it should not be possible.  <\/p><p>We know, for example, we are dealing with a large amount of money.  The total value of investment funds domiciled and administered in Ireland is &euro;4.9 trillion.  The amount of money lost internationally on an annual basis due to base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, is &euro;240 billion.  Much of it is lost to some of the poorest countries in the world.  <\/p><p>I am concerned, specifically, around some of the measures in this Bill that lessen liabilities.  I note my amendments in respect of the Revenue Commissioners at a later stage.  I am concerned about the lessening of potential liabilities in respect of our own tax base.  However, I am also concerned about the erosion of liabilities in other areas of this Bill, including the revenue of other countries.  I am somewhat concerned, specifically, about some of the provisions in the Bill on lessening liability and which seem to even lessen criminal liability.  Again, there are positive aspects in this Bill in terms of tackling money laundering but there are also places where we are, in fact, removing offences or removing potential liability under offences.  Again, in terms of due scrutiny and due process that is not ideal.  It is something we need to look at.<\/p><p>I will be pressing this amendment.  I will, however, also bring forward amendments to the effect that certain sections of this Bill should not commence until a review of compatibility with base erosion and profit shifting guidelines from the OECD is done.  Indeed, I will also look to suggest the timeframe.  Twelve months is the timeframe I gave.  I wrote this amendment prior to the revelations about the progress of this Bill and the question marks that have arisen regarding appropriate best parliamentary progress being seen to be done.  It is not just about being done but about that question being seen to be done.<\/p><p>It is important we have scrutiny of this Bill.  I am hopeful the Minister of State might accept this amendment.  I reserve the right to put forward stronger wording in terms of a report at a later stage.  Given the trillions of euro in investment funds passing through Ireland, we have a huge responsibility to not only abide by the basic letter of the law but be seen to give leadership in terms of the highest possible standards.  I will be pressing this amendment.  I hope the Minister of State might be able to indicate that he will accept this amendment.  It would give some signal of positive commitment to scrutiny and I will follow by hoping he will indicate that sections of this Bill might not commence until after the information has been provided.<\/p><p>I have a final request.  If the Minister of State has information on the OECD and BEPS guidelines in this Bill he would like to make available to all in this House in advance of this Bill resuming, that would be useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#AAA00200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I really want to echo what Senator Higgins has said.

I should first explain my appearance.  I was in hospital yesterday and I had a surgical procedure to remove some blemishes from my forehead, as a result of which I look as if I had measles.  I want to assure colleagues that I am not infectious and that I do not have measles.<\/p> <p>I realise also this has been a very busy day for the Minister.  I greatly appreciate that he has taken the trouble on such a very busy day because of Covid-19 to be here with us.  In the spirit of positive co-operation, I have had a very good meeting with civil servants on this Bill and I see Ms Flaherty is in attendance to advise the Minister.  That is also very much appreciated.  <\/p> <p>This Bill will have the effect, if implemented, of saving the lives of 50 infants per year.  I cannot imagine that any one of my colleagues will wish to vote against a proposal that would save 50 lives per year.  As I may get the opportunity to say later on, this is the real pro-life movement.  I have also said to Senator Mullen that I am hoping that he will speak on this Bill from a pro-life perspective.  I note that the Minister has put down an amendment and I will not be calling a vote on this as I would consider it foolish.  I am also very grateful to the Minister for putting this amendment down which asks that the Bill be read a Second Time this day 12 months to allow for further consideration, etc.  Can the Minister reduce that period to six months?  There was the suggestion that it is always 12 months.  It is not.  I am here for 33 years and I have seen periods of three months, six months and nine months.  I am choosing the median and I asked the Minister that he might graciously consider the period of six months.<\/p> <p>This Bill is urgent because now, in a table of 60 countries, including all of the European Union and the rich countries of the world, we are fourth from the bottom.  That is not a good position to be in.  I know that the Minister has indicated that we will be adding one new category this year but one category a year is fairly glacial progress.  This Bill will have the effect of pushing things forward.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One of the other things I am particularly interested in is the question of a statutory footing.  I would like to explain to the House why I am doing this.  Putting the Bill on a statutory footing provides for greater accountability to the Minister and the Oireachtas.  The Schedule at paragraph 10 requires the chairperson of the committee to appear before an Oireachtas committee when requested.  Section 5 of the Bill requires the committee to prepare and lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the test and whether conditions should be added to it, which must be done within six months of the Bill being enacted.  The committee will also be obliged to report annually on the programme and the addition of conditions to the list.  By putting pressure on the committee to do so, further pressure is placed on the Minister, whereby he must make a statement to the D&aacute;il as to why he is not taking on the recommendations of the committee.  We would not be able to require the committee to do this report if it were not on a statutory footing.  I understand that the argument from the Civil Service is that this is going to lead to a lot of bureaucracy, red tape, delays and the rest of it.  I find that an astonishing argument to come from the Civil Service because I would have imagined it would claim to be efficiency plus.  It is simply not true.  I would like to emphasise this point to the Minister.  Requiring the Minister to lay a report before the House every six months provides a degree of statutory urgency and a compulsion.  The whole process will be speeded up.<\/p><p>The objective of the Bill is to provide for the extension of the national newborn blood spot screening programme.  One of the arguments usually used against this kind of progressive measure is that it is going to cost the Exchequer money.  In the long term, it is not.  Providing for screening for conditions for which there is treatment will obviate ineffective, lengthy and expensive treatment for the children involved, so we are going to have a very considerable saving.  I understand also that questions have been raised about Italy.  In my original submission I said they had gone from screening for four conditions to 40 inside one year.  Apparently this is spotty and not general throughout the whole of Italy.  Some provinces are a little bit tardy.  The Italian Government is at the moment processing legislation to make it general so that argument falls as well.<\/p><p>I was originally contacted by a remarkable man whom the Minister knows as well, Les Martin.  He has three children, Cathal, Ciaran and Holly.  The two boys have a condition called metachromatic leukodystrophy. Cathal was diagnosed after two and a half years.  That meant it was too late for him.  It is probably too late for Ciaran as well.  Les Martin has suggested that the popular name for this Bill should be Cathal's Bill to reflect the important part he has played in this process.  It is really remarkable and astonishing that a man like Les Martin - who has the most lovely family, a real picture-book family of attractive, lovely people and three wonderful children - in the agony of watching two of his children progress towards death, would have the generosity of spirit to go out and try to ensure that this does not happen to another family.  That is a generosity that we in the Seanad could look to as an example.  The cost is &euro;50 per child, or &euro;3.5 million, and it would save hundreds of millions in treatment.  The HSE says it is possible to implement this immediately so let us do it.<\/p><p>I have also had a letter from a lady who wanted her name to be on the record, Samantha Kirwan.  She has a child who is also caught with metachromatic leukodystrophy.  It is a terminal and very progressive condition.  Amelia has the juvenile onset form, with a life span of ten to 20 years or fewer.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->She has lost her ability to walk and feed herself properly.  Her speech has slowed and she is confined to a wheelchair.  She went from a normal healthy baby to having everything taken away from her.  It is important to mention these cases.<\/p><p>This has been in the political works for quite some time.  On Wednesday, 19 June, my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues in the Lower House tabled an amendment to a Fianna F&aacute;il motion on maternity care.  That amendment stated we must guarantee the right of every child born in Ireland to be screened for all diseases for which there is a viable treatment.  This is also my position.  I do not see any great point in screening for diseases for which there is no treatment but we should confine it and focus on this.  The D&aacute;il voted on that motion on Thursday, 20 June, and it passed so we have a track record there.<\/p><p>Without involving the President, Michael D. Higgins, in a political debate, I want to mention that he was contacted about this and he expressed his belief that it is a human rights matter.  It is the right of a citizen to be treated in a way that is sympathetic to their proper development.<\/p><p>I was involved in the referendum on the eighth amendment and I was in favour of repeal.  Abortion is a very difficult issue to address and the then Minister did so very honestly and openly, as did the then Leader of the House, Senator Buttimer.  He was absolutely excellent in chairing the committee.  We were able to open ten abortion clinics in one year.  Why can we not do the same to save lives?  This is a pro-life position.  We opened ten abortion clinics.  Can we not open genetic screening testing facilities?  The saving of life is even more important than providing facilities for abortion.  We spent so much time convincing ourselves that abortion should be allowed, why should we not do something for the babies who continue to live?  I came up with what I thought was rather a good phrase about this business of postponing or referring.  Long fingering is failing people.  Long fingering is wasting time.  What we need is action.<\/p><p>That HSE might argue we cannot screen for every disease if we do not have the facilities to care for those who have them.  That logic is flawed.  The patients will exist anyway.  We will not get rid of them by just making a statement.  They are going to be there and they are going to require treatment and that treatment will be expensive.  They are going to come into existence and they will die.  Screening is available for &euro;50 a child so there is no excuse whatsoever to delay its introduction.<\/p><p>I greatly appreciate the positive attitude of the Minister and his advisers.  I look forward to a situation where we can progress the Bill and save the lives of 50 infants.  This is one of the most important debates in which I have taken part during my 33 years in the House because the opportunity to save life is so valuable.  The Jewish people have a phrase that he who saves one life saves a universe.  We have the opportunity to save 50 lives and I know the Minister in his heart believes this is an appropriate course for us to take.  We will all be supporting him in this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#KKKK00300","speaker":"1675","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank my colleague and friend, Senator David Norris, for sticking with this and pursuing it.

Subsection (1) establishes the committee on a statutory footing, which is exceptionally important.<\/p><p>Section 4 is titled \"Conferral of additional functions\".  This is a standard provision that allows the Minister for Health to draft an order, which must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, conferring the NSAC with additional functions it may need to perform effectively.  Senator Norris has referred to that.  It is worthy of note and comment.<\/p><p>Section 5, \"Reports of Advisory Committee\", specifically subsection (1), requires that the national screening advisory committee report and make recommendations to the Minister for Health on the expansion and the conditions tested for and by the national newborn blood spot screening programme within six months of the Bill being enacted.  The Minister must also cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Again, Senator Norris referred to that in his introduction.<\/p><p>A number of things struck me about the Schedule, which deals with procedural issues relating to the advisory committee.  The Schedule provides for a patient advocacy member of the committee.  It is important that there would be a patient advocate member of the committee if it were established.  The Schedule also requires that there be gender balance on the committee.  That is an important point that sometimes gets lost in all these things.  The Schedule also provides for details of the resignation or, for that matter, the removal from office of the committee.  Perhaps issues may arise such that people should be removed from office, disqualified, etc., from the national screening advisory committee.  That is an important provision in the Bill because it is something we do not always envisage when we set out to establish committees or when we run into difficulties.  It is important we have that mechanism in place, and that is dealt with in the Schedule.  The Schedule also requires members to disclose interests in any material matter to be considered by the committee and provides that the Minister may, if he or she deems fit, disqualify members of the committee for failing to disclose such interests.  That is important.  The Schedule also prohibits the unauthorised disclosure - this is a really important consideration - of confidential information obtained by a person in any capacity who engages with the committee and makes it a criminal offence to do so.  The Schedule also obliges the chairperson of the committee to appear before Oireachtas committees whenever requested to do so.<\/p><p>This is a very reasonable, pragmatic, common-sense Bill and I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on it.  Again, I commend Senator Norris on pursuing it.  Anything he does he sticks with it.  He has stuck with this issue, and I look forward to a favourable response from the Minister to the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#MMMM00200","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;the Bill be read a second time this day 12 months to allow for further consideration of the Bill and to allow the National Screening Advisory Committee to continue with its work and report on progress.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote> <p>I thank Senator Norris for bringing the Bill before the House and for all the very hard work he has done over a long number of years.

It is very significant that he pointed out that 50 lives could be saved per year as a result of the measures contained in the Bill.<\/p><p>It is vitally important that the screening service is expanded.  I have had two children in recent years and they were very fortunate to have availed of the screening service.  Thankfully, there were no adverse findings in their screenings, but I know friends of mine and family members who have had issues picked up in the screening service.  It is very important that the number of disorders is expanded, particularly when one considers that cystic fibrosis was only added to the screening service a short number of years ago.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2461\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is incredible, given the high incidence of cystic fibrosis in Ireland.

The Senator made points on the report being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and a gender balance, and these are very important.  I have heard the story of Les Martin and his family, which is absolutely heart-wrenching.  We need this done properly for all the children of Ireland and it is very important for the Minister to work on this with the national screening advisory committee, NSAC, to speed up its work.  It is not satisfactory that it has only met on a number of occasions since its formation.<\/p><p>At this point I ask the Senator to refrain from drawing parallels between termination care or reproductive rights for women and what is contained in this Bill.  Terminations are essential healthcare for women and it is not helpful to ever draw parallels or pitch one group against the other, perhaps even demonising women, in making those comparisons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#NNNN00200","speaker":"1643","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I supported abortion rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#OOOO00200","speaker":"1675"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":195,"content":"<p>The Senator's support was very much appreciated but drawing parallels between abortion care and what is contained in this Bill is not helpful.

As Les says, this is not for him, as his two sons have been diagnosed with a terminal disease.  His campaign is not for him but for all the other families that will be affected by the issue and so they do not have to endure the pain and suffering that he and his extended family have experienced.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the work done by Les, as he brought this matter from nowhere to somewhere that it is very relevant.  Without Les, the NSAC would not be in place.  He has campaigned hard to have it put there.  He has campaigned hard to have the screening expanded and has travelled to Italy, where one of his sons has been treated with some good results.  Regrettably, all this could have been avoided if the testing had been expanded before.  That is the fundamental point.<\/p> <p>As Les has said, he is seeking screening for conditions where treatment is available.  He is not looking for everything.  He is looking for the prick test to be done on children where treatment is available.  I know the Minister has met Les a number of times well before he took office.<\/p> <p>I have been in the Houses of the Oireachtas for four years and sometimes I wonder why the Government does not look to the benefits of forward investment.  This will save the State money in the long term.  In this case we are talking about children's lives but across all sectors we are not investing enough in forward thinking that could end up saving the State money.  I do not buy the argument that this is a cost on the State.  There would be an eventual saving to the State if we could diagnose these illnesses early.<\/p> <p>There is matter of putting this on a statutory footing and I have no qualms about that either way.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pat Casey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2431\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2431&amp;amp;pid=PatCasey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When I was a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, it debated whether the right to housing should be enshrined in the Constitution.

The Minister is committed to delivering on this issue and we will see results in that regard.  It is to be hoped that within a year we will see the results the Minister is seeking.  The national screening advisory committee needs to be given a bit more time.  It has only just been established.

If Laura Brennan was still alive, she would be 28 years of age.  Today is her birthday.  Everyone in the House will be aware of the phenomenal contribution she made to society.  For the last 18 months of her life, she campaigned for people to raise awareness.  She shared her story to raise awareness of what the HPV vaccine can do and what can be achieved if people take it.  When Laura embarked on her campaign in 2016 or early 2017, 50% of the age category for whom the vaccine is appropriate availed of it.  Last year, 81% of young people of the appropriate age availed of the vaccine.  I am glad to say that in County Clare, Laura's native county and also my county, that figure was 90%.  On her birthday, I reiterate my comments on the Order of Business this morning.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would be a fitting and most appropriate tribute to the tireless work of Laura and her memory if we could get that figure to 100% and if every parent realised that vaccines save lives and administering a vaccine to his or her child of 12 or 13 years could preventing cancer a few years later.<\/p><p>I listened to what my friend and colleague, Senator Clifford-Lee, said about her two beautiful children and the vaccines she has availed of.  There is an old saying, which I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach has often heard, that prevention is better than cure.  Investment in prevention is better than trying to find the money to create the cure.  That is thinking long term.  Unfortunately, thinking long term is not politically expedient and does not feed the monster of social media, but vaccination ensures that people's sons and daughters will benefit when they grow up.  They may not even know they benefit through being vaccinated against the awful evil that could land on their doorstep.<\/p><p>Senator Norris's Bill aims to identify illnesses at an early age.  When illnesses, challenges and disabilities can be identified at an early age, it is amazing what early intervention can do.  In this country, four out of five people who go blind or lose their sight do so unnecessarily.  It is because they do not have their eyes checked and the onset of conditions such as cataracts, glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa are not identified.  If people had their eyes checked regularly, they would get the interventions they needed.  As a result, 80% of the people who go blind in this country every year would not go blind.<\/p><p>As a society, we need to have a conversation about health checks.  The statistics show that females are more likely to get their health checked than males.  Deputy John Paul Phelan, our great colleague and friend in this House for many years, gave an interview on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 on Sunday last in which he spoke about his near-death experience and the obvious benefits of early intervention and regular medical checks.<\/p><p>Senator Norris, as always, must be commended.  I have yet to see the Senator bring a Bill before this House that did not make sense.  This one makes absolute sense.  I have no doubt the Minister will agree with my sentiments.  As always, however, we want to make sure the engine of the car is working.  I urge the Senator to accept the Government amendment because it is planted in logic and the need for work to be done to ensure the common goal we all aspire to is achieved through his Bill.  I know Senator Norris is man of common sense.  I sat with him in the Seanad Chamber for 200 hours when we discussed the awful Bill on judicial appointments and he made a great deal of sense on that legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#PPPP00400","speaker":"1644","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":202,"content":"<p>We got rid of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#QQQQ00200","speaker":"1675"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>On this occasion, as a wonderful parliamentarian, Senator Norris will see the logic of our amendment on behalf of the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#QQQQ00300","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>The Minister might shave six months off the 12-month period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#QQQQ00400","speaker":"1675"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>The Senator will understand that we are better off getting this right rather than having to come back and retrofit the legislation, which none of us wants to do.

It is most welcome and Sinn F&eacute;in looks forward to supporting its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I welcome the fact that the Bill will put the national screening advisory committee onto a statutory footing.  I note that the committee has been set up and has already met on two occasions and I look forward to reading the full minutes of the second meeting.  It appears from initial reports that recommendations are to be made to the HSE to add adenosine deaminase deficiency, ADA and severe combined immunodeficiency, SCID to screenings of newborns, which I welcome.<\/p><p>I particularly welcome section 3 of the Bill as it relates to the requirements of the committee to report on the expansion of conditions tested for by the national newborn blood spot screening programme, NNBSP and follow-up requirements thereafter.  The expansion of the NNBSP, known to us mammies and daddies as the heel prick test, to include much more testing is long overdue.  As we have heard from many previous debates, Ireland is way behind when it comes to the heel prick test and what we are actually testing for with it.  We currently only screen for eight conditions but other European countries like Italy, which is the model of best practice, are screening for up to 40 conditions.  It is to be hoped that the fact that the committee is required to report back on this specific issue on an annual basis will encourage progress in the expansion of this particular screening process.  <\/p><p>It is a matter of great concern that many screening programmes in Ireland are failing and falling behind.  Before the outbreak of Covid-19, we had the awful and tragic shambles of the cervical smear scandal.  As everyone knows more than 200 women were directly affected by the failures highlighted in the Scally report.  These failures led to the misreading of hundreds of cervical smear tests which led, unfortunately, to many women developing cervical cancer and some have since died.  Acknowledgement is not enough, however.  The Scally report was obviously a good start but it is not enough and its recommendations must be followed through.  I ask that consideration be given to the repatriation of the screening samples in order that the work can be done here at home, with the HSE having control and oversight.  The Government must step up its efforts in respect of the national screening laboratory immediately.  We must have an attitude of zero tolerance for misdiagnosis of cancer across the board.  The failure to provide properly functioning screening leads to more complex problems.  I acknowledge that almost all previous speakers referred to the fact that in almost every situation, prevention is better than the cure.  Early detection saves lives and it saves money in the long run.  <\/p><p>We now have a very worrying situation with regard to cancer screening services.  Services such as BreastCheck, CervicalCheck and BowelScreen have been suspended since 27 March.  Some have resumed but others are still delayed.  Fewer than 100,000 people have been screened in the first half of this year, compared to 500,000 in all of 2019.  The immediate impact is that thousands of people are experiencing symptoms but have not been tested.  As the Minister can appreciate, this is causing enormous anxiety.  It has led to waiting lists bursting at the seams.  Return to service is very much dependent on capacity and location.  These screening services must resume fully in a safe and appropriate manner.  I hope that this issue will be considered by the committee at its next meeting.<\/p><p>I reiterate Sinn F&eacute;in's support for this Bill and again thank Senators Norris, Boyhan and Craughwell for leading the way by proposing to put the committee on a statutory footing.  The work on screening for genetic disorders in newborns did not go unnoticed by my party.  My party colleagues, Deputy John Brady and former Senator M&aacute;ire Devine were actively engaged with Mr. Les Martin and his family.  Many Members have spoken today of their appreciation of the Martin family and their pursuit of the change we are discussing today, despite their own difficulties.

In that regard and as others have done, I pay special tribute to Les Martin, his partner, Lynda, and their children, Holly, Cathal and Ciaran, who have been tireless in campaigning for the expansion of the newborn screening programme.  Others have referred to their heartbreaking story of having two sons battling with a rare condition.  I mention the immense and positive work they have done, not just in Ireland but also in Italy, to ensure that life-saving treatments will be made available for other children where early screening can be carried out.<\/p> <p>Both in preparation for that motion last year and for the debate on this Bill, we have heard evidence of the huge value an expanded newborn screening programme could provide.  We have heard about bill 167, which was passed in Italy in 2016 and which provided a statutory basis for the screening programme there.  As colleagues mentioned, the Italian programme screens for 40 conditions, which is a much wider range of conditions than are screened for in Ireland.  We know that only eight conditions are screened for in Ireland under what we all know as the heel prick test, as Senator McCallion said.  There is a wide variation across different EU member states.  Some 29 conditions are screened for in Poland but as few as two are screened for in Malta.  I know there have been debates in the European Parliament and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, about trying to ensure a more consistent approach.<\/p> <p>We know the immense value of this early screening.  As the explanatory memorandum points out, early newborn blood spot screening can ascertain whether children are suffering from certain disorders or conditions which are treatable if identified at an early stage.  That is why we refer to this proposal as being genuinely life-saving.  It is because early detection and prevention can lead to genuinely life-saving treatment.  I recall watching the heel prick test being carried out as a new parent.  It is quite traumatic, when a baby is only a few days old, to see the test being carried out but it is so important.  It is a minimally invasive procedure, yet it has such a beneficial effect, even if we are only screening for eight conditions, as we are in Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is especially beneficial when it is used to screen for many more disorders in, for example, Italy.  Interestingly, the test is mandatory there.  There is another debate to be had about mandatory versus voluntary screening tests.  Ireland has a high uptake rate of the heel prick test.  Every parent recognises how important it is.  However, we have seen some alarming drops in uptake rates in child vaccination programmes.  Other colleagues, in particular Senator Conway, referred to the wonderful Laura Brennan.  I join the Senator in paying tribute to her considerable work throughout her life in support of vaccinations and encouraging more parents and children to have vaccinations.  There has also been significant work done by Vicky Phelan and other campaigners in the context of the cervical smear controversy.  Their work has sought to ensure high uptake rates of the cervical cancer vaccine as well as other childhood vaccines.<\/p><p>Who would have predicted a year ago when we debated this motion the immense focus on vaccines in the context of Covid?  It is important for all of us as public representatives to speak in support of vaccination and the principle that vaccines save lives and are safe, and to urge parents to take up the vaccination programmes that are rolled out.<\/p><p>I strongly support this Bill.  Labour Party Senators signed up to the motion last year and are signing up to the Bill this year.  We commend Les Martin and his family on their considerable work.  Front-line organisations have worked with Les Martin and Senator Norris, including the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation, the LauraLynn Children's Hospice Foundation, Enable Ireland and Rare Diseases Ireland.  All of those organisations have been pushing for this Bill.  They represent parents and families on the front line of caring for children with life-limiting conditions.  They have seen the benefits on a human level of supporting legislation of the sort that was passed in Italy.<\/p><p>The other aspect of the Bill seeks to put the national screening advisory committee on a statutory footing.  That has been an important development since the House last debated this issue.  I welcome that the committee's inaugural meeting was held in December and that there has been a further meeting, but it is important that there be a statutory basis for the committee.  I support Senator Norris's provisions setting out how the committee will operate.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Norris for his commitment to this issue, express the support of the Labour Party in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il for when, rather than if, the Bill gets to the D&aacute;il, and urge the Minister to move forward in a timely fashion and ensure that the Bill becomes law.  We owe it to Les Martin, his children and all the families that are facing the terrible diagnoses that affect so many children to remember, as Les Martin has told us, that legislation of this sort, which expands the programme, could save up to 50 children's lives per year.

I highlighted some issues at the time.  While I agreed with the motion, I had concerns.  I raised concerns with similar proposals at an Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, meeting.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is appropriate that we look to whatever mechanisms we can to widen the number of conditions for which we screen.  If we take the example of Italy, 40 conditions are screened for there.  It is important for families to know about the existence of such conditions so that they can plan and access life-saving treatment for those affected, but it is also important for the Minister and other officials within the health service, so that they can put plans in place.  I hope that as we move towards expanded screening, it will be accompanied by increased resources, particularly in the field of rare conditions.  There may be only a small number of individuals who are affected by rare conditions, but their families and communities are also impacted, particularly when there are gaps in the health service in terms of the screening for those conditions.<\/p><p>I am in favour of the expansion of the screening programme but it should be noted that how we screen will be important going forward.  It is something we must get right.  There are concerns surrounding how we have screened for certain conditions in the past, both regarding procurement and some of the partnerships in which the State has engaged.  <\/p><p>When this Bill comes back for Committee Stage, ethics is an area in respect of which I will move some amendments.  It is an essential area of expertise within the screening committee.  I refer to the example of cervical screening.  In that situation the procurement contract awarded was of the lowest cost.  I intend to bring Private Members' legislation later in the sitting term around the issue of procurement and the problem with focusing on lowest cost rather than looking at the price: quality ratio in terms of who is awarded the screening contract.  <\/p><p>I agree with Senator McCallion that we need to seek to strengthen our own national screening capacity in Ireland.  We have experts in our universities and must strengthen the mechanisms in place for screening and our in-house capacity for same.  The other key principle is that the protection of public health must come first.  This has to be about public health.  I have had concerns about some of the partnerships into which the Government has entered with groups such as Genomics Medicine Ireland, now known as Genuity Science.  We have had situations in which the Government has entered into partnerships with organisations and the HSE has experienced a delay in accessing the data.  In such cases the information is effectively being gathered, used by a commercial partner and then eventually being made available to the HSE.  It is vital that it is set out in legislation that it is within the statutory powers of the screening committee that it can ensure that the protection of public health is the guiding principle in this area.  We must not find ourselves in a situation in respect of screening mechanisms where we are partnering inappropriately with organisations who may be providing access to databases to the pharmaceutical industry.  We know, for example, that Genuity Science made &euro;13 million in January 2020 from selling access to databases.  These are not issues that are intrinsic to the heel prick screening test, for example.  These are issues that can easily be avoided through careful legislation, safeguards and in-built ethical parameters.  <\/p><p>As stated by others, I want to see the heel prick screening test being taken up widely, and for every child in Ireland to be screened.  Ensuring the rights of the child are protected is part of the Constitution, and we must make sure that every child is given the best possible opportunity in life by being screened for conditions that will allow their families, and later themselves, to manage those conditions as best as possible going forward.  The genetic data of children, such as their DNA and other elements that may be associated with a blood sample, are also intrinsic to their protection.  Therefore, it is important that the purposes for which samples taken as part of the heel prick test are used, such as screening, are carefully safeguarded and firewalled.  I say that because I want people to avail of screening opportunities, and for screening to be widespread.  <\/p><p>I support the thrust of this Bill and the screening committee.  However, safeguards must be built into the functioning of that independent committee, to ensure that we protect the public health purposes of the screening from other commercial activities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I again commend those who have brought this Bill forward, though I would perhaps add a caveat.

These issues should all be addressed in order that it can make speedy progress at that point.

We got to talking.  I told him why I was going on the radio and he told me why he was going on.  He has three young kids; a little girl and two little boys.  I also have three young kids and so we got to talking, as two dads in Wicklow, only two of Les's kids are very sick.  That was the first time I met him and I have spoken to him many times since, including this week in the context of this Bill.  He has done extraordinary work and continues to do so.  I agree with colleagues that it is selfless work.  Les is right, ultimately.  I do not know whether the right answer is 40 conditions, but I know it is not eight.  He is right and we are going to progress his work and provide the public health and scientific resources that are needed.  We are going to save as many children as can be saved in this country.

My conclusion was that were we to move the committee onto a statutory footing right now, there would be a real risk it would simply slow things down because, once things move to a statutory footing, there are all manner of procedures and things that have to be done.  The reason for the timed amendment is only that - it is only that the committee is new.  It is to let it do its work, let it build up a bit of pace, and we can then see where we are at.  I will talk later to the various points on it.  That is the only reason for the timed amendment.  I believe there is a real risk that, in all of us trying to do the right thing, we could slow down what is vital and life-saving work.<\/p><p>I have tabled a response from Government to seek this 12-month extension.  The national screening advisory committee is newly established.  It has robust terms of reference and a diverse expert membership.  It was established in 2019 on foot of the recommendations contained in Dr. Scally&rsquo;s report.  The committee's role is to provide robust independent expert advice when it comes to considering population screening programmes here.  Substantial work was carried out to establish the committee and to staff it with independent and eminently qualified people and an eminently qualified chair, as well as a very broad membership, including what are called people advocates or patient advocates, with a very broad range of experience.  In July 2019, Professor Niall O'Higgins was appointed chair and he brings a wealth of experience to the role.  He was extensively involved in establishing a system of breast cancer services, BreastCheck, and the national breast cancer screening service.<\/p><p>The committee is set up in such a way as to enable it to be agile and in a position to respond to new developments and scientific research as they relate to population-based screening.  The approach taken here is closely aligned to the approach in the UK, where the national screening committee is also on a non-statutory footing.  Our committee has agreed terms of reference that closely mirror those set out in the Bill.  Operating as it is currently established ensures the committee will be free to evaluate proposals for applications for any new screening programme or modification of existing programmes, as appropriate.<\/p><p>The committee communicates independent expert advice directly to me, as Minister for Health, and to the Department of Health, the HSE and relevant stakeholders and members of the public.  It is strongly committed to increasing public understanding and confidence in the screening programmes as set out in its terms of reference.  I would like to acknowledge the contributions of several Members regarding the broader screening programme.  Obviously, we are focused on the newborn screening programme but the committee has a very important role, and we all have a very important role, in fostering confidence in those programmes.<\/p><p>In regard to the national newborn blood spot screening programme, I am very cognisant of the desire to expand this and agree wholeheartedly with the desire to expand it.  I am acutely aware of how difficult it is for parents whose children have received a diagnosis of a rare disease, and how challenging daily life can be for them, their families and their children.  It can be an overwhelming situation and can be very isolating for many families because of the significant work that is involved when a rare disease is diagnosed.<\/p><p>It is worth pointing out, on a positive note for Ireland, that we were one of the first countries in the world to introduce a national programme in 1966, so well done to everyone who was involved in that.  The newborn screening programme known as the heel prick test is offered to all newborn babies in Ireland through their parent, parents, legal guardian or legal guardians when they are three to five days old.  It checks for eight rare conditions that are treatable if detected early, which is key.  Most babies born in Ireland will not have any of these eight rare conditions but, for a very small number who do, detecting a condition early has huge benefits.  It means that treatment that is established as effective can start early, which improves health and prevents severe disability in later life or even death.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I acknowledge the many potential benefits of expanding the national newborn screening programme and I am committed to identifying opportunities for future additions to it.  Any other population-based screening programmes will be considered by the national screening advisory committee.  Recommendations will be made following an independent and robust assessment of the evidence against internationally accepted criteria. <\/p><p>Expansion of the national newborn bloodspot screening programme has been a priority of the committee since its establishment.  The newly-established committee has been asked to prioritise a review of the programme.  This is important.  Specifically, the committee is concerned with how to progress this in line with international best practice.  To be clear, the committee is not just reviewing new evidence as it emerges.  It has been specifically tasked with looking at our current programme and making recommendations on how it can be expanded.  Work on the review will be progressed with the support of our regulator, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, which has been appointed to support the work of the committee.  HIQA is far more than a regulator.  For example, it is currently tasked with assessment of the technology for rapid Covid-19 testing.  It has a vital technical and scientific role to play in support of the committee.  I have asked the committee to report within six months. <\/p><p>Since its establishment, the committee has made one recommendation to me in respect of the national newborn screening programme.  The meeting took place in July 2020.  It recommended the addition of adenosine deaminasedeficient severe combined immunodeficiency, ADA-SCID.  I hope any scientists in the room will forgive me.  I accepted the recommendation and have advised the HSE of this decision.  The HSE is now making the relevant arrangements for inclusion in the programme.<\/p><p>This is of key importance.  If we were debating this today with nothing having happened except that a committee had formed somewhere and terms of reference had been agreed, I would be more concerned.  Perhaps then it would be right to introduce a forcing mechanism.  If the Oireachtas was not convinced the committee was doing its job, a statutory footing would be needed.  The fact that the committee is doing its job is relevant and important.  We have just moved from eight rare conditions to nine.  The question is how to move to ten, 11, 12, 13 and so on.  <\/p><p>Changing the 12-month extension would require a Cabinet decision.  The 12-month period was my proposed way of meeting Senator Norris's concerns halfway.  The committee probably needs the 12 months.  However, when I read the Senator's Bill I noted that it would require the committee to report to me and me to lay the report before both Houses within six months of the committee being established on a statutory footing.  As a proxy for that, I have already written to the chair and asked the committee to report to me within six months.  I will go one step further.  I suggest that we should retain the 12-month extension, but when I have the committee's report after six months I will share it with colleagues here.  Perhaps we can convene formally or informally to discuss the progress that has been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#VVVV00500","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>That would be very useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#XXXX00200","speaker":"1675"},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.<\/p> <p>I wish to make a point about public health, which is what this is all about.

I was before the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response earlier today.  Today we made two very significant announcements.  The first is that I have just sanctioned a doubling of our public health workforce.  Before the Covid-19 pandemic reached Ireland we had 254 people working in public health throughout the country.  That includes the eight public health bodies, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and other areas.  We are adding a further 250 staff, which will include public health doctors, public health nurses, scientists and administrative and management support.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a very significant statement of intent that we are doubling our public health workforce.<\/p><p>Another measure which I have just sanctioned is that public health doctors will have access to consultant grade.

It is great to have a Minister come into the House who is so open to improving the lives of children and all citizens of our nation.  All Senators agree that the screening of newborns is among the most important screening programmes.  I know people who, because they were born in Newry, were screened for cystic fibrosis.  They were born before 2011.  Their quality of life was improved because they got the heel prick test.  It was normal for that test to be carried out in the North, but it was not routinely carried out in the South until 2011.  Children born before 2011 were not screened for cystic fibrosis, but those born since then have been screened.  That has an impact on their life expectancy and their quality of life.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister's commitment to the expansion of the screening programme.  I welcome the fact that he will update the House in six months' time.  I ask that he get his officials to look at the situation in Italy and the potential savings the HSE could make by implementing a testing model similar to that in operation there.  As he knows, it is not just about finances or a cost-benefit analysis of resources being assigned to various issues; it is about the lives of babies.  It is about their life expectancy and quality of life.  It is about looking after families and babies.  They deserve the best start we can give them.  I very much welcome that he has prioritised the review for the national newborn blood spot screening programme and that he stated it will be expanded in line with international best practice.  I ask him to update the House with regard to the basis or grounds for the board deciding to recommend a particular additional condition or screening test over another.

I listened to his compassionate plea earlier for the family he mentioned, and meeting a young Dad and his children.  I also listened to the contribution from Senator Casey concerning his knowledge of the children, as well as what the Minister had to say.  It is incredibly poignant to think that a family dealing with its own crisis as the health of the two young boys declines is also lobbying so hard to ensure that other children and families will not have to go through the same pain, heartbreak and grief.  I commend that family, because it is not easy to endure that experience and start a campaign that takes away from the precious time they have with those they love.<\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about that situation.  I thank the Minister for being here and for the positive response he has given to this motion.  The Minister's proposal regarding public health doctors is good, including the doubling of their numbers and associated recompense.  We have relied on them a great deal in the last seven or eight months, and we will be relying on them again for the next 18 months or so.  Our public health doctors have been doing an incredible amount of work in the background as well.  <\/p> <p>Looking at the screening service now, we can see how far we have come since the first screening programme, BreastCheck, was brought in 20 years ago by the then Minister for Health, and now Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  I think that was in June 2000, the millennium year.  We have moved on and now have three different types of cancer screening programmes, namely, BreastCheck, BowelScreen and CervicalCheck.  I do not need to go through the litany of failures surrounding cervical cancer screening, but every one of those women impacted spoke about the importance of encouraging and supporting other women to go for screening.  That has certainly been a very good thing.  We also have diabetic retinal screening.  <\/p> <p>The establishment of the national screening service in 2007 was really important.  The Minister spoke of the committee which commenced earlier this year.  It is important that it is an independent body which will give advice to the Minister and his Department.  I state that because this concerns promoting public confidence as much as anything else.  The Minister said, \"we can and must do more\", and we absolutely must.  If we can save 50 lives a year, then there is no option whatsoever but to do that.  <\/p> <p>I accept the explanation given regarding the amendment, and I support it, but I also accept the Minister's suggestion that after six months he might be able to return to the House and discuss the issue with the proposers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a privilege to be in the House to speak in a debate such as this.

I am mindful of the parents throughout the country who are dealing with conditions or illnesses in their children that might have been picked up had the service provided for in the Bill been available some years ago.  Most of us have come across somebody in our lives who is struggling with a child who has a terminal illness or who is suffering with cystic fibrosis or some other condition.  To have one's child given a sentence of death early in life is tough going.<\/p> <p>Senator Norris, speaking in the House in July 2019, said that this was the most important debate in which he had taken part in his 32 years - now 33 years - as a Member of the Seanad.  That statement attests to both the seriousness of this issue and the relative ease with which it could be rectified.  I acknowledge the role of Mr. Les Martin, his wife, Linda, his daughter, Holly, and his two sons, Cathal and Ciaran, in ensuring this Bill meets the needs of families in which children are born with undiagnosed genetic illnesses and whose lives could be saved by an expanded newborn screening programme.  As a father and grandfather, it is unimaginable to me that my children or grandchildren might have been born with undetected but treatable conditions and that the length and quality of their lives would have been dependent on a programme that exists but has not been expanded, despite the significant leaps in medical and genetic research.<\/p> <p>I sincerely hope the Bill will be passed and it looks like it will be.  It will expand the national newborn blood spot screening programme, which has the potential to allow for life-saving treatment for at least one child per week.  I listened to the Minister's argument regarding the delay of 12 months and I understand the rationale behind it .  However, I am mindful of the fact that 50 children will not benefit in the interim.  I acknowledge that he will make every effort to move on this sooner if he can.<\/p> <p>It should be noted that new conditions can be screened from the same heel blood spot that is currently used.  We learned from Mr. Martin that Italy has increased its testing to cover 40 conditions, an increase from four previously.  I understand the Italian authorities are willing to share the technology and anything they have learned with their European colleagues.  It is one of the great benefits of being a member of the European Union that we have this type of co-operation between member states.  Legislation was enacted to make the screening a mandatory national public service to ensure the viability and longevity of the newborn screening service in Italy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Every Italian newborn receives a free and compulsory test providing early diagnosis at birth for almost 40 rare metabolic hereditary diseases.  My colleague, Senator Bacik, referred to that.  That is another debate that we must have with respect to matters such as screening and vaccines that have been discussed today because the protection of life is important.<\/p><p>The Bill before us places the national screening advisory committee on a statutory footing.  I agree with that provision, which was one of the many recommendations of the Scally report on our national screening programmes.  The Bill also places the screening programme on a statutory footing.  It will ensure dialogue with stakeholders, full disclosure and accountability in respect of all screening programmes in the State.  This is essential as it will ensure that the committee is well resourced, forward looking and proactive, rather than reactive in response to new conditions.<\/p><p>The cost of the heel prick test in Ireland is approximately &euro;50 per child.  This is a pittance in the overall scale of the national health budget, yet life-saving for the children who receive diagnoses.  Any additional costs arising from expanding the programme would be far exceeded by the benefits.  I am sure there is no need to convince any Senator on any side of the House of this.<\/p><p>In looking back over the history of the national screening programme in Ireland, it is hard to believe that we were considered to be leading lights in newborn screening and research in the world when the screening programme was first set up in 1966.  Now, sadly, we would be considered one of the laggards as we have not expanded the number of conditions, although I heard today that we are moving in that direction and I thank the Minister for that.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, Mr. Phillip Watt, chair of the rare disease task force, stated that while an average of 20 diseases are screened for at birth among babies in Europe, Irish hospitals only screen for eight conditions.  The Minister is telling us that the number is now increasing.  This contrasts sharply with some states in the USA where babies are screened for up to 50 conditions.<\/p><p>Currently, 42 children are born in Ireland each year with a condition that could be detected at birth and treated but is not.  That is one baby every eight days.  I understand the Minister's predecessors, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Mr. Finian McGrath, were very supportive of this legislative proposal and that the then Minister gave a commitment in the House in July 2019 to send his officials to Italy to meet their Italian counterparts .  I am not sure if that meeting has taken place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#AAAAA00700","speaker":"1645","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":247,"content":"<p>It has.

Hopefully, the Minister will tell us in six months that we are ready to move and the interim report has answered any questions that need to be answered.<\/p> <p>I hope parents and, in particular, young women who are pregnant and experiencing all the fears that go with bringing a child into the world, trust us to do everything and to move hell, heaven and earth to screen for 42 conditions as soon as possible.  It is so important that this is done.  It is a long time since I was a first-time dad but, more than anything else, I remember the fear of this tiny little being coming into my life and being asked to pick her up.  I loved my daughter but she was so tiny and when picking her up I had a fear of breaking her in some way.  I would have walked over hot coals to do anything to solve any issue that she may have had.  Every parent in the country is the same.<\/p> <p>There is a big weight on the Minister's shoulders, in addition to everything that is going on with Covid-19 and all the other issues in health.

I commend my colleague, the father of the House, Senator Norris, on persisting with this important cause.  I commend Senators Boyhan and Craughwell for also sponsoring the Bill.<\/p><p>The Bill is welcome.  It has two main effects: it puts the national screening advisory committee on a statutory footing; and, in the context of that committee's work, it requires the committee to make recommendations, not about the conditions tested, but about the expansion of the conditions tested by the national newborn blood spot screening programme.  Several Senators have spoken about the importance of such recommendations and the expansion of screening.<\/p><p>Any initiative that allows increased screening of citizens for serious conditions should be supported in order to allow for early intervention, give clinicians a head start and allow those with diagnosed conditions to deal with them or to be helped in the best way possible.  It is important that we increase screening for newborn children, particularly those who may be at higher risk because of a family history of certain illnesses.<\/p><p>It is good that the House is discussing screening.  We all know that, in the context of Covid-19, our healthcare system has been under considerable pressure.  Even getting treatment for conditions has been difficult.  As a result of the need to focus on treatment, there has been an unfortunate halting of BreastCheck and CervicalCheck appointments during the pandemic.  Sadly, that will probably cost lives in the years to come through certain conditions being diagnosed much later than would otherwise have been the case.  We understand the reasons for the pressures on the healthcare system and for screening to take second place to the treatment of identified conditions, for example, cancer, but we must get back to having a well-focused and well-funded approach to screening.  BreastCheck, BowelScreen and CervicalCheck have performed a vital service for women and saved many lives in recent years, notwithstanding the failings that have been highlighted.<\/p><p>I wish to mention a number of issues.  Senator Norris is clear in the Bill on the need for openness and transparency in the provision of our health services.  Putting the national screening advisory committee on a statutory footing is intended to follow through on the letter and spirit of the Scally report, which recommended and led to the committee's establishment.  However, I am particularly taken by section 5(4) concerning the committee's recommendations.  We need to be clear that it is not just in the context of the expansion of the national newborn blood spot screening programme that the committee is empowered to make recommendations.  Rather, it has a broad remit under section 3 to make recommendations, and that is as it should be.  However, section 5(4) provides: \"If the Minister does not accept a recommendation of the Advisory Committee ... the Minister shall, within one month of being given a copy of the recommendations [containing the recommendations] ... prepare and lay ... a statement of the Minister&rsquo;s reasons for not accepting it.\"  I have not had an opportunity to look at how common this kind of requirement is, but at a time when there is concern in Ireland and, indeed, Britain about the important role of governments in making decisions and the need for parliaments to restore their level of oversight of important decision-making, this is another way where, with great respect to our Government and the important function of the Minister, accountability is sought and ensured by requiring that, where a recommendation is not to be accepted, a reason for not accepting it is given fairly promptly.  I welcome that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I wish to raise a number of issues that I touched on during the debate we had last July which the then Minister of State at the Department of Health, Finian McGrath, acknowledged as important.  He said that the Department was seeking information from other EU member states on them.  I refer first to the question of the efficacy of screening programmes.  I understand that there is a debate abroad about the effectiveness and benefit of certain forms of screening and DNA testing in particular.  In the United States, there is a view that new screening should only be targeted at children within families where there is a history of certain serious conditions.  Non-specific testing obviously has a large cost and perhaps we should be directing resources to provide the maximum range of testing to those at highest risk.  That said, I favour the broadest approach to screening but would ask whether this is a policy consideration that will underpin the work of the committee or whether the Minister thinks that it should.  I am also interested in the question of conflicts of interest.  I have previously raised the fact that screening and DNA testing are often a cash cow for the pharmaceutical industry.  Eruofins Biomnis, the company that produces the Harmony test, for example, has made enormous profits.  The Irish and British medical councils have also issued warnings about potential conflicts of interest in circumstances where doctors have a financial interest or incentive to recommend certain testing.  These are also important issues that do not contradict in any way the spirt or the aims of this legislation.  N&iacute; thagann siad salach ar bhunspriocanna an Bhille seo but it is important that they are considered.  It would also be important that the committee, once given statutory underpinning, would tread carefully and take such issues into consideration.<\/p><p>I wish to raise an issue that is not directly connected but about which I would like to ask the Minister, although I am not necessarily expecting a response today.  I raise it in the context of prevention and the early identification of conditions, as well as taking early steps to ensure the future treatment of conditions.  I am interested in the whole area of so-called chord blood banking, the process whereby blood is taken from umbilical chord or placenta after birth which contains stem cells that could be retained for later use.  Sometimes this blood is retained in private clinics while in other cases it is publicly held.  I understand that this is relatively common abroad but is not common in Ireland.  Is this something upon which the Minister has a view?  Is it something that is being looked at in the Department?<\/p><p>Finally, I wish to return to the committee and the qualifications required of its members.  I note that 18 specialties are listed and correctly so, including genetics, laboratory services, nursing and midwifery.  I also notice, however, that journalism is included.  That jumped out at me because it is the only clearly non-medical specialty listed.  It jarred slightly with me.  I am not sure I have a settled view but I am wondering why it was felt that journalism should be specifically included.  Is it to do with having somebody on the committee who could help to explain its work, make sure its reports are well written or help to explain its position in lay person's language?  I have a limited former career in journalism, which is perhaps why I am intrigued by it.  Of course, one might add that at the rate that journalists are becoming Government advisers, maybe that should also be included as a category for possible consideration.  This is a question that jumps out at me because it would be a stretch to say that journalists have the same type of technical or academic qualification that the other specifically named specialties can provide to the committee.  I wonder about that while not having a very strong feeling about it.<\/p><p>In summary, I commend Senator Norris on bringing forward this very important Bill and I am very happy to hear the Government's positive response to it.  I look forward to its early enactment and to the strengthened work of the national screening advisory committee.  The proof of the pudding, of course, will be when we see an enlarged number of conditions being tested for in the context of the national newborn blood spot screening programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020093000002#BBBBB00400","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601458200,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, in particular, and his advisers for being here with us this evening.
