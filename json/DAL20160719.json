It is interesting that there has been approximately a 400% increase in the number of families sleeping in emergency or temporary accommodation for the homeless since October 2014.  That is a rise from 800 families in that situation to 2,177 in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In 2012, we only had an average of eight new families presenting as homeless in Dublin every month, but that rose to 40 families per month in 2014, and has risen to 70 per month in the first half of this year.  Clearly, therefore, the situation is getting worse year after year.  For far too long the last government denied the existence of a crisis and only belatedly declared it a national emergency.  It published many strategies which were lacking in detail, implementation and execution in terms of their impact on building new houses.  For example, fewer than 274 new social houses were constructed in 2015, and only 28 of those were directly built by local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Committee on Housing and Homelessness, chaired by Deputy John Curran, did a lot of good cross-party work in coming up with solutions.  The Minister has announced his response today.  My key question to the Taoiseach concerns the execution, administrative and statutory capacity to deliver the scale of houses required to meet the challenges.  Very few council houses were built by councils in 2015 and 2016, to date, yet we are now looking in the plan at up to 47,000 new social houses.  One must question the current capacity of the system to deliver that number.<\/p>  <p>  Is it not the case that a separate statutory institution or agency is required with wide-ranging powers to drive home house-building and deal with what is, by any yardstick, a national emergency?<\/p><p>Anybody who listened in this morning to \"Morning Ireland\" will have heard that we have had children living in hotels in Dublin in recent years, the impact of which on families, mothers, fathers and children was eloquently and graphically articulated.  It is a true blight on our society.  Notwithstanding all the strategies in the world that we publish, I am concerned about the capacity to execute delivery of this plan.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the statutory administrative capacity to deliver it exists?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468933500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>As we speak, the Minister with responsibility for housing is attending with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and others at the formal launch of the Government's housing action plan and so the Deputy's question is very pertinent and appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  We have made no secret that the issue of providing accommodation and proper housing for people, both social and affordable, and dealing with homelessness is a key priority of Government.  That is why &euro;5.3 billion is being provided, with 47,000 houses to be provided by 2021.  Obviously, execution of the plan is an important point.  The consultation with the entire spectrum of interested parties has been thorough.  I commended Deputy John Curran and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing and Homelessness on the report they produced.  There is an appendix at the back of the plan dealing with each proposal brought forward by the Oireachtas committee, which is right and proper because these formed part of the detailed conversations and discussions that were held by the committee on this matter.  The plan contains five pillars.  It will be debated in the House this evening and tomorrow, during which time Deputies from all sides and all parties will have an opportunity to comment on it.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that in recent years, local authorities have not measured up in the building of social housing to the extent needed.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has looked at this carefully and has provided local authorities with a &euro;200 million fund for access to sites that are currently inaccessible, either by bridge or road and to allow councils to design their own schemes in respect of certain conditions being applied.  He has also provided for expedited capacity for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to allow it deal directly with applications that are usually first lodged with the local authorities and then transferred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, such that in a situation where there is no further requirement for information, an answer will be given one way or the other inside 18 weeks.  This is a serious attempt, following serious discussions by Government, to deal with this matter.<\/p>  <p>  The first pillar of the plan on housing and homeless deals with homelessness.  As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has pointed out everybody should read the long and detailed first chapter of the plan because of the impact of homelessness.  It is not appropriate that families and children in particular would be in inappropriate accommodation, bed and breakfast establishments or hotels.  Obviously, the plan is set out in detail and is not only costed but timelined.  It will be overseen by the Cabinet sub-committee and monitored carefully by the Minister.  It is a case now of seeing if local authorities can measure up to the challenge they have been given with the resources they have been supplied with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900004#B00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1468933500,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The question is whether the Taoiseach blames the local authorities for the mess of the past five years or their inability to get to grips with it as it continued to grow.  I recall being in the House for Leaders' Questions during which the Government denied for a long time that there was a problem.  The Focus Ireland statistics in regard to homelessness among children increased in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.  It was a market-led approach and we were told the market would correct but it did not.  We got the same response to rent allowance for three years.  The Government told us there was no way it was going to increase rent allowance.  There was an ideological resistance to it.  At long last the rent allowance has been increased.  Following engagement, discussions, party conferences and so on, it has happened.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think it is fair to blame the local authorities.<\/p><p>Yes, they need to be looked at as well but it is a scandal that there are any empty houses in local authority housing stock given the emergency.  It is incredible.  Deputy Cowen submitted a freedom of information request.  There are still 2,700 empty local authority houses throughout the country.  In the name of God, does anybody realise that there is an urgency and an emergency out there?  There are people coming to our clinics who would take those houses in the morning, but what does the Government do?  It puts a limit on 30,000 houses, over and above which a local authority must seek permission.  The local authority must go through an eight-stage process, which has reduced to four stages.  Local authority officials are telling me that this has made it worse.  The Taoiseach needs to cut through a lot of this.  I put to him that given the emergency with which we are dealing, we need national administrative and statutory capacity to knock heads together and get delivery.  That is the only way it is going to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900004#B00300","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468933800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The plan will be debated in the D&aacute;il today and tomorrow.  It is important to say that local authorities have performed very indifferently in many cases.  Some are better than others.  However, they were not responsible for the complete collapse of the housing sector.  We know what happened to the construction sector in general.  Obviously, many builders went out of business while many others emigrated and the economy did not have the capacity to develop these things.<\/p>  <p>  All these issues are being looked at in great detail by the Minister and his officials across Government, not just in one Department.  This is also to address the unacceptable number of families in emergency accommodation and involves looking at moderating rental and purchase price inflation, particularly in urban areas.  We are aware of this.  There was never a denial of the fact that there was a problem.  There was always an acceptance and understanding that the construction sector had collapsed from building 90,000 houses down to fewer than 10,000.  There is also the issue of addressing the affordability gap for many households wishing to purchase their own homes.  The Minister will refer to opportunities to deal with that which will present themselves later.  Other issues include the rental sector, void units and empty houses throughout the country that could be purchased.  The Minister has addressed all of these issues in considerable detail through the five pillars, and I hope Members will give their views during the discussion today and tomorrow.

The Government and Fianna F&aacute;il blocked this motion.  The Taoiseach claimed that the allegations relating to the sale of Project Eagle had nothing to do with NAMA as an entity.  Yet it emerged last week that the chairperson of NAMA, Frank Daly, wrote to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, in March to say that a member of NAMA's advisory board in Northern Ireland might have contravened the Ethics in Public Office Act while serving on the board.  The Taoiseach will recall that this board member was alleged to have been charging clients fees for advice relating to NAMA.  It is also alleged that he had an unethical working relationship with the head of asset recovery at NAMA which gave him access to sensitive commercial information.  It is further alleged that he was lobbying on behalf of fee-paying clients to reduce loan repayments.  In return, he would receive cash payments - the so-called fixer fees - and all this is very well documented.<\/p>  <p>  Frank Daly's letter to SIPO rubbishes the notion put forward by the Taoiseach that the sale of Project Eagle has nothing to do with NAMA.  It has everything to do with NAMA and there are serious questions for NAMA to answer in respect of all this.  However, the Taoiseach says there is nothing to see.  In respect of the SIPO complaint, NAMA needs to explain why it waited until March 2016 to write to SIPO when it was aware of the issues involved in March 2014.  All of this is on the public record.

On the question of value for money, we fully support the ongoing examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General into the disposal by NAMA of the loans of Northern Ireland debtors.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, as Deputy Adams is aware, is best positioned to independently review the transaction in this jurisdiction.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is required by law under section 226 of the NAMA Act to produce a report every three years assessing the extent to which NAMA has made progress towards achieving its overall targets.  NAMA and the Comptroller and Auditor General appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts on 9 July 2015.  At that appearance, the Comptroller and Auditor General indicated that his next section 226 report required under law would look in detail at a sample of NAMA disposals and a sample of properties held by it for investment and, furthermore, that a specific review of Project Eagle under section 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General Act would be undertaken.  I am quite sure Deputy Adams supports the integrity and credibility of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That report into Project Eagle, as I understand it, is practically completed.  It will be debated by the Committee of Public Accounts, which is the accountable body in respect of NAMA.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts both hold NAMA accountable here.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has indicated that he intends to issue a report under section 11 of the Comptroller and Auditor General Act following this review of Project Eagle.  This is consistent entirely with the law and with his powers of investigation to scrutinise and report on operations or regarding any aspect of NAMA's work that may arise through its annual audits or special reports about any aspect of NAMA's work.  Mr. Daly was doing his duty of seeing that everything was above board in respect of the law and his responsibilities.  The Department of Finance and NAMA have received a draft of the report and are providing comment to the Comptroller and Auditor General on that draft report.  Officials of the Comptroller and Auditor General have also confirmed that, given their independent role, any queries related to the timing, content or any other specific aspects of their reports should be directed to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the first instance.  I am informed by NAMA, as I said before, that the loan portfolio in question was sold following an open process to the highest bidder for what it was worth.  On the question about allegations made against certain individuals in Northern Ireland, NAMA paid no moneys to any party on this loan sale against whom allegations of wrongdoing are now being made.  As I said previously, anyone with any evidence of wrongdoing needs to immediately report it to the relevant authorities.  I am aware that two individuals were held for questioning as part of the UK National Crime Agency's investigation into the sale of Northern Ireland assets owned by NAMA.  I am advised also that the NCA has confirmed to NAMA that no aspect of the agency's activities is under investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900006#D00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1468934400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I reassure the Taoiseach that of course I support the Comptroller and Auditor General, but his role is restricted and limited.

This week, he is saying it is okay and that the Comptroller and Auditor General is dealing with it.  Last week he said, \"the Minister for Finance has a view that no specific line of inquiry here can stand up and be usefully pursued by a commission of investigation.\"  This is the same Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, whom Frank Daly said he briefed in full on these matters, including on the scandal of the &pound;15 million fixer fee.

I gather from media reports that this report was considered by Government today and will be published this afternoon.  The media reports made clear that the Low Pay Commission has recommended an increase of 10 cent per hour to the minimum wage.  It is fair to say that this is a disappointing recommendation for the thousands of low-paid workers in the Irish economy.  For a full-time worker, this would translate to just about &euro;200 per year, hardly enough to lift a family out of poverty, I think we will all agree.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of the Low Pay Commission was a progressive move and the issue I raise here today is no reflection on the membership of the commission.  Instead, I will focus on the Government's role.  In the UK, their Low Pay Commission has been tasked with raising the minimum wage to at least 60% of median earnings by 2020.  That was the specific target given to it by the British Government.  During the general election, that was the policy that my party advocated.  We expected to see the minimum wage rise to &euro;11.50 an hour by 2020, an increase of approximately &euro;5,000 a year.  The programme for a partnership Government, published by Fine Gael published with its Government partners for this term, was less ambitious than what the Labour Party set out during the election, but it still included a commitment that it would support an increase in the minimum wage to &euro;10.50 an hour over the next five years.  Unfortunately, it appears the Taoiseach has not done anything to achieve that target set out in the Government programme.  Instead of achieving a level of &euro;11.50 within five years, if we continue at the current rate of recommendations today, we will not see that target reached until 2029.<\/p>  <p>  My questions are straightforward.  Why has the Taoiseach not changed the terms of reference for the Low Pay Commission to mandate it to deliver an increase in the minimum wage to at least &euro;10.50 an hour within the five years set out in the programme for Government?  Will the Taoiseach agree to implement such changes so that the Low Pay Commission will have a mandate before it produces its next report?<\/p><p>In light of the recent work that has confirmed the consensus on the living wage to be approximately &euro;11.50 per hour, will the Taoiseach revise the commitment in the programme for Government to reach that level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900007#E00400","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468935000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Howlin for his question.  The Low Pay Commission is an independent entity set up by the previous Government to bring a structure and a realism to claims for increases in the minimum wage.  As the Deputy is well aware, the Low Pay Commission was set up because of the nature of the way claims were being put forward prior to that.  The former Minister of State, now Senator Gerald Nash, did much work on that with the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, at the time.<\/p>  <p>  The Government was interested in having a low pay commission to bring about independent objectivity.  One of the first decisions of the previous Government was to reverse a cut in the minimum wage that had been brought about before, and it increased the wage by 50 cent.  This is an independent entity.  The Government approved the publication of the report today, 19 July, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation now has three months to consider the implications of the report before coming back to the Government in September.  There is a minority report, as the Deputy is aware.  There are nine members on the Low Pay Commission and three of those had a different view.  The report must be considered carefully by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Howlin is well aware from his own experience, the Low Pay Commission values its independence and would not want to be in the position of being directed.  The &euro;10.50 rate referred to in the programme for Government was an indication of what might be achieved over a five-year Government.  Whereas the recommendation is for an extra 10 cent per hour, this is clearly an indication of how seriously the employers and specialists in the area view the implications of the decision from the British referendum on EU membership.  They have made their judgment and I consider taking the possible implications of that into account.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will consider the report in its entirety and has three months to come back to the Government.  She will do so in September.  As the Deputy is aware, we favour having a position where work is seen to pay and there is an incentive for people to go to work.

At best, it is yet another mirage and false dawn for those who desperately need solutions to the housing crisis.  At worst, I believe it to be a cynical exercise in spoof and dishonesty in that it masks a move to retreat from the provision of local authority housing to the privatisation of housing provision under the guise of a promise of an increase in social housing provision.<\/p>  <p>  If that contention is not true, the Taoiseach will be able to answer a simple question - an answer that is not contained in the report.  How many local authority houses will be built between 2016 to 2020, the years of this plan?  I am being very specific; my question is about local authority houses.  I am not asking about the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, the housing assistance payment, HAP, leasing arrangements, public private partnerships or approved housing bodies.  I am asking about council houses.  How many will be built?  It is not in the report, it was never in Deputy Alan Kelly's report and the Taoiseach never answers that question.  I believe what is clearly spelt out in this document is that this is all about more incentives, grants and supports for private developers and vulture funds, in the hope of creating a mirage that the private, for profit sector will deliver the social housing we need when it will not.  What we need are council houses.<\/p>  <p>  If I am wrong, the Taoiseach should tell me.  Will he give me the specific figures?  How many council houses will be built next year and in subsequent years?  I suspect the Taoiseach will not be able to give me the answer to the question.

The Deputy will not be able to answer my question either.  Some 47,000 social housing units are to be delivered by 2021, supported by an investment of &euro;5.35 billion.  That is real money that is on the table.  However, Deputy Boyd Barrett will not be able to answer the question as to the impact of a housing delivery unit being set up in the Department with responsibility for housing.  This unit will work with every local authority to improve the opportunity to build council houses.  There will be a provision of money for the building of bridges, roads or access points, as the case may be, to get access to sites that are currently inaccessible.  Councils will have the opportunity to design their own houses.  The planning process will be expedited so that these things can happen.<\/p>  <p>  The overall objective is to deliver 47,000 houses by 2021.  It is impossible for any chief executive to say today that X number of council houses will be built by year end.  When we take into account these facilities, the housing delivery unit in the Department and the opportunity for local authorities throughout the country to avail of the incentives to open up sites they have not been able to open up before, to expedite planning and to design their own houses, the answer to this question will become clearer as we move along.<\/p><p>The overall objective is for 47,000 houses with &euro;5.35 billion on the table to make it happen.

Some local authorities perform better than others but voids and the regeneration of neglected houses into liveable units are opportunities for social houses to be provided by local authorities.  <\/p> <p> It is not possible to answer the Deputy's question directly because the answer lies in the incentives and facilities being made available to local authorities and the chief executives of those local authorities to get on with it and prove they can measure up both to the numbers and the timetable that has been set out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900009#G00600","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468935600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I did not know this was questions to People Before Profit - I thought it was questions to the Taoiseach.

That confirms that we are just getting a rehashed, slightly upscaled version of the Kelly plan.  There are big headline figures but when one scratches beneath the surface, it is all dependent on \"incentives\" to the private sector in the shape of infrastructural grants and the transfer of public land.

Now we mourn the death of 84 people, and the serious injuries suffered by many more, after the latest in this appalling litany of outrage.<\/p><p>Each of these attacks has been the same in its dreadful consequences, but each has had its own distinctly horrific features.  People have been killed for who they were - journalists or Jews.  People have been killed as they enjoyed an autumn Friday evening out, as they travelled to work or through an international airport and now, just after they had watched spectacular fireworks by the Mediterranean at the end of France&rsquo;s national day.<\/p><p>In each case, they have been killed as they enjoyed - and because they enjoyed - the freedoms offered by our western civilisation.  The freedom of expression and the freedom of religion.  The freedom to have a drink, to listen to music, for men and women, gay and straight, to be together on a night out.  The freedom to travel and to work.  The freedom to come together to celebrate the eternal values of France - liberty, equality and fraternity.<\/p><p>Those who were murdered on Thursday night were French and foreign, young and old, male and female.  Families were wiped out or shattered forever.  The innocent faces of the youngest victims are deeply poignant, but so too is the face of the 73 year old grandmother who was the first person to be killed, and in a bitter irony, she was only one of many Muslims to be killed by someone purporting to act in the name of Islam.<\/p><p>We do not know if the killer acted alone or as part of a conspiracy, even though his attack was claimed by ISIS.  His methods were cruder than those used in previous attacks.  It does seem clear that he was a deeply disturbed and unstable person - at first glance, similar to those responsible for so many gun attacks in the United States of America, most recently in Orlando.<\/p><p>Ireland stands by France.  France is a great nation, the birthplace of republicanism and of universal human rights.  These values are more precious than ever in our turbulent and dangerous world and must be protected.  I look forward very much to greeting President Hollande in Dublin on Thursday, as will President Higgins, and to conveying to him in person the deep sympathy and outrage felt by the people of Ireland.<\/p><p>We must do all we can to combat evil and to protect our citizens.

Ireland works very closely with France and other international partners, and within the EU significant progress has been made on a wide range of counter-terrorism legislation and other practical measures of co-operation, though there is also a very long way to go.  There is also an intensified focus on combating and rooting out the ideology of hate, an ideology totally inconsistent with true religious belief.<\/p><p>It is a sad reality, however, that no defences can guarantee absolute safety, above all, against an attack so chillingly rage-filled and basic as that of Bastille Day, but we cannot allow ourselves to be cowed or beaten by terrorism, and we will not.<\/p><p>The best response is to continue to live our lives in accordance with the values of our society because in the end, liberty and love will triumph over repression and hate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900011#J00100","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1468935900,"counter":48,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and on my own behalf, I want again to join with Deputies in sending our sincerest sympathy to the families bereaved by this appalling act of terror, which raises the threshold of inhumanity to an incomprehensible level.

There is a natural urge to find refuge in broad definitions of the enemy.  New types of terror require new and robust responses.  The democratic will cannot be defenceless in the face of those who seek to destroy it but, equally, we must never forget what it is we defend.  There are those who love nothing more than to attack the values of Europe by refusing to acknowledge anything that distinguishes it from places dominated by cruel and dominant governments.  Nothing will ever convince them.  However, Europe is a continent which is defined by a respect for democracy and human rights beyond any other region in the world.  France must not stop being France because of these attacks and Europe must not stop being Europe because that is exactly what the terrorists want.  They want us to act like them and they want to inspire an extreme reaction.  They want to make things immeasurably worse for the communities from whence they came.

We also remember them.  They died in the former French colony in Baton Rouge.  It is as if the bodies keep falling since that day when something happened that we could never have imagined, when someone flew a plane into a trade centre.  Now, someone has used a truck in a way we could never have thought of.  There is a sense that we should just shout &quot;Stop&quot; - that we need a different constitution, a bigger constitution.  We need a different Bastille Day, one with peace and mercy at its core.  As others said, all we can do is kneel with the parents of those who died near that Nice strand and remember the words of the Trojan mother Hecuba when she said in response to her child being thrown from the walls of the city, crushed and broken:<\/p><blockquote>Oh to clasp thy tender limbs, a mother's fondest joy!  Oh to breathe thy fragrant breath! ... Why have ye in terror of this child been guilty of murder never matched before?<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900015#N00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1468937700,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I ask Deputies to stand as a mark of respect for those who have died, and thoughtful of those who remain injured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900016#O00100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1468937700,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Members rose.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1468937700,"counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900016#O00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1468937700,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I call on the rapporteur for the business committee, Deputy Jim Daly, to announce the Order of Business for the week and to move the proposals regarding arrangements for the taking of that business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900016#O00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1468937700,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Today's business shall be No. 11, motion re Standing Orders 141 and 146A, and No. 12, motion re business of select committees, without debate.

They looked at the way the force was deployed, the way resources were deployed, its mechanism for following through on investigations and its information relating to the time for investigation of every particular type of crime in each division.

Many residents - families and their children - are living in fear.  The Taoiseach met with some of them recently and he quite rightly praised and commended their resilience and steadfastness.  Since then, as well as the fear arising from the gang feud and the ongoing drugs trade in that area, there is also a concern that once the media focus moves off onto other issues the commitments and promises of support from the Government will not be delivered.  The Taoiseach will know that what the people want and need is an integrated plan for the social, economic, educational and community development of their community.  They are looking for funding, projects, jobs, counsellors, homes, teachers for children, Garda youth diversion projects, addiction services and so on.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach asked recently for the terms of reference of the community coalition in Dublin's north inner city and, with their permission, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald provided him with this.  He agreed to meet with representatives of the coalition and bring back proposals to them about the task force and its terms of reference and so on.  I do not want to presume or make judgment on what the Taoiseach said earlier but, if I heard him properly, he said he was going to the constituency tomorrow and appears to have agreed the terms of reference.  Will he give us some sense of the terms of reference and recommit to consulting in good faith with the people he met, given the seriousness of the issues involved?  It is all about empowering people.  These people have empowered themselves.  The Taoiseach said in an earlier discussion here that there appeared to be a gap between what has happened in here and what is happening down there.  I challenged the Taoiseach on this.  I said it is not that there appears to be a gap; there is a gap.  The Taoiseach made a firm commitment about consultation and going back to consult with the folks he met previously.  I ask him to give us as much information as he can on that.  <\/p>  <p>  I request an update on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Garda Inspectorate report, Changing Policing in Ireland, and I also request that he address the concern about a whole range of Garda appointments that were made.  I do not want to go through them all, as I do not want to take up other people's time.  A whole range of promotions were made which could and should have been made by the policing authority, but there was a rush to do this at the request of the Garda Commissioner before the authority was authorised to do it.  Is the Taoiseach concerned about this?  It strikes me as being something that does not bode well for what we are trying to do in terms of a new beginning to policing, or at least the effort to reform the garda&iacute; so that it is a service that its men and women deserve and that those whom they mind deserve also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900020#S00200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1468939800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>A number of questions were asked.  Deputy Howlin raised the membership of the Cabinet committee on justice reform, comprised of myself, as chair, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Attorney General.  As others are needed they will attend.  The terms of reference are to provide political oversight of the delivery of commitments in the programme for a partnership Government, to reform the policing, justice and legal systems and related issues.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin mentioned the Inspectorate report.  In November 2014, the Garda Inspectorate published a comprehensive report on crime investigation, and significant work is continuing to implement the recommendations.  That includes a review of crime counting rules by the CSO, the establishment of a data quality team in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, significant reorganisation and amalgamation of Garda national units, and the establishment of a criminal justice steering group to provide greater co-ordination between all bodies operating within the criminal justice system.  The Garda has established a new incident recording process and a working group has examined the need for increased investment in Garda ICT as part of the upcoming capital programme.  The Garda has established a victim support office in every local Garda division and, in addition, the previous Government put in place measures to ensure and enhance ongoing public confidence in policing in Ireland while continuing to support the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their day-to-day duties of keeping communities in the country safe.  On the Garda Inspectorate report on management and structures, the T&aacute;naiste put in place a process to seek the views of the Garda Commissioner, to whom the bulk of recommendations are directed, and other bodies to whom recommendations are directed.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also mentioned modern technology.  As he is aware, &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the capital programme, is being invested in the Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021.  This major investment will allow the garda&iacute; to deploy the latest cutting-edge technologies in the fight against crime and will facilitate progress on an important set of reforms arising from the Garda Inspectorate's report on crime investigation.  A considerable amount of the new Garda ICT solutions have been delivered over the past five years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system, the deployment and support of Garda and community CCTV systems, an automated number plate registration, ANPR, system, and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which is further supported by a dedicated Garda data entry service in Davitt House in Castlebar.<\/p>  <p>  The substantial additional investment under the capital programme out to 2021 will facilitate progress on a range of other important reforms that arise from the Inspectorate report on crime investigation.  Examples of some of the new systems to be developed include new computer-aided despatch to ensure responsive and co-ordinated deployment of garda&iacute; in the community, mobile technology to give garda&iacute; secure mobile access to critical information when and where they need it, investigation management systems to ensure enhanced management of crime investigations, and an upgrade of the ANPR to enhance policing of road safety and compliance.<\/p><p>Obviously, there is an interest in supplying increased numbers of CCTV systems as well.<\/p> <p> In respect of Deputy Adams' question on gangland crime, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality has been in close and extensive engagement with the Garda Commissioner and senior officers on the measures to tackle the appalling crime situation in certain areas where gangs operate and significant progress has been made in the investigations which are under way.  Both the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and I have assured the Garda that whatever resources are necessary will be made available to it.  On the basis of that assurance, the Garda, day in and day out, is incurring substantial additional expenditure, including overtime expenditure.<\/p> <p> On 8 June, the Government approved substantial additional funding to be provided to the Garda.  An additional allocation of &euro;55 million is being made available this year for the purpose of tackling organised crime.  These additional moneys are made available based on information from Garda management regarding the level of funding required to maintain the necessary policing response to the current situation.  This will allow for concentrated policing targeting gang-related crime and the continued intensive and strategic targeting of burglaries and related crime through the support for Operation Thor, which has been successful, and continued support for measures against terrorism.<\/p> <p> Underpinning all of that has been the reopening of Templemore and the decision to increase the Garda strength to 15,000 by way of recruitment.  While in the short term substantial funds continue to be made available for overtime working measures to accelerate the planned programme of recruitment, they are being worked on now so that additional new garda&iacute; can be provided as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> I note that the Criminal Assets Bureau is one of the few areas of public expenditure that was largely ring-fenced from reductions in public service staffing during the economic crisis.  Its staffing complement now of approximately 70 is similar to what it was in the late 2000s.<\/p> <p> In respect of Garda measures to deal with gangland crime, the new special crime task force has been put in place.  This will operate in co-operation with other agencies, such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.

I am satisfied that is the case.<\/p>  <p>  We work closely with the devolved administrations in the context of the institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement, including the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council.  In preparing for the European Council meeting, I had a wide range of discussions, including with the Northern Ireland First Minister and Deputy First Minister and with the Scottish First Minister, Ms Sturgeon, whom I had also met at the British-Irish Council in Glasgow on 17 June.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and Scotland enjoy excellent and close relations, as, indeed, we do with the UK as a whole.  The recent visit by President Higgins underlined once more the strength of the ties between the peoples of Scotland and Ireland.  The First Minister, Ms Sturgeon, was anxious that European leaders would be aware of her concerns about the future situation and status of Scotland following a UK departure from the Union.  I undertook to mention those concerns during the European Council meeting, which I did.  This was in the context of a wide-ranging discussion on the referendum outcome and its consequences, on which I reported in detail to the House on the 5 July.  I look forward to ongoing contact with the First Minister and her administration at political, diplomatic and official levels.  We will have an opportunity to meet again at the extraordinary meeting of the British-Irish Council on Friday of this week in Cardiff.<\/p>  <p>  It is self-evident that the outcome of the referendum on EU membership has generated significant debate in all parts of the United Kingdom and beyond.  Many aspects of the next steps in this process require clarification that will only emerge now that the new British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, has been appointed.  In my discussions with Mrs. May last week, we discussed a range of issues of mutual interest, not least the importance of continuing to work together to build on the excellent relationship that now exists between Ireland and Britain, including our joint support of the peace process and the wider development of co-operation between these two islands.  We agreed to stay in touch and to meet each other in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900021#T01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1468940400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  With a new Government in place in London, there is emerging a basic shape of the approach that may be taken by the United Kingdom Government to negotiations with the European Union.  Mr. Davis, the new British Secretary of State responsible for Brexit, has suggested that he is fine with simply seeking a trade pact and that he may delay the triggering of Article 50 until next year.  That would have significant implications for Ireland, and particularly Mr. Davis's narrow view of the negotiation parameters with Britain.  It could involve the return of a customs border here, if his thinking gains any further momentum.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Davis also seemed somewhat confused as to the status of what he termed \"southern Ireland\", when asked about this country on Sunday.  He seemed to be unaware of our constitutional status, to put it mildly.  Could the Taoiseach, at the earliest opportunity, ensure that a member of Government holds an early meeting with Mr. Davis to update him on our perspectives on it?<\/p>  <p>  More specifically concerning Scotland, it is clear that we need to stay closely in contact with the Scottish Government on an ongoing basis.  I welcome the fact that the Government has decided to implement a suggestion I made to increase staffing in our European embassies and delegations - the Taoiseach made that clear at the leaders' meeting last week - but the Taoiseach needs to make a similar commitment to increasing the staff levels at our Edinburgh consulate, which was set up quite a number of years ago and which has played a valuable role in developing relationships between Ireland and the Scottish Government and, indeed, the Scottish Parliament.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach was correct in raising the matter at the European Council meeting because it is the elephant in the room in some respects as well.  It is relevant in terms of what may happen down the road in Scotland, if it was ever to secede from the United Kingdom.  That is something that may take some time to happen.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned in his reply the British-Irish Council and the broader sets of relationships.  I note the key issues, apart from Mr. David Davis saying it is about trade.  For us, it is obviously the retention of and, ideally and optimally, the UK's access to the Single Market to avoid tariffs between Ireland and Britain, but also the common travel area.  The retention of the Single Market on the island of Ireland is critical, as is the avoidance of a hard border.  I suggested an all-island dialogue on Brexit which would involve community groups, non-governmental organisations, the economic stakeholders, unions, business, etc.<\/p><p>Apart from the political constitutional elements, I am looking at a civil dialogue involving civil organisations.  The Taoiseach is broadly committed to that.  It would allow people from the civic and social side in Northern Ireland to make a contribution to such a national dialogue on the implications of Brexit and the optimal outcome for the island of Ireland that could be achieved in the context of negotiations between the Republic of Ireland, within the European Union and with the United Kingdom.<br\/><br\/>To be frank, that leaves aside the constitutional and political issues under the umbrella of the Good Friday Agreement, which should be dealt with separately.  I made it clear in my remarks at the weekend that there is no evidence now there has been any shift in terms of public opinion <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>a united Ireland, as per the Good Friday Agreement.  All the evidence up to the Brexit referendum was to the contrary and that public opinion was not moving in the direction of a united Ireland in previous polls.  It is important not to use Brexit as a kind of basis for an immediate Border poll or anything like that.  I just want to make it clear that my position on that has been very consistent and understood.  Much work must be done on that question.<br\/><br\/>On the Brexit issue itself, there is a very clear need for substantive dialogue, including with Scotland and others.  I do not believe the full implications of this have been readily understood.  As a former Minister, I went on trade missions to Scotland and we engaged with their universities.  They are particularly strong on research and the application of research to business ideas and industry.  It seems that many partnerships that have developed between Irish companies and companies in the UK or Northern Ireland could be in jeopardy as a result of Horizon 2020 funding being cut from partners in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  When in Brussels recently, the first person I met at the airport was a young person involved with a Northern Irish company who was very concerned about the partnership that had been developed.  Where do such people now stand in terms of funding?<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach got some criticism on the Scottish issue.  We need voices on the UK side to surface as they will suddenly realise the implications of this for them if some proper negotiating platform, broader than just a trade agreement, is embarked upon.  That needs to happen organically within the UK on issues like research, education, the Erasmus programme and so on, all of which could be cut off from young British people as a result of the decision to leave the European Union.  There are a panoply of issues beyond trade and many people in the UK would be anxious to have some continuing engagement with them in any new agreement arising between the European Union and the United Kingdom.<br\/><br\/>Will the Taoiseach indicate if he will take practical steps on the dialogue issue, including inviting in civil and social groups?  When can we expect a national conference or a plenary session of such stakeholders to take place and enable us to start the process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900021#T01900","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468941000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I will see to it that Mr. Davis is contacted at an early stage to have the full range of our constitutional position fully outlined for him.  I will ask the relevant Minister to deal with that fairly quickly.<\/p>  <p>  When I was in Edinburgh at the last British-Irish Council, we spoke about the possibilities of increased business and trade between Ireland and Scotland before the decision.  The Deputy is aware that Scotland has opened an office in Dublin.  We will look at the question of beefing up the capacity in Edinburgh.  I was very impressed with their approach when I met people in Glasgow about the possibilities for Irish business.  The British-Irish Council meets in a special session in Cardiff this week on Friday to speak about the Brexit position, the Single Market and the CTA.  They will all be points of discussion.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to think there will be an opportunity for everybody to have their say on this.  It may well be necessary to do it separately from the formalities of the Good Friday Agreement structure.  As I stated before, although there is no mandate from here to negotiate for Northern Ireland, it is very important that we have a responsibility as co-guarantor of the agreement to understand the challenges that Northern Ireland businesses and entrepreneurs feel they face arising from Brexit.  The Deputy is quite right in that many of these issues have not even been thought of in terms of how there will be an impact from the decision of the electorate to leave the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  When I was in Donegal yesterday, the point I was making was that when the Good Friday Agreement was drafted, people were long-sighted enough to put into the agreement a clause whereby a time might arrive - we are now 20 years on - when a secretary of state could invoke the clause on the basis of sufficient support for a Border poll.  That does not apply now because there is not sufficient support.  I make the point that in years to come, it may well be that with Britain having left the European Union and Northern Ireland having voted to stay in the European Union but remaining a member of the United Kingdom, there may be general negotiations and discussions.  The Deputy made the point, quite rightly, about Scotland wanting to join the European Union if it leaves the UK.  We should be able to make the arrangement on a long-term basis if it arises in future that a secretary of state triggers that clause, which will by then have been in the Good Friday Agreement for many years.  That is if Northern Ireland would want to extract itself from the United Kingdom to join a country that continued as a member of the European Union.  The only point I was making was that the discussions should be long-sighted and visionary enough to cater for that kind of issue if it happened.  I am not saying it will happen and I do not see any evidence of a Border poll now.  Some time in the future, they should not have to go through the process of a long drawn-out application to join the Republic, if that was the wish, but to be a member of the European Union as well.  These are the kinds of issues that should be encompassed in this.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy because under the Horizon 2020 programme we have 500 partnerships with Britain in universities, research, scientific analysis and so on.  This is very worrying as the Commission has informed some of those people that funding might not be likely to continue.  There are also many thousands of Irish students going to college in colleges of technology and universities in Britain, so the issue of what happens with them must be discussed.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the question of electricity supply.  Northern Ireland depends on the Republic of Ireland.  We have interconnections with gas.  These are important elements.  If Britain is to leave and no longer be subject to the regulations in so far as climate change is concerned or the other implications of EU directives, these will all need to be discussed.  We will also need to discuss what applies in terms of the law currently.  If there is a single island electricity market underpinned by legislation in Dublin or Westminster, when Britain leaves we presume the legislation will continue to be enforced.  In the longer term, part of the European Union philosophy is not to have any energy islands and we should be connected to mainland Europe.  Currently that connection comes through Britain with undersea and land connections.  These are all part of the dialogue we must have.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to think we could put the best possible proposition together to have that kind of discussion from political parties, non-governmental organisations, business people, trade unions and everybody else who wants to have a say.  We are working to devise what might be an appropriate operation to allow that to happen.  I hope we can do that in September but I will consult the leaders opposite for their views on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900022#U00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1468941600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>On a point of order and the way questions are grouped, this was a question about discussions between the Taoiseach and the Scottish First Minister which interacted with a raft of further questions.

His reply was worth waiting for.<\/p><p>There was purpose to the question.  In light of the fantastic economic figures released last week, I thought we might be adjusting completely our social and public sector policies.  I am sure the Taoiseach read the article in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>last week.  It opened by stating:<\/p><blockquote>The Irish have written some notable works of fiction - James Joyce and Flann O'Brien produced imperishable classics.  Now there is a new addition to the national [canon] - the official narrative of the country's economy.  According to data released on Tuesday, it grew by 26.3 per cent last year.<\/blockquote><p>Arising from this and the previous Government's policy of creating a tax haven in the country and other such incentives for multinationals to locate here, we are now disguising the real economic figures and making ourselves an international laughing stock.  I do not know how the Taoiseach was greeted in Europe last week but the idea that there has been a 26% growth in the economy -  I do not know if even Soviet Russia in the 1930s exceeded these figures - means we have all now heard the phrase leprechaun economics being bandied around internationally.<\/p><p>Has the Taoiseach reconsidered this country's policy of having the lowest rate of corporation tax in Europe, particularly when we have the most acute housing emergency?  The Government has just released a plan which, unfortunately and sadly for those on housing lists, will continue to see people waiting up to 15 years to be housed and puts housing in the lap of the private sector.  Meanwhile in the real world, while these figures were making us a laughing stock, according to Social Justice Ireland the number of people living in poverty in Ireland has increased by more than 110,000.  Today, more than 750,000 people in the State live in poverty and 18% of adults with incomes below the poverty line are in employment.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach had a mantra during the election about making work pay.  In actual fact, work does not pay for a huge number of people in the country.  I am sure the Taoiseach has also noted the Low Pay Commission's derisory and insulting awarding of a 10 cent an hour increase to the minimum wage.  Many have commented that it would have been better if no increase had been awarded because a 10 cent increase just adds insult to injury.<\/p><p>Will the Taoiseach reconsider his sacred policy of multinational domination of the economy?  The policy allows them to have brass plate operations here and to source so much of their operations here they are distorting economic figures.  It is now impossible to determine the rate of growth.<\/p><p>I will finish by mentioning the pursuit of Apple.  Will the Taoiseach now drop his opposition to the European Commission's pursuit of Apple for back taxes in this country?  These are estimated to amount to &euro;17 billion.  Imagine the houses we could build if we had &euro;17 billion to hand.  Will the Taoiseach consider bringing into effect the headline rate of corporation tax, which would increase our fiscal space of &euro;2 billion this year alone?  Those are the kinds of things we need to do to solve the housing crisis and not the kind of thing released earlier on today, which offers little hope to people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900023#V01100","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1468941600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I do not accept the premise of Deputy Coppinger's response at all.  She states that we created a tax haven in the country.  We did no such thing.  Not only that, we have been very much upfront with the OECD in terms of the presentation of our corporate tax position.  We abolished the double Irish concept.  We got rid of the stateless concept.  We were the first country to have a fully compliant regime in terms of the OECD requirements for countries.  We have introduced the first fully OECD compliant knowledge development box with a tax rate of 6.25%.  We defend strongly our corporate tax rate of 12.5% and will continue to do so.  I note that other countries intend to reduce their corporate tax rate as well.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned last week's CSO figures.  We dealt with them.  Obviously, they do not reflect the average growth in the economy.  The figures were impacted by the scale of aircraft leasing in the country, contracted manufacturing in other countries where firms are based here in Ireland, the transfer of public limited companies, plcs, to Ireland and the transfer of significant amounts of intellectual property rights to the country.  These are all issues which impact on our economy, but clearly the figures produced last week do not impact in terms of job creation and job numbers.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet sub-committee on social policy and public service reform has been dealing with quite a number of issues.  It is important to reflect on the benefits of a rising economy on social injustice, unfairness and inequality and to demonstrate that Government does care about the quality of people's lives.  My visits to the north inner city are a case in point.  Within 100 yards of the IFSC, I witnessed people who deal in misery for money on the streets.  Garda resources and facilities are needed to deal with these things and clean up these places.  We also need to help those who have been waylaid.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, we have protected the primary weekly social welfare rates.  We have put in place a proactive approach to helping those who are unemployed through the provision of Intreo offices.  We held a referendum on children's rights.  We strengthened child protection through the National Vetting Bureau.  We published the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which is going through the legislative process now.  We launched the new junior cycle reforms.  We increased the time spent on literacy and numeracy skills in all primary schools and introduced a comprehensive action plan on bullying.  We ended the practice of sending 16 year olds to St. Patrick's Institution.  We published the national positive ageing strategy and the national dementia strategy.  We established the Child and Family Agency.  We increased provision for special needs assistants to 12,600 until the end of 2016, which is an increase of 2,300.  We put in place the Irish refugee protection programme to take in 4,000 persons to the country.  We approved amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act to give the Garda greater power to deal with the problem of illicit trade in street medicines.  We introduced a two-week period of paternity leave and associated social welfare payments.  Priorities for this year include the new model of in-school speech and language therapy and the implementation of the national plan for equality of access to higher education.  They also include expanding the preschool provision under the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme, which will see the number of children benefiting rise from approximately 67,000 to 127,000 in the programme next year.  We published the Government's action plan for education inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  I will give an example to Deputy Coppinger.  We have been dealing with the issue of resource teachers for years.  This is a sore point with people and rightly so because it means an awful lot to those for whom it should mean most - the students.  The model was developed by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, with Mr. Eamon Stack.  It was discussed by the Cabinet sub-committee twice under the last Government.  It was piloted in 47 schemes and the feedback has been positive.<\/p><p>We are going to roll it out nationally in a way that does not create any losers in the short term and at a once-off cost of &euro;72 million.  The situation in regard to some learning support schemes was wasteful and inequitable.  In one example, if school A has 250 students with ten needing learning support while school B has 250 students with 75 needing learning support, both would get the same level of learning support under the current system and that is inequitable, wasteful and harmful to those who do not get the necessary support.  We are changing all that with a model designed for Ireland by the NCSE which will eliminate that type of situation and will mean the accompanying stress and pressure will not be put on parents and children.  All these matters are important and reflect inequality, unfairness and social disadvantage so we must focus where we can on using the resources of a rising economy to deal with them.<\/p> <p> As I said to Deputy Adams on a previous occasion, there needs to be an output from this type of investment in order that we can help people.  Last week I met reformed alcoholics, reformed drug addicts and women who had suffered the most horrendous physical violence in their relationships and who have tried hard over the years to make a comeback and live their lives again.  We must and will continue to work in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900023#V01200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468942200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>That was a cook's tour of everything.

The Road Safety Authority, RSA, carried out a public consultation on the issue, following which draft provisions were developed for consideration.  Due to the complexity of the issues involved, the Department, working together with the RSA, agreed that legislation could only be progressed following legal advice and careful examination of how robust and effective any measures would be.  I am of the view that enabling legislation to provide for the regulation of written-off vehicles is an issue which requires action in the current Road Traffic Bill.  This Bill has passed all Stages in the Seanad and is due to be introduced in the D&aacute;il.

The term \"write-off\" refers to cars involved in crashes that are so seriously damaged that they either need major repairs done for them to be classed as roadworthy or should never appear back on the road.

I am grateful to Deputy Troy for addressing the matter in a wider form.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing capacity in our public transport system and improving the quality of public transport services is key to addressing congestion in the greater Dublin area.\u00a0 More than &euro;200 million has been allocated for investment in public and sustainable transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area in 2016 under the capital plan.  The capital investment works currently being undertaken by the National Transport Authority, NTA, in the greater Dublin area include the Luas cross city project, which is on schedule to open at the end of 2017; the Phoenix Park tunnel, which I expect to open for services later this year; the city centre re-signalling project; and investment in the bus fleet and bus priority measures.  These will greatly enhance the capacity of the public transport system in the greater Dublin area when completed.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, funding is being\u00a0allocated\u00a0to\u00a0a wide range of projects in the greater Dublin area aimed at developing sustainable transport modes such as cycling, walking and public transport.  Investment is also being made in integration measures designed to encourage the use of public transport, such as real-time passenger information, the Leap card, the national journey planner and on-board Wi-Fi.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area\u00a0for 2016 to 2035 sets out a comprehensive vision for public transport in the greater Dublin area over the next two decades.  The NTA is now drawing up an integrated implementation plan to outline how it will go about delivering the strategy's objectives over the first six-year period within the strategy's overall 20-year horizon.<\/p>  <p>  While investment in the public transport system is critical to addressing congestion, ultimately, a public transport response on its own cannot ensure\u00a0that there is a sustainable match between transport demand and transport supply.  Neither can\u00a0traffic management measures\u00a0or\u00a0additional roads investment achieve this in isolation.  Congestion can only be managed by combining all of these responses.

The capital plan that was published last September is very unambitious with regard to what will be delivered.  Meanwhile, we have the construction of cycle lanes.  The number of cars coming into the city is decreasing and the reduction is not being compensated for by ensuring the provision of public car parks on the outer roads.

If we want to get people into the capital city and moving freely around by way of public transport, cycling or walking, where are they to leave their cars when they commute?

It is something we are addressing as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in regard to the national roads programme.  The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for TII, under the Roads Act, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects is a matter for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of local authorities, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993, as amended.  Works on these roads are funded from the local authority's own resources, supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each authority.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and the Exchequer.  As a result of the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in the funding available for road expenditure over the past number of years.<\/p>  <p>  The capital plan, published in September 2015, outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  It provides &euro;6 billion for investment in the roads network in the period to 2022, with &euro;4.4 billion earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country and &euro;1.6 billion for new projects, including PPP already underway.  The transport element of the capital plan is based on a gradual buildup over the plan period in capital funding for the road network from the current relatively low base towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works.<\/p>  <p>  While I fully recognise the importance of maintenance and renewal work on the roads, as Minister I have to work within the capital and current budgets available to my Department.  In view of the continuing constraints on State funding, my Department has emphasised to local authorities the importance of prioritising expenditure on roads when allocating their resource income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900028#AA00900","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1468944600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>The Minister is correct; it is the statutory responsibility of local authorities to maintain roads.

It is no wonder people are annoyed at the condition of the roads.  It is not just me: my colleague Deputy Michael McGrath has also tabled a question on road projects.  I met with a delegation of councillors from Monaghan who were infuriated with the condition of the roads.  It is not good enough to say it is the statutory responsibility of the local authorities.

The start of year capital and current expenditure allocation for 2016 is &euro;402 million.  The steep decline in expenditure on roads during that period spans several Administrations and several years.  It is inevitable at this stage that we are in a situation which is critical, admittedly, in certain places but it is not just the result of spendthrift or generous spending on roads at certain times in the past decade, it is also the result of the fact that as the Deputy is aware, we have an extraordinarily high number of roads, 100,000 km, which is amazing and is way above the EU average.

The sorry situation now is that many roads are unsafe because we have not invested enough in road restoration.  The figures the Minister outlined from 2007 to 2015 include new constructions.  We have not had new roads constructed in recent years but we have had a siphoning off of money raised from road tax for the establishment of what in the words of the Minister is a super quango, namely, Irish Water.

The fact that we have to spend so much money just on the maintenance of the roads because the network is so extensive is indicative of the problems, which is going to remain with us for a long period.

They will also be aware that there was no round of the sports capital programme in 2009, 2010 or 2011.  There were, however, rounds of the programme in 2012, 2014 and 2015.  Almost 1,600 applications were received under the 2015 round of the programme, evidence of its ongoing importance.

The Minister of State said that there were 1,600 applicants last year, which will give him an understanding of the level of interest in the sports grant application process.  He will also recognise how valuable these sports grants are to sporting clubs right across the State, particularly to sporting clubs and groups in disadvantaged areas.

The severe delay in the allocation of sports capital funding is now a major concern for various sports clubs and organisations that have been waiting for investment to progress with plans and proposals to upgrade or develop facilities for some time.  It is critical that the Government build on the many years of investment in this area.  As the Minister has indicated, he relaunched the scheme in 2012.  Many clubs, on the basis of having submitted an application on the first day, have now progressed plans to move on further.  The Minister of State also created the air of uncertainty.  He said he would take a special interest in this.  Judging from his response to a previous parliamentary question, I am sure his colleagues below in Killarney received a rush of expressions of interest.  Even that has created an air of uncertainty.  From a political point of view, it has to be acknowledged that money has been allocated to the Department.

I could not make it clearer that no decision has been made on this issue and that both the Minister, Deputy Ross, and I are committed to it.  I point to the years 2012 onwards in that regard.  The timeframe in which any allocation or announcement would be made allows the potential for something to happen in 2016.  The only confusion and uncertainty out there is, I think, generated by people who almost hope in a way that we might not be able to do it.  Our aspiration is that we will be able to do it.  The clubs are certainly looking for it, and individual sporting organisations have over the last number of months been engaging with the Department on an online basis anyway.

I also note that the 2020 national reduction targets under EU Decision 406\/2009\/EC (Effort Sharing) do not include international aircraft emissions so the north runway project will not have any direct impact on these targets.<\/p>  <p>  Aviation emissions are to be addressed separately under an agreement reached at a meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, in 2013 to establish a global market-based measure for aviation emissions.  It is anticipated that the details of that global scheme, which will apply from 2020, will be finalised at the ICAO general assembly in September 2016.  Currently, aviation emissions from flights within the European Economic Area, EEA, are subject to an emissions trading scheme known as the EU ETS scheme.

There was much consternation, deliberation and negotiation, and ultimately it went to the Labour Court.  Other aspects of the negotiations took place over a protracted period of time and culminated earlier this year in a Workplace Relations Commission agreement, which spoke about the ability of the relevant section of the board to outsource services.  In this case, as a result of Bord na M&oacute;na's intention to outsource its road division and impose cuts on its rail division, 130-odd workers are affected.  If there is a breach of the WRC agreement it could have a knock-on effect on the 600 workers involved in the entire peat production, known as feedstock.  My contention is that the board feels it is within its powers as detailed within the agreement, which states:<\/p><blockquote>Bord na M&oacute;na's road haulage operations are currently being reviewed with a view to significant cost reductions and while the company notes the union's opposition to outsourcing in general, the option of outsourcing has been included in this review and if this standard tendering process determines that outsourcing is the most economic option it will be pursued.  In that eventuality, existing Bord na M&oacute;na drivers will not be required to transfer to an external operator or operators and will have the option of redeployment on current pay and terms within Bord na M&oacute;na or voluntary redundancy applications may be sought.<\/blockquote><p>Also within the WRC agreement was the proposal to appoint a joint industrial relations commission, which had been suggested as a forum to deal with issues such as this if there was contention around them.  The contention around them is by virtue of the fact that the workers or unions were not afforded an opportunity to offer similar savings from within their own divisions to meet the demands that were being placed on them by Bord na M&oacute;na, whose overall reductions amounted to 30%, much of it from pay, as per the agreement that was reached with the entire staff in January.  Based on the WRC agreement, in the event of dispute in areas such as this, there was provision for the setting up of a joint industrial relations council to further adjudicate on such issues.  That opportunity has not been availed of, and now we have a situation whereby the transport staff voted yesterday on a work to rule.  The unions may eventually take the opinion that this is a breach of the entire agreement, which has a knock-on effect on 600 workers.  Intervention is needed to adjudicate on that and to allow the joint industrial relations council an opportunity to further adjudicate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900034#GG00300","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1468948200,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cowen for raising this important issue and I acknowledge the presence of Deputy Eugene Murphy.  It is an issue close to all our hearts.  As Deputies Cowen and Murphy are aware, Bord na M&oacute;na is facing significant business challenges in the context of the deregulation of the electricity market and increasingly competitive and challenging environments across all its business areas.  In order to ensure its continued success and survival, the company is implementing a programme to transform all areas of its operation and structure, the key objective of which is to improve business efficiency and effectiveness.  In April 2016, following a series of negotiations with the assistance of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court, Bord na M&oacute;na reached agreement with the Bord na M&oacute;na group of unions on pay progression and new working methods across a range of issues related to business transformation.<\/p>  <p>  The specific matter raised by the Deputy is an operational matter for the company and not one in which I as Minister have a function or role.  I have, however, sought a report from the company on the issues raised and am informed that the matters referred to by the Deputy cut across two specific areas.  With regard to rail transport, I am advised that Bord na M&oacute;na transports peat to its three peat-fired power stations via its rail network.  This work is carried out in accordance with the standards laid down in respect of the work methodology.  Bord na M&oacute;na has confirmed that it is normal practice dating back many years to periodically review these standards to see if they can be updated to reflect developments, for example, in technology.  I understand that this was done by an industrial engineer who reviews current practices and redefines standards.<\/p>  <p>  The recently adopted general agreement under the WRC makes provision for this matter.  Bord na M&oacute;na informs me that the loading and haulage work standards, which were outdated for many years, were reviewed during 2015 and updated in June 2016 to reflect modern equipment and workplace practices.  I am advised that the new arrangements have resulted in reductions in bonus payments, in some cases by up to 12%.  Bord na M&oacute;na has assured me that the Workplace Relations Commission agreement mentioned above clearly covers the adjustment and sets out an agreed compensation arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the outsourcing of services, I am advised that Bord na M&oacute;na currently transports some peat by road, which is quite expensive.  Between 15% and 20% of all peat sold is transported by road.  Bord na M&oacute;na's peat business has ten trucks and 18 permanent drivers, which carry approximately 60% of the peat transported by road.  The remaining 40% is carried by third-party trucks.  An analysis of the internal cost per tonne transported versus the third-party cost per tonne transported found that significant cost reductions could be realised if the road haulage was outsourced.  The WRC agreement provides that outsourcing could be introduced where it results in cost savings, provided that employees are given the option to redeploy within Bord na M&oacute;na on their current terms and conditions.  I am informed that the company has advised the unions that it intends to implement this outsourcing by 1 September 2016 and that all drivers will be deployed within the business on current pay terms.  I understand that discussions are ongoing between the company and the unions on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900034#GG00400","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1468948200,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response and acknowledge that he has sought a report from the board on this issue.

The text indicated that, as of Monday last, there would be an increase in the pay-per-lift charge.  The pay-per-lift for general waste was to increase from &euro;8 per lift to &euro;12 per lift, and for recyclable waste from &euro;4 per lift to &euro;7 per lift.  Customers were also asked to increase the amount that they had in their accounts on standby for payment from &euro;20 to &euro;22.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, came in to the House only a matter of weeks ago stating he had an agreement - it was dubbed in the House \"a gentleman's agreement\" - with the Irish Waste Management Association, the representative organisation for the waste collection companies.  The Minister gave a guarantee to the House and to customers that there would be no price hikes for 12 months.  I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy English, that this is a clear breach.  Not only is it a price hike, it is a price of hike in the region of 50%.<\/p>  <p>  I am asking for action.  Country Clean has gone to ground.  The company is not taking phone calls from radio stations or anything of the like, and I am asking for action from the Government.  The Minister stated in June that legislation would be brought in to enforce a price cap in the event of breaches of this kind.

The company has said to its customers they can opt out of pay-by-weight, and if they do, they can enter into another deal where one must pay &euro;140 up front.  I made the case of a woman in my area who had paid &euro;59.95 for a year's contract with Greyhound in January of this year and now she has been told she must pay &euro;140 to go back into that contract from 1 August to July next year.  That is a massive increase.<\/p>  <p>  These companies are holding the Government and their customers, and, in Greyhound's case, its workers, in contempt in relation to this so-called gentleman's agreement.  The T&aacute;naiste stated on Thursday last that the Minister was monitoring the matter and, if necessary, he would bring in the legislation to force the companies to implement this price freeze.<\/p>  <p>  Country Clean is continuing to act in this way.

He was hoping to be back in time to take it.<\/p>  <p>  It is true that earlier this month the Minister, Deputy Coveney, secured an agreement with all major waste collection companies to freeze charges in order that customers would pay no more than they currently pay for waste collection over the next 12 months for the same level of service.<\/p>  <p>  While the majority of those in the sector have clearly honoured the agreement, there appear to be some instances of divergence from the terms, or if not the terms then certainly the spirit, of what was agreed.  We are disappointed and unhappy, therefore, if it is true that a waste collector, cited by the Deputies, is requiring existing customers to pay an increased charge for the same level of service contrary to the sector-wide agreement that was negotiated in good faith.<\/p>  <p>  Our Department has been in touch with the company in question, Country Clean, which has explained that the pricing change only relates to some of its customers and is due to the discontinuing of waivers for a small percentage of pay-by-lift customers, which the company purchased from Cork city and county local authorities in 2011.  Country Clean has continued the waiver up to this point but is now intending to remove it.  The company also stated that it is open to those customers to move to the flat fee pricing plan offered by the company.<\/p>  <p>  While regular presenters of waste, that is, those who present both a residual black bin and green bin every fortnight, would see no increase in charges under this change, it could result in increased fees for lighter producers of waste.<\/p>  <p>  We consider that unacceptable.  Customers should not be punished for displaying good management practices by producing less waste.  Furthermore, I also do not believe that this approach is consistent with the spirit of the agreement reached with the sector last month.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has asked our officials to follow up directly with the company and to ensure it understands his expectations in this regard, and also the implications of what the company plans to do.<\/p>  <p>  The approach being taken by different waste companies is being closely monitored.  In this regard, the Minister mandated officials from our Department to meet representatives of the waste sector earlier this month where issues concerning the consistent implementation of the agreement were raised.  It was made clear to the representatives from the waste sector that if a fair and reasonable approach was not being delivered, we would be forced to take further steps to ensure the agreement was honoured.  The Minister has also been clear that if there is evidence of the agreement being breached, he will look at further legislative measures, where necessary, to enforce it.<\/p>  <p>  The compliance of the sector and its effectiveness in co-operating and implementing these new arrangements are likely to feature within the overall review of the functioning of this waste collection sector and to influence consideration of the need for a regulator to ensure we have absolute clarity in terms of predicted behaviour, charging systems and the parameters within which the providers operate.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  We have publicly expressed our dissatisfaction before with how certain companies are operating in a manner that is not in keeping with the spirit of the agreement reached with sector in June.  Under the agreement, customers should not pay more than they currently pay for their waste collection and for the same level of service until July next year.<\/p><p>That was a very clear agreement and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, outlined it to the House and took questions on it.  The operation of the price freeze by industry is being closely monitored by the Department.  Departmental officials have held three meetings with representatives of the waste industry since 1 July and are in regular contact around issues arising from this matter.  We will continue to liaise with operators as necessary on the consistent implementation of the agreement.<\/p> <p> I reiterate that at those meetings it was made very clear to the industry that, if the companies were not taking a fair and reasonable approach, we would be forced to take further steps to ensure the agreement is honoured.

Most of these people struggle even to get the most basic level of service, according to the Neurological Alliance of Ireland.  One of them is a lady named Vera Ronan.  She was a happy energetic woman, active in her community and fond of the game of darts.  She was close to her family and a very vibrant individual.  She suffered a fall on 2 July 2015 and following some very good care in Beaumont Hospital, she was transferred on 18 July 2015 to Connolly Hospital, receiving care there for approximately six weeks.  Following that, she waited in the hospital bed for a transfer to the National Rehabilitation Hospital or for any form of rehabilitation services.  Her family assisted the nurses and carers and sat by her bedside, minding her as anybody would mind their mother.  They watched her deteriorate and wait every single day.  While she was in the bed, there were people downstairs on trolleys in the accident and emergency department.  She should not have been in that bed; she should have been getting neuro-rehabilitation but she could not get it.<\/p>  <p>  According to the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, the problem is at crisis level.  We should have 270 inpatient beds for our population but we have fewer than half that number, with none outside Dublin.  We should have four regional inpatient specialist rehabilitation services nationwide but we have none.  There should be a minimum of nine community neuro-rehabilitation teams nationwide, with one in each community health organisation as a starting point, but there are only three, with none adequately staffed.  I know Vera Ronan's family and their hearts break over the eight months lost, when their mother could have made serious progress.  Every day that is lost, it takes two or more days to get the day back.  It was heartbreaking for her family to have to see her in a hospital bed when she did not need to be there, effectively getting very expensive bed and breakfast.  She needed neuro-rehabilitation.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State commit to publishing a meaningful plan by the end of 2016 for the implementation of the national neuro-rehabilitation strategy that covers key actions, timeframes and a deadline to implement it?  We have the report and know what needs to be done.  We need a timeline, actions and identifiable targets.  Will the Minister of State commit to appointing a senior manager in the HSE in 2016 to complete the plan and lead on the development of rehabilitation services nationally?  We are failing people who need these services so badly because they have a chance of recovery; every day they spend without the neuro-rehabilitation services, they are being pushed back even further.  There are 25,000 people per year who require this level of intervention.  We have a plan so we do not need another report, as the Minister of State knows as well as I do.

The programme for a partnership Government places a particular focus on a number of key programmes and strategies, including publishing a plan for advancing neuro-rehabilitation services in the community.  Currently, a steering group led by the Health Service Executive social care division, with representation from the national clinical programmes for rehabilitation medicine and neurology and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, has drafted an implementation framework for the national policy and strategy for neuro-rehabilitation services.  The draft framework is the subject of consultation at present.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the development of the neuro-rehabilitation policy and strategy, the HSE established the clinical programme on rehabilitation medicine.  The scope of the clinical programme on rehabilitation medicine covers the whole of the patient journey from self-management and prevention through primary, secondary and tertiary care.  It provides a national, strategic and co-ordinated approach to a wide range of rehabilitation services.  The implementation framework will guide and oversee the reconfiguration and development of neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level.<\/p>  <p>  The framework outlines the key issues, themes and considerations, particularly with reference to the necessary reconfiguration and development of community services within the HSE's community health care organisations and inpatient specialist rehabilitation services.<\/p><p>It is envisaged that implementation will involve reconfiguration and development of resources with the community health care organisations to establish specialist neuro-rehabilitation teams within each area as well as reconfiguration and development of specialist inpatient rehabilitation services.  This is in line with the rehabilitation medicine programme model of care and national trauma policy and integration of all specialist rehabilitation services within what is envisaged as being managed clinical networks where each of the nine community health care organisations will establish local implementation teams.  A neuro-rehabilitation network, based on a hub and spoke model, will serve population based areas of the country.  Managed networks will link closely with the National Rehabilitation Hospital, community rehabilitation teams, primary care centres and acute hospitals in their areas.<\/p> <p> Alongside these developments, the Government announced a major capital development of the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  This will deliver a modern, purpose built hospital on the current site.  It will have 120 inpatient beds and will include support therapies, paediatric and acquired brain injury wards, a hydrotherapy unit and a sports hall.  A priority for the implementation of the recommendations of the national policy on neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland will be to establish a structure and methodology to provide the development of neuro-rehabilitation services.  This will include the reconfiguration of current service provision.  Services will be developed by the HSE social care division and other relevant HSE divisions in collaboration with the national clinical programme for rehabilitation medicine.  This will ensure appropriate planning, service delivery and governance for neuro-rehabilitation services.<\/p> <p> I agree with Deputy Louise O'Reilly that it is not acceptable that 25,000 people are waiting for rehabilitation services.

The Minister will no doubt be aware of the importance of the N28.  It is one of the most strategically important roads in the State.  In terms of outlay in comparison to potential economic return, it may well be the best value for money.  This has been on the cards for some time now.  The road will link the Bloomfield interchange and Ringaskiddy at motorway standards.  Needless to say, the economic case for the motorway is extremely strong, particularly in the context of the crucial strategic employment area that is Ringaskiddy, the rapidly growing town of Carrigaline and the strategy which both Government and council have developed for the Cork Harbour area, including the National Maritime College of Ireland which the Minister discussed with Deputies last week.<\/p>  <p>  Cork Chamber helpfully commissioned a report, Cork to the World, in 2010 by Indecon on the economic case for the N28.  If the Minister has not read it, I can tell him it is well worth reading.  I will ensure a copy is left in his pigeonhole for his attention.  To give a brief outline, the assessment indicates that the N28 upgrade would provide a catalyst for realising massively enhanced foreign direct investment, involving an estimated 1,100 additional high value jobs and related additional employment incomes of &euro;97.1 million in annual terms or &euro;1.4 billion in present value terms over a 25-year period.  That is a substantial amount and crucially important to Cork's industrial future. <\/p>  <p>  There are also the potential implications if the road is not delivered in a relatively short period.  The Indecon report states that the estimated loss in trade that would result from a failure to provide the required port capacity - which is the Port of Cork redevelopment that is linked to the N28, to which I will return - is &euro;3.8 billion per annum or just below 22.4% relative to projected 2030 trade.  This is the equivalent of a loss of &euro;59.4 billion when measured in present value terms over a 25-year period.  Mar sin, muna chuirtear an N28 ar f&aacute;il, caillfear tr&aacute;d&aacute;il agus tionscnaimh.<\/p>  <p>  The development of the Port of Cork, one of the most important maritime developments in the State and crucially important to Cork's industrial future, is closely tied to the N28.  Phase 3 of that development, which involves roll on-roll off traffic, will not happen unless the N28 upgrade is delivered, and nor, incidentally, should it happen, as it would be an entirely unreasonable imposition on residents.  The delivery of the N28 is vitally important to the local community.  Residents of Shanbally and Ringaskiddy have had to suffer heavy freight travelling through their villages daily for far too long.  In addition, this has the potential to assist with extremely heavy traffic in Carrigaline.<\/p>  <p>  This matter is being discussed once again following a report given to Cork County Council following a meeting between Transport Infrastructure Ireland and a delegation from the council.  The report was received with great disappointment by councillors.  It confirmed that a number of projects for Cork would not happen within five years due to lack of funding.<\/p><p>It stated that a contractor for Dunkettle would not be appointed until late 2018 and, despite its being the top priority for Cork, work would not begin until at least 2019 or 2020.  The M22 and the M28 will begin only after Dunkettle is delivered, and this will not be until 2021 at the earliest.  The N28 hinges hugely on Dunkettle.  If we are serious about regional development outside Dublin, the delivery of the N28 is absolutely key.  Cork has waited long enough and it needs to be expedited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900037#KK00700","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468950600,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire for the opportunity to address this issue .  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, such as the N28 Cork to Ringaskiddy scheme, is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects are matters for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.<\/p>  <p>  The N28 is the national primary road that links Cork city to Ringaskiddy.  The existing N28 is approximately 12 km long and is a single carriageway except for a dual-carriageway section at the approach to the Bloomfield interchange, the junction with the N40.  The combination of traffic levels and the road layout results in delays for the current users of the N28.  This affects both local traffic and long-distance through traffic.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network, and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads place a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.  Because of the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure over the past number of years.  For this reason, the focus has had to be on maintenance and renewal rather than major new improvement schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The capital plan, published in September 2015, outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  I understand that the transport element of the plan was framed by the conclusions reached in my Department's strategic investment framework for land transport.  This report highlighted the importance of maintenance and renewal of transport infrastructure together with targeted investments to address particular bottlenecks and critical safety issues.  The capital plan provides &euro;6 billion for investment in the roads network in the period to 2022, with &euro;4.4 billion earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country and &euro;1.6 billion for new projects.  Allowing for the commitments relating to the PPP projects, the balance available for new projects within the available capital envelope was limited.  Given the funding limits, the decision made by my predecessor was to provide for a mix of projects across the country to address particular constraints, including bottlenecks and port connectivity.  While it will not be possible to address all the demands for improvement schemes over the capital plan period, the plan does provide for a number of important projects in the Cork area which are scheduled to commence construction within the plan period, including the upgrading of the Dunkettle roundabout, works on the N22 road between Ballyvourney and Macroom and works on the N28 Cork to Ringaskiddy road, subject to appropriate planning consent.<\/p>  <p>  In April this year, Cork County Council, in partnership with TII, launched a public consultation on the next stage of the M28 Cork to Ringaskiddy motorway scheme.  The preferred route alignment and junction strategy for the scheme provides for 10.9 km of motorway standard dual carriageway from Bloomfield to Barnahely and 1.6 km of single carriageway from Barnahely to east of Ringaskiddy.  TlI has reported that the outcome of the public consultation was positive.  I understand the business case in respect of the project is being finalised for submission to my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  The transport element of the capital plan is based on a gradual build-up in capital funding for the road network from the current relatively low base towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works.  Funding will continue to be tight in 2017, with a step up in 2018 and 2019 and then a significant ramp up from 2020.  As Minister I have to work within the capital budgets included in the plan, and TII, in planning the construction schedule for individual projects, also has to take account of the annual budgets available.<\/p>  <p>  As I have indicated previously, we are all conscious that the recovery of the economy is generating spending pressures across the Government system, including capital investment needs.  As part of the programme for a partnership Government there is an increased emphasis on the need for spending on public services, but the Government still has to operate within the EU fiscal rules and this does constrain options.  There will be a mid-term review of the capital plan and this will provide an opportunity to assess progress and consider what scope there is for increased levels of investment depending on economic growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900038#LL00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1468950600,"counter":362,"content":"<p>The part of the Minister's response that jumps out at me the most is the reference to the 12 km of the N28.  The investment involved would result in 1,100 high-end jobs, but there will be a potential loss of &euro;59.4 billion in present value terms over 25 years if it is not developed quickly enough.  The value for money in this project is enormous.  If the Government is serious about balanced regional development and attracting major multinational employers outside the Dublin region then projects such as this need to be prioritised.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned two self-imposed constraints on the Government.  The first is the fiscal compact, and we made an argument at the time of the referendum about the implications that would have for capital spending.  Even within these restrictions, however, the Government's proposed capital plan is under-strength and unambitious.   For some time, the State has been below the OECD average for spending on capital infrastructure, and that state of affairs continues.  This project has been long-fingered for too long.  Massive amounts of freight travel through the surrounding villages, which is having a detrimental impact on the communities there, and it will be a serious loss for Cork, Ringaskiddy, Carrigaline and the whole harbour area, not to mention the southern part of this country, if this is not delivered soon.  A starting date in 2021 is far too late, and by then Cork and the region will already have lost out on billions.  <\/p>  <p>  Incidentally, the Minister mispronounced my name.

I did not mean to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I understand what the Deputy is saying, but I come across people putting similar cases for their own areas every day.  I am utterly sympathetic to the needs of the Cork area, particularly its need for jobs, but we are working within very serious financial constraints.  We would prefer not to be working within financial constraints, and this is a particularly expensive project, as are all roads of this sort.  We have to prioritise them, as there is very little money for them before 2019, 2020 and 2021.  It would be wrong of me to come to the House today and promise that it will be prioritised or brought forward.  In any case, the scheme does not yet have the necessary approvals, though some others in the area do have them.  In April this year TII, in conjunction with Cork County Council, held a public consultation into the proposed route and the business case in respect of the project is being finalised for submission to my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Those procedures have to be completed.<\/p>  <p>  While I am sympathetic, the Deputy has to realise that we have a fundamental problem with the roads in this country.  The 99,000 km of roads are a huge albatross around our neck, as they have to be maintained.  This is massively expensive, and much more money is spent on maintenance than on actual building projects.  If the Deputy or other Deputies would like to stop the maintenance and start building, they should say so, but this is a problem that we aim to ameliorate in 2019, 2020 and 2021, when we have great hopes for growth.<\/p><p>We hope to be able to indulge ourselves in capital expenditure of this sort, which is absolutely necessary, but I cannot hold out any promise.

The housing emergency, which is especially acute in our urban centres, is the most pressing social and economic issue facing the country.  To have a home is a basic human need, and we are elected to this House to ensure all our citizens have a place to call home. The publication today of Rebuilding Ireland - an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness is a step forward in providing good quality, well-designed housing for all our citizens within the context of a just society.<\/p><p>The concept of a just society is not new in an Irish context.  Fifty years ago this September, the then Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, surprised the nation by announcing a free education scheme.  Fifty years later, I think there is complete cross-party agreement on the gravity of the housing issues facing us.  I believe that through the implementation of this housing action plan we can transform the State's approach towards social housing and the interaction of communities involving private and social housing.  The current levels of homelessness are not acceptable in a decent society.  A home is a basic need.  At the launch earlier this afternoon, in the short video highlighting the new Sophia housing development in Sean McDermott Street, a young man captured the life-changing possibilities of providing a homeless person with an opportunity to have his or her own home where he or she can finally close the door on the experience of homelessness and have a place that provides warmth, security and a balanced, hopeful future.<\/p><p>A Programme for a Partnership Government rightly put the homelessness and housing challenge front and centre and committed to the delivery of an action plan within 100 days.  That I am here today presenting an action plan, 74 days into our Administration, is testament to the priority that the Government, I as housing Minister and my Department places on developing and publishing this action plan as quickly and as comprehensively as possible.  We were able to move swiftly because of a range of enabling and supporting work, including the contributions of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness, whose Chairman, Deputy John Curran, and members worked hard to bring together the many facets and challenges to be faced in addressing the many housing issues.  I believe we have responded to all the key and implementable recommendations of that report.  In the document we specifically have an appendix responding to each recommendation in turn in some detail.<\/p><p>Our current housing challenges have deep roots.  For a decade, our broken public finances and even more broken banking and development sectors have been incapable of providing the housing we know we need.  I believe that the publication of this document, Rebuilding Ireland - an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness,<b><i><\/i><\/b>is an important moment in public policy terms because it is the first time that Government has set out a holistic overview of the overall housing system.  For too long, whether in this House, in council chambers or in public discourse generally, we have polarised the debate on housing provision, focusing alternately on social housing or home ownership needs but never bringing those two elements together in a detailed way.  This action plan crucially brings together the two sides of the one issue, which essentially is about providing affordable homes, and State intervention when people cannot afford to do so.  Too many of our cities, towns and villages show the effects of that kind of thinking, resulting in ordinary decent people being instantly categorised based on where they live or the name of the estate where they come from.  This action plan points towards a very different path for the future.  While it opens the door to a massive public house building and acquisition programme, it aims to deliver that programme not through large swathes of mono-tenure estates but through a mixed tenure approach to integrated and cohesive communities.<\/p><p>This action plan is ultimately focused on delivering more homes for the people who need them.  It includes more than 80 separate actions structured under five main pillars that will address the needs of people who are homeless and at risk of homelessness; accelerate social housing delivery; build more homes for the wider housing market; improve the rental sector; and utilise the houses we have, many of which remain vacant.<\/p><p>I will outline particular actions that stand out for me as Minister and for the Members of the House.  With regard to funding and viability, with the support of the wider Government and, in particular, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, a massive &euro;5.35 billion of funding will be provided from now until 2021 to support the delivery of some 47,000 units of social housing.  To ensure a planning-led approach to meeting our current housing challenges, a &euro;200 million local infrastructure housing activation fund will provide enabling infrastructure to open up large sites for early development by housing providers, with potential to develop between 15,000 and 20,000 new homes directly linked to that investment, at least 10%, and potentially much more, of which will be social housing.  A complementary National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and private sector large-scale infrastructure development finance fund will seek to provide additional funding for on-site works by developers.  Underutilised and publicly owned lands will be opened up for mixed tenure developments to provide the social and market housing we need side-by side.  Funding has been put in place for increased limits for rent supplement and housing assistance payment, HAP, from 1 July this year, costing approximately &euro;55 million next year.  A total of 2,000 affordable rental homes will be brought on stream, using the proceeds of the State's sale of its stake in Bord G&aacute;is Energy, and measures will be developed to bring on stream an additional 7,000 student accommodation places by 2019, thereby providing purpose-built units for our growing third level sector, and in the process, freeing up rental properties in our cities, which is badly needed.<\/p><p>With regard to regulatory reform, legislation will be developed and introduced to the House in the autumn to speed up the planning process by enabling large housing applications to be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la after careful preplanning consultation involving local authorities, to streamline Part VIII procedures for local authority and approved housing bodies, and to remove regulatory barriers to reusing vacant and underutilised properties, particularly in our city, town and village centres, many of which have suffered most in recent years.<\/p><p>A major new strategy for the whole of the rental sector will be brought forward before the end of this year, striking an effective balance between, first and foremost, the rights of tenants and creating a stable environment for badly needed investment.  We have had debates on that sector already in the House, and I look forward to those consultations continuing.  Putting in place a national planning framework early next year will ensure a long-term approach not only to planning for housing the 500,000 people who will live in our country over the next 20 years but also to identifying key sites and measures to ensure proper use of land and vacant properties.  We will also be examining further legislative measures on mortgage arrears to do all we can to keep people in their homes, where at all possible.<\/p><p>On the issue of delivery, a new housing delivery office will report directly to the Secretary General of my Department and to me, as Minister, to co-ordinate key elements of the overall social and market housing delivery programme under this plan.  A total of 1,600 currently vacant homes will be acquired by the Housing Agency for onward transfer to local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, as an initial exercise for a new procurement centre in the agency.<\/p><p>A total of 20,000 new homes, 2,000 of them Part V houses, will be brought on stream by NAMA.  There will be 1,500 rapid delivery homes built by this time next year - a trebling of the previous target - to banish the spectre of families living in totally unsuitable hotel accommodation.  A new National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, backed special purpose vehicle will look to access private funding sources to deliver additional social housing as part of mixed tenure developments.  There will be 3,000 new homes delivered on State lands as pathfinder mixed housing developments.  We hope that these will show an example for many others to follow.  Social housing design, approval and delivery procedures will be overhauled to ensure swifter delivery.  The number of tenancies provided by Housing First teams for rough sleepers in Dublin will be tripled from 100 to 300 tenancies and the housing-led approach will be extended to other urban areas.  An additional 7,000 housing assistance payment tenancies will be delivered in 2017 and 2018.  A new initiative will be put in place to provide access to independent expert advice and legal advice for people facing serious mortgage arrears, and more households will be facilitated with the option of a revamped mortgage to rent scheme.<\/p> <p> Additional resources will be made available to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and local authorities to ensure they meet the statutory deadlines to which they have committed.  This is an 18-week turnaround time for decisions for large-scale residential developments.  The role of the Residential Tenancies Board will be expanded and strengthened.  Resolution of unfinished housing estates will continue focusing on alignment with the social housing investment programme.  Proposals for new urban, village and rural renewal programmes will be brought forward to harness the synergies between planning, housing and community development initiatives of the relevant Departments.<\/p> <p> On the supporting measures, there will be enhanced supports for homeless families with children, such as the provision of free travel in order that families can better access the services and amenities they need.  A range of measures will be advanced to meet the needs of homeless people with mental health and addiction issues.  The HSE has committed to trebling the amount of money it will commit to supporting homeless people within 2016 and 2017.  It is currently &euro;2 million and it will rise to &euro;6 million next year.  As housing delivery activity ramps up, emerging skills needs will be met through measures to support the supply of skilled tradespeople.  There will be better management of social housing stock through rapid re-letting of vacant units and through the introduction of choice-based letting which has enabled a 25% reduction in the numbers on the housing list in Cork.<\/p> <p> Above all, I believe that through the implementation of the action plan, we can and will comprehensively address the homelessness issue, and not before time, and arrest the growing affordability gap for many households looking for a house.  The implementation of the plan will drive the rental sector to provide a range of quality accommodation in bigger numbers and deliver housing in a way that supports and does not direct economic growth.  We can also achieve wider objectives such as the need to support proper planning and sustainable development.<\/p> <p> I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on the analysis and actions proposed under Rebuilding Ireland - an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  I also look forward to receiving constructive input to moving forward its implementation.  The State cannot do this alone.  We need all stakeholders, especially housing providers, landowners, agencies and policy-makers across Government to work towards a common goal of providing good quality, affordable and well-located homes for our growing population.  Business as usual is simply not an option.  We each have our roles and must fulfil our respective responsibilities with the public sector empowered to act and the private sector enabled to support and deliver.<\/p> <p> I believe this strategy to be a significant step forward.  It is not the perfect article and we do not pretend it is.  If there are mistakes in the strategy, we will correct them.  However, I believe it is a very good start as a signal of intent by Government and a commitment of very significantly increased resources.  It is a plan that has been tested and will deliver, if implemented, a very significant increase in the number of social house constructed and provided.  This would kick-start the private sector into building the many more houses that are needed.  We have the capacity, with this plan and its implementation, to get to building 25,000 housing units by mid-2019, but we need to go well beyond that figure to deal with the deficit that was created over the ten years of virtual inactivity in the construction sector.  We need to go beyond 25,000 to somewhere between 30,000 and 35,000 housing units which are a mix of social, affordable and private.  The structures, mechanisms and decision-making procedures that we are looking to streamline and improve by this strategy, can and will facilitate that.  The construction sector's response today to the plan has so far been positive.  We want to work in partnership with all the stakeholders, whether that is to address the vulnerabilities of people who are homeless, or people who are rough sleepers who rely on emergency accommodation night by night, or families who are living in totally inappropriate emergency accommodation at the moment.  Ambitious targets have been set but it is intended to deliver on those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900039#MM00800","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468951800,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Barry Cowen who will be sharing time with Deputies John Curran, Mary Butler and Pat Casey.

As he has said, and as many of us have said in the D&aacute;il since it reconvened, the housing crisis and homelessness crisis or emergency is the greatest issue facing Government, the country and society.  It was high on Fianna F&aacute;il's agenda when we sought to facilitate an arrangement to allow Fine Gael to lead Government based on the numbers it had with a view to producing a new housing strategy.  I acknowledge the foresight of the D&aacute;il in putting together an all-party housing committee on an emergency basis.  I acknowledge the work it did under the chairmanship of Deputy John Curran and the way in which it sought to meet and consult all the stakeholders in the sectors in the housing area, those who are greatly affected by homelessness and all those who help and assist them.  The work of that committee has fed into a process which allowed the Government to make a wholesome response and bring forward a strategy that has the potential to address this issue, in the full knowledge that other strategies were not that successful.  There are aspects of this strategy that appear fine and good and have potential.  However, we must be mindful of the fact that in November 2014 we heard a lot of this also.  Unfortunately, much of what was promised then has not materialised.<\/p><p>It is against that background that I will read into the record a paragraph from page 44 of the strategy which was published today.  It talks about increasing and accelerating the delivery of social housing:<\/p><blockquote>The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020<\/i>, published in November 2014, committed to providing 35,600 new social housing units between 2015 and 2020, at an estimated cost to the Exchequer of around &euro;3.8 billion.  Local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies are delivering these units through a variety of new-build and acquisition mechanisms as well as through leasing arrangements and tackling vacant stock [an exaggeration].  Given the scale of the current pressures in terms of delivery, more direct intervention is required to expand and accelerate overall social housing supply, particularly in the short term.<br \/><br \/>Under this Action Plan, targeted social housing supply is being increased to 47,000 units over the period 2016 to 2021 (at which stage some 10,000 units will be delivered on an annual basis).  This will be achieved with Exchequer support of &euro;5.35 billion, with the following delivery profile as set out in [the following graph].<\/blockquote><p>What jumps out from this paragraph is that the figures indicate an increase of 12,000 housing units on the last plan, much of which has not been delivered and many of which were lease units rather than new build units.  That equates to a little more than 2,500 new housing units per year in addition to the previous plan that was in place.  The committee recommended 10,000 new units per annum.<\/p><p>It might be described as ambitious but there were many priorities within the content of the recommendations that offered opportunities to meet that demand for housing.  We have to provide houses or units for people to live in.<\/p> <p> Apart from all that, I acknowledge that there is an increase of &euro;2 billion over five years which has to be welcomed.  I acknowledge there is an appendix with timelines attached and I heard the Taoiseach today call them \"timebombs\".  They will be timebombs if they are not adhered to, and we in opposition, like anybody else in opposition, will seek to hold the Government to account for that.  We will have a watching brief to ensure that what is in the plan will be implemented.<\/p> <p> I will be brief about what is not contained and why I think the plan is incomplete.  I am seeking to be constructive.  I have the same rights and representative responsibility and role to effect change for my constituents, for the country and for society.  While there is an aspirational commitment in respect of the rental sector and first-time buyers, much of what the Minister hopes to enact will, I expect, be contained in the budget such as rewarding landlords for improving the quality of tenure over time for families.  The all-party committee made sound recommendations on that to be taken on board.<\/p> <p> I am surprised and disappointed there is not a firm commitment to student accommodation.  There is a commitment to review student accommodation and report back in quarter two next year, this time next year.  Many of us know there is a crisis in respect of student accommodation.  Students are competing with families for accommodation in cities and near colleges.  That is not right or appropriate.  I had hoped a vehicle would be put in place to allow colleges access funds to build units and provide them as soon as possible.  That process should have been commenced much sooner than the commitment in this plan.<\/p> <p> In respect of mortgage arrears and mortgage distress, we would like to see firm legislative proposals to allow mortgage-to-rent solutions be imposed by courts rather than considered by courts where there was a bank veto for too long.<\/p> <p> The housing delivery office has potential but does not go far enough.  A housing procurement agency or housing authority is needed to drive development and change and to build houses.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority did a job.  It might have wound up in an unfortunate manner but the job it was asked to do was to develop the docklands and it did so.  A housing authority's job is to build houses and this has the potential to build houses, but the way in which the Minister seeks to fund it off-balance sheet is very limited from what I have seen without getting into greater detail.  The Minister says it has the potential to deliver 5,000 units over five years.  I would have expected it had the potential to deliver many multiples of that.  It has the potential to draw down funding from a wide range of sources, including the credit unions who want to get involved, to help and gain a return for their funds, rather than have them in the pillar banks with no return where they contribute to profits piggybacked on people who are paying 2% over and above the European average.  We do not want them to be associated with that.  We want them associated with providing a vehicle whereby a massive amount of funding can be given to provide the massive number of units needed.<\/p> <p> People want homes and houses, irrespective of where they come from.  We can provide a vehicle whereby they can be leased for 50 or 100 years, if necessary, to get over the EUROSTAT issue the Minister mentioned that he fears.  This could provide adequate resources, funds, contracts and joint ventures in order that local authorities can appease and settle those who are on their waiting lists, approved housing bodies can play their role, colleges can build units and the private sector can borrow from that fund at competitive rates because they are not competitive now.  I accept the mixed tenure commitment will seek to help those who have a good education and good jobs and cannot even start to rent, let alone own a home.  They have to be accommodated and I expect they will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900040#NN00300","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468952400,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Having read the plan, and to be fair about it, I broadly welcome it.  There are issues I have with it and there are things I would like to have seen done differently.  I welcome it because if this plan is implemented in full, in the fashion outlined and the timelines are met, we will be much better off than we would have been with the plan we were implementing three months ago or before the general election.  This makes a serious effort under several headings to tackle the housing issue.  The Minister said, in an honest assessment, that it does not have all the answers but it is a good start.  It is a start.  Certain elements are framed in such a way that it is an evolving plan.  The answers are not all here, there is further research to be done and people who read the plan need to acknowledge that the Minister has not said this is the definitive handbook, that all the answers are here.  There are certain areas that must be further developed.<\/p>  <p>  Our greatest sympathy and that of any public representative is with the people in emergency homeless accommodation today, whether in hostels, bed and breakfast establishments, guesthouses and so forth.  The Minister put his head on the block a bit today when he gave a very definitive timeline and I genuinely wish him well.  For people living in such inappropriate accommodation, the urgency the Minister has attached to dealing with that is important.  I acknowledge that he has published this report significantly ahead of time.  That demonstrates his urgency in dealing with this issue.<\/p>  <p>  From the point of view of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness, one of the issues on which we probably differ is that we had envisaged a national housing procurement agency, an overarching body, but the Minister proposes a housing delivery office within the Department.  We need to see the detail.  He also says the housing agency would run a procurement centre in parallel.  We differ on that in terms of the efficiencies that might be driven.  The Minister has made his plan and I do not think a plan should fall over on this issue but it was not as we had envisaged it.  We felt that the way to go would be to have one centralised office that would be effective and efficient over a decade to drive the housing programme the Minister has delivered here, and one that Ministers after him would have to follow.  He has chosen a different route.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has some innovative proposals about vacant properties which need to be dealt with urgently.  I am conscious that Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures produced last week indicated that even in the greater Dublin area where the housing crisis is at its worst there are still significant numbers of vacant properties.  While not all would be suitable for residential occupation, local authorities need to be tasked with identifying them and developing the initiatives the Minister has indicated in dealing with that.<\/p>  <p>  There is certainly a job of work to be done in the private rented sector.  It is several years since we had a strategy in that area but private rented accommodation will endure for some considerable time, as it has in most other countries and cities.  One of the biggest concerns people have is about security of tenure.  The Minister says that by the end of the year he will have strategy for the sector, which is important.  This will also, however, require legislation to underpin it in respect of rents, security of tenure and other similar issues.<\/p>  <p>  The committee asked for a moratorium on repossessions for a short period while additional legislation comes in, either what the Minister mentioned in the programme for Government or proposals that we might have.  While mortgage arrears are mentioned in the report and the Minister refers to the potential for legislative measures later in the year, I would like to remind him that one of the committee's specific recommendations was that the code of conduct on mortgage arrears should be amended on a statutory basis to include an offer of split mortgage or mortgage to rent.  Those issues should be considered.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister refers to the off-balance sheet issue in the plan and I was a little bit surprised that only 5,000 social housing units will be built over five years.  We felt that could have been more ambitious.

Having met groups such as the Irish League of Credit Unions and others, we feel this model has greater potential.  I acknowledge and accept that the Minister is saying it is a starting point.  I agree that we have to start somewhere, but we felt it had significant potential.<\/p>  <p>  My time is running out, but I want to finish on a specific point that I do not want to miss.  The Minister has established a local infrastructure housing activation fund at a cost of &euro;200 million.  The report states it could deliver 15,000 or 20,000 housing units.  I want to put a document on the record that was presented to the committee during our consultation.  It clearly indicated that across the four local authorities in Dublin, 48,000 or 49,000 housing units could be developed without planning permission and local authorities had a deficit of about &euro;160 million.  The document should be specifically considered because the Minister is not addressing the issue that was presented to us with the amount of money he is spending.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister should examine the information we received during our meetings.  It is important that the deficit in infrastructure is front-loaded to allow private development and social housing on lands across the four Dublin local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900042#PP00100","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1468953000,"counter":378,"content":"<p>The launch of the housing action plan is a significant event.  It is particularly significant for the 4,152 adults in emergency accommodation, an increase of 160 on the previous count, and for the 2,206 children who will sleep in emergency accommodation tonight, an increase of 29 on the previous count.  It is also significant for all the people who are sofa-surfing or living in overcrowded accommodation, those at risk of homelessness due to repossessions or excessive rents, the 130,000 or more households languishing on local authority housing lists for up to ten years and those priced out of the first-time buyer market.  The plan the Minister launched today will determine whether things start to get better for many, if not all, these people.<\/p>  <p>  It is also a big day for the Government.  This is the first real test of how it intends to govern, whether it will abandon the failed policies of the previous Administration and embrace new ideas and new politics or continue to underinvest in social housing and under-regulate the housing market as it did over the previous five years.  As we all know, that had devastating consequences for many people.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Minister, the Minister of State and their team on completing and publishing the report early.  It involved a significant amount of work, something I acknowledge.  I also acknowledge the work of others who assisted the Minister.  The continual references to the Committee on Housing and Homelessness is a very positive sign.  The Minister referred to appendix 2 of the report when he referred to cross-referencing recommendations of the committee with his recommendations.  In fact, he only referenced our priority recommendations.  Although that is welcome, there are only 23 priority recommendations while there are 84 other recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  I have only read the full plan properly once.  The Minister has only fully accepted seven of our 23 priority recommendations.  The 15 others have not been accepted or fall substantially short of what we proposed.  I have written to the Chair of the Select Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Maria Bailey, to request that not only do we have a meeting to scrutinise the plan this week or next, but also that the Minister attends the committee in order that we have time to get into the detail of many of the questions Deputies will no doubt want to ask.  He will address some of them today, and I hope he will facilitate a committee meeting.<\/p>  <p>  I want to comment very briefly on each of the five pillars of the plan.  I want specifically to address funding.  The total amount of funding allocated goes to the very heart of this plan and its ability to deliver on its commitments.  Earlier today, the Minister claimed that increased investment on the Kelly plan is in the region of &euro;2.2 billion.  This is simply not the case.  I will talk Deputies through the figures.  Deputy Alan Kelly's plan committed &euro;3.8 billion over six years or &euro;633 million per year, on average.  The Minister's plan commits to &euro;5.35 billion over six years or &euro;891 million per year, on average.  That is an annual increase or difference of &euro;258 million between his plan and that of Deputy Alan Kelly's.  Over the course of six years, that is &euro;1.54 billion.<\/p>  <p>  The total increase in the Minister's plan compared with what would have happened otherwise is significantly short of what he says.  In fact, if one compares the five years left in Deputy Alan Kelly's plan and the first five years of the Minister's plan, the difference is &euro;1.2 billion.  That is a substantial gap.  Massaging the figures is not a good place to start when one is announcing such an important plan.  The Minister should clarify that issue on the floor of the House today.<\/p>  <p>  I will deal with the pillars in order.  I strongly welcome the commitment in the plan to reduce dramatically the use of hotels by mid-2017 through rapid build and the acquisition of vacant units.  That is a very brave commitment on the part of the Minister.  I am concerned that the timescale is very tight and I am not sure how many families the Minister intends to move into rapid or refurbished units and how many families will remain in them permanently or will be moved on to council housing or housing assistance payment, HAP, schemes.  That is not clear in the plan, and it would be good for the Minister to clarify that today or at a later stage.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the commitment on additional funding for mental health supports for people in emergency accommodation.  I am deeply concerned about the text of the plan with respect to tackling mortgage distress, in particular preventing people at risk of losing their homes from becoming homeless.  The proposal for a dedicated court in the programme for Government seems to be gone.  The clear commitment in the programme for Government for amending the code of conduct on a statutory basis also appears to be gone, and there seems to be a significant roll-back on what was in the programme for Government to help those families in very significant mortgage distress.  Again, I would be interested in hearing the views of the Minister on that.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in absolutely and unequivocally welcomes any increased investment in social housing and output.  There is an increase in both of those in the action plan, which I fully acknowledge.  I also strongly welcome the shift towards the greater use of mixed tenure states, as the Minister has outlined.<\/p>  <p>  I see the plan moving in the direction of local authorities providing housing, while private sector developers build estates and benefit from the cost rental and private units.  That is a more expensive way to do things and denies the statutory sector the profits that generate from that which could be recycled into increased social housing provision.  I do not believe it is the best use of local authority land or expertise.  Therefore, I again urge the Minister, as I did privately before, to include in the mixed tenure plan or aspect of the plan the ability of local authorities not just to lead but to develop fully, control and benefit from those mixed tenure estates.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, an additional 12,000 social housing units are outlined in the plan, but it is important we interrogate that figure fully.  The headline of 47,000 social housing units does not adequately characterise or capture what is taking place.  According to the Minister, 26,000 units will be built by councils or approved housing bodies or purchased under Part V.  I am interested to know whether there is an estimation of the balance because clearly the State has more control over housing provided by local authorities and approved housing bodies as opposed to Part V.<\/p>  <p>  Some 11,000 units are to be provided through other acquisitions by council and approved housing bodies.  Given the fact that the census figures from 2016 tell us there are 189,000 vacant units in Ireland, it seems to me that the 11,000 target is too small.  If I am misreading the plan, I ask the Minister to clarify the figures.<\/p>  <p>  A journalist asked the Minister about the 10,000 units to be provided through leasing, and he evaded the answer.  How many will become public or voluntary housing association owned units?  How many will remain in the private sector and be leased over a period?  That is quite important.<\/p>  <p>  On the potential 5,000 units to be delivered through a special purpose vehicle off-balance sheet, are they in addition to the 47,000 thousand units mentioned in the plan?  Are they included in the plan?  Who will own the units?  These are crucial questions.<\/p><p>From my estimation - I am more than happy for the Minister to correct me - what we are looking at is an increase of the real social housing stock owned by approved housing bodies and local authorities in the region of 6,000 units a year over the lifetime of the plan.  That is 40% short of what the committee proposed and that was a minimum.<\/p> <p> I am deeply concerned that the total increased funding according to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, at the press conference this morning for next year is &euro;150 million.  Could the Minister confirm whether that is the case?  I appreciate the fiscal constraints on the Government but if it is, given the scale of the crisis, that is not enough when we need to front-load direct State investment in social housing.<\/p> <p> Pillar 3, which relates to building more homes, is disappointing given how much of a centrepiece the Minister has made of increased provision of private housing by the market.  In the region of 25,000 units a year is required.  I echo some of the comments made by Deputies Cowen and Curran so I will not repeat what they said.  It seems to me that there is little of real substance in terms of concrete actions to make homes more affordable.  There is no great value in increasing the stock of private housing if it is costing between &euro;330,000 and &euro;350,000 for first-time buyers.  I am deeply concerned about that.<\/p> <p> Notwithstanding the additional 12,000 social units, I am concerned that the Minister is talking about 100,000 units ultimately for social use being delivered by the private rental sector.  The Minister referred today to 84,000 housing assistance payment, HAP, units, 10,000 leased units and 4,000 rental accommodation scheme, RAS units.  That remains an enormous over-reliance on the private rental sector.  I admit it is slightly better than the proposal of the previous Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, but it is still deeply concerning.<\/p> <p> Pillar 4 focuses on improving the rental sector.  I fully agree with Deputies Curran and Cowen that this is the most disappointing section of the strategy.  There are no firm commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900042#PP00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468953600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>There are firm commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900043#QQ00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1468953600,"counter":381,"content":"<p>There is the promise of a strategy and we will engage constructively with the Minister in the D&aacute;il Chamber and in the committee whenever he develops the strategy but there is a lack of firm, hard commitments not only on the long-term development of the private rental sector but the type of legislation on tenancy terminations or the purpose and outcome of a review of standards.<\/p>  <p>  There is nothing on rent certainty, despite the escalating rent crisis and nothing specific on student accommodation other than, again, just a promise of another strategy at some future point.  I acknowledge the point made by the Minister that his team did not have enough time to develop that part of the strategy.  I suspect the real blockage is not the lack of time but the unwillingness on the part of his Cabinet colleagues to take the kind of policy decisions required to provide long-term solutions to a broken private rented sector.<\/p>  <p>  Pillar 5 deals with utilising existing housing.  Last week, as we are all aware, the Central Statistics Office revealed that there are 189,000 vacant units throughout the State.  When the Housing Agency published its report based on the 2011 figures, many rubbished it, saying that the 2016 figures would show a significant reduction in the number of vacant units.  They were wrong and the Housing Agency was right.  While I again welcome the proposal to allocate &euro;70 million to acquire 1,600 vacant properties, that is nowhere near enough.  If the Housing Agency spends the money quickly, will the Minister replenish it and make it a rolling fund, and will he ask local authorities to develop actions plans for the long-term reintroduction of such units into the overall public private stock at local authority level?<\/p>  <p>  The plan is undoubtedly better than that of the previous Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.  There is no question about that, but in the view of the party and constituents I represent it is simply nowhere near enough.  The Minister has adopted much of the rhetoric of the report of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  He has adopted some of its spirit in his recommendations but the gap between the committee&rsquo;s report and what the Minister has published today remains far too great.<\/p>  <p>  There will undoubtedly be some improvements for some families following what the Minister has announced today.  I will take the Minister at his word, that those of us who will sit with him in committee, privately or in the D&aacute;il Chamber, to try to improve the quality of the plan will see improvements over a period.  We will not be found wanting to make constructive, realistic proposals to the Minister as we did to the Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  Crucially, however, unless the Minister is more ambitious and unless the Government ensures greater investment in the direct provision of local authority and approved housing body social housing, the crisis that is gripping tens of thousands of families in the housing system today will continue and things will continue to get worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900043#QQ00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1468953600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact the Government has published its action plan for housing and homelessness and that is has done so ahead of time, and also that it has taken on board many of the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee, although, as has been pointed out, not all of the recommendations in full and not all of the recommendations that were made.  Nevertheless, it is welcome that the action plan has been published and that it has five pillars which are designed to address what is a very serious problem.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned at what the plan does not contain and whether it can break the logjam that halted construction after the economic collapse of 2008.  That is the challenge.  People who are homeless, or are at risk of becoming homeless, need the plan to work.  I wish it success because it is the most important issue and it needs immediate and effective action.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest issue staring us all in the face is the need for housing at a time when there are zoned sites available.  However, hardly anyone is building, apart from one-off houses in the countryside to which the Minister referred at the launch of the plan this morning.  If it is cost-effective to build one-off houses, why is it not cost-effective to build multi-unit developments with the economies of scale attached to building more than one unit, especially given the demand that is building up in the cities?  We are constantly being told by the private sector that it is not cost-effective to build, yet people are building one-off houses in the countryside.  Therefore, those protestations must be challenged.  I agree incentives should be provided, and some were announced today, such as the upfront payment for Part V units and making publicly owned land available for private housing to be built for profit.  I agree with the Minister and others who have said that a social mix is desirable.  It is good that publicly owned land will be made available for social and affordable housing, but it will also be made available for private development and presumably for profit.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that there needs to be some public payback for that.  While I agree with the principle that we need a social mix of housing, there must be some reward to local authorities where publicly owned land is being used for private profit.  We must learn from the mistakes of the past whereby huge swathes of public housing are in one part of the city and other parts are entirely composed of private housing.  The Minister cited Cork as an example.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a pressing need to have disincentives to the hoarding of land and sites until they become more profitable.  While I agree that we need to provide carrots to get the private sector to build, we also need sticks to ensure it does not sit on land to make a greater profit at a later stage.  While the Minister answered questions on the plan this morning, he specifically said he is concerned that investment funds are buying up zoned land.  I share the Minister&rsquo;s concern.  The only purpose I can see for buying zoned land is that one can hold on to it for some time to make a profit.  The Minister must provide a strong deterrent to the hoarding of land for future profit.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party put forward proposals in the Social Housing Bill yesterday.  I hope the Minister will look at the proposals contained in the Bill, one of which is the implementation of the Kenny report and other of which is to bring forward the vacant sites levy.  I accept the Minister said this morning that he would bring forward the vacant sites levy as soon as he legally could, but he should keep the matter under review because it is not planned to introduce it until 2018 and I believe it could be brought forward earlier.  These two measures would provide the necessary deterrent to the hoarding of land.<\/p><p> Our Bill proposes the implementation of the recommendations of the Kenny report which, as we know, was published more than 40 years ago.  An all-party commission on the Constitution in 2004 found that it was not contrary to the Constitution.  I was a member of that committee.  The Kenny report proposes that land acquired for the purpose of building houses through compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, would only have its current value plus 25%.  In other words, one could not sit on the land and then make a profit by having it rezoned for housing.<\/p> <p> A second proposal of our Bill is that the remit of NAMA be broadened and the organisation rebranded as the national housing development and finance agency.  I know there are a number of measures proposed regarding the Housing Agency, for example, and the NTMA and others being part of the solution.  However, we believe that NAMA could be a much greater part of the solution if its focus were changed and if its considerable monetary resources and expertise were used for the provision of housing, whether social or private.<\/p> <p> We also propose measures to professionalise the landlord sector.  Again, there are references to this in the housing strategy, but I believe that genuine measures could be introduced in this regard.  There is a professionalised landlord sector in other European countries that provides stable, affordable rented accommodation but we do not really have that in this country, and we need more measures in this regard.<\/p> <p> The fourth measure in our Bill I wish to highlight - I acknowledge that Sinn F&eacute;in has also proposed it - is the linking of rent to the consumer price index.  We published all these measures about a month ago in a draft Bill, which we have added to, and we published the full Bill yesterday.<\/p> <p> The Government is not proposing any specific actions regarding any of these four measures and others that we have published.  We in opposition want to be constructive but we also hope that the Government will seriously consider measures presented by the Opposition.<\/p> <p> We also urgently need more measures to give security to those privately renting.  Some measures in the housing strategy will give some protection for tenants, such as, for example, where houses are being sold, that tenants stay in their homes.  The Minister has announced that in large developments there will be protections.  I have not seen any measures that would protect, say, the person who is in an individual apartment or whose landlord owns only a small number of properties.  The majority of people privately renting are in those kinds of situations where the landlord does not own a very large number of properties in any one development.  More security of tenure is required.  Again, I know the Minister has said that there will be a plan later in the year in this regard, but a number of measures need to be taken in this area because people in the private rented sector face a great deal of insecurity.<\/p> <p> I welcome increased funding for construction of social housing, building on the &euro;3.1 billion provided by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, in the strategy he announced in November 2014.  It is important to note the amended amount of &euro;5.35 billion and, again, Deputy &Oacute; Broin has pursued the numbers surrounding this issue.  However, the Minister's plan goes up to 2021, whereas the plan of the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, went up to 2020.  I know that they are both six-year periods, but there was very little money available to spend in the first year of the plan of the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.  Fair is fair, and we must give credit to the former Minister.  When I was in that Department, there was no money, and any bit of money we had we put into voids and bringing local authority houses back into use.  That was effectively spent certainly in some local authorities, and I would cite Fingal as a particularly good one, but there was hardly any money to spend on the construction of houses.  That money is now becoming available because the economy has been fixed, so we need to ensure it is spent, and spent effectively, but I do welcome the additional money.<\/p> <p> There will be real challenges in getting the money spent.  That will be the real test of the success of the plan.  Money allocated to local authorities for social housing gets turned into actual houses at a snail's pace.  I highlighted a hole in the ground in my city last week.  I had allocated the money to housing there when I was Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning.  We had been given a commitment and I had it in writing that the houses would be built by April 2016, but it is still a hole in the ground.  I am not hitting out at my local authority in particular because I know there are similar situations throughout the country.<\/p> <p> We need to get rid of these obstacles and logjams.  The matter will not be addressed simply by fast-tracking the planning process.  If one considers Part VIII, for example, it is only an eight-week process plus possibly another four weeks if additional information is asked, so that is not the problem.  I have some concerns about tampering with the planning process to address the issue of the slow pace of build because that is not where the problem is.  The problem surrounds getting the money, getting to the planning process and then getting the construction done.  The Minister needs to focus on that area.  I point to the Minister of State sitting beside him because we were together in the Department of Education and Skills.  Schools can be built relatively quickly, and I think I saw the Minister of State, Deputy English, on a television programme talking about that.  There are examples in the Department of Education and Skills, both in my time and that of other Ministers, of our being able to build schools.  One allocates money and the school or classrooms or whatever is built in a relatively short time.  There are real issues to be addressed in this regard, and I hope we can get rid of those logjams.<\/p> <p> In the time that is left to me I want to refer to a few other matters.  I agree that student housing is referenced in the strategy but it needs much more specific proposals.  Anything I saw in the plan was, I believe, there already.  On the issue of homelessness, which is very important, I fully support the proposals of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the involvement of the Minister, Deputy Zappone, in supporting children and simple things like transportation.  The cost of travelling was identified, along with the need to get to school, to have preschool facilities and to have the school completion programme available to these young people.  They are extremely vulnerable and protection policies need to be in place to ensure these children are not exposed to any risk.  These measures are very important, but getting the families into homes is the real solution, and that must be the focus.<\/p> <p> I support the Housing First proposals and note that there is a proposal to expand them.  I have some experience of this as well and was at a conference in Limerick two weeks ago on Housing First.  It is about giving people a home, taking them as they are, whether they are addicted to drugs or have mental health issues or whatever, putting them in a home and giving them the wraparound 24-hour support they need to stay in that home.  When it is explained to private landlords that such support is available, that the housing association working with those people will deal with the paying of the rent, and the kinds of supports that are in place, it should be attractive to landlords as well.  It is a model that works and has been shown to work in other parts of the world, so I urge that that programme be supported, continued and expanded.<\/p> <p> There are a large number of measures in the plan.  There is a need for more strategic focus, particularly on the disincentives to construct.  I would like to see a lot more focus on that and on the fact there are nearly 200,000 vacant houses in the country that are not holiday homes.  I suspect that most of those are private because the voids money has brought back into use much of the local authority housing and housing authorities have got quicker at turnover.  We in opposition will work with the Government to deliver on this plan.  However, we want the Minister to listen to the measures proposed by us and by other Opposition parties.<\/p><p>At all costs we must avoid the boom and bust cycle that nearly broke our economy and our society, and that was the basis for the huge problems of housing and homelessness that we have now and which have caused such misery and anxiety for so many of our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900043#QQ00400","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468954800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>There is nothing I would like to believe more than that this plan will deliver.

However, when one looks at the detail of this plan I do not think it will deliver.  That is so, not just because it does not take on board what people like ourselves have been saying since 2011, but also because of what was confirmed by the chairperson of the Housing Finance Agency, Dr. Michelle Norris, this morning.  She summarised what we have been saying for five years and it stands as the most accurate critique of the failure of this plan to get to the kernel of the problem.  Dr. Norris said:<\/p><blockquote>We have become too dependent on the private sector to house low-income households.  If we are going to deliver houses we need in the short term, in my view, local authorities to be introduced to building at a large scale that will involve them having permission to borrow money.<\/blockquote><p>Therefore, local authorities must directly deliver council housing and be given the money to do so themselves.

Those are the vulture funds, the people who bought up land and property and own it.  The most telling confirmation that my assessment of this is right came when I asked the Taoiseach earlier today if he could tell me how many local authority houses would be built under the plan.  He frankly admitted that he could not give me an answer to that question.  It is not in the plan.  I have heard since from journalists, which I presume came from the Minister, and who I suspect, like everybody else, want to believe that this plan is a new departure.  Everybody wants to believe that, while we all wanted to believe that Deputy Alan Kelly's plan was going to change things, but it did not.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach could not answer the question of how many council houses will be built, and neither can this report.  The nearest it gets to answering the question is on page 45 where it states, \"With cooperation and mobilisation by local authorities and AHBs, this Action Plan envisages a significant progressive increase in social housing build activity to over 5,000 ... a year by 2021.\"  Let us read that carefully.  It is not 5,000 a year to 2021.  That would still only amount to 25,000 and it would not all be council because some of it would be from approved housing bodies.  However, the Minister hopes to get up to 5,000 in 2021.  Therefore, of the headline figure of 47,000 social housing units, which sounds good, fewer than 25,000 - in fact, I suspect it is considerably less - will be actual local authority houses.<\/p>  <p>  In the time of the previous Government the housing list went from 96,000 to 140,000 families and households, and although we do not quite know what it is now, it is up by more than 45,000.  If the rate of increase in the housing list continues, we will have a longer council housing list at the end of this plan than we currently have.  That is because at the centre of its strategy, this plan does not envisage local authorities taking advice from the Housing Finance Agency and getting back to direct provision of large-scale local authority housing.  Why are the figures not in it?  Will the Minister tell me how many council houses will be built under this plan?

Why would a private landlord enter into an arrangement with the Minister for a cap of &euro;1,300 when average rents are &euro;1,800?

They will not do it and that is the problem.  Sadly, I do not have time to go into the detail.  As is so often the case, there is a reliance on the private sector and an ideological blindness.  In addition, there is kowtowing to developers who say they cannot make enough profits which is why they will not build and deliver social and affordable housing.

The Minister never listens to anything we have to say, but will he listen to the CEO of NAMA?  He said it is not that housing is unprofitable for private developers, it is just not profitable enough.  Apparently a profit of &euro;20,000 is not enough for them, so the Minister is now proposing to reward them for hoarding and the strike of capital that they have been engaged in.  This time the Minister will give over local authority land.<\/p>  <p>  I will start with the poverty of ambition in this plan.  We hear that this is the biggest investment in yonks.  Deputy Alan Kelly used to tell us the same when he was the Minister.<\/p><p>This would not even bring us to the level of building that obtained in 2007 but, as we know, there is now a waiting list that is a multiple of that number.  In 2007 and 2008 we were building approximately 5,000 local authority or housing association houses and acquisitions and houses provided under Part V stood at approximately 9,000.  This information is available from the bar charts contained in the report, which the Minister can check if he so wishes.  The plan now is to provide 9,000 social houses per annum, which is an incredible paucity of ambition at a time when leprechaun economics indicate we have massive growth rates in this country.<\/p> <p> There is also a poverty of ambition in the context of the 200,000 vacant houses.  From my reading of the plan, 1,600 such houses are to be acquired.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify if that is the case?  Local authorities are to be ordered by the Minister to hand over land to private developers for development, in respect of which trickle-down housing of the order of 25% to 30% is indicated.  Why are we doing this?  According to the Minister for Finance, there is no shortage of money.  There is &euro;5.4 billion available under the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, which could be used for the provision of public housing but we are barred under EU fiscal rules from doing so.  Has the Minister asked the EU for a derogation because of our housing emergency?  Has he had any communication with Brussels on this matter?  According to the report, the Department has, while the housing crisis has been raging, spent two years trying to find a workable off-balance-sheet model to get around this quandary.  We have the land and the labour in the form of our many unemployed construction workers and we also have the money but we are not allowed to provide housing on a public basis.  The solution must involve the private sector and it must be self-financing.  It is capitalism.  It is the neoliberal impediment that is preventing us from resolving our housing crisis.<\/p> <p> I would like now to speak about the ISIF, which has moneys to the tune of &euro;5.4 billion, and NAMA's &euro;2.4 billion in cash reserves.  The total resources of &euro;8 billion of these two entities could be spent on social and affordable housing provision but the State cannot use that money to build housing.  That is the problem.  Let us simplify matters.  The Minister announced approximately ten different schemes today but our inability to use the funds to which I refer is the problem, which is outrageous.  The Minister also announced a new type of housing estate today.  The term \"mixed tenure\" has been used, which is something similar to motherhood and apple pie.  Everyone is in favour of diversity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900045#SS01600","speaker":"1254","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468955400,"counter":401,"content":"<p>They are not, actually.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900046#TT00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1468955400,"counter":402,"content":"<p>We all want to see a different mix of people in estates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900046#TT00300","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1468955400,"counter":403,"content":"<p>There are many people who are against it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900046#TT00400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1468955400,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Deputy Coppinger, without interruption please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900046#TT00500","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1468955400,"counter":405,"content":"<p>The Minister is continually interrupting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900046#TT00600","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1468955400,"counter":406,"content":"<p>Deputy Coppinger keeps putting questions to the Minister.

Some 25% to 30% of the housing on council-owned land will be social housing and 75% will be privately mortgaged or, to use the new term, \"affordable rental\" houses.  What does affordable rental mean?  Perhaps the Minister will clarify if I am correct that it is 70% to 80% of market rent.  The cost of renting in many parts of Dublin is &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,400.  That is not affordable.  That we would call such a level of rent affordable is laughable.  The people in Tyrrelstown who live in houses and not apartments are paying &euro;1,500 per month for small dwellings.  An affordable rent for them under the proposed scheme is not affordable.  We need to raise the eligibility levels for social housing so that people such as bus drivers, etc., can apply for it.  We also need to provide people with affordable mortgages, such as were previously available from the councils.  The mortgage I obtained from Fingal County Council 12 years ago when I was a teacher allowed me to access a house.  We need to give other people that same opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  I received an e-mail last night from a family whose rent is being increased by &euro;100.  While &euro;100 would not be a lot to the Minister, it is to the family in question.  The couple's monthly income - they are both working - is &euro;1,700.  They live in a two bedroom house with their three children and their rent is being increased to &euro;1,200 per month, which will leave &euro;500 per month for five people to live on.  Is there anything in the plan for them?  No, there is not one solution.  What we need is emergency legislation to ban repossessions.  The Committee on Housing and Homelessness recommended a moratorium on repossessions but the Minister did not take that on board.  How many months will it take before it becomes obvious to him that we need rent controls and that the private rented sector is the source of homelessness and poverty?  The Minister plans to entrust 65% of social housing provision to the private rented sector.  This is a hugely expensive way of providing social housing.  We need to return to utilising public land and public funds to build a range of affordable and social housing for people to buy or rent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900046#TT00800","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1468955400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.

We know also that this crisis was brewing for years.  The interventions which could have been made at various stages and which would have made a difference to the situation not escalating or becoming worse were not made.  One significant factor was that local authorities stopped building houses.<\/p>  <p>  We know all the statistics, including that there are over 90,000 people on the social housing waiting list, that the numbers of people in homelessness are rising, that the numbers of those in emergency accommodation are also rising and that the numbers of individuals sleeping rough and the hidden homeless who move from couch to couch are increasing as well.  In addition, many of the people on the housing lists long term are being pushed down those lists because there are more people coming onto them.  We know that demand is exceeding supply.<\/p>  <p>  Having been a member of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness, I know that the solution involves a multifaceted approach.  I acknowledge the wide-ranging consultation in which the committee engaged, including with the Minister.  We are at a point now where we need action rather than words.  What we do not want is actions that will lead to negative consequences later.  One of the key areas is social housing provision so that we can get people out of emergency accommodation and private renting, which is more cost-effective.  When one balances what the Government is spending on emergency accommodation, homelessness and rent supplement versus what it would cost to build social housing and get people back into homes, that to which I refer makes economic sense.  Many individuals and families are putting themselves under immense pressure to get top-ups to meet the cost of rent.  It is essential that we get social housing right.<\/p>  <p>  We know that 10,000 units per year is not enough but if we can deliver on 10,000 real social housing units, it will make a difference.  Lone parents with children, senior citizens, couples and single men who are on the housing lists should benefit from this new build.  For me, success will be the movement in significant numbers of such people into one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom units.  I would like to speak about children because a number of mothers asked me to specifically refer to the devastating physical and mental affects on their children of living in emergency accommodation and the shame they feel when their friends see them going into a hostel or hotel.  I know projects in the north inner city that are accessing counselling for such children.<\/p>  <p>  I tried to read as much of the report as I could this afternoon.  Obviously, I was looking at it from the point of view of the cross-party committee report.  The latter report was pretty well received by those working in housing and homelessness and I did hear some positive reaction to this report.  It is disappointing, however, that some of the committee's recommendations are not included in it.  For example, was the advice of the Attorney General sought on the committee's recommendation for a moratorium on home repossessions?  Will the Minister give an assurance that homeless shelters will not close unless residents have viable alternatives?  Will he similarly provide that hotels that are in NAMA and being used as emergency accommodation cannot be sold until the residents get alternative accommodation?  One of the key pillars of the plan ought to have been around prevention but I do not see any proposals in that regard in the report.  On rent certainty and fixed tenure, I presume the affordable rental sector issue will be addressed in the autumn statement.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, I attended a meeting with Social Justice Ireland on financing for social housing at which it was suggested that we could invoke the structural reform clause in the EU Stability and Growth Pact, which would, it was suggested, provide us with &euro;1 billion in on-balance-sheet funding and, along with that, the off-balance-sheet mechanism of low-cost finance, which we know is available from credit unions and the Housing Finance Agency.<\/p><p> In the case of O'Devaney Gardens, I looked at submissions made to Dublin City Council by residents who live in the area.  They are very much in favour of mixed tenure and want quality housing.  They made an interesting point about the need to define \"affordable\".  Perhaps that issue might be looked at also.<\/p> <p> How much funding will be available to each local authority, particularly those with the longest housing waiting lists such as Dublin City Council?  We suggested one framework.  The Minister is suggesting the housing delivery office and the housing procurement office, but I am anxious to know who the actual driver will be.<\/p> <p> I welcome what the Minister said about mental health and addiction issues, but there is a lack of specific measures to deal with them.  We need timeframes for monitoring, evaluating and implementing measures.  The Minister should come here before Christmas at the latest to give us a rundown on what the actions taken have achieved.  I listened to the response of Brother Kevin Crowley, for whom I have great respect.  He said action was needed and that the time for talk was over.  We need action now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900046#TT01200","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468956000,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I listened to the Taoiseach tell us this morning that the local authorities had not measured up.  He repeated this later using different phraseology.  Let me say Galway City Council has measured up.  It produced a housing report every quarter of every year in which it set out its strategy and identified the land it had zoned for residential purposes.  The accompanying note stated construction had been suspended and that there was no funding available.  That was the position in Galway where I had been since 1999 and left earlier this year. Not a single social house has been constructed since 2009.  There is a housing crisis in Galway because we did not use public land to provide homes with public funds.  I am sickened to the core when I hear Labour Party Members justify this by saying because of the state of the economy we could not afford to build homes.  There is something seriously wrong with our definition of what an economy is if we cannot afford to give people homes and there is something definitely wrong with an economic strategy that does not allow people security with all of the positive benefits it brings.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome some of the measures included in the report such as the strategy for urban and village renewal.  There are 84 recommendations made.  I agree fully with Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Ruth Coppinger that there has been a complete failure to address the fact that a state must provide homes on public lands.  The facts are outlined on page 45 of the report.  The Minister intends to build up to 5,000 houses by 2021.  He cannot possibly provide homes with this strategy at the rate at which the waiting lists are increasing.  What is worse is that he is going to rely on the very market forces that, through repeated Government policy, caused the crisis in the first place.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope the Minister will conclude tonight by acknowledging that there is a national emergency, not because the economy failed but because we failed to use it to provide homes for people.  Each Deputy has an anecdote.  I can say I made representations today on behalf of a family who has been on the waiting list in Galway since 2002.  they are number one on the list.  Galway City Council has responded by stating it is not in a position to tell the family when they will have a house.  Sticking with the position in Galway but making a general point, Dr. P&aacute;draic Kenna of NUI Galway has concluded a piece of Europe research that continued for over two years.  While I hear Deputies ask for a moratorium on house repossessions, with which I agree, Dr. Kenna points to the significant finding of the research that evictions result from increased rents and that such evictions are greater in number than those arising from a failure to pay a mortgage.  The document fails utterly to give security in the rental sector, while its thrust is we have to rely on it.  I am appalled that the Minister thinks we should give public land bought at the highest prices to private companies on which to build to provide social housing rather than the other way round.   The Kenny report has been quoted by the Deputy from the Labour Party.  Successive Governments have refused to act on it.  We have refused to recognise the long-term gain in providing homes for people would spur the economy and lead to a much healthier society and wealthier country.  <\/p>  <p>  We are going to give more money to approved housing bodies, which are unregulated.  In the past few weeks we have come into the Chamber to talk about the unregulated charities sector.

Rome was not built in a day, but it was started.  I accept that it is a start and will not dismiss it out of hand.<\/p>  <p>  I will address the issues that we still need to address.  I do not think the issue of affordability has been dealt with.  We still have a huge problem with how we provide housing and dealing with this issue is a huge challenge.  I am not saying the Minister should be able to sort it out overnight, but as he learns more about it, I hope he will take a stronger line in some areas.  Land-banking is a massive problem within the industry that will stay with us for a while longer.  It does not look as though the funding issue has been addressed either, as I would like it to be.  The EU rules must be challenged.  We are still very much restricted by them and they are stopping us from borrowing cheaply to invest in State housing provision.  <\/p>  <p>  We have discussed the issue of affordability a lot at the housing committee and established that there is a big difference between the cost of providing local authority and private sector housing.  The difference can be up to &euro;100,000, which is an awful lot of money.  We are not providing quite as many social houses as we thought.  My understanding is we were recommending 50,000 local authority new builds, but perhaps I have misinterpreted.  I understand we are looking at a figure of 26,000 local authority new builds.  This represents a missed opportunity.  <\/p>  <p>  In a building regulations blog someone wonders why the Minister did not establish a fund of something under &euro;100 million and buy 50,000 or 60,000 houses to take people out of emergency accommodation.  Investment funds are still buying houses for less than the cost at which we can build them.  Why does the Government not take that position?  <\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party suggested we rebrand NAMA.  I would prefer to abolish it.  I am very concerned that we will expect NAMA to provide 20,000 houses in the next few years.  This is an organisation that looks worse by the day.  It lacks accountability and transparency and has been seriously economical with the truth.  It is dysfunctional.  The Minister might think I am making it up, but I am not.  It is not an organisation on which he should be hanging his coat to help him resolve the housing crisis.  We are going to use land owned by the people, yet nine out of ten units will be available through the private sector and NAMA will be doing deals with developers and investment funds to provide it.  Many of the people in question have actually grown from a dysfunctional property market in Ireland.<\/p><p>Some of their strength is based on ill-gotten gains.  They are people who formerly worked in NAMA and got involved in this area.  People were asking why the private sector is not building and they get a couple of things mixed up.  There is an entity called the builder and an entity called the developer.  The builders are prepared to build, they are able to build and they want to build.  The developer is a different animal.  It is true to say it is not financially attractive enough for him at present.  It is for the builder but not the developer.  One of the main causes of this is that the so-called developers, of which there is now a new, much bigger version, namely, investment funds or vulture funds, are still preoccupied with picking from the carcass of what is left of stressed assets from the failed financial institutions and NAMA.  That is a huge problem for us.  Builders are prepared to build.  They are not saying there is not enough money in it for them.  They cannot get the money.

Homelessness is a deeply unhealthy state.  Many of those on our streets suffer from mental illness combined with drug addiction - a so-called dual diagnosis - but many also have physical illnesses which relate to being on the streets and their drug addiction.  If people have that triple diagnosis, they are in a seriously unhealthy state.  If we are to avoid unnecessary deaths on our streets, we need to address those three issues.  The challenge for this Government is to provide safe, secure and appropriate housing tailored to the individual street homeless person's needs coupled with essential medical, addiction and social support services to ensure that exiting homelessness is sustainable and for the long term.  Those health and support services should be a priority.  There should be linkage between supplying appropriate housing and appropriate services if we are to allow these people to get off our streets.<\/p>  <p>  There are some startling statistics available, including that: 85% of our street homeless people have either a mental illness, a drug addiction or a physical illness; 50% of them abuse drugs as well as having a mental illness; 13% have serious mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder; 33% have self-harmed in the past six months; and 50% are on methadone or taking heroin.  There is an alarming rate of suicide ideation and attempted suicide among these individuals.  It is very difficult to obtain accurate figures on how many people are street homeless in Dublin due to the transient nature of homelessness and the scatter of homelessness around the city.  If one adds the number of rough sleepers, which a recent count indicated was 106, to those who are in night shelters, hostels or treatment centres, the figure rises to over 300.  Estimating the number of homeless in other areas outside Dublin is equally as difficult.  All one has to do is walk up Grafton Street and along St. Stephen's Green towards Baggot Street to see the evidence of street homelessness.  I did so three weeks ago and at around 10.30 p.m. there were 14 people setting up their sleeping bags and cardboard boxes in doorways.  That was in 500 or 600 yards walking around the city.<\/p>  <p>  There are many complex factors that lead to homelessness, including family breakdown, poverty, poor education, unemployment, leaving institutional care, drug addiction, alcohol addiction and mental illness.  There is a disproportionate number of homeless people on our streets who have been in care or in prison.  Foreign nationals make up a significant number of those experiencing homelessness because they lack access to housing entitlements.  There are two broad methods of exiting homelessness.  One is the Housing First model, which has been mentioned extensively in the report.  Housing First offers a homeless person on the street secure accommodation without any barriers or questions.  After they have accepted that they get wraparound services - psychiatric, medical and addiction services - but they are taken off the streets before they get them.  The treatment first model is a staircase model whereby people are offered detoxification, stabilisation and rehabilitation services before they are offered a house or accommodation.  There is a need for both of these models.  There are many variations of these models but the most important part of all of them is providing somebody with secure accommodation.  There is one frightening statistic on those who go into psychiatric hospitals and have delayed discharges.  At the beginning of January, there were 10,000 hospital days accumulated on delayed discharges.  If a hospital bed costs &euro;500 a day, that is &euro;5 million wasted on delayed discharges.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the report to the House.  Increasing the number of Housing First units from 100 to 300 is very important.  There are 50 people already waiting for housing if they could get the accommodation from Housing First.  The lack of accommodation is the critical part.  I wish the Minister every good fortune in implementing the report.  I hope all the other Departments associated with the Minister's initiative can supply what he requires from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900048#VV00500","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1468956600,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I welcome the report and wish the Minister well.  I wish Deputy Bailey well as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, which I look forward to working and engaging with.  I pay tribute to Deputy Harty and others who worked on the interim committee.  I know the work that Deputy Harty put in and he has provided very interesting statistics on foot of his professional experience.  I will talk more generally and about the delivery.<\/p>  <p>  I wish the Minister well.  He is more down to earth and realistic in what he has to do.  We had a previous Minister who announced something every day.  I am talking about Deputy Kelly.  The houses would not fit in Ireland if he had built them all.  Blunder, bluff and bluster was all we got from him.  He would turn sods and design maps but really he did absolutely nothing.  We hear the Labour Party lecturing and telling us what we could do and the Deputies on the left that know everything about building, developers and bankers, but there are very few of them involved in voluntary housing associations or in other aspects of housing.  They should do something rather than telling us all how to do it.<\/p>  <p>  We have a serious housing crisis.  We know that.  I have spoken to the Minister before on this.  I hope he gets involved and gets down and dirty because there are blockages.  I agree with Deputy Wallace.  I do not agree with him a lot of the time.  T&aacute; s&eacute; imithe anois.  I do not know if he was a developer or a builder or a bit of both.  That is his business but some people are confused.  He knows the difference between a developer and a builder.  We cannot denigrate and demonise every builder in the country.  They were the backbone of the economy and they provided great employment.  I am glad that the Seanad agreed a motion earlier tonight to give self-employed people some benefit from PRSI.  They are a decent race of people.  They are not aliens, they do not have horns and they are not monsters.  They are genuine people.  I have worked for many of them and I saw the results.  They want to build and have the capacity to build small schemes of houses and one-off homes for people who want to house themselves if they can get a mortgage.<\/p>  <p>  There are a lot of blockages in the system.  I agree that NAMA is a vehicle.  I said it in this House - from this very seat - on the night NAMA was set up that it was like a wild animal being released in the woods and nobody knew where it would end up.  We do not know now if it is in Austria or Syria or where it is but we know it is a mess.  It is unaccountable and it is not delivering.  I see there are aspirations regarding how many houses it will build and deliver.  We have had that before.  It failed and it is not accountable.  The sooner it is disbanded and the animal is reined in or lassoed and brought down to Puck Fair in Killorglin - he need not be put up at a height, just put him up in pictures - the better, because there will be inquiries and investigations into NAMA in decades or years to come.<\/p>  <p>  There are blockages in respect of planning.  I do not know what has happened to our county councils.  They have suffered cutbacks in funding and staff and they have also lost their way and their will to build houses.<\/p><p> The Census has referred to the number of vacant houses.  Local authorities have a lot of them.  They are boarded up, in some cases for years.  They tell us that they cannot get funding or approval from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department tells us something else.  There should not be such blockages.<\/p> <p> Planning is also an issue.  There are young couples in my area who want to build houses.  I have told the Minister, Deputy Coveney, this previously and I want him to come and see the area.  Lately, I heard from three such couples who had done everything - they got the design, engineers and everything else.  Willing to house themselves, they paid a lot of money.  The planning rules are so restrictive.  There are fiddly issues stopping them and delaying them.  On the other hand, there is lovely zoned land in the town of Cahir and elsewhere which should be developed.  We cannot build any house because there is no access and the planners are afraid to give permission for any more than two or three houses.  As I said, people want to buy houses for different reasons.<\/p> <p> Vulture funds are buying up the houses that borrowers have been evicted from.  There is no coherent message in the plan for those in mortgage distress, and to stop the banks evicting borrowers.  I thought there would be.  There is a mention but nothing cohesive.  We must stop that because we will never deal with the housing crisis if we do not stop mortgage holders being made homeless on a daily basis by the banks.  A whole army has built up around this, with sheriffs, repossession agents and so on.  An industry that has mushroomed out of that is distasteful, dishonest and nasty.  It is terrorising borrowers and that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p> I wish the Minister well and I look forward to working with him.  However, there are blockages, and they are simple ones.  I am glad that the Minister has an overreaching responsibility in planning.  I also am glad to see that something I advocated in my county development plan in Tipperary is being considered.  It concerns shops and village centre places which are empty for five years or less and which will never again be opened as a shop.  In such cases one need not apply for a change of planning and be involved in more preplanning meetings with planners, which one now must wait six weeks for in my county, who will place every obstacle at their disposal to prevent action being taken.  As a result, we will get towns alive again, allow people to come in to live in those places and deal with the housing lists as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900048#VV00600","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468957200,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for getting the ball rolling with this housing strategy.  However, I will not praise the strategy until I see how it works because, as we all know, and as I know having been a member of Kerry County Council for 14 years, the devil is always in the detail and we have to see, as Deputy Mattie McGrath stated, how the blockages that we have been dealing with over the past number of years will be dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  The first pledge is to address homelessness.  I have been told that in regard to Dublin, the making illegal of bed-sits has contributed greatly to the number of homeless sleeping on the streets.  Maybe the Minister should look at how that could be overlooked or changed for the time being until we have more housing stock available.<\/p>  <p>  In the past six years, Kerry County Council has built three houses but, unlike the Taoiseach and the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, I do not blame the local authorities.  Since early 2015, when Deputy Kelly made an announcement that we had &euro;62.5 million in Kerry for housing, there has been no house built yet because there has been blockages with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government dealing with the applications for the social housing in places such as Killarney and Tralee.  Thirty houses were to have been built in the summer of 2015 but to date there is no house built because there were four stages of approval demanded by the Department.  Those four stages seem to go on forever.  That is where I am asking the Minister to get involved and provide the staff, and ensure that the staff deal with the issues because there should only be one model for local authorities to deal with in respect of each type of housing.  Whether it is a one bedroom, two bedroom, three bedroom, four bedroom or five bedroom house, there should be one model for the country.  The current situation has been causing unreal delays in getting 30 houses built in Kerry.  I ask the Minister to address that aspect.<\/p>  <p>  If we are to provide more housing, we need more staff.  As I understand it, even at present there is an embargo on local authorities getting staff.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, are shaking their heads.  I know the blockages are still there because I deal with them every day.  I go to Kerry County Council at least once a week, every Monday.  I know what is happening there.  There are still blockages.  They do not have the additional staff.  It was disingenuous of the Taoiseach to criticise the local authorities and lay the blame at their doorstep because they are not to blame.  I can tell the Taoiseach - I will make no bones about it - I will be more critical of him than his own party colleague, Deputy Griffin, if this does not work or if he does not put his shoulder to the wheel and ensure that it does.<\/p>  <p>  On the pledge to increase speed of delivery of social housing, I hope that this process will be streamlined and, as I stated, more staff will be put in place.  On the pledge to increase the output of private housing to meet demand, the private builders tell me they cannot access funding or capital at present to build the houses and that when they do, they are charged an interest rate of 12%.  They cannot work with that because, they tell me, in a &euro;180,000 house they will only have a &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 profit.  They cannot take all of the responsibility and deal with all of the liabilities for that little gain.  Something has to be done with the banks that we are supposed to own.<\/p>  <p>  On the pledge to utilise existing housing, I highlighted this at meetings of Kerry County Council which owns many such houses.  When we were working on a programme for Government, I insisted that we look at these vacant properties to see if they could be brought up to scratch.  I welcome this, if it can be made work.  It involves a lot of work, if one gives a loan to the house owner or landlord and hopes to get back the rent after five years or whatever, but it is a laudable exercise.  I ask the Minister to put extra effort into that.  I hope he will do so because there are a lot of houses vacant in my county.  I even know of one house in a prominent place in a street in the heart of Killarney which, they tell me, is vacant for 70 years.<\/p>  <p>  I wish the Minister all the best with this housing strategy.  He will have to get stuck in.  Many commentators say we will have holidays but I do not anticipate that the Minister will take a holiday this summer because there is a lot of work to be done.<\/p>  <p>  I have one other issue to raise.  In County Kerry, the former national roads authority, NRA or, as it is now being called, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has deprived three couples of getting planning permission exiting onto a national secondary route.  This is very unfair.  Whatever regulations they are going by now were signed into law by the then Minister of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, in 2012.  I ask that the Minister look into that because it is depriving many in our county of access.  All they are asking for is planning permission and they are being deprived of it by this one rule by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and TII.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900049#WW00200","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1468957200,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I gave Deputy Danny Healy-Rae the extra few seconds for the mistake I made earlier, and I apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900049#WW00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1468957200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900049#WW00400","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1468957200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I welcome today's action plan for housing and homelessness.  We all will agree it is long overdue.  In the previous D&aacute;il, many of us could see that there was a housing infrastructure deficit.  In my own area, I began to see functioning families at risk of becoming homeless in the period 2012-13 because there was a big construction projection, which was welcome at the time but which exposed a significant deficit.  At that stage, we were seeing families - I had some in my area - that were sleeping in cars.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the term of the previous Government, there was an inability to listen, even to practical steps that were proposed.  The committee of which I was a member, the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, invited all the housing agencies to hearings in early 2013.  Even at that point, we made a proposal that European Investment Bank funding would be leveraged.  It is disappointing that much of that advice was not taken up.  Therefore, it is a crisis that partly could have been avoided.<\/p>  <p>  I have briefly gone through the 117 pages of the document and I will devote a good deal more time over the summer to get more familiar with it.  Certainly, the detail of some of the initiatives will need to be discussed further by us.<\/p><p>The Social Democrats published a housing document and there is a section included in our manifesto.  We are very happy to see some aspects of what has emerged today.  We sought the establishment of a housing delivery agency and I note that there is a procurement section devoted to local authorities in the Minister's Department.  We will wait to see how it works, but it certainly has possibilities.  The idea that a housing agency can have a procurement function is important, although it is not quite what we sought.  The procurement aspect is important.<\/p> <p> A couple of years ago we spoke about &euro;3.1 billion being available like monopoly money.  It was trotted out time and again, but it did not deliver a result.  We cannot have the figure of &euro;5.33 billion doing the same rounds; it must be more than just a figure that is spoken about.  There must be practical action.  There are some practical measures included in the document and it will be important for us to see how they play out.<\/p> <p> There is a language issue.  I heard it on the news again tonight that there will be the delivery of 47,000 houses.  Those on the periphery will presume this means the building of 47,000 houses, but, of course, that is not what it means.  It is very important that we say what will happen.

I have some concerns about the bypassing of the planning system in the way proposed.  I recognise that there is a crisis, but in bypassing a system, a process can be made more expensive and difficult, as in the making of submissions.  Sometimes submissions are full of good ideas.  I am concerned that we could potentially lose out on good conditions that could be attached to planning permission as a result.  I am also concerned that we may be circumventing the Aarhus Convention, as people are entitled to be consulted and have a role in the process of deciding on environmental issues in an area.<\/p>  <p>  One of the issues we have included in our housing document, which we have brought to the Minister's attention on a number of occasions, is the favoured mixture of tenure and size, with scaling for value when the amount of houses built can reduce the cost.  It appears that this is the case in what has been proposed.  It is the approach that should be taken, but the only concern I have is the amount to be paid for sites by the private sector.  That income will be important to build other local authority houses in other areas or to provide for the involvement of tier 3 housing associations.  There are some tier 3 housing associations in my area and although there are some minor criticisms about cherry-picking, housing of a very good standard has been delivered by some of the larger organisations or associations.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the Central Statistics Office indicated the sheer scale of vacant units.  I accept the point made by the Minister - I have made it also - that all of these vacant units are not in the right place or perhaps in high-demand areas.  Nevertheless, there are many in high-demand areas and they could be released in Dublin.  We should not confuse them with local authority voids, as very often people confuse one with the other.  These vacant units tend to be available in the private sector and it is a question of putting imaginative schemes in place.  I noted that a number of initiatives were identified in the report and hope they will help to free some of these units.  For every 1% of vacancies in the Dublin area, we could release approximately 5,000 units.  They may well be suitable as student accommodation or not suitable for families, but the knock-on effect would be to release other units.  I will wait to see how some of the initiatives play out, but it is important that this aspect be addressed.  It is addressed to some degree in the report, but we will see how it works in practice.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of other issues.  For example, there appears to be a reliance on the HAP scheme.  I found it difficult in some respects in my area and it does not add to the supply.  It is not a particularly sustainable approach in the longer term as we keep having to pump money into something that must be renewed over time.  It is useful as a short-term initiative, but it is not a solution in the longer term.  One cannot avoid the prospect of having to build a sizable number of houses into the future, probably every year for the next ten or 15 years.<\/p>  <p>  The mortgage-to-rent schemes are torturous and I have dealt with a few of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900050#XX00700","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1468957800,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900050#XX00800","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1468957800,"counter":437,"content":"<p>We must get to grips with them if we are to get them to work.  It is a very good idea if it can be made to work as there would be the least amount of disruption for a family while the equity issue was being dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  There are measures relating to starter homes that are likely to be included in the budget.  There are families still in what could be described as starter homes who may be inappropriately housed.  For example, a family with two or three kids may be living in a two-bedroom apartment on the third or fourth floor.  That group are trapped, although their housing needs appear to have been met.  That group will have to be considered in the not too distant future as their living environment is not sustainable.  There would be resentment if they were not given some way to move on from that accommodation to something more suitable.<\/p>  <p>  There are also issues where people were victims of timing.  There was a period - 2009 and 2010 - during which a group of first-time buyers were excluded from mortgage interest relief, while others who purchased either side of those years were included in the scheme.  In fairness, that issue should be examined as some of the people involved may be inappropriately housed also.  It just does not make sense that others who purchased either side of that period can avail of mortgage interest relief.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister was correct to start the document with the section on homelessness which must be the number one priority.  We all recognise the most recent escalation of homelessness primarily involved functioning families.  I attended the briefing this afternoon, at which I heard the Minister's speech and noted the point about the Housing First approach.  It is absolutely the right way to go, offering services and a sustainable approach into the future.<\/p><p>The one thing we should not do is end up in 20 years time with people saying, \"We know there was a housing crisis, we can document how it came about, but they made mistakes then that we are trying to undo\".  Some of what I see here is attempting to get a more balanced type of housing delivery that will allow people to downsize when they are older and may need less accommodation and that younger people who need less accommodation can move to a different size of accommodation when they have a larger family.<\/p> <p> The different types of tenure are important and I noted that the Minister will revisit the issue of long-term rentals later in the year.  That type of tenure is delivered in other countries and people find the arrangement satisfactory.  There is no reason a portion of our housing stock should not fall into that category.  We need to get used to the idea of changing our mindset, which is that it is in some way unsatisfactory if one does not own one's home.  It is a viable type of tenure as long as people can see it as their home rather than someone else's property that they are renting short term and running the risk of having to move on and, therefore, do not develop roots in their communities, etc.  As long as there is that kind of security, it is a viable type of tenure and one deserving a good deal more effort.  However, the Minister will address it later in the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900050#XX00900","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance: Motion [Private Members]","time":1468958400,"counter":439,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900051#YY00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1468958400,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>&ldquo;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>notes:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the inappropriate and burdensome full financial audit of the entire household and all its expenses as the sole route for a seriously ill child or a child with a disability to apply for a medical card;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the onerous application process, the exclusive focus on 'financial hardship' and the failure to take account of medical need and the impact of a serious medical condition on a child and their family in the application for a medical card that currently exists;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility - the Keane report - concluded that it would be neither possible nor ethical to produce a list of medical conditions on which to base automatic entitlement to a medical card and that 'a listing approach risks inequity by diagnosis and a further fragmentation of services';<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the Keane report recommended that the development of a more compassionate medical card system, which accommodates those with significant illness and disability, should be used as a 'stepping stone' to the implementation of the first phase of free GP care for all; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Department of Social Protection's domiciliary care allowance scheme provides an example of an assessment model on which a new medical card eligibility test could be based, in that it is independent of both financial means and diagnosis titles; rather, eligibility is based on reaching a threshold of care needs;<br \/><br \/>acknowledges that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; several campaigns, including the Our Children's Health campaign, were launched by families impacted by illness and disability who have first-hand experience of the struggle to secure and retain medical cards for their children; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the programme for Government states 'we will extend the entitlement to a medical card for all children in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance in Budget 2017.

I would also like to thank sincerely all the Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, across the House, who have put their names to this motion.  This is not just a Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  It transcends parties and politics.<\/p><p>It is important that, as we rise for the summer recess, we remember that for thousands of families across the State there is no respite.  They have sick children who need care and access to services.  They battle every day for their children and, sadly, most of their battles are with the State.  I think we all agree that that is fundamentally  wrong.  However, today I hope we can move to lifting one of the greatest hurdles these families are facing, access to medical cards.<\/p><p>What sort of system tells a parent of a young child with a disability or an illness that the granting or continuation of a child's medical card depends on the parents' jumping through bureaucratic hoops to prove they do not earn too much?  Access to quality health care should be a right and not a concession to be granted or withheld by any Government, Minister or civil servant. <\/p><p>Let me tell the House about R&eacute;alt&iacute;n.  According to her nurse, R&eacute;alt&iacute;n has had a particularly fragile start in life.  Her mam has given me permission to use her name here tonight but it gives me no pleasure to have to share this story.  Her nurse wrote in a letter:<\/p><blockquote>This little girl has had a particularly fragile start in life and while she has hopefully come through very difficult surgeries for Duodenal Atresia and complex heart surgery, she has Downs Syndrome and [she] has recently been diagnosed as deaf and may require implants in the future.<br \/><br \/>She requires [a] CPAP [machine] at night for sleep apnoea [and] has significant developmental delay.  Her road ahead remains very challenging and securing a Medical Card for her would certainly relieve some pressure for [her] family.<br \/><br \/>Needless to say, Reilitin&rsquo;s parents, were very disappointed when Reilitin&rsquo;s card was refused and [they] cannot understand why discretion was not applied to their daughters case.<\/blockquote><p>A further communication from her nurse tells us that she was informed that R&eacute;alt&iacute;n's continuous positive airway pressure, CPAP, machine is not covered by her long-term illness card.  This has just added more stress for this family.  The nurse describes R&eacute;alt&iacute;n as a very deserving little girl and I do not think anyone would disagree with this, yet her medical card was not granted.  We should not have to legislate for compassion but R&eacute;alt&iacute;n's case proves that this is indeed what we must do.  I, therefore, ask the Minister if he thinks it is right or fair that this deserving little girl has to wait.  We do not think it is and the Teachtai Dala who have co-signed this motion do not think she should wait either.  We need to end the two-tier health care system and we need to move towards a system where every person who needs health care will have that need met.<\/p><p>I firmly believe that no Deputy in this House would disagree that children with a terminal or a life-limiting illness should have access to health care and adequate personal support irrespective of means.  The public would be behind us.  Anyone who has been through the medical card application process or who knows someone that has would tell us, as legislators, to simply do whatever is necessary.  They would say we should forget about getting P45s, P60s, PAYE balancing statements, bank statements and evidence of mortgage payments and social welfare searches, etc.  They would say that once a person's illness or disability has been confirmed and a medical need established the State should do all in its power to help and support that person and his or her family.  There should be no means tests, financial audit or, as the expert group under its terms of reference were initially examining, a list of specified medical conditions.  We believe that access to a medical card should be on the basis of medical need only.<\/p><p>We need to move to a system that shows due respect and compassion, taking fully into account not only incomes, but the burdens imposed by medical conditions, illnesses and disabilities.  We must see an end to the disturbing and insensitive practice of the requirement for those with life-limiting illnesses and permanent disabilities to respond to review after review, despite the ongoing progression of their illness and the reality that there will never be a recovery for them.  Some people with terminal illnesses cannot get medical cards.  There is no such thing as recovering from a terminal illness.<\/p><p>For those of us who are fortunate to have good health or for whom there are no caring responsibilities, the importance of a medical card cannot be fathomed in terms of quality of living and quality of care.  First, it meets the costs of visits to the GP, medication, aids and appliances.  Whether it is one's own diagnosis or that of a child or a loved one, being dealt the blow that one needs a range of aids or medicines to deal with it, as well as the illness or disability itself, can and does cause grave hardship.  When a person's household is just over the income threshold, or just straddling it, and thus unable to get a medical card, getting access to these can be next to near impossible.  I spoke to one family for whom two pieces of critical equipment for their child was the equivalent of the full year's carer&rsquo;s allowance payment one parent was receiving.They were over the income threshold for the medical card as a household.  This is not right.<\/p><p>Second, the medical card is a passport to gaining automatic access to a range of community based and primary care services.  This is a particularly challenging position to be in if one has a complex condition requiring ongoing multi-disciplinary support in the community.  A number of studies have found that people suffering from an illness or a disability are more likely to fall into poverty than people in good health or who have debt problems due to health care costs.  This is not the kind of Ireland that I think any of us want to live in.  We should support vulnerable people and not exacerbate their vulnerabilities and hardship.<\/p><p>If the intention is to move to universal health care where access is based on need and not ability to pay and to remove the inequalities associated with that, it is right that people with disabilities, chronic conditions and distinct medical need are put to the fore of this plan.  Our first step concerns the 10,000 medical cards for sick children.<\/p><p>Then we must legislate for a distinct, new, medical need ground for eligibility for the medical card with an associated application route, using the DCA assessment framework as a model, an assessment involving the establishment of a threshold of medical need and not tested against a household's financial means or against diagnosis titles.  We must legislate for this.  Reviewing previous Committee of Public Accounts deliberations on the issue, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Secretary General and the HSE are very clear.  A system whereby qualification for a medical card is on the basis of medical need alone can only be given effect by a change in the legislation, not by a change in the administration of the scheme by the .<br\/><br\/>The Minister knows from his meeting with Our Children's Health that, for these worn-out parents, the medical card process is torture in slow motion, with constant form filling, endless reviews, rejection and appeals.  For those who may get the medical card, discretionary or otherwise, which is a child's passport to the basic care plan, there is no relief.  There is still the endless worry and anxiety.  There is always another application and they are always waiting for the next review.<br\/><br\/>I know that the Minister, Deputy Harris, has issued a press release following our announcement of this motion, confirming that it is his intention to bring forward the legislation.  Getting down to the practicalities, when do we envisage that those 10,000 children will see the benefit of this change?  This, for many children, is very much a life and death issue and it cannot be long-fingered.  If the Minister does not intend to announce the measure until budget day, when will the legislation be presented to the House?  Looking at the swathes of support for this motion, I do not see any opposition to the legislation so its passage is going to be easy.  We are on board already and want it to happen.  If the Minister brings forward the legislation we will support it.  The families need a timeframe and to know when the medical card eligibility criteria will be changed.  They need certainty and the Minister should give us the certainty of a date by which the legislation will be enacted.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the Government's commitment but this group has had many false dawns.  There is a track record of broken promises to these people and we should not waste any opportunity to give them the certainty they need.  We will press the Minister and the Minister of State tonight to give us a date and to give the families who are watching in the Gallery and at home what they need.  They cannot take another broken promise and need to know when the criteria will be changed.  The Minister has support for the legislation.  We have drafted it already and have attempted to table it.  We can do this and we should make it a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900051#YY01000","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468959000,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Severely sick and disabled children in this country have been grossly neglected for many years.  Parents and families of these children have put in a lot of time and energy fighting to ensure that their young sick child has the right to a medical card.  It is totally unacceptable and plain wrong to put any parent or family through such an ordeal when all they want to do is simply care for their child, not fight a system that refuses to recognise their plight and distress.<\/p><p>I welcome the parents who are here this evening and the representatives of the Our Children's Health campaign.  Our Children's Health campaign was launched in May 2014 by families impacted by illness and disability who have first-hand experience of the struggle to secure and retain medical cards for their children.  Its primary aim is,&quot;to ensure children with serious medical need are no longer subjected to the crude, unfair, lengthy and frustrating means test in order to be considered for a medical card&quot;.  The campaign has condemned the onerous application process, the exclusive focus on financial hardship and the failure to take account of medical need and the impact of a serious medical condition on a child and their family.  Our Children's Health has argued:<\/p><blockquote>We cannot continue to have a situation whereby children with the most serious medical need coming from ordinary families with modest incomes and huge outgoings remain ineligible.  This is simply wrong and unjustifiable.<\/blockquote><p>It is high time that medical cards were granted to every child with a serious illness or disability.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the Department of Social Protection's domiciliary care allowance scheme provides an example of an assessment model on which a new medical card eligibility test could be based, in that it is independent of both financial means and diagnosis titles.  Rather, eligibility is based on reaching a threshold of care needs.<\/p><p>I acknowledge and welcome the fact that last week the Minister, Deputy Harris, met with Our Children's Health and committed to the automatic provision of medical cards to very sick children.  It has been suggested, however, that this may not happen until 2017.  That is too far away.  This should happen now, as a matter of urgency.  Let us not let any parent of a severely disabled or sick child have to worry a day more about their child's health needs.  I repeat, we must act now.<\/p><p>The extension of an automatic medical card to all children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance is only a stepping stone, albeit a very important one.  Inequality is rife throughout the health system.  Some pay more than others for the same care.  Families in one part of the country get access to necessary services denied to those in a different region.  The less well off die younger and live less healthy lives.  The diminishing minority who can afford private health insurance get to jump the queue.  Sinn F&eacute;in is the only party with a costed, credible plan for health.  We would increase investment in the health system and use &euro;3.3 billion of the money available to end the two-tier public-private system and deliver a new universal public health system for Ireland.  Such a comprehensive system will not be achieved overnight but a beginning must be made and that requires political will and a fundamental change in the direction of policy, away from the current two-tier and increasingly privatised system.  Ireland is the only EU health system that does not provide universal access to primary care.  Free GP care should be available to the entire population.  We are committed to the realisation of a world-class system of universal health care, accessed on the basis of need, free at the point of delivery and funded by progressive taxation in the Irish State.<\/p><p>I have no doubt but that every single Deputy in this House has been approached by a concerned parent of one of these children with a severe illness or disability who is at their wits' end trying to secure a medical card.  Today, we have an opportunity to bring to a halt the distressing and cruel process that these families must go through.  Let us get that ball rolling and ensure that those young children will have the automatic entitlement to a medical card that they are so deservedly entitled to.

According to the last annual report of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, 1,258 applications for domiciliary care allowance were appealed, with only 313 given a revised decision.  In the context of the number of people who would apply for it, that is a substantial number.  Anecdotally, I am aware that many families must go through a long and difficult process.  Deputy O'Reilly referred to having to battle the State every step of the way to get this payment processed.  In that context, it is worth recalling that to qualify a child must be deemed to have a disability so severe that the child requires care and attention substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  That is a very high threshold.  Many families have to go down the appeals route, which is a further hardship for parents who have been already seriously overburdened and put under pressure.  That is a matter that needs to be resolved.  I ask the Minister to take that up with the Minister for Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of this policy, I am encouraged that the Minister intends to support the motion, which is a vitally important step that needs to be progressed urgently.  That being the case, the point Deputy O'Reilly made about this being available without a means test and immune from changes to household finances is crucially important.

I have been convinced by the people who are in the Gallery tonight.  I have been convinced by the parents of children who are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, the parents I have met in my own constituency, the parents of children with autism, among other conditions, whom I have worked with for many years.<\/p>  <p>  In fact, on my way into what I think was my second Cabinet meeting, I spoke with Mark, who joins us here this evening, one of the Our Children&rsquo;s Health campaigners, outside Government Buildings.  On that occasion I took the opportunity to make very clear to Mark that this was a priority for Government and would be dealt with in the forthcoming budget.  Many of us, as public representatives, have been struck by the practical challenges, as outlined by Deputy O'Reilly and others, that parents face in meeting the needs of their child with a severe disability.<\/p>  <p>  As we discussed the issue that day, I came to further understand that, for many of these parents, meeting their child&rsquo;s needs was the first time they had sought assistance from the State.  The process of providing family financial information, expert or medical reports, and additional supporting information was and is a real burden on these parents when they were only seeking a medical card for their child.  I am very clear that a core objective of the Government is to use the strengthening economy to make life better for the Irish people, and this is one such area.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has committed to this significant improvement to the medical card system for a number of reasons.  First, about one third of DCA children do not hold a medical card.  Therefore, about 11,000 more children with a severe disability will qualify for a medical card under this measure.  Second, in future, all 33,000 DCA children will automatically qualify for a medical card.  Therefore, those children will not be subject to the medical card means test at any point in the future.  Finally, the requirement to go through the medical card assessment process will be removed for about 30,000 families looking after a child with a severe disability.  Those families will no longer need to complete a means test application form for their child and support that with expert reports and other additional information in order for their child&rsquo;s case to be considered.  Instead, mothers and fathers will be able focus on their primary objective of providing care and support to their child.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, I held a meeting in the Department of Health with representatives of Our Children&rsquo;s Health.  At that meeting, I reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment in its programme to providing medical cards to all children who qualify for the domiciliary care allowance.  I confirmed that this commitment was a priority for me and the Government in the upcoming budget discussions and that my objective was to have legislation to enable it follow quickly after the required resources have been secured.  I discussed at that meeting, and I believe there is cross-party agreement on this, the importance of doing this by legislation so that it makes it very difficult to be undone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900053#AAA00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1468959600,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I am glad the Minister realises that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900053#AAA00600","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1468959600,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I am only ten weeks in the job, Deputy, and I am about to do it.<\/p>  <p>  It is fair to say that all assessment systems have some limitations.  It is probably practically impossible for a single assessment system to take account of all individual circumstances.  If one tried with the best will in the world, it would probably become incredibly complex.  While it is important that we acknowledge the limitations of the existing eligibility framework, it is also necessary to recognise the potential for improvements that we can make.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that the recently established Committee on the Future of Healthcare will play a key role in this regard.  It was set up to achieve cross-party consensus on a single, long-term vision for health care and the direction of health policy in Ireland, and to make recommendations to this House within six months.  I firmly believe that the health service will benefit greatly from a single unifying vision that we can all get behind.  A long-term vision, built on a cross-party or even a social consensus, can help to drive reform and development of the system over the next ten years.<\/p>  <p>  I am genuinely excited that this new D&aacute;il has come together with the aim of achieving long-term consensus on the fundamental principles of health policy.  In striving for the optimal single-tier health service for Ireland, there are inevitable policy trade-offs to be confronted.  These trade-offs often involve tensions between efficiency and equity or between comprehensiveness and cost control. In all countries, not just Ireland, the trade-offs centre around three basic dimensions of the health service which must be confronted when designing a health service: the proportion of the population to be covered; the range of services to be covered; and the proportion of the total costs to be met.<\/p>  <p>  On the specific issue before us, Deputies may be aware that the domiciliary care allowance is administered by my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.  It is a monthly payment for a child with a severe disability, aged under 16 years, who requires ongoing care and attention substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.<\/p>  <p>  I accept, as others, including Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, have said, that the DCA measure is not the perfect solution to our health eligibility framework.  The latest available data indicate that about 33,000 children qualify for the DCA.  By comparison, about 390,000 children under the age of 16 years currently qualify for the medical card.  The DCA is not based on a type of disability or the medical need of a child.  Under the legislation, it is based on how much extra care and attention a child needs because of it.  The DCA also has a range of qualifying criteria.  These include the disability being likely to last for at least one year, that the parent is providing the care to the child, that the child resides at home, and that the child meets the medical criteria of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, I visited the Health Service Executive's national medical card unit, which administers the general medical services scheme.  Its functions include the processing of medical card applications.  It was established in 2011 as part of the HSE&rsquo;s primary care reimbursement service.  I acknowledge the hard work of the staff I met.  I know that they are committed to ensuring that anyone who is eligible for a medical card under the existing legislation receives their card, and that the system operates in a streamlined way.  The medical card unit provides a single uniform system for medical card applications and renewals, replacing the different systems previously operated in local health offices.  This ensures that people are treated in a similar manner irrespective of where they live.<\/p>  <p>  The scale of the operations of the national medical card unit is enormous.  In 2015 alone, the medical card unit processed almost 400,000 cases.<\/p><p>These included 107,000 applications and 92,000 full reviews of medical card and GP visit card eligibility as well as over 195,000 self-assessment reviews of eligibility.<\/p> <p> Currently there are over 1.7 million people registered with a medical card and a further 450,000 people registered with a GP visit card.  Under the existing health legislation the standard assessment for a medical card is based on the combined income of the applicant and spouse, or partner, if any, after tax, PRSI and USC have been deducted.  In addition a further allowance is made for the costs of rent or mortgage, for the costs of travelling to and from work and the costs of child care that a family might face.  In the assessment process the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though the applicant's means exceed the relevant threshold.<\/p> <p> Deputies may be aware of a major report in 2014 by an expert panel on medical need for medical card eligibility which was chaired by Professor Frank Keane.  The Keane report recommended that a person's means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  Nonetheless, it is absolutely clear that there are people, including children, with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a much more straightforward manner.  On foot of the Keane report, the HSE established the clinical advisory group on medical card eligibility.  This group is to develop a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease and appropriate operational guidelines for the medical card scheme.  The membership of the clinical advisory group includes clinical experts from specialist services and professions and, importantly, patient representatives.  The group reports to the national director of primary care on a quarterly basis.  It is expected that the group will make a report when it has completed its work in the near future.<\/p> <p> As a result of the range of improvements implemented by the HSE on foot of the Keane report, the HSE is exercising greater discretion.  There are now over 106,000 discretionary medical cards.  This is the highest number of discretionary medical cards on record in the history of the State.<\/p> <p> I shall conclude by saying that more needs to be done.  I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to provide medical cards to all children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and is a priority for me in budget 2017.  I am privileged to have become Minister for Health at a time when we are in a period of reinvestment in the health services, which gives me the opportunity to address some immediate issues such as this.  I will act and we will act, as I hope will all Members, with a sense of urgency.  The money will be put in place in the budget in October and we will move forward with the legislation.  There are parents currently sitting in the public gallery.  These, and the parents of 11,000 other children, will receive an automatic entitlement to a medical card early in 2017.  That is acting immediately and urgently.  We must all move together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900053#AAA00700","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1468960200,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.

This was a specific proposal Fianna F&aacute;il had in its manifesto and I am quite sure it was part of the manifestos of all the main parties.  I am glad that for once we can stand here as a group to deliver on a commitment we made to one of the most vulnerable sections of our society.<\/p>  <p>  Access to a medical card for children who have a serious illness or condition is a fundamental requirement and is important to the families.  I welcome to the Gallery tonight the group from Our Children's Health and parents of children who have disabilities.  While welcoming the good news I hope in future that basic fundamental requirements such as this could happen without the need for sustained campaigns from groups, families and political parties, when it is blatantly obvious that it should have been done a long time ago.  The parents work so hard in dealing with their children who have disabilities and their time would be far better spent looking after their loved ones rather than campaigning on such difficult issues.  I hope it is a lesson for us all.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to other issues affecting children with profound disabilities, it is concerning that when those children become adults the level of care and available budget are just not sufficient.  I met a mother last weekend in my clinic.  She has a 19 year old son with a severe and profound disability.  Before he turned 18 years of age he had received respite care once a week.  This service stopped as soon as he turned 18.  There was no adult respite care available.  Unfortunately his mother became exceptionally unwell last year and at one stage was at death's door.  She was advised to spend at least two months recuperating.  After nine days in hospital she had to return home to assist her husband in looking after their 19 year old son who has a profound disability because they could not get respite care.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, and the Minister of Health, Deputy Harris, would ring fence specific funding to assist young adults and people with profound disabilities to get respite care.  It is an important call as an additional support to help these people.<\/p>  <p>  Cancer patients could also benefit from automatic medical cards.  This year some 30,000 people will hear the words \"You have cancer\".  Once a patient is diagnosed his or her life changes beyond belief and the last thing that person needs is to go through the arduous process of applying for a medical card.  Once a consultant confirms that a patient has cancer, a letter presented to the HSE should automatically entitle that person to a medical card for at least 12 months.  During that intervening period any paperwork that is necessary can then be put together.  As a practising pharmacist who deals with patients daily I assure the House that once a cancer patient is diagnosed they need to concentrate all their time and effort on getting better.  They can get better, but having to worry about the costs of medication and GP visits and so on is something they should not be burdened with.  As the Minister is aware, once a person is diagnosed with cancer their ability to work and earn changes fundamentally.  An automatic medical card would go a long way towards easing the burden and towards helping the patients recover.<\/p>  <p>  If we are to bring these fundamental changes to our medical card system, general practitioners are the one key group we must bring with us in this process.  While we would all love a universal GP system with visits free for everybody - we will work towards that - it is not going to happen overnight.  The process is going to happen over years.  However, for the 10,000 people the Minister is bringing on board this evening, and for the cancer patients whom I hope the Minister will also look to bringing in to automatic eligibility in the near future, we also need the GPs to be properly resourced and fully supportive of our proposals so they can carry out their work.  Many well qualified doctors are leaving the State because the necessary supports to allow them to practice and carry out their business professionally do not exist.  Rural areas are losing GPs on a regular basis because of lack of supports.  I urge the Minister to consider, in working towards universal GP care, that we bring this important group with us and that every decision we make is made in consultation and in agreement with them.<\/p>  <p>  It is really good news to hear that the domiciliary care allowance recipients will avail of the cards easily and seamlessly.  It is a welcome measure and we can be proud of it.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to making this happen quickly.  I also welcome the Sinn F&eacute;in motion in allowing Deputies to discuss the matter in the House.  For once we can be proud of the commitments that have been made in the Chamber and that we, as a political body, have kept them and can stand over them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900054#BBB00400","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1468960200,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I invite Deputy Eamon Scanlon to speak and I ask him to note that there is over 30 minutes remaining for the three speakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900054#BBB00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1468960200,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal to ensure the provision of a full medical card for every child in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  During the last D&aacute;il this party was to the forefront in highlighting the Government's targeting of people on discretionary medical cards before the election.<\/p><p>We committed to ensuring a medical card for all children whose carer was in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  The Fine Gael and Labour Party Government promised people with disabilities that they would be the Government's number one social justice priority.  I am glad to say the Minister has tonight confirmed that that is the case.<\/p> <p> It is truly regrettable that thousands of families had their medical cards withdrawn, causing untold misery and hardship.  They were families who had assumed they would always receive that care.  I recall many children with serious medical needs who required substantial daily care having their discretionary medical cards revoked.  For two years the then Government denied that there was a deliberate policy to cut the number of discretionary medical cards.  There are approximately 10,000 children who, I believe, thanks to the announcement made tonight, will receive a medical card which they truly deserve.  The Minister&rsquo;s announcement of the allocation of &euro;20 million is welcome and I ask that the money be made available immediately, without having to wait for the budget which will be announced near the end of the year.  The money should be made available now to take the burden off these families.  <\/p> <p> The campaign group Our Children&rsquo;s Health established in 2014 by Kevin Shortall and Peter Fitzpatrick must be commended for its tireless campaigning for better access to medical cards for sick children.  It remains imperative that we establish a flexible assessment regime for discretionary medical cards in order that the financial burden people with a serious illness or disabilities are forced to endure will be lifted.  Fianna F&aacute;il made it a provision in the confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael that the more humane system for discretionary medical cards it had suggested in the run-up to the general election be fully maintained.  Fianna F&aacute;il does not believe in a two-tier health system.  We are committed to creating a more inclusive society and dismantling barriers that prevent people with disabilities from participating in society. <\/p> <p> Deputy Joe O'Reilly mentioned C-PAP machines.  I have been using one of them for the past 15 years.  I hired it initially for &euro;70 a week.  After seven or eight months I bought it at a cost of approximately &euro;1,600.  The Department of Health is paying &euro;86 a month to lease one of these machines, which works out at nearly &euro;1,100 a year.  Approximately five weeks ago I purchased a new machine with a mask for &euro;750.  The machines have come down in price and are available.  I suggest to the Government - I am glad tha an official is present - that it is being ripped off in leasing these machines.  What was costing &euro;1,070 to lease or rent can be bought for &euro;750.  Anyone who needs one of these machines really needs it.  I would not be here tonight but for it.  They are crucial to those who need them.  This issue should be examined because I imagine millions of euro is being lost as a result of what is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900054#BBB00600","speaker":"1344","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468960800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the motion and the fact that the Government has accepted it.  As well as the obvious benefit for those in receipt of domiciliary care allowance who will receive the medical card automatically, the other great advantage is that it eliminates the unnecessary hassle of filling in forms, with a vast amount of paperwork attached, particularly where a person is trying to prove not only medical expenses have been incurred in treating a medical condition but also ancillary expenses.  Many of those applying for medical cards do not realise that, for example, the cost of travelling from a rural part of Ireland to Dublin and staying overnight is a legitimate expense they can include when making their case for a medical card.  I welcome anything that simplifies life.<\/p>  <p>  There are other groups who do not necessarily receive domiciliary care allowance but who are clearly identified as having young people with medical conditions.  The Minister should consider extending it to such categories as quickly as possible and obviating the necessity to make a case. <\/p>  <p>  During the term of the last Government I knew of a young person who on first meeting them I thought was six or seven years of age but who was actually 14 or 15 and suffering from a rare genetic disorder.  It took us a year to obtain a medical card.  The first battle we had to fight was to retain the medical card held until a decision was made.  It then went to appeal and went on and on.  The parents had a modest middle income.  The child needed care 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and a medical card was being held back at a time when children in the whole of their health were being given free general practitioner, GP, cards.<\/p>  <p>  I live in a world where finance will always be finite.  Some people seem to live in a parallel universe where there is unlimited finance and no choices to be made.  I have disagreed with the Government&rsquo;s policy of trying to give GP cards to everybody in the country and not giving full medical cards to those who really need them.  We have our priorities upside down, given that very wealthy people are going to wind up with GP cards, while people who endure huge hardship cannot get their hands on a full medical card.  As the Ministers of State opposite know from their time on this side of the House, many ancillary issues arise in not having a medical card.  <\/p>  <p>  Another practical point concerns the interminable reviews of the circumstances of people with discretionary medical cards or old people.  How many old people, over the age of 66 years, does the Minister of State know whose incomes go up after they turn 66 years, unless they win the lotto?  Is it worthwhile hassling them with forms and worry, year after year while carrying out these reviews? <\/p>  <p>  Another habit of the Health Service Executive, HSE, is that when a person applies, it writes back looking for some information.  There might be a delay in obtaining that information because the person might not understand what is required, or there are family circumstances and the HSE cancels the application, instead of holding it.  The person concerned then has to reapply, receive the documentation again and new forms and fill them in again.  That is lunacy, bureaucracy gone mad and totally unfeeling.  I have had to table parliamentary questions to try to get a medical card application held over while going through this ridiculous process, when the HSE already had the information, to obtain the ancillary information required.  I knew of a case where the information was not provided because the people in charge of the medical card section had not even asked for it. <\/p>  <p>  Another simple case will show how crazy the system is.  Somebody who lives 60 miles to the west of Galway city came to see me in the past few days.  The person concerned has to travel into the city for dialysis and seeks transport in and out.  The sensible thing for them to do is to arrange the outpatient appointment for the same day, but the taxi for dialysis patients leaves before outpatients are seen to.  The person concerned has been told there is no financial support available.  They cannot drive having been on dialysis.  Their spouse cannot drive and they have to get by some miracle from Galway to the western tip of Connemara, Ballyconneely, at their own expense.  Is that a humane system?  That is common throughout the country and every Deputy can tell the Minister of State about such cases.  The amount of money involved in these real hardship cases is very small.  We need practicality, common sense and discretion to be brought back into the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900055#CCC00200","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1468960800,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I am very happy to see all-party consensus on this very important issue.  I am glad to be a Member of an Oireachtas where all Members of the House are giving this issue such priority.  <\/p>  <p>  Domiciliary care allowance is defined as a monthly payment made by the Department of Social Protection to the carer of a child with a disability so severe that the child requires care and attention substantially in excess of another child of the same age to allow the child to deal with the activities of daily living.  Surely this definition says it all.  We are speaking about children with severe disabilities where a member of the family cannot go out to work because there is a requirement for the child to receive extra care and attention.<\/p><p>It should be a given that all of our children are cherished equally and equitably, but that is not the case.  Surely those who are most vulnerable and have been identified as such by virtue of being given this allowance should not have to engage in another battle for a medical card.  At this point, 10,000 children are affected by that to which I refer.<\/p> <p> It must be recognised that families with children who receive domiciliary care allowance are apprehensive about the future and the State support, something I am happy is being acknowledged today.  Families have felt the effects of the economic downturn, with rising prices across household budgets, leading to increased fuel and food costs and rising transport and school costs, as well as the introduction of the household charge and USC, to name but a few.  However, families who have children with disabilities are feeling the squeeze even more, with research showing that they are more likely to be living in poverty than other families.  In addition, it has been estimated to cost three times as much to raise a child with a disability than to raise a child who has no health problems.<\/p> <p> It is clear that any family entitled to domiciliary care allowance for a child should automatically be entitled to a medical card.  It is now accepted that for all children early intervention in order to develop their potential is not only humane and compassionate, but has real economic benefits for society.  This allowance is designed to enable those children with substantial disabilities for whom normal family care and mainstream services do not suffice to develop their potential and to experience, as closely as possible, the benefits of normal family life.<\/p> <p> Children who should qualify for domiciliary care allowance, therefore, have disabilities or conditions that, given the services available to them at their age, location and family circumstances, require extraordinary parental input and additional expenditure if they are to develop as they should.  Some children have a diagnosis or condition that will require costly and ongoing care into their adult years.  They should receive this allowance without the unnecessary burden of having to undergo lengthy procedures to qualify for a medical card.  Often, children have to have medical appointments and parents are advised to get additional medical reports.  This should not be an extra burden, financially or otherwise.  The long drawn-out process for approval of domiciliary care allowance has implications in assessing eligibility for carer's allowance and the respite care grant.  The parents of these children often face additional costs.  The assessment process needs to be flexible in order to capture all areas of need.  It should not just include a child's diagnosis.  Rather, it should also consider the level of care and support needs as well as additional financial and emotional costs.  The household income of a family should not be reduced because a child has been diagnosed with a disability.  Domiciliary care allowance should help families to offset the financial and emotional costs relating to a disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900055#CCC00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468961400,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Deputy on putting forward the motion.  Everyone in the House is quite supportive of recognising the burden that so many families have had to undergo in terms of getting medical cards and the stress that has been caused to them by the process they have had to go through over a number of years.  The fundamental underlying question in the motion is whether children with severe life-limiting disabilities or, unfortunately, in some cases terminal illnesses have the right to a medical card.  The fundamental and unequivocal answer to that is \"Yes\".<\/p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the response of the Minister to the motion, the statement in the programme for Government and the clarification that has been given on extending the entitlement to medical cards for all children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance in the forthcoming budget.  I acknowledge that 11,000 or so children will benefit from this initiative and it will certainly ease the minds of many parents and carers across Ireland who struggle to cope with the day-to-day costs of caring for a loved one with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Ministers present to clarify their intentions as regards the timeline for legislation.  The House will, I presume, automatically pass any legislation.  Therefore, there is no reason we not cannot pass it in advance so that we will not have to wait until later this year or early in the new year and payments can kick in as soon as possible once the budget has been passed.  Legislation can include a timeline so that it automatically comes into force subsequent to the House passing the budget.  That has been done before.  The Minister might consider that.  It is something that everyone in the House would probably welcome.<\/p>  <p>  A number of issues have been raised.  In the limited time available, I want to speak about them.  Domiciliary care allowance is a vital resource for disabled children, their carers and their families.  It is incredible that people in receipt of the allowance were not automatically entitled to medical cards without first undergoing a full household financial audit by way of the famous means test.  I am glad the Minister spoke earlier about visiting a medical card unit.  I am, like some other Deputies, a member of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  It would be a good move for a number of us to visit such a unit, perhaps with a Minister, and discuss some of the issues that all of us in the House across the political spectrum face in terms of the onerous tolls on families engaged in the medical card applications process.  In many cases, they have to repeatedly fill out forms.  I do not blame the officials who are at dealing with the applications process.  They work within the rules.  Given the political process, we can pass on information to the medical card unit based on our direct experience and this could help the process.<\/p>  <p>  Medical cards are a necessity for children who have disabilities as they allow parents to access publicly-run health services free of charge.  Their value is incredible to those families.  I want to acknowledge the Our Children's Health campaign for the fantastic work it has done to highlight the difficulties in the medical card applications process.  Everyone has learned a lot from the work it has done and the many horror stories it has highlighted in terms of the issues families face every day.<\/p>  <p>  Greater flexibility must be shown in the provision of medical cards where there is an obvious long-term medical need on the part of the applicant.  A strong ethical governance framework should direct all policy in this area.  People should never have to live in fear of their medical cards being withdrawn as a result of a change in financial circumstances, particularly because those with disabilities understand that their circumstances will never change.  The exclusive focus on financial hardship in the medical card application process is something that has to change.  We must begin to move towards a system that takes a more compassionate and humanitarian approach to how we service the needs of those with severe disabilities.  We discussed the Keane report, which examined whether eligibility for medical cards could be based on a list of certain conditions.  We all know the outcome of that report.  However, it is important that we continually assess the outcomes so that we can offer greater compassion and flexibility to ensure that people who need medical cards get them.<\/p>  <p>  The motion also notes the Department of Social Protection's domiciliary care allowance assessment programme is an example of what a new, changed or tweaked medical card eligibility test could be based on.  I concur that this process is much improved from the standard medical card application process as it prioritises the needs of disabled children first rather than the financial circumstances of their households.<\/p>  <p>  We must remember that when we are allocating defined resources, in particular to those with disabilities, we are not just dealing with statistics.  Rather, we are having a major impact on the lives of people who face significant obstacles which the rest of us would struggle to understand in our day-to-day lives.<\/p><p>We must, therefore, be cognisant, first and foremost, of the needs of people with disabilities and how we can best provide for their additional requirements in a way which treats them as equal participants in society, rather than just faceless applicants in an overly bureaucratic process, which we are all collectively trying to change.  The current medical card application system provides insufficient flexibility in particular for the needs of those with severe disabilities who face a financial means test.  We in the Labour Party, and Members collectively across the House, would argue that the economic status of a household should never prevent children in need, in particular, from availing of services to which they should be entitled as a right.<\/p> <p> It is with all that in mind that the Labour Party will support the motion.  We are delighted that everyone in the House supports the motion and that the Government is accepting it.  I note what the Minister said earlier but I stress to both Ministers of State who are present that this was a commitment in the programme for Government.  We now have a motion that is supported by all parties and all Members in this House.  It would be another welcome step in the right direction for the Minister to outline at the conclusion of the debate the timeline for putting the change in place and if it can be done in advance of the budget.  That has been done previously with a post date to the budget timeframe so that once the budget is passed by this House - I hope the budget is passed by this House - that the measure will kick in straight away.  That would be a very positive endeavour.  The House would welcome it very much if the Minister could come back with such news.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900056#DDD00200","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468962000,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I will probably need a quarter of the time available to me.

The hardship of an acute medical prognosis, which is then questioned and audited by unnecessary bureaucracy, leads to undue hardship.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s commitment to extend entitlement to a medical card to all children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance in this year&rsquo;s budget.  I hope the day will arrive when all health care, regardless of income, is universal.  Perhaps one day medical cards will be a thing of the past.  Public health and access to public health services should be based not on an audit of one&rsquo;s income, but on one&rsquo;s health requirements.  When one&rsquo;s child or family member is very sick, one would do anything to make the pain go away.  The added stress of having to justify and jump through legal hoops and bureaucracy to get something to which one&rsquo;s child is entitled does not have a place in a society that calls itself &ldquo;civil&rdquo;.

Perhaps it is a sign of new politics because if this motion had come before the House prior to February of this year, it would have been rejected out of hand by the previous Government and it would have been voted down.  The fact that 11,000 children will now automatically get a medical card is very welcome.  It is a great relief to the families of those children who have a lot to contend with and many difficulties in their way.  The State should not compound the difficulties such families have to deal with and it will be a great relief to them for their children to automatically get a medical card.  In many cases the parents are not looking for a medical card for themselves but in order to have their child&rsquo;s needs looked after.  Parents put their own lives on hold to ensure their child can have the best life possible and anything the State can do to facilitate that must be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  It is a pity we must wait for legislation, as Deputy Kelly outlined.  The primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, could start to roll out the process now or the Government could bring legislation if it is necessary through the Houses as a matter of urgency given that it was a commitment in the programme for Government.  I do not imagine the legislation would need to be complicated in order to bring about the desired result.  Surely it could have been prepared and made ready in the ten weeks in which the Government has been in place.<\/p>  <p>  The only problem I had with the motion was the proposal that the domiciliary care assessment would be used as a model for medical card assessment.  I am pleased the Government has not accepted that aspect of the motion because it would have led to its own difficulties.  In the previous D&aacute;il, Private Members&rsquo; motions were tabled about the assessment process for domiciliary care allowance and the difficulties parents had accessing that allowance in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  When one has been around this House for a long time, one might become a bit cynical.  I am afraid the domiciliary care application process might become more difficult in the future.  I hope that is not the case but I fear that it might, given that getting it will in future automatically mean the family will be entitled to carer&rsquo;s allowance and a medical card.  I hope that does not happen and that further motions on the issue are not tabled in the future on difficulties in getting the domiciliary care allowance itself.<\/p>  <p>  Changes should be made to tweak the medical card application process and make it more responsive to people&rsquo;s needs.  All Members have people come to see them in their constituency offices who are applying for a medical card.  We know right well they will not pass the means test, yet they have to go through the process even though they have medical conditions that would justify getting a medical card.  They must go the entire way through the means assessment process and fail it in order to get to the point where their medical condition is assessed.  It would be a worthwhile change if the system allowed for the means test to be bypassed so that people could go straight to having their medical needs assessed.<\/p>  <p>  Much of the discretion has been removed from the PCRS.  In recent weeks, I am aware of a constituent who was refused a medical card because he was 19 cent over the limit on the means test assessment.  In recent years if someone was up to &euro;20 over the limit, he or she would have still been awarded a medical card.  It is a disgrace that someone would be refused a medical card for the sake of being 19 cent over the limit.  It might be a blip in the system but it happened and that should not continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900057#EEE00500","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1468962000,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I am delighted to support the motion.  I am very pleased the Minister has responded in a positive manner to this Private Members&rsquo; motion.  I welcome the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in opened up the motion for others to sign it.  That is a reflection of the general support in this House, in particular from the Opposition in recent years, for progressing such issues.  I fully support the parents who are in the Gallery tonight in their call on the Government to accept the motion and to put the necessary measures in place.<\/p>  <p>  The situation in this regard is another example of the dysfunctional nature of the health service.  Some day we will get a Government which will dismantle our unfair, unequal, two-tier health service and introduce free health care as a universal benefit for all, paid for by progressive taxation.  I am a member of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  I hope we will progress the issue of free health care in the committee.<\/p>  <p>  It defies description that a child suffering from a serious illness or long-term congenital condition is not automatically entitled to free health care.  It also defies description that a family caring for such a child must undergo a complex means test in order to obtain a discretionary medical card.  The test is crude and outdated.  The changes to the test in 2013 represented a cruel austerity cut.  It meant that repayments on a home loan were no longer taken into account and a previous standard travel allowance of &euro;50 a week could no longer be taken into account.  That forced many parents to apply for discretionary medical cards, which put those families at the mercy of the State and allowed it to decide if undue hardship was placed on the family due to the illness or disability of a child.  What a horribly bureaucratic term that is, undue hardship.  It would not be out of place in a Victorian workhouse.<\/p>  <p>  The Keane report recommended the development of a more compassionate medical card system to accommodate those with significant illnesses or disabilities.  I am pleased that we are moving to that point.  Given that the programme for Government gives a specific commitment to extend the entitlement to a medical card to children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, it should accept and act on this motion.<\/p><p>Again, when does the Minister think he can get that legislation through?  Could it be worked on during the summer months and brought in quite quickly when we come back to the D&aacute;il?<\/p> <p> I want to raise one other point before I finish.  An issue came up recently in my constituency office of a cancer patient who had the words \"incurable cancer\" as the description of her medical illness.  The word \"terminal\" was not used because the consultant did not consider that it was an immediately terminal illness, although it was an incurable cancer, and the medical card was refused on that basis.  It just shows that these are the issues that we must consider regarding medical cards.  One should not have to write \"terminal,\" if an illness is not terminal but incurable, to get a medical card.  That kind of broader look at the whole medical card system, as has been said by Deputy Pringle, should be considered as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900057#EEE00600","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468962600,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae also wants to contribute, but if he does not come in, I will do the best I can.  I am glad that this motion was tabled but I am even more pleased that the Government has accepted it.  It is a sign of new politics.  People may scoff and laugh at the new workings of the new D&aacute;il, but this is practical proof, and it is not the first time in recent weeks that it has happened.<\/p>  <p>  As someone who sat through all the talks on the formation of a government for so many days, I was delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, my namesake - I know he has just left - was appointed.  He was very passionate at those talks about issues to the fore, especially in areas such as this.  I congratulate him and Deputy Corcoran Kennedy on their promotions to Ministers of State at the Department of Health, as I know how passionately they both feel about health issues.  The Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, will forgive me if I talk about Deputy McGrath, but he was present at the talks and lobbied very hard, and this issue was included in the programme for Government.  Action on this issue cannot happen fast enough.  Sinn F&eacute;in obviously feels this way, as we all do, but Rome was not built in a day, and tosach maith leath na hoibre.<\/p>  <p>  There should not be any question about domiciliary care allowance once one goes through the arduous process to get the allowance for the sickest of children and in the most traumatic of cases.  I am involved with a number of organisations, such as the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Children's Foundation, Every Life Counts and One Day More.  These are powerful, wonderful organisations that have done Trojan work and supported and given testimony to the reasons these special children must be nurtured, brought into the world and looked after.  The State should not make it any more difficult or arduous for the families involved.  The cruel terminologies must be removed from the discourse and the granting of the allowance should be automatic.  I know a former Minister at some stage agreed something similar in a motion similar to this one.  It is very important.<\/p>  <p>  The fact that 11,000 special children, as I like to call them - very special children - will automatically receive this allowance is a good step, one that we should not have to boast about or fight for, but one that we should celebrate in 2016, the 100th anniversary of 1916.  Something should be readily available to these children.  I believe it will come, and it will work to the advantage of the families.<\/p>  <p>  We must make a separation here, get a different ideological outlook and set the medical card apart from the domiciliary care allowance.  Assessments of eligibility for medical cards are based on family income.  A sick and special child should not be depending on this.  There are extra burdens on such families.  They love caring for their children and they step up to the plate, but the assessment should not be done in this way.  The assessment should be based on the needs of the sick children who need those special medications and supports to live as best a life as they can with the disability they have, whether life-limiting or not and whether terminal or not.  If a person becomes unemployed, he or she gets a medical card, and rightly so, for the whole family, but when a sick child needs a medical card, it should not be assessed based on the needs or the income of the parents, the household income or anything to do with the rest of the family.  We must have clarity on that area and work and strive towards such an approach.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the issue of the terminology used and the questions asked about reviews and medical cards.  We have heard such issues recounted here.  We heard of a case not so long ago in which the parents of a child with Down's syndrome were asked if her condition had improved.  There is no room for such language to be used by officials in the medical card section of the HSE.  They should understand that it is very hurtful, very silly and downright contemptuous of the people involved.  As I said, for people with medical cards, cancer patients, the sickest of people trying to access the system, it is too onerous and arduous.  I certainly hope that when these 11,000 people automatically get medical cards, they will not make the domiciliary care allowance any more difficult for the children who need it.<\/p>  <p>  I salute the work of Jack and Jill, especially Jonathan Irwin, its CEO, for what it does for sick children and the continuous work its nurses provide and the hours they give.  As I said, I wish the two Ministers of State very well in their promotions and look forward to working with them on many other issues across the floor.  I hope that issues will be taken and dealt with.  Sensible motions were not tabled heretofore, during the terms of past Governments, but they are being tabled now because of the new situation here, and it is a welcome development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900058#FFF00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1468962600,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Each and every one of us knows that health is paramount to families, especially to parents who have children.  Unfortunately, however, some parents have a heavy cost to bear and unfair burdens when their children become ill and may be ill for many months or many years.  Maybe some of them will never get back to full health.  When they look for domiciliary care allowance, to which they are entitled, I feel they have to wait much too long.  I have had a case in recent times that has been going on for months now - since April - and we are told that maybe we will have an answer by the end of August.  To give Deputies a small bit of an insight into the background of the case, it concerns a child who is about seven years old, one of a family of five, whose bowel and colon were removed.  She has a bag and may have it until she becomes an adult, although hopefully it will be removed then and replaced with a more acceptable system for keeping her alive.  In the meantime, however, the family applied for domiciliary care allowance last April and will be waiting at least until the end of August.  I feel, as I suppose do all Members here and county councils around the country, that a six-month wait is not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  It must be about staff.  I do not think any staff in any Department would hoard an application like this, but there are not enough staff to vet these cases.  It is the same with the carer's allowance.  I know Deputy Mattie McGrath and others have made the case about the medical card but I am glad of this opportunity to highlight the need to speed up domiciliary care allowances for children.  A sick child is a serious burden to carry for parents and in the case I have mentioned it may be for the rest of her life.  I ask the Government to do something and to staff these places to ensure that a speedier outcome is available to those parents who apply for domiciliary care allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900058#FFF00300","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1468962600,"counter":479,"content":"<p>First, I welcome members of Our Children's Health to the Visitors Gallery.  They are very welcome, but to me it defies logic that any parent should have to go out and mobilise and organise a campaign group or sit in a public gallery at 10.10 p.m. on a Tuesday evening in the hope that their national legislators will do the right thing.  Members of this group represent so many families right across the State looking in here this evening, but there is no legitimate reason for any Deputy in this Chamber to vote against giving a child who is sick a full medical card.<\/p><p>I have heard a number of announcements on this but there has been no action to implement it.  In the most recent announcement, coming last week on foot of Sinn F&eacute;in tabling this motion, the Minister, Deputy Harris, said it would be implemented next year.  However, next year is simply not good enough for many families, including children.  These sick children need medical cards now, not next year.  There are no excuses whatsoever.  Sinn F&eacute;in has brought forward legislation which is in place, prepared and ready to go.  Its implementation is all that is needed now.  Unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy Harris, failed to give us a date when that legislation could be in place.<\/p> <p> I do not agree with the Labour Party too often, but I agree with Deputy Alan Kelly that there is no reason that legislation cannot be put through now.  I ask the Ministers of State present to provide us with a date when this legislation can be put through.  The Government can rush through legislation when it suits it, be it the financial emergency legislation, property tax, water charges or a law to tackle head-shops.  It has been done.  If providing sick children with a medical card was a priority it could be done, too. <\/p> <p> This is about political priorities and choices.  The cost of doing this is a mere &euro;9 million, which pales in comparison to the &euro;14 million spent on ministerial transport costs from 2011 to 2014, or the &euro;700 million spent on Irish Water.  It comes down to political choices.  Seriously ill children should never be left waiting for medical cards.  Parents have to fight the system to get a medical card for their sick children, to which they are rightly entitled.  This puts unnecessary pressures on parents.  Those with disabilities have suffered hugely under the Government's austerity agenda - scrapping the mobility allowance, halving housing adaptation grants, cutting disability allowance and increasing prescription charges.  The list goes on and on.  <\/p> <p> Not only is there a fight for medical cards in the first place but there is also a fight to get a medical card back when it has been taken from a child.  In 2014, the Coyle family from my own constituency of Wicklow, had to go on national television to state their case before any notice was taken of their actual situation.  Their child, Alexander, was the first person in Ireland to be diagnosed with Mowat Wilson syndrome, a profound intellectual and physical disability which brings life-threatening problems and seizures.  Expenses include syringes and medication, nappies and other equipment, the cost of which exceeds &euro;1,100 per month.  Yet his medical card was taken away from him.  At the time, Alexander's mother told how she had been forced to sterilise and re-use syringes which were meant for one use only.<\/p> <p> This is not news to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who has left the Chamber.  He comes from the same constituency as Alexander.  Yet, the Minister has no problem in telling us that we will have to wait for the implementation of this legislation.  The Coyle family's position is replicated for so many families across the State who find themselves in similar situations.  This Government is so far removed from the realities faced by so many families and the fact that we have to push for something such as this, proves it.  Parents should not have to go on television to get a medical card for their sick child, nor should they have to battle with the system to get one when it is so desperately needed.<\/p> <p> If we are all in agreement that sick children are entitled to a medical card, then we should see emergency legislation go through the Oireachtas now.  It has been done before and it can be done again.  It is a political choice.<\/p> <p> This motion provides an opportunity for Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to give something back to the cohort of people they have taken so much from.

Parents struggle to apply for and obtain the allowance, while there is the added pressure of not automatically getting a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the work of parents who fight daily for their children and, in particular, a group called the DCA warriors who do fantastic work.  They are an extraordinary group of people who fight tirelessly for parents in need of State support for children with severe illness or disabilities.  However, the fact that this group is in existence, and is so heavily relied upon, is shameful.<\/p>  <p>  Adding extra pressure on parents to wade through streams of paper and bureaucracy in order to prove their child or children's challenge or disability is inhumane and wrong.  We should be creating a society that puts children and their needs first - a society that protects those children most in need.  By supporting this Bill the Government would be sending a message that those children are a priority.<\/p>  <p>  The messy delays that exist at the moment are playing havoc with children's lives.  Unnecessary delays are an abuse of those children's rights to equal treatment in health and development.  At the very least a medical card should come as an immediate right if one qualifies for the domiciliary care allowance.  Immediately extending the medical card to children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance would ensure that critically ill children who need urgent medical treatment, would get it.<\/p>  <p>  In this centenary year, the words of our Proclamation are being repeatedly echoed across the country.  Children have been learning about the meaning of those words in our schools as part of our centenary celebrations.  The Proclamation \"declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally.\"  This is not the reality for so many children affected by the unjust system currently in place, however.<\/p>  <p>  We need urgently to introduce and implement a schedule for the extension of full medical cards to people with serious illness and disabilities, without a means test and immune from changes to household finances.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact the Minister has said he is supportive of this legislation, but we need to see a timeframe and a date for rolling it out.  Actions speak louder than words and if the Government is serious about this issue it is important not to pay lip service to it but to provide a timeframe for its implementation.  It is the least that these parents and children deserve.  It is difficult enough for families faced with a situation whereby their child or children might have a serious illness or disability, but it is humiliating for them to go into detail when completing the domiciliary care allowance application forms.  In addition, they must go through the process again when applying for medical cards.<\/p>  <p>  In this day and age, we should put a stop to that process.  We need to see a date from the Minister also.  While I appreciate his comment that this legislation is welcome, we do need to learn when such a Bill will be passed.

It is clear that the cross-party agreement that we have heard this evening shows that no individual or party has a monopoly on caring about the people of this country, and especially the young people and their families we are discussing here this evening. <\/p>  <p>  Like many of my fellow public representatives, I have been struck by the practical challenges that parents face in meeting the needs of their children with a severe disability.  Over the years, I have engaged closely with constituents, neighbours, with the Irish Wheelchair Association in my own county, the Carers' Association, and Laois-Offaly Families for Autism.  I am well aware of the difficulties and challenges that parents are experiencing.  <\/p>  <p>  I also want to welcome our Children's Help Group who have joined us in the Visitors Gallery.<\/p><p>As outlined earlier by the Minister for Health, there are good reasons for this Government commitment.  Approximately one third of children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance do not hold a medical card.  Therefore, approximately 11,000 more children with a severe disability would qualify for a medical card under this new scheme.  In addition, all 33,000 children in receipt of the allowance would not in future be subject to the medical card means test and approximately 30,000 families looking after a child with a severe disability would no longer be required to go through the medical card assessment process, leaving mothers and fathers to focus on doing what they do best and what they want to do, which is to provide care and support for their child.<\/p> <p> I am convinced that the recently established committee on the future of health care, of which many Deputies here this evening are members, and which acknowledges my own specific remit of maintaining health and wellbeing, can be of great benefit to the future development of our health system.  A single long-term vision for health care in Ireland, built on a cross-party or social consensus, can help to drive reform and the system over the next ten years.  <\/p> <p> I recognise that as a result of a range of improvements to the medical card scheme implemented by the HSE over the past two years it is now exercising greater discretion.  This reflects how the economy has improved and that there is now funding available to ensure that people are looked after they way we all them looked after.  The number of discretionary medical cards has more than doubled.  There are now over 106,000 discretionary medical cards, which is the highest number of discretionary medical cards on record.  <\/p> <p> I acknowledge the difficulties that some of our citizens are experiencing including, as outlined by some Deputies earlier, discretionary medical cards being refused on the basis of a person's income exceeding the threshold by 19 cent; on the basis of whether a cancer patient is terminal or incurable; and interminable reviews in respect of applications by the elderly.  These are all issues that I have come across.  I know how frustrating this is for people.  I will refer these matters to the HSE for consideration.  In regard to the issue raised by Deputy Scanlon, I cannot understand why a decision would be made to rent equipment if it is cheaper to buy it.  These are all questions that the HSE will need to answer.  I know that they will be taken on board and given careful consideration.  A visit by the health committee to the unit which considers medical card applications would be worthwhile.  <\/p> <p> Deputies will be aware that on foot of the Keane report, the HSE established the clinical advisory group on medical card eligibility.  The objective of this group is to develop a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease and appropriate operational guidelines for the medical card scheme.  Membership of the group includes clinical experts from specialist services and professions, as well as patient representatives.  The group is expected to complete its work and report on it in the future to the director general of the HSE.<\/p> <p> I welcome this opportunity for Deputies to discuss this important issue that affects so many families in the country.  The Government has given a clear commitment in its programme<\/p> <p>to provide medical cards to all children that qualify for the domiciliary care allowance.  I am convinced that this will be a priority in the upcoming budget discussions.  When the funding is in place we will aim to have the enabling legislation enacted as quickly as possible.  I hope that this will reassure Deputies of the commitment of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and all Ministers and the Government to deliver this scheme to the recipients of the domiciliary care allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900059#GGG00300","speaker":"1339","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468963800,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to address the House today on the Government's commitment to extend medical cards to all children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance, as outlined in our agreed programme for a partnership Government.  I welcome most of the comments made tonight during this debate, some of which I will deal with later in my contribution.<\/p>  <p>  This is a very important issue that affects many thousands of families throughout our country.  Deputies may be aware that the domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is a monthly payment for a child with a severe disability aged under 16 years who requires ongoing care and attention substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  It is administered by the Department of Social Protection in accordance with the social welfare legislation.  As a parent of a daughter with an intellectual disability, I spent many years campaigning for disability rights and the domiciliary care allowance.  Now, it is in the programme.  That is action.  I also spent many years campaigning for the restoration of the respite care grant.  That was restored four weeks ago.  That is action.  It is important that people, when making comments, know what is going on and the difference between action and inaction.  This commitment is stitched into the programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the DCA is not based on disability or the medical need of a child.  Under the social welfare legislation it is based on the how much additional care and attention a child needs because of a disability.  There are a range of qualifying criteria in respect of eligibility for the domiciliary care allowance.  These include the disability being likely to last for at least one year, that the parent is providing the care to the child, that the child resides at home and on the child meeting the medical criteria of the scheme.  It is estimated that approximately 33,000 children currently qualify for the domiciliary care allowance.  By comparison, approximately 390,000 children under the age of 16 years currently qualify for the medical card.  I agree that when moving towards a universal health service we need to set priorities.  Children that are sick and children with disabilities, and not children that are healthy, are my priority.  By contrast, the medical card scheme, which is administered by the HSE in accordance with the Health Act 1970, as amended, is primarily a means based scheme.  Under health legislation, medical cards are provided to persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  The legislation also requires the HSE to have regard to the overall financial situation of the family.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to many of the comments from my colleagues in regard to the urgent need to deal with the reform of medical card system.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual a family.  Where deemed appropriate, in particular circumstances, it can exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the relevant threshold.  As a result of a range of improvements implemented by the HSE since mid-2014, the HSE is exercising greater discretion.  Since then, the number of discretionary medical cards has doubled.  There are now over 107,000 discretionary cards, which is the highest number of discretionary cards on record.<\/p>  <p>  I share the hope of the Minister for Health that we will be able to get cross-party support for this measure.  I also recognise that there are enormous demands and cost pressures on our health service.  Health care continues to rise to meet the needs of our growing and ageing population, as well as the increasing incidence of chronic conditions and medical technologies and treatments.  <\/p>  <p>  We have secured a substantial increase in funding for the health services for 2016 but I do not underestimate the challenges involved in the delivery of a safe and efficient health service for our citizens.  I welcome the attendance in the Visitors' Gallery tonight of our children's health group, which I have always supported and will continue to support.  I am pleased that the House has discussed this important issue this evening.  I am determined to prioritise this commitment as part of the upcoming discussions and to see it implemented as soon as possible after we have secured the required resources.  The discussions on the Estimates will continue over the summer months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900060#HHH00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1468963800,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I thank all Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la who took part in this important debate.

It is great that the Government is acknowledging that legislation is needed and I am telling it that we have the legislation.

While we had some misgivings about it, we supported it and there was broad support in the House for it.  It is on its way to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in this week to be signed by the President.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na knows that if it asks for something, the Minister delivers and that is good but the Minister for Health and the Ministers of State who are here need to deliver for the families of children with severe and life-limiting conditions.  It is very simple.<\/p> <p> The Government has given the commitment, which is very welcome.  It is supporting our motion and that is very welcome.  The cross-party support for our motion is very welcome but the Ministers of State know that what we need is a date and some certainty.  I know some families are following this debate.  If they are on a discretionary medical card, they go to bed every night terrified that this medical card will be taken off them so we are going to press the Ministers of State for a date.  We are going to press them to put some definable goals in place and to give certainty to those families who will go to sleep worried.  We are going to press them because cases like that of baby R&eacute;alt&iacute;n should not happen - not in a civilised society.  I hope that because I have raised the case of baby R&eacute;alt&iacute;n on the floor of the House that it might herald some action for this individual case but we cannot do that every time we have an issue like this.  This is why the legislation and the certainty are needed.  I have met these families, as have the Ministers of State.  We know these people.  They are people in our communities who come to us for help and are dealt with on an individual basis.  That is not right.  At at time in their lives when they least need to battle the system, it is an endless round of form filling, appeals and denials of application.  That is not right.  We know it is not right.  There is cross-party support for our motion because we all know it is not right.  We are going to press the Minister and Ministers of State to give us a date by which these families can know.  It is not good enough in case anyone thinks it is to come in here and tell us that it will be subject to the budgetary process because these people have been subject to enough already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900060#HHH00300","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1468964400,"counter":487,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1468964400,"counter":488,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.35 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 20 July 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
