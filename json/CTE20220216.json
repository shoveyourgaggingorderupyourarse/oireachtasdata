As for where we are in our eradication of bovine TB, we have engaged in a programme since 1954 and there has been progress over recent decades in respect of the eradication and the reduction of numbers, in terms of both the incidence rate and the prevalence at which TB occurs.  From the point of view of the role of the TB forum, which was established in recent years, progress has been made in developing both the science base on which the eradication programme is built and the knowledge and education base among the farming community.<\/p> <p>  The pressures among farmers and farm families as a result of a breakdown cannot be underestimated.  The breakdown of a family farm affects not only the farmer but also the entire enterprise and the family holding.  The role farmers have played over recent decades in the eradication of the programme and the role farmers will play into the future will continue to be one of supportive engagement, seeking the ultimate eradication of the programme.  Nevertheless, the support of farmers from a financial point of view and the integration of farmers' viewpoints in developing any policies that will ultimately affect the eradication of the programme must be at the core of what is determined to be a success as we move forward.  Farmers have continually engaged in biosecurity measures to improve, enhance and reduce their risk from the spread of bovine tuberculosis.<\/p> <p>  It is worth noting also the role wildlife has to play and the further research and development that is needed, in respect of both the interaction of the badger population and improved knowledge and research of the relationship deer have to play in the transmission of the disease at farm level.  Over recent years, the roll-out of the vaccination programme to the badger population in areas that have previously been culled and where the disease is said to be under control has merited some rewards, but there must be ongoing research and continued investigation in respect of the merits and the occurrence rate, the frequency rate and the continued effectiveness of the vaccine in those badger populations.  As for the role of deer, particularly in high-density volumes in Wicklow among other places, research has shown that in high density and high volumes of deer, badger and bovine animals, the isolates of the samples of the species and also the strains of TB that have been found are similar to those found in bovine animals and badgers and among the deer population.  Research presented to the TB forum in recent months has also highlighted this as a possible pool of infection.<\/p> <p>  With all that in mind, the development of science and the research will bring about the change that is necessary for the eradication of TB.  We must look to some of our partners throughout the world who have successfully eradicated TB and to states such as New Zealand, which is down to fewer than 40 herds that have become infected with TB.  It is a science-based model of research.  We look at the area of whole-genome sequencing, which the TB forum has been briefed about this week and which it has also discussed in previous sessions, and the role that has to play to identify the species, the strain and isolate the strain has come from.<\/p><p>Essentially, it identifies the occurrence, the species it occurred in and whether the transmission was from bovine to badger or from badger back to bovine.  Macra na Feirme feels that it is essential that the studies that have been conducted in the UK are carried out in the Republic of Ireland for us to gain further insight into the transmissibility of the disease.  <\/p><p> We must also be cognisant of the need for a consistent and sustainable funding model into the future.  The TB forum has consistently heard that a funding model must deliver for eradication but also for farmers.  The farmers' contribution in recent years has been around &euro;34 million with decreasing funding from the EU and the Irish taxpayer increasing the funding to an overall funding of &euro;105 million in 2021.  That must continue if we are serious about eradication of the disease.<\/p><p> Macra na Feirme feels there must be front-loading of investment in funding to eradicate the disease.  We feel that from a farmer's perspective, our labour is not included in the costs incurred.  It must be considered that we have young farmers who are highly educated and highly qualified with level 6, 7 and 8 degrees and qualifications.  If we are serious, we must consider as significant the labour expense and labour wage and associated qualifications and then the subsistence provided must reflect the quality of education among the farming community.  <\/p><p> We welcome any questions.  Macra na Feirme's goal is held in common with that of the TB forum and all the other stakeholders; the eradication of disease is something we all strive for.  Continued support, engagement, education and investment in research is how will achieve that by 2030 and beyond.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>It is great to be back in person.  We appreciate the invitation to come in.  We were told it has been over two years since we were here in person.<\/p> <p>  We have sent a submission to the committee but I will give some key points here.  The TB eradication programme implemented in Ireland remains the single largest animal health cost for Irish farmers each year with combined direct and indirect cost of over &euro;55 million per annum.  In addition, despite 4% of herds breaking down with the disease annually, the fear of a TB outbreak continues to be identified by farmers as one of the largest annual stress factors associated with farming as a result of the severe impact on normal farm practice and associated losses. <\/p> <p>  Irish farmers contribute in excess of &euro;55 million each year to the TB programme with more than &euro;27 million in annual TB testing costs, approximately &euro;8 million in disease levies and &euro;20 million in labour when facilitating the testing of more than 9 million animal tests a year.  For the &euro;55 million investment, farmers receive just over &euro;20 million in compensation in 2020, rising to &euro;26 million last year, reflecting the higher stock values for animals and production losses associated with the TB programme on our farms. <\/p> <p>  Clearly, eradication of the disease within the shortest feasible time frames must be the objective.  However, this will not be achieved by the simplistic approach of tightening controls on farmers while ignoring the impact this has on farmers and the associated losses for their farms.  In recent years, the levels of TB have increased throughout the country with more than 20,000 reactors and more than 4,000 herds each year experiencing restrictions. <\/p> <p>  While the objective must be eradication of TB from the national herd within the shortest feasible timeframe, we cannot lose sight of the impact TB controls and measures have on farmers, their families and their business.  Regardless of how effective any new or enhanced controls will be in reducing the levels of TB and ultimately achieving eradication, we cannot lose sight of the fact this will be a long-term process throughout which farmers will incur financial losses through animal removals and trade restrictions.  The support schemes in the TB programme must be enhanced to reflect the full impact animal removals and restrictions have on the income of their farms.  This will provide the platform to move forward the controls and measures necessary to make meaningful progress in pursuing eradication of the disease and maintaining farmer support for the process.  <\/p> <p>  Today we are here to discuss TB eradication.  The main driver to achieve this will not be a simplistic and one-dimensional approach.  While a multifaceted approach will be necessary, the main driver has been and will always be the effective implementation of the effective wildlife control programme.  We have seen first-hand in this country the impact this programme can have in reducing the levels of disease.  In the late 1990s we were having up to 44,000 TB reactors a year taken from our farms.  The commencement of the wildlife programme in the early 2000s reduced these numbers to less than 16,000 by 2013.  There is no doubt but that a number of factors have contributed to the increase in reactors since then but central to that has been the lack of progress in enhancing the wildlife control programme. <\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has committed additional resources to the wildlife programme in the last budget and through the implementation group, enhancements to the programme have been agreed which include a comprehensive resurveying for setts, assisted by the roll-out of the new app which farmers support and have already engaged with and are starting to see the results in terms of additional setts identified and the proactive implementation of the programme in advance of major infrastructural works. <\/p> <p>  However, the main limiting factor here is the human resources available to the programme to effectively and efficiently implement the programme to positively impact on the levels of TB.  Additional funding has been provided for and we must now see this translate into boots on the ground to carry out the surveying and capture work.  The IFA has made a detailed submission to the TB implementation group in this area.  Members will have been provided with a copy. <\/p> <p>  The programme effectively requires a doubling of the human resources available to it with those resources deployed on the basis of TB levels within the area.  If we are serious about eradicating TB, we must have effective and efficient implementation of the wildlife programme with the primary focus on density reduction of badgers where found associated with TB outbreaks.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister has announced the re-establishment of the national deer management forum.  This must happen as a matter of urgency both to address the TB risk associated with deer, which is becoming more prevalent, and the broader impact these animals are having roaming through our farmland, eating grass, damaging crops and fences and raising safety issues on roads. <\/p> <p>  I now turn to farm controls.  We can never again have a situation where the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine unilaterally embarks on an approach of blacklisting farmers through herd categorisation for TB.  The new structures of engagement are helpful to avoid a repeat of this but the episode has rightly caused great anger among our members.  Categorising herds based on TB risk does not eradicate the disease, but severely penalises farmers who through no fault of their own experience TB breakdowns.  Good progress has been made in this area.<\/p> <p>  Between 2012 and 2020, the level of farmers' direct contribution to the programme increased by 13.8% from &euro;30.6 million to &euro;34 million.  Funding from the Exchequer increased from &euro;45 million to &euro;57 million, while the contribution from the EU reduced from &euro;11 million to &euro;5.4 million.  Farmer contributions in 2021 have increased again with a further reduction in the contribution from the EU.  Farmers&rsquo; direct contribution consists of payment for the annual TB test and the payment of disease levies amounting to over &euro;35 million in 2021.  Until recently the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine refused to recognise farmer labour as a contribution to the programme.  The Grant Thornton cost-benefit analysis identified this contribution to be worth only &euro;8 million.  The IFA has rejected this figure.  Our conservative estimate puts the farm labour contribution at &euro;20 million annually.  That brings farmers&rsquo; total contribution to over &euro;55 million.<\/p> <p>  It must be remembered TB breakdowns are primarily associated with issues outside the control of the farmer.  TB controls have a huge financial impact on farms and facilitating the programme on our farms creates significant labour demands.  All this must be taken into account.  Clearly a sustainable funding model needs to be agreed.  There is broad consensus here on that.  This model must recognise the full level of farmers' contributions currently and must involve all stakeholders who benefit from farmers' implementation of the TB eradication programme.  Maintaining access to our export markets and the value-added chain for our produce is only possible because of the facilitation of the TB programme on our farms, which benefits all stakeholders in the agriculture sector and beyond.  All of these must contribute to the funding of the programme.  <\/p> <p>  Long-standing agreements are in place in relation to liability to pay for testing on our farms. As farmers, we are liable to pay for one test in a calendar year at no shorter interval than ten months.  Any other additional supplementary testing requirements are the responsibility of the Department.  We will not be deviating from this position.<\/p><p> The IFA is acutely aware of the importance of maintaining the hard-won, high-health status of our national livestock herd as a major exporter of agricultural produce.  Farmers have and continue to support the efforts of the Department in eradicating TB from the national herd at an enormous direct and indirect cost.  The IFA is demanding the eradication of TB from the national herd in the shortest feasible time.  However, this cannot be achieved by further increasing the enormous and disproportionate cost burden on farmers.  The main contributing factors to TB spread can be addressed in a practical and effective way that takes account of the farming dynamic in Ireland and the critical importance of animal movements and live exports.<\/p><p> The IFA is actively engaged with the TB forum process with the clearly outlined objective of eradicating TB from the national herd while minimising the impact of controls on our farmers.  We have the tools at our disposal to achieve significant reductions in the levels of TB and, ultimately, eradication.  While science is important and we must always seek to improve what we do, we cannot lose sight of the measures that have proven effective in the past.  We must have the wildlife programme fully resourced to ensure the enhanced programme that has been agreed is fully implemented throughout the country.  We must address the deer issue before it starts to contribute to disease spread to the same extent as badgers.  Farmers must be fairly compensated for the impact of the controls and animal losses on their farms.  The funding model must recognise the full value of farmers' contribution to the programme and include those outside the farm gate who are beneficiaries of the programme but currently do not contribute.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and committee members for their attention.  We will be delighted to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. T.J.

Our objective, as the committee knows, is to get rid of TB as quickly as possible and our submission is on the record.  There are a couple of things I want to highlight on that.  The main one, as the committee has heard from everyone before, is the wildlife problem.  The badgers are obviously a problem and it is under-resourced.  As late as yesterday I was talking to people with TB in their herd in the southern part of the country.  They were saying they had no personnel for the last two years and it created havoc with wildlife.  For a start, the wildlife is considered to be one of the biggest problems.  It is completely under-resourced.  There need to be many more feet on the ground to sort that out.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to other things, the new animal health law suggested we bring in the pre- and post-movement testing of animals that have been out of test within six months.  We have continuously pushed forward that it be the pre-movement test only because it will be very difficult to police the other.  A policy we in the ICMSA have pushed for a long time relates to inconclusives.  Going back to 2019, there have been over 2,000 inconclusives in the country every year with 12% to 13% of them going down subsequently.  I am glad that as of last year all inconclusives are under a strict regime of testing.  It is now showing up that two out of three inconclusives are subsequently failing on the blood test and subsequent testing.  We have continuously looked for a programme to be put in place so that historical inconclusives - there are approximately 4,000 of them - are taken out at full market valuation because there is no doubt they will turn up problems as we go forward.<\/p> <p>  The other thing that is very critical is communication.  We have heard constantly from the Department about this new communication programme called the CRM, or client relation management, that is to be up and running.  Under it, anyone with TB can, in one phone call, have everything explained to them as to what happens.  This is not the case on the ground.  It absolutely is not.  It is irrelevant whether people lose two, 50 or 100 cows because for them, these are animals they care for going down.  They are under stress starting off.  They want a phone number to ring to find out about valuation, all the forms they must fill in and everything that must be done.  That is not there.  If we want farmers on side the Department needs to have a direct line people can ring with everything they need.  Going back to the badgers and catching, snaring and vaccinating them, you must get farmers on your side first.  If farmers are in the dark they are not aware of what is happening and where to go.  The communication is one thing we have been promised and it has fallen down very badly.<\/p> <p>  The compensation scheme is probably going 20 years now and there are a couple of issues.  The income supplement was set at &euro;55 probably 20-odd years ago and with costs, etc., it is completely outdated.  In our submission we have set it at a minimum of &euro;90.  We have heard from people who have lost cows.  Their income is way down.  I have people screaming at me on the phone that their income is way down.  Everything is there in our submission.<\/p> <p>  Going back to financing, the wildlife programme for 2019 was &euro;4.5 million.  That needs to be upped much more and as I said before, we need feet on the ground to sort it out.  In some areas you have fantastic officers on the ground who work hard at it.  In other areas it is not that they do not do a good job but that they are just not there.  We need an update on that.<\/p> <p>  On research, only something like &euro;2 million is spent on research every year.  Scientific research is the way we must go.  That research must be updated.  Recently there is genomic sequencing and it has huge potential in tracing where TB has come from.  In other words, if I bought an animal off Mr. Smyth, they would be able to trace it back to wherever it came from and we will knock that out in the end.<\/p> <p>  We have a couple of other points there.  We believe there should be a loan scheme for people who have been held up with TB because it can be catastrophic.  One other quick thing.  With Covid in the past two years, there was a relaxing of the regulation regarding calves such that you can sell them up to 120 days.  Our friends in the Department have at all stages said it has not impacted on TB whatsoever so we will be hoping that rule could be reapplied.  It has not since last September.  I will be willing to take any questions.  Our objective is that there will be no TB and so no need for compensation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan McCabe"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCabe and call Mr. Farrell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#C00400","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  The ICSA takes the opportunity to thank him and the committee for the invitation to appear on the topic of bovine TB eradication and to be back in the committee room.  We really appreciate it.<\/p> <p>  The TB problem remains one of the most difficult challenges faced by all of the stakeholders in agriculture.  For the past four years, the TB forum has provided a framework to chart a way forward.  Obviously, the Covid situation has impacted the work.   Nonetheless, the TB forum led to the publication of a national TB strategy.  To some extent, the strategy remains an aspirational document detached from the practical realities of implementing a programme that is workable and fair to all.  We are now working with the other stakeholders through a number of sub-groups of the TB forum.<\/p> <p>  The committee will undoubtedly be aware the Department is expressing concern at increasing costs for the programme.  There is the reality that EU funding has been cut and is likely to diminish further.  Our basic position is that all farmers must be treated fairly and that no farmer should be expected to carry an unacceptable financial cost towards the meeting of a national goal.  We do not accept the proposition that farmers can be asked to carry more cost.  The problem, as we have seen with Covid, is that measures to alleviate an infectious disease cost money and require public funds.  The more draconian the measures, the more public funds are required.<\/p><p>To some extent, we are concerned that the subgroups of the tuberculosis, TB, forum are not working in tandem.  Measures that hit farmers are being proposed at the implementation subgroup without reference to the finance subgroup.  However, the problem for sucklers is that, in certain cases, the loss of a cow has a lifetime impact on the calf.  The ICSA believes that the impact on the calf needs to be fully compensated for.  <\/p><p> We have several key asks.  We ask that on-farm market valuation is independent, reflects the real value of stock and is not subject to artificial limitations which deprive farmers of fair play.  We ask that the hardship grants and income supplement and depopulation grants must also reflect real costs, particularly in the context of increased costs and stock values, and they must also treat the farmers the same whether full-time or part-time.  It is completely unacceptable that more measures are being proposed to focus on cattle unless we have a comprehensive programme to deal with the undoubted wildlife elements of the TB spread.  We have seen that badger culling has been a necessary part of making progress, but there is a need to ensure that the badger vaccination programme is used to improve data collection on badger infection rates.<\/p><p> The Department cannot continue to wash its hands of the deer problem.  We know that deer infection rates are comparable to bovine rates.  It is very frustrating that the only answer farmers are getting is to look for a licence to shoot deer.  We want a proper forum to deal with the issues around deer and other State and State-sponsored bodies, such as Coillte, need to play their part as good neighbours.  Any new proposals will only be acceptable as part of an overall package.  <\/p><p> If the Department wants pre- or post-movement tests for cattle for fattening or in certain other scenarios, then there has to be an agreement in place for paying for this.  Farmers already pay enough for the annual herd test and this principle must be respected.  There are still problems with individual farmers who experience unacceptable delays in the removal of reactors.  The ICSA has been totally opposed to herd categorisation or any other process which leads to the devaluation of a farmer&rsquo;s herd.  There was strong resistance to mart board information and the unfortunate incident with the letters last year did not help.  Overall, the problem we see is that the Department wants to add considerably more burdens on farmers but is also trying to cut costs.  We are all in favour of fast-tracking the eradication of TB, but this implies spending money today in order to eliminate spending at a future date.  However, despite this, the cost of the programme is not escalating out of control.  It has increased by 12% over the past four years, but that must taken in the context of significant dairy expansion.  <\/p><p> The increase in dairy cows, compared to suckler cows, makes higher funding under the valuation scheme inevitable.  Dairy cows that are culled due to TB have very little salvage value compared to suckler cows.  Suckler cows usually are very valuable in a meat factory by comparison.  Therefore, if we have more dairy cows, we have more cows where the salvage value falls well short of the on-farm market valuation.<\/p><p> However, dairy expansion and the related increase in beef exports has also delivered a massive increase in State receipts through taxation, investment and employment.  The value of food and drink exports increased 21% between 2016 and 2021, or an extra &euro;2.3 billion.  The Exchequer cannot have it both ways.  Increased exports cannot come without some increase in the cost of the TB programme.  Total disposals of livestock, including slaughtering, live exports and deaths, increased by more than 500,000 head in the period 2012-2019.  In this context, the increased cost of the TB programme over the past four years at 12% is not unexpected and does not represent a disproportionately higher burden on Exchequer funds.<\/p><p> The cost of the programme is estimated at &euro;97 million in 2020, compared with &euro;87.5 million in 2012.  We think this does not fully capture the contribution of farmers.  The testing element, which farmers pay for, is costed at a national rate per animal tested, but we believe that many farmers, especially those on smaller or fragmented holdings, are paying more for testing.  It is also the case that the programme does not allocate a cost to farmers for their own time in testing cattle and other programme requirements.  <\/p><p> Department staff costs for 2020 were &euro;28.5 million, which is a figure that we have repeatedly challenged.  We do not understand how it makes sense that the Department figures show that its staff costs for administering the scheme are roughly equal to the costs of testing the entire national herd under the annual herd test, paid for by farmers, particularly when one considers that more than 95% of herds are clear and, therefore, these herds do not entail much interaction with the Department.<\/p><p> A sound strategy must be based on fair play for all farmers and a recognition that full and accurate compensation is the essential foundation of success.  Academic research is important, but we are talking about the livelihood of our members here.<\/p><p> I will add some general comments on compensation.  The ICSA wants to see a review of the financial impact of compensation arrangements on suckler and beef farmers.  In the case of suckler farmers, the entire business viability is very sensitive to selling at exactly the right time and weight.  For example, an enforced slaughtering of a calf before it reaches optimum weight for a weanling of 350 kg means that it will be undervalued.  Moreover, the remaining cohort of suckler calves will not be sold in time to achieve the best balance between price per kilogram and the cost.  Timing is also significant.  Weanlings are generally priced higher in July and August and therefore being locked up at this time can have serious implications for viability.  This impact is not captured by either the on-farm market valuation, depopulation or income supplement grants.  Likewise, the restrictions on buying in cattle or on selling at particular times of the year can have devastating impacts on the entire viability of an enterprise.  In terms of overall cost, the compensation scheme is only the third highest area of expenditure, well below the costs of testing and staff administration.<\/p><p> I will speak on on-farm market valuation.  In 2020, the cost of on-farm market valuation compensation is estimated at &euro;16.3 million.  Using the September 2019 to September 2020 data, there were 21,289 reactors which works out at &euro;769 per head average compensation cost in today's markets.<\/p><p> The ICSA believes that there is a particular problem with the valuation of high value animals being capped unfairly and that valuation should be always in line with the real market value of the animal, particularly in the case of breeding stock or pedigree stock.  Valuers should be free to fully and correctly value all animals and there should be no artificial cap on breeding or pedigree stock values.<\/p><p> Depopulation and income supplement grants are paid to help alleviate loss of income due to loss of stock.  The rate of dairy cows is &euro;55 per month and suckler cows at &euro;38, which presumably reflects loss of milk sales.  However, the problem of sucklers is that in certain cases, the loss of the cow has a lifetime impact on the calf.  ICSA believes that the impact on the calf needs to be fully compensated for.<\/p><p> The hardship grant is paid, in particular, to cover extra feed costs incurred during the winter feeding months as a result of being unable to sell stock.  It only applies where there is no off-farm income.  The rate of &euro;38 per suckler cow is reasonable except for the fact that the maximum payment is &euro;250 per month, which is totally inadequate to cover feed costs in many cases, particularly with recent inflation and it is outdated.  We also question why those with off-farm income are excluded.  This may be appropriate for high-net-worth individuals, but the suggestion that there is no financial hardship for someone with a modest level of off-farm income is absurd.<\/p><p>The TB forum will need to align the deliberations of all subgroups if we are to make progress.  We cannot accept new measures unless the thorny issue of funding and fair compensation is sorted.  It is also essential that the wildlife element to TB is given as much prominence as proposals for more farm restrictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I apologise because I will have to leave to go to the Seanad.  There is an important animal health and welfare and forestry Bill in the Seanad which is important and which relates to all of us here.  I will ask two or three questions.  I first thank all our guests for the comprehensive documentation they provided, which we have read and considered.  They add a great amount of weight to the discussion and the experience and knowledge of our guests is always paramount in formulating legislation and advocating on behalf of the agricultural industry.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Macra na Feirme.  I always say it would be helpful if submissions were made by the number because we have to number them ourselves.  Page 2 of Macra na Feirme&rsquo;s submission refers to providing disinfecting footpaths and overalls for personnel visiting their holdings.  I understand the significance of that but I am also conscious of a controversy that is regularly raised with me, namely, uninvited guests to agricultural holdings and those who sometimes assert that they have some sort of right of way.  It is becoming common for agricultural land to be tied up along greenways.  Even in Dublin, organisations are talking about keeping Ireland open.  While I have no problem with, I am also conscious that farm owners have private property rights that must be vindicated, and these farmers must also be supported.  That is another dynamic and challenge.  It is an area that I ask the farm organisations to direct some attention to.  I am always walking around the greenways and the countryside.  There are issues with this in terms of a source of infection.  It is an argument that the agricultural advocacy groups have not advanced enough.  I would be interested to hear about that.  I raise this issue because our guests from Macra na Feirme have raised it.  Perhaps they will address that point.<\/p> <p>  Everyone has covered the issue of the challenges around deer, the role of deer in the spread of disease and the need for further research and innovation in this area.  What do the witnesses mean by that?  What quick and simple measures could or should we look at?<\/p> <p>  The ICSA and the IFA both raised the issue of mart boards, which I am familiar with.  There is negativity around mart boards, which both groups mentioned in their submissions.  There has been extensive coverage of this issue in the media.  Farmers remain deeply dissatisfied with the way the Department has taken herd categorisation at marts upon itself and that is impacting negatively on prices.  This has the potential to seriously compromise the prices at the marts such that cattle could not be at the mart in the first place.  I would have thought cattle could not be at the mart if they are not clear of TB.  Why are we talking about the integrity of the TB test system?  It is ridiculous to suggest that about categorisation.  There is an element of the flawed pedigree and lower price mechanism about this.  I have an issue with that and many farmers have raised it with me as a concern.  I have seen it at first-hand and it is always nice to go to marts.  There is an issue there.  I will leave it at that because that is one of the biggest recurring issues and it one I regularly hear about from farmers.  The witnesses might comment on that.  What can we do about that and what is the alternative?  I see the flaws, the negativity and the impact on cattle prices in marts.  Farmers either have a clear bill of health and are in the mart because it is legal, right and appropriate to be there or they do not have a clear bill of health.  If not, what is the issue with the integrity of the system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#E00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the question.  I will touch on a few elements.  We talked about the biosecurity measures that are ongoing at farm level and the Senator mentioned disinfection and its use at farm level.  The wider context for that is the boundary fencing for farmers and the reduction of spread.  There are gaps within that, however.  With regard to the funding streams available for the security of farmyards, for example to protect from wildlife entering farmyards, there are no funding streams for that under TAMS.  To take Wicklow and the reservoir of Mycobacterium bovis in the deer population there, under TAMS there is no funding available to farmers for effective deer fencing or other supports to prevent deer from entering their land and engaging with their livestock enterprises.  Control of the sources of infection is as important as the on-farm practices that farmers are carrying out.  While work can be done to improve engagement and education, the sources that occur in farmyards and through deer populations must also be addressed through funding.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the perceived rights of individuals travelling on farmland.  There is a bigger discussion to be had around the impact that has, not only on the transmission of disease at farm level but also its implications for the legal rights of landowners.  The full expression of the legal rights of landowners must be looked at as well.  As has been highlighted around the country in recent months, we see cases of walkers taking dogs that are not under effective control out on land and these dogs end up worrying sheep.  There are a number of issues that must be addressed in the spread of disease from foreign bodies.  I refer to people entering into or trespassing on farms in that regard and to the impact their role has in dog worrying or sources of infection.<\/p> <p>  The Senator's last point was on display and mart boards and so forth.  It has been mentioned that equivalents to the TB forum have been done in other regions where eradication has been achieved or partially achieved.  It is important to note, and this has been highlighted in the TB forum as well, that the make-up of the mart sector in the Irish context is greatly different from the make-up of the sales arenas in other sectors.  In particular, it differs from those in overseas regions where there are tens or hundreds of animals in different lots.  In Ireland, animals are sold in individual lots of ones or twos.  A simple copycat of the measures introduced in other countries and jurisdictions to allow that will not work here or provide a fair and transparent market return for farmers.<\/p> <p>  It is Macra na Feirme's view, which is shared by many, that this market disturbance will further negatively impact farmers who are suffering from a TB breakdown.  We have already touched on the impact on them from the effect of the TB, whether that be the hardship support grant or others which members will see in our submission, and the implications in costs incurred by the farmer as a result of the disease.  Thereafter, for a protracted period, perhaps three, four or five years, the farmer is in a negative market trading position.  The farmer suffers for three, four or five years as a result of a breakdown that may not be his or her fault and could also receive a lower return from the market as a result.  The science tells us that one third of farms that become infected with TB will have a reoccurrence of infection within the following two or three years.  There will be a cycle of continued impact on that farmer as a result of that.  The financial impact that will have on farmers needs to be given much greater thought and it needs to be established that it will work for farmers.  We should not think only of the effect it will have on the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I will address the final issue Macra na Feirme raised in its opening statement, namely, categorisation and the concerns and challenges around that.

The Department has become a little hung up, for want of a better word, on the idea that the track record of a farm over several years would be presented on mart boards or under herd categorisation, such as in letters sent to farmers.  The implication is that, even though a farmer may be clear of TB and his or her herd may have passed the TB test, he or she may be somehow less safe as a source of livestock than his or her neighbour because his or her farm had TB, say, three or four years ago and the neighbour did not.  We think that is a dangerous road to go down because the implication is the devaluation of one herd against another.  Moreover, it will ultimately devalue the merit of the herd test.  If someone's herd test indicates that all the stock is clear, that must be either accepted, as is the foundation of the entire TB programme, or not accepted.  While it may have made some academic sense to examine this from some sort of research point of view, in the real commercial world in which farmers have to operate it creates an appalling vista whereby people would be financially devastated by having their herds devalued.  In tandem with that, when we discuss the Department&rsquo;s concerns about the cost of compensation, for example, we cannot now introduce an element that creates a significant devaluation of some stock that has nonetheless passed the TB test, and not accept that has incredible implications for the cost of the programme as a whole.<\/p> <p>  For those reasons, we in the ICSA and other farm organisations are deeply alarmed at the proposal that this information would be shown on mart boards.  As committee members will be aware, mart proceedings are now shown live on video as well, so it would mean advertising the information far and wide.  Furthermore, even though we succeeded in getting that rolled back, a letter sent out last year seemed to create an impetus to reintroduce that topic by the back door.  We do not accept it is a good road to go down.  The TB testing programme either works or it does not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#F00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Punch"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>On the mart boards issue, as the Senator will be aware, it was a proposal from the original TB forum that was implemented by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine without any agreement or discussion with farm organisations.  It was subsequently removed from the process.  Unfortunately, however, as the previous speaker outlined, the categorisation the Department carried out of all the herds in this country remains, given that it continues to be published at the top of our annual TB test letter.  The information continues to be there despite the fact there are significant issues with data protection, which was breached, from our perspective.  We lodged a complaint with the relevant office to have the matter investigated.  Farmers' private data, based on historical trading interactions with other herd owners, have been communicated throughout the country unnecessarily, with a severe impact on the potential for many herds to have further trading arrangements with those farmers.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked what the alternative is.  There is no a need for an alternative because devaluing farmers' stock for a prolonged period of five to six years, having undergone the burden of a TB restriction in the first instance for a period of anything from six months to two years, does nothing to eradicate TB.  We have considerable problems with TB on the 4% farmers where it exists, but TB remains a low-prevalence disease.  The vast majority of TB episodes on farms relates to two animals or fewer, and we have to bear that in mind when we talk about controls and the appropriateness of controls in controlling the disease.<\/p> <p>  The other substantive point is that TB is primarily a disease of older animals, with two thirds of TB reactors in this country coming from the cow population, yet our entire agriculture sector is based on the trade of younger animals.  This crude approach by the Department to eradicate TB, which has no basis in science, has had the impact of devaluing 75% of the animals that are traded in this country, which were at an extremely low risk of ever being found with TB.  It was an unnecessary approach and it does not require an alternative.  It is not part of the current programme but, at this week's TB forum, it was again raised by the Department as a proposal for enhancements to the 2023 programme before we have fully implemented the agreed improvements and enhancements to the current programme from last year, particularly in respect of wildlife.<\/p> <p>  The herd categorisation does not contribute to the eradication of disease and has no place in the Irish TB programme because it fails to recognise the unique dynamic of the Irish farm infrastructure and the high dependence of the vast majority of farmers in this country on trade, whereby weanlings are born on small-scale farms in the peripheral areas of the country that are subsequently traded to larger farms for feeding, and whereby dairy farms need to move calves from their farms to sustain and maintain the production systems we have.  Neither science nor the figures back up any further advance in the devaluing of our herds through this blacklisting approach and we continue to reject it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s Bourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>All four organisations raised the issue of wildlife.

Unfortunately, there is clear evidence the badger population has increased dramatically and a huge number of setts have not been mapped.  Boots on the ground are critical for that.<\/p> <p>  On deer management, we are clear.  The establishment of a deer management forum, which will look after density reduction around TB outbreak areas, needs to happen immediately.  In that context, our former regional vice president Tom Short was key in establishing a programme in Wicklow that identified a strain correlated from cattle, and that linked the disease from deer to cattle, which then spread.  The density of deer in TB outbreaks is a crucial problem and has to be addressed early.  We are very clear it is a problem in Wicklow, where it has proven so.  We have to ensure a deer management forum will be properly set up and that people will take responsibility.  At the moment, people are not taking responsibility.  A national deer forum needs to be established, with responsibility placed at its door, in order that when disease outbreaks occur, a proper management programme will be instigated, density will be reduced and proper management of the population will flow throughout the country.

As with bovine, the Department is lacking in its responsibility of taking care of them, and reducing numbers.

After the three years, it was still found in the fully vaccinated zone that 24% of the badgers in that area that were caught after the three-year period were still carrying the infection of bovine TB.  There still is work to be done in terms of effectiveness and in terms of the endurance of the vaccine for protection.  We are all well aware of Covid and we are boosted three, four and five times.  The research still needs to be done in terms of the effectiveness and how long that lasts within the badger population.  The research from the study to which I referred would suggest that even after three years there was still a certain amount of infection transferring within the badger population.<\/p> <p>  An earlier study conducted in Offaly in the early 2000s drew significant links between a reduction in the density of the badger population and the occurrence and frequency of the infection of mycobacterium, M, bovis within the bovine population.  Work still needs to be done there.  As for simple acceptance that we have that solved in the badger population and once we get them vaccinated we will be fine, from our side of things there is still more research needed to be done there.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the deer population, and I understand that the Department was in in front of the committee not too long ago speaking about this as well, the numbers of deer that have been captured and tested for lesions are very small.  Over 200 is the most that have been tested in any calendar year that have been captured, and results from that are available as well.  In more recent years, as a result of Covid fewer than 100 deer have been captured to distinguish the prevalence of TB, with the numbers in the region of three or four out of 70 or 80 that have come back testing positive for the presence of the strain within the deer population.  The Department has been on the record in saying that it cannot ultimately deny - in front of this committee - the possibility that in high-density areas of the deer population there is the ability of the strain of M bovis to transfer from deer to cattle.  If we look across the world, the research in places such as America, Australia and New Zealand would also show that there is prevalence and the possibility that the strains of M bovis can be carried in animals such as foxes.  The research needs to continue, but also there need to be controls in terms of the density of the populations in high-prevalence areas.  The evidence would suggest that the control of the wildlife in those areas has resulted in the occurrence and frequency of occurrence within the bovine population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank all our guests for being here.

I suppose we go back to go forward here.  Members will be acutely aware of our position on the original TB forum that was established because it is important we make a distinction here.<\/p> <p>  There was a TB forum established a number of years ago that effectively provided one opportunity for one representative from each farm organisation to have an input along with all stakeholders.  Despite only two stakeholders contributing to the programme - one being the Department or the State and the other being farmers - we had multiple stakeholders that were deemed to have equal voice to farmers in discussing the TB programme.  The approach in that group was that effectively we would be called together, lectured on what the Department felt should be done and three months later we would see a press release outlining changes to the TB programme.  The original TB forum was in no way fit for purpose and we are on public record already in stating that.<\/p> <p>  However, the new TB strategy has addressed significantly many of the shortcomings in that.  There is now a structure where the TB forum is effectively the overall body that oversees the work of the sub-committees.  Part of our submissions to amendments to the original TB forum was to ensure that those impacted by the decisions that were to be taken would be actively involved in the discussions and the decision-making on how they would be practically implemented at farm level.<\/p> <p>  The new TB forum, that has grown, I suppose, or has been set out in the strategy that was launched last year, has sub-groups.  The implementation working group is one of those.  The critical issue there is that the TB forum deals with high-level principle ideas, suggestions and proposals but the work of the implementation working group is to take that down to what would this look like at farm level, how would this work on farms, what impact it would have on farms and whether it is practical to even implement it based on what the costs associated would be.<\/p><p>The financial working group allows for detailed discussions around the appropriate levels of financial support for farmers, such as amendments to the live valuation scheme and targeting of income loss supports.  The scientific working group is the forward-looking group.  We have a technical group dealing with the more technical aspects of live valuation and various schemes to avoid these getting all hung up in one big round table.<\/p><p> To answer Deputy Carthy's question, we believe the strategy provides the basis for us to progress the TB programme, but the success of the IFA, the groups and the forum will be measured by taking the appropriate decisions and having them implemented at farm level.  One of the frustrations coming through at this point is that some significant decisions have been taken.  For example, decisions were taken to enhance the wildlife control programme and funding has been provided to implement those enhancements, but we have not seen that happen on the ground.

In our view, it seems strange, if we compare it, for example, to the &euro;2 million spent on research.<\/p> <p>  We would also like to see results from research rather than just spending &euro;2 million on it every year.  Research should come to a conclusion and there should be results, but there is definitely a need to allocate more resources to the wildlife programme and the culling of deer.  For three or four years, we have listened to the Department wash its hands of the deer problem by stating people can get a licence to shoot deer if they like.  That is not good enough.  The Department has also been of the view that this is not a problem because the incidence rate is low, but the limited amount of testing it has done of deer has shown an incidence of 3% to 4% TB infectivity, which is the same level as that in the cattle herd.  There is, therefore, a big problem with deer.<\/p><p>Some &euro;27 million in farmers' money, or &euro;35 million including the payment of disease levies, is spent on testing bovines.  Very little money is being spent on testing badgers that are being vaccinated, though, so we do not know what the story is there.  Realistically speaking, no money is being spent on testing or culling deer.  It is clear that there is an imbalance in the way the budget is being spent.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the &euro;28.5 million in administrative costs, we do not understand how it is that high.  Think about it.  Everyone here knows what is involved in a herd test.  It is heavy work.  The entire national herd is tested for the same cost as the administrators dealing with the 4.5% of herds that have reactors.  There is something amiss here.  The issue is that a cost is being allocated across a range of veterinary staff and is being attributed to TB.  We would question that.

It will have to be based on research and science without having a negative impact on farmers' market returns or without the on-farm actions required to eradicate TB being so onerous as to make the cure worse than the disease.

It has never been more valuable around the world than it is right now, and we have one of the great resources.  The largest impediment to protecting that seems to be an unwillingness to front-load investment.  Everyone around the farming table has shown a commitment to investing in science and what are effectively more restrictions on farmers.  Restrictions mean hardship for farmers.  We were clear in our submission, in that we are targeting increased rates of income supplement - &euro;110 per cow, &euro;55 per dairy cow and &euro;55 per suckler cow - and an increase in the hardship fund.  TB means a significant income loss for farmers.  We make no apologies for defending the rights of the 4,000 farmers annually who suffer income losses because of it.  We must protect them.  We must ensure that they stay in business.  They are a vital resource for the country.  Two elements are critical to achieving this: finance for the wildlife programme and putting boots on the ground.  We are a broken record but this is the reality.  To reduce the incidence rate in the animal population, we must invest in reducing the incidence rate among the wildlife population.  We must protect the businesses of those farmers who are suffering because of TB breakouts.<\/p> <p>  The model is up for debate; the Department has asked this question.  We are willing to engage in that debate.  Openness and transparency are crucial.  We are clear on this, in that, if the Department is of the view that everyone is entitled to be part of this programme, then everyone should be involved in investing in it.  Farmers contribute in excess of &euro;55 million annually.  That is one hell of an investment.  If other bodies feel that they have an entitlement to be part of the decision-making process, then they should be required to pay into it.  We did not invent the forum.  Rather, it is what has been presented to us.<\/p> <p>  Our number one priority is to protect the bovine industry and the livelihoods of our farmers.  That is our request of the Oireachtas Members who are present in this room or online.  This is going to require a front-loading of investment.  We have invested in the science to protect us, but it requires front-loading and full recognition of everyone's investment.  We are part of that.  We are tied into it.  We have no choice but to target 2030.  That is eight years of further restrictions on families.  That is eight years of income hardship and people suffering.  That might sound like an exaggeration but the income losses on farms as a result of TB outbreaks are significant.  It is our job to protect farmers and we make no apologies for that.<\/p> <p>  The Department's financial working group has opened the debate on a model.

From our perspective, there is an unwillingness to pay for the current control programmes on TB that are in place.  That unwillingness will result in the 2030 target for TB eradication not being achieved.  Further proposals were outlined to the TB forum on what further restrictions they want to bring in.  The main TB forum is considering bringing in further restrictions and the implementation group and financial group want us to tighten our belts in terms of the funding that is put towards it.  Those two rail tracks will not meet and that will mean the 2030 target will not achieved.  It will also mean that we, as farmers, will not be fully compensated for the strain that will be put on us if further restrictions are introduced.  That is the simple answer as to where we are going with that.  The finances do not add up.<\/p> <p>  On the feedlots and the distortion in prices, in a roundabout way, that has a wider perspective.

I will deal with the question on the controlled finishing units first.  From our perspective, we are firmly of the view that they were vital and have proved to be such for beef farmers to be able to continue to function because of our TB programme.  As anybody in agriculture knows, once a farmer has a TB reactor or even a suspected TB reactor, for example, in the form of a lesion spotted in the factory, the farmer's herd is restricted in terms of purchasing in and selling out.  Most finishing farms and beef farmers with 50 to 60 cattle only buy in and sell out to the factory.  Unfortunately, when a lesion shows up, it takes eight to ten weeks to establish its status and the farmer is prohibited from trading and from purchasing in, which is the lifeblood of that farm.  All those beef finishing farmers who do not have breeding animals on their farm have been forced down the years to become registered as controlled finishing units in order to be allowed to continue to do their business.  They undergo two herd tests a year and that removes from them from the 60-day testing, the factory lesions process and the prohibition on purchasing in.  It has been crucial for those farmers.  It is important we distinguish between those and what the Deputy referenced in the context of processor-owned large units.  The vast majority of ordinary finishing beef farmers because of the TB programme have had no choice down the years but to become registered as controlled finished units in order to be able to continue to do their business.<\/p> <p>  There has been a second major benefit in that regard from the point of view of farmers restricted with TB in their herds.  There are a number of components to the way the TB programme impacts on farms.  The main one is the restriction because it is a low prevalence disease.  The restriction prohibits the farmer from selling his animals on the open market.  As the Deputy would know, suckler farmers depend at the end of the year on selling their weanlings, as they do not have the feed or housing to hold those animals.  Amendments to the TB programme dating back 15 or more years provided that trade from restricted farms to controlled finishing units, or feedlots as they were called then, was facilitated.  Any farmer who is restricted because of TB in his herd, who has culled cows and who has store cattle and weanlings that he must sell but for which he does not have the feed or the housing can sell them into a controlled finishing unit.  Those are not unique to Ireland.  They are facilitated in other EU member states.  It is important we distinguish between the two, namely, the impact with respect to potentially large processor owned units and with respect to those who are called the same thing but are stand-alone ordinary farmers doing their daily grind and trying to avoid the impact of the TB programme on them doing their business while at the same time offering a major service to other farmers restricted because of TB.<\/p> <p>  On the question of whether departmental funding is being used as efficiently as it could be, I would say it most certainly is not.  Everything would have to be reviewed in a funding model for the future.  I will give the Deputy an example.  Despite all the reports and technology we have on mart prices, and anybody can pick up a phone and get a mart price anywhere in the country, the Department, in compiling the summary weekly prices for the live valuations scheme, persists in sending agricultural officers out to sit in marts to record prices.  In this day and age and with the technology available, that is certainly a waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money and of funding for the TB programme.  That is one small example of it.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, we will have to agree a funding model for the future but that will only commence when there is full transparency on all the costings, including the cost the Department put forward and claimed for its contribution.  It will also require a correct appraisal of the cost what we, as farmers, have put in.  At present, the Department claims its labour is worth almost four times farmers&rsquo; labour in carrying out the TB programme in a year.  A Grant Thornton report estimates all we are worth is &euro;8 million to facilitate the testing of 9 million animals on our farms, including the time it takes to do that.  Yet the departmental staff's contribution to that same programme is worth &euro;27.5 million.  There is certainly a need for an in-depth review of it and full transparency on every line of it.  It cuts both ways.  <\/p> <p>  On the question on whether TB can be eradicated without vaccination, unfortunately, it will have to be eradicated without vaccination.  While the purposes of the TB programme originally were different its main function currently is to enable us to continue to access export markets for our produce.  Unfortunately, the criteria set out in all the trade regulations, EU trade directives and international trade arrangements we have require TB freedom.  Even if the marker vaccine on which work is currently being done, in which the Department is involved, can be developed - this is probably be eight to ten years down the road - a fundamental change to the trading rules with member states and all our trading partners would be required.  I am not sure they would be overly flexible given that they do not want TB.  There are seasons when it is not predominant.  It is not as simple as saying we could vaccinate a herd.  When the prevalence of the disease is reduced in the badger population, the vaccine used in that population may play a role, but it will not remove the need to manage the population and keep the density at a level where the disease is not spread among them, which is what we have in the deer population.<\/p> <p>  To finish on the Deputy's substantive point, he rightly identified there is a fundamental issue with the compensation levels.  The ask to compensate farmers fairly through the various schemes has been costed.  It would cost only an additional &euro;7 million to offset all the financial impact of the TB programme on farmers.  That is costed by the Department to provide full income loss for every animal removed from the date it is identified on the farm.  We do not believe that is a major ask for the 4,000 farmers who are losing their animals in the TB programme considering what we, as farmers, put into it year in, year out in order to recognise the impact it is having on farmers' livelihoods.  This has been costed.  It is not figure that is off the radar.  The methodology by which we arrived at the &euro;110 per month for a dairy cow and &euro;56 for a suckler cow was based on the national farm survey over a three-year average because we will get peaks and troughs.<\/p><p>Obviously, when an animal is removed from the farm, some costs are no longer incurred but other fixed costs remain and these have been costed on to the production of the animal.  Other variables have also been taken into account.  Seven or eight years ago, we used a methodology whereby we took the three-year period of the national farm survey and we repeated that process three years ago.  We took three years as a rolling average and the figures did not change much.  If we were to run them today, they would increase.<\/p><p> We are seeking to have this methodology, which removes all ambiguity, used.  Let us use a three-year rolling average and be fair to every farmer.  If an animal is being taken from a farm in the national interest and for the greater good, the farmer should not be out of pocket because TB is not a farmer-caused problem.  The main driver of TB is a protected species of wildlife over which we have no control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s Bourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I will follow up on Deputy Carthy's question on feedlots, much of which Mr. Bourke has covered under the different categories.  As he rightly said, we need it there as part of the TB programme, where there are stressed herds and numbers of cattle have to be sold or moved on.  A lesson has also been learned over the past year or two, which we need to take on board, in terms of Covid, new testing and PCR.  When an animal goes to the factory and has a lesion or whatever, there is no reason the farmer should wait 60 days or more for the test to culture.  We have a PCR system that can return results in 24 to 48 hours.  We have the laboratories available.  They have been proven to work and have worked through Covid.  That has been a massive saving for farmers and has allowed them to trade and be in business.  That has to be the case for the Government too.  Instead of monitoring something for 60 days, it should be done in two days to roll over the system and keep moving.  This needs to be directed.  We need to learn our lessons and move on, instead of staying static.<\/p> <p>  With regard to feedlot status, while there are many feedlots in the country, they are directed through the Department.  In many cases, animals are bought to feed that have continuous lesions.  Some of those people could have herd tests five times in a year with no skin reactor, yet lesions may appear again in the factory within days.  This is not working.  The skin test is not accurate.  The farmer suffers when a lesion is found and is locked out of trading for months.  Nobody can afford to lose trading time.  We have to get round this.<\/p> <p>  This is what builds up the numbers granted feedlot status.  The Department is giving them the option of pre- or post-testing or going into feedlot status which, as Mr. Bourke said, is one test per year or two in some cases.  We need to take this on board and with the help and direction of the committee, we might help to drive that further.

The Department is imposing on many farmers that they should go feedlot status.  It is being done by the Department directly.

It is always great to hear and see them.  They give such an informed insight into the industry and we learn an awful lot when they come in.  I will deal with each of the groups.  I have one question for each of them.  An outsider looking in would say it has taken us 70 years to get this far.  We went from a prevalence rate of bovine TB of 80% with 17% infections to just 4%.  We are marketed as one of the most ambitious, intelligent and technologically-advanced countries in the world and we still have not been able to eradicate TB.<\/p> <p>  Hypothetically speaking, if a large public limited company, plc, or multinational company decided to take over Irish farming and suddenly became \"Irish Farming plc\", the first decision it would make to reduce costs and streamline farming would be to eradicate TB because the disease costs the guts of &euro;100 million per year.  If an additional &euro;10 million was front-loaded into eradication every year, the problem would surely be resolved within ten years.<\/p> <p>  We are constantly told about the tight margins with which farmers are working.  Whether the direct and indirect costs to farmers amount to &euro;35 million or &euro;55 million, if that was put back in farmers' pockets, it would substantially improve the sector.  I am sure the Department would prefer not to be spending &euro;27 million on this each year.  All told, it makes sense to eradicate TB by 2030.<\/p> <p>  I will put questions to Macra na Feirme first.  Mr. Keane is gone so I am not sure whether Ms Richardson or Mr. Fitzgerald wishes to respond.  New Zealand was cited as one of the examples of best practice throughout the world.  I am conscious of the time.  As succinctly as possible, will Macra na Feirme give us an example of a country where TB has been eradicated or all but eradicated?

That will be the key thing we can do in this country.  It is probably hard to compare Ireland with any other country.  New Zealand is probably similar as it also has a grass-based model and animals are outdoors all year around.

If it goes to another herd, more problems arise because if the testing is not done on time, the herd is locked up for 30 days.

It is based on information provided by the Department.  We will submit all of that.  It makes for interesting reading and validates the position that has been adopted regarding pre-movement and post-movement testing because it avoids any impact in the marketplace on the bulk of the animals we trade.<\/p> <p>  As has been noted, Scotland has eradicated TB.  As a result of that, we engage directly with farmers, vets and elected farm representatives in Scotland to see exactly what they did differently from us. The substantive message is that they did not have a TB problem in the wildlife like we did and, therefore, their on-farm animal controls were adequate.  When we discussed the controls we had in place, even prior to amending them, the people we spoke to were of the view that they had achieved eradication with lesser on-farm controls.  The disease has to be addressed in wildlife in order to address it in the bovine population.  Until you break that link you cannot achieve eradication.  The answer in that regard is that Scotland did not have to do anything with deer from the point of view of TB.  They also did not have to do anything with badgers as there was not the same level of interaction because of the location of the two species.  Unfortunately, we have a situation where there is very close interaction between badgers and cattle and there is a high prevalence of disease within the badgers.  It is cyclical and you have to break it within both species.  We cannot just focus on cattle.  We have to reduce the density of badgers.<\/p> <p>  It is the same principle with deer.  The Department has regularly referenced studies on this.  Any real disease control is based on density reduction and reducing the opportunity for spread.  That is why the peak of the problem is in Wicklow, although it is now being replicated elsewhere.  As the national deer population has been allowed to increase year on year without any natural predator, density has increased and their level of encroachment on farmland has increased dramatically.  The key issue here is density reduction around TB outbreaks and a national control programme to bring the deer back to a population level that is sustainable within their environment.  We do not need a census.  The measure will be when the deer are being maintained in their own natural habitat and we as farmers are no longer feeding them in our fields, and they are no longer mixing with our cattle, knocking our fences or affecting our plantations.  That will be the census for us as farmers and that will reduce the disease threat. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s Bourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bourke.

There are so many aspects, including deer, badgers, inconclusive results, and testing, that need to be pulled together.  There is not just one thing.

It has been a very interesting session.  It is very interesting to hear all the angles and takes on the matter.  TB testing has been going on since I was a young fellow anyway.  That was quite a while ago.  We did succeed in the warble fly eradication and with brucellosis.  Other countries have practically got rid of TB and what is happening here is worrying.  It is very clear that the deer and badgers are causing the problem.  The deer have moved into farms.  Before they were in the national park and up on the top of the mountains but they are practically inside our village now.  Many is the morning you could go over the road and there will be a deer that has been killed by a car just outside the 30 km\/h limit area.  They are inside the town in Killarney.  Something has to be done about that.  It is time now because not enough recognition is being given to the upset this is causing to farmers.  One man told me how he was locked up and got clear.  Then, after ten months, he was locked up again.  Another constituent, Tim, is a milking man who sold six cows the other day in a mart.  One was killed out with lesions but now they are telling him that he will not get any test results back for two months.  He says when his father went down 40 years ago, the lorry came and took the offending animals and two days later they were tested.  There are more laboratories now with more testing ability.  Surely it should not take 60 days to come back with a definite result or that he cannot be tested until then?  It think Mr. Bourke mentioned young cattle and calves.  This man will be loaded with 60 calves that he has no housing for.  It is February.  They cannot go out in a field until May around our way.  It poured in Kerry yesterday and it was the grandest day of the year here.  We have a different climate down there.  It is heading for more of that.  Something needs to be done to help the likes of that man.<\/p> <p>  We have been told by the witnesses there were 20,000 reactors and 4,000 herds.  Those figures are massive.  I am sure that if something was done with the deer and the badgers, it would help.  I will give an example of another farmer.  He was a small milking man in the middle of other, bigger dairy farms.  They kept going down continuously.  They might get clear for a bit and then they would go down again; they would get clear again and go down again.  This man, inside the middle of them, never went down.  I will tell you why.  What he did may have been illegal but he stopped the badgers coming in.  He dealt with the badgers.  In one year he dealt with 111, big and small.  That proves that the badgers are causing the problem.  Now, I do not condone that -  I am asking that they either be vaccinated or culled properly - but they cannot keep this thing going.  Farmers' backs and hands are broken and help is very scarce, as the Chair knows.   <\/p> <p>  There was mention of the thrill seeker who said that all farms and all of Ireland should be opened up to walkers.  I do not approve of that.  We can see what is happening with the deer where these fellows can go from one farm to the next without any control and can wander around.  I bet if you went to his house, he most likely would have an electric gate and you would not get inside that.  He is the very same man who wants to open up the country, spread disease and do what he likes.  He might bring an old dog with him or something that would hunt sheep.  These are ridiculous types of suggestions and statements.  I know that the Chair would not approve of that and nor would any of the representatives here. <\/p> <p>  I am very grateful to have the opportunity to listen to everyone.  I came in here the very minute I knew they were here.  I appreciate everything.  I know that they are good men to have on the farmers' side and I appreciate them very much.  I am happy to give any help that I can give to do something about the deer.  The deer are fine.  We have nothing against deer but they must go up the hills away out of the farmers' fields and let the farmers farm.  Things are tough enough.  Look at the fertiliser and everything.

Mr. Bourke spoke about keeping control of the deer.  I do not know how we will do it for the simple reason that anywhere you sow a bit of new grass, you see them ploughing in from the woods.  There are more and more woods everywhere.  I just do not know how we will do it.  How does Mr. Bourke see us doing that?<\/p> <p>   Mr. Farrell has helped me with a few different problems and I thank him for that.  I would like the others to answer this question.  There seems a problem around the country whereby if I went out with, say eight or ten cattle, a valuer would come out and then the Department would say that it did not like the price and would send someone out again.  The Department sends someone out again and while that person will not give a straight answer one way or another as to whether he or she agrees with the valuation, he or she will expect to bring your cattle.  Not many people like to see their cattle going out of the yard without knowing what they are getting.  This seems to be a problem with the Department the whole time.  It will not agree with the first price or the second price but they expect a farmer to put his or her cattle on a lorry without having been given a price.  I think it is a complete disgrace.  The least the Department should do would be to say that it would give one or other price and they could battle it out for the difference.<\/p> <p>  There was discussion about vaccination and reactors.  Will someone educate me on this?  My understanding was that when you take these samples that they have to incubate in some way.<\/p><p>I am not a scientist and I do not know anything about it but it has to incubate and that is why it needs a certain number of days.  Is that correct or not?  Maybe I am reading it wrong.  They are vaccinating badgers.  We must be careful too what we say because it is about when the badger gets it in one place and he is pegged out of the den and brings it off down the road to give to other cattle.  We cannot just say every badger is at fault, in fairness.  Sometimes badgers that are in places never get infected and you leave them alone because the last thing you want to do is put them flying around the place.  We should put out that message so everyone is not just going out saying every badger in the country is at fault.  It is the same for deer.  I noticed one thing with the badgers.  I understand that even with the vaccinated badgers, 8% to 10% of them are still showing up TB.  Why is that?<\/p><p> I have another question for the representatives.  If I am a farmer on 30, 40 or 50 acres and am working somewhere and go down with TB I do not get the hardship money because I am working.  Where are we at with that?  Is there a feeling among the farming organisations - no more than with us many's the time, because I will call it out straight - that Departments will bring them in to have a meeting and this, that and the other and then next week or the following one they will announce something that may not be agreed with the organisations?  The Departments then just drive on regardless of who is there.  Is that a problem?  Is there a problem that they are not listening?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#N00400","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Who wants to go first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#O00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s Bourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I have one last question as I wrote down a few points.

I thank the Deputy.  It falls in and I might just pick the specific compensation questions first.  On the pedigree cattle, the Deputy is clearly referring to the ceilings within the scheme, which are not appropriate.  It is supposed to be an on-farm market valuation scheme.  As a farmer, if your animal goes down as a TB reactor you are entitled to get through that scheme the value you would reasonably expect the animal to get on the open market.  As the Deputy and I both know, the current ceilings were not even covering some of the commercial cattle sold in marts in his own county and indeed across the country.  That is under review under the live valuation scheme.  There was a Grant Thornton review of that.  It is one of the areas where changes have been sought.  Discussions are ongoing to agree that through the financial working group dealing specifically with the live valuation scheme.<\/p> <p>  The key issue there is maintaining the independence of the valuers.  The system has become way too prohibitive and constrained.  It is effectively a box-ticking exercise with qualified auctioneers and valuers being paid to go out and write down tag numbers.  We are looking for simplification of this system.  These people are approved by the Department having undergone a tender process, are then trained by the Department, have auctioneering qualifications and are selling cattle four or five days a week in the marketplace.  We do not need a 40-page booklet telling them which box to push the weanling into and which box to push the cow into.  A simplification of the live valuation scheme is being sought.  Let these experienced people go out and assess the animal based on their knowledge of the market.  Take away all the bureaucracy around it.  We referenced earlier all the money being wasted sending Department AOs around to sit in marts.  They sit in the very mart the independent valuer is an auctioneer in to write on a page to send to Dublin, to send back down to the man who sold the bullock, the price he should give for a similar bullock when he goes out to a farmer's yard.  Going back to the Deputy's other point about whether the money is being used correctly and efficiently, it certainly is not and there is another example.  With the controls that are there we as farmers are not being allowed to get the correct value of our animal because that valuer is being hamstrung by bureaucracy and conditions around it.  We are seeking that the ceilings be changed and that is under discussion.  It applies to all animals because it has not been just a pedigree issue, as the Deputy is aware.  Some high-quality springing heifers made well in excess of the &euro;3,000 ceiling that is there.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is 100% right on the information the farmer gets when he is asked to accept or reject a valuation.  This is an issue we raised with the Department again last week.  It is not only on the second valuation.  On the first valuation the farmer is being asked to sign a V8 form but there is no actual value of the animals in the V8 form.  He is given a valuation sheet that might have nine or ten animals on it, such as within calf, not in calf and various prices.  There is no total.  Then he is asked to sign a V8 form asking whether he accepts the first valuation.  But what is the first valuation?  This is the substantive point we have made.  The Deputy is right.  The farmer must be given full sight of the price on offer to him.  We accept there may be variables.  If the pregnancy status of the cow has a big bearing on the value, we can say it is either-or or put that caveat in but it certainly cannot and should not continue with a blank sheet because you do not know where you are going.  Then you have the arbitration process, as the Deputy rightly identified.<\/p> <p>  On the hardship grant moneys, any farmer with enough farm income is not eligible for them.  That is one of the problems.  The biggest problem with the hardship grant moneys is the actual rate of pay.  It is a maximum payment of &euro;350 a month.  While it is better than nothing, it certainly does not reflect the additional costs of maintaining 20, 30 or 40 weanlings if you are a suckler farmer who is set up to sell them in the back end of the year.  Equally, from a dairy farmer's perspective as referenced by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae referenced earlier, the &euro;250 does not go any way towards the cost of maintaining those 50 or 60 calves in February, March and April.  We have sought fundamental changes to that which the committee will have seen from previous submissions.  It is very easy to cost this and quantify it.  If you are forced to maintain animals you ordinarily resold because of a TB restriction, your AIM system will show if you sold them last year and now you are forced to keep them.  Teagasc has all the costs of maintaining these animals.  These schemes need to be built on those real-time costs to offset the impact on the farm.<\/p> <p>  On the control of deer, it must be national.  There was good work, or some good work, done by the original deer management forum.  In Wicklow, two or three pilot areas were set up to see how you could address this within hotspot areas, that is, areas where studies found 16% of the deer had TB.  The message here is it is a multi-stakeholder approach but somebody must be in charge and be responsible.  Our view is that should be the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine because it is responsible for TB and the biggest and most identifiable threat deer are causing at the moment is TB.

We need to deal with the national population and get them pushed back, as was identified, into their own national environment because at the moment it is us maintaining the national deer population.   The hills have been allowed to become overgrown.  They are not fools when they get used to the better food and forage.  They are down now along the coast in Wicklow.  This is a national issue that must be dealt with in a co-ordinated national plan to reduce the numbers.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked the question about the lesions and the length of time.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae had the same point.  Unfortunately, if the status of the lesion cannot be identified under histology done within a few days of the sample going into the lab, which is effectively looking at it under the microscope to determine definitively if it is TB or not, then it must go on to culture.  The approval of the culture test requires you to get a negative a minimum timeframe of six weeks in the platelet to see does the TB organism grow or not.  If it grows you get the positive result a bit earlier, unfortunately.  There is work being done on other tests that are quicker.  The Department is starting to run some tests to get early recognition.  What they can tell you is that you will perhaps be restricted a bit sooner.  The difficulty here is, from the point of view of EU animal health law, there are criteria set out and tests identified that you must pass in order to have your trade status established.  It is ultimately down to the trade status and that is the frustrating thing.  The bigger issue with the lesions is we have a situation in this country - probably forced on us because of the requirements of EU regulations - that every TB outbreak is the same, whether you identify 30 TB reactors in your skin test or a factory lesion that confirms a positive result, you are restricted for a minimum of 120 days.<\/p><p>Yet we know that in this country 85% of herds with a positive factory lesion do not have any more TB reactors.  It is not a good indicator of a TB problem on a farm.  We have continually pushed the Department to treat those farms differently.  If we are putting in tighter controls where there is a lot of TB, we must counterbalance that.  We accept that EU approval is required for that but the facts, figures and science are there.  We can offset the impact of many of these restrictions if we can move that forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s Bourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I will respond to a couple of points although Mr. Bourke has, in fairness, covered most of them.

There is &euro;97 million for the programme, 17% of which goes to on-farm market valuation.  There is a difference between the salvage value, the factory price, and the on-farm market valuation.  We have consistently argued that the Department is getting a bad deal in the price it gets from factories.  The standard response of the Department is, to put it in colloquial terms, that its hand is in the dog's mouth.  That is not good enough.  The Department could do a better deal with meat factories.  It is the differential.<\/p> <p>  The second part is that it seems to us an inordinate amount of money wasted on fighting over a few shillings and objecting to the valuations that are put in place by the independent valuers in the first instance.  It would be an interesting area for the committee to consider.  We are doing that as well.  Perhaps the Committee of Public Accounts could also look at these issues.  How much of the &euro;28.5 million is spent on arguing the toss over &euro;50 for an animal or arguing about the tiny percentage of animals are high value and of high merit.  These things need to be discussed.  An arbitration process involves hotels being rented and all that kind of stuff.  I am curious and it would be good if we could get to the bottom of it.  We have not been able to get to the bottom of it yet.  How much is the Department spending on fighting valuations?  How much does that cost in terms of mileage and all the costs that go with those inspectors compared with how much is saved?  It nearly seems to us that if the Department just accepted the original valuation, it would not end up spending any more money.  Slightly more would be spent on the valuation and slightly less on the administration.  I think that is worth saying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Punch"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I apologise to our guests because I was delayed on another issue in the Seanad Chamber.  This is an important debate.  I should declare I have a vested interest.  I am locked up at the moment when it comes to TB so I know more about it than most, unfortunately.  The majority of farms in my area have gone down with it in the past eight months.  There are between 13 and 20 infected animals in farms.  That is the case throughout the townland and probably half the parish.  The other half got it last year and we got it this year.  That has a considerable impact without a shadow of a doubt.  That cannot be taken into consideration.  We are in calving season at the moment.  Every one of us is locked up.  We are all dairy farmers.  One can only imagine the situation.  It is a significant issue for the farming community.  There is hardship.  How will farmers cope mentally, physically and financially at this time of year when they are locked up?  Being restricted with dairy calves, bull calves in particular, has its own issues.  One can manage but it comes at a cost to oneself and one's family.  These are issues for us.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe the programme should be called the national eradication programme.  There is a fundamental view that we will never actually beat this disease.  We have been fighting TB since my father's time and well before it.  The figures have increased dramatically.  They have, at times, dipped and then increased.  There is an idea that we need to find a way of dealing and working with TB on a long-term basis.  We have heard about the 30-year strategy.  Dr. Margaret Good attended a previous committee that was under different chairmanship and we were on about a 30-year strategy to get rid of TB.  Some of the committee members, including the Chairman, were also members of that committee.  We were hesitant to think we could deliver a 30-year strategy that would eradicate the disease.  It is obvious, four or five years later, that the 30-year strategy for the eradication of the disease was never going to work on the ground.  How we look at the issue needs to be considered.<\/p> <p>  I will ask our guests' views on a few matters.  How do they believe the blood test will be a part of the solution, going forward?  Do they believe it is appropriate and used appropriately?  Where do they believe it falls as part of the solution when it comes to eradicating TB?  On some occasions the blood test is used appropriately but on other occasions it is not used at all.  I would like our guests' views regarding it and where they believe we need to be going forward.<\/p> <p>  The wildlife issue has been declared and spoken about on a continuous basis.  There is an issue about how to deal with badgers and deer, and how the Department can work with urban society to deal with those issues.  That is an issue for us.  The Department pulled out of the vaccination programme in certain areas because of issues arising on Facebook, where pictures of snares were put up.  There were scenarios of that kind.  We are on the back foot when it comes to those issues.  How the Department manages those issues is important and has an impact on us as farmers.  When the Department pulls out because of so-called negative publicity, it is an issue.  How can we move forward to get everyone onside on this issue?  Unfortunately, not everyone is onside regarding this issue.<\/p> <p>  Money and compensation are also issues, as others have mentioned.  The valuations in some of the documents are not related to what is happening in the marketplace.  They are totally off-kilter.  Mr. Punch made an interesting point about animals going to the factory.  One wonders was it the same animal that left the yard.  There are significant issues in that regard, which is worth talking about and acknowledging.  A farmer might send off a cull cow or a milking cow to a factory and get &euro;212 for it.  That farmer might wonder was it a calf he or she sent off.  That was happening in some of these situations.  We must find out how we can address those situations so everyone can have the opportunity to survive the issue of TB.<\/p> <p>  Numbers in some places have got bigger.  That is an issue in some locations.  The numbers in some herds are quite horrendous, particularly on the second test.  The first test might be okay but the second test is a blood test.  It is a blind spot.  One does not know what will come until one gets the report.  That is a significant issue that we need to start talking about.<\/p> <p>  I apologise again for being late to the meeting.

I refer to departmental eradication programme.  Like elements of ear to the ground, clearly this programme is seen to be of benefit to the badger population as well.  That is the reality.  A sick badger is kicked out.  We are trying to prevent sick badgers.  The problem is that it is not totally effective.  The reality is that we have sick badgers infecting animals.  It is in our interest to continue to work with everybody here.  We are in a difficult situation with the way urban society is moving.  We have no choice but to encourage the Department to do its best and to work with farmers.  The key is to work with farmers to identify these sets.  One of the critical problems is that sets are not being identified.<\/p> <p>  On the question of compensation and evaluation, we made this point and declared our demand for &euro;110 for dairy cows and &euro;55 for suckler cows and that every animal is eligible.  The key point is, and this is a point we have made continuously at the forum, that this is not just about income loss.  This is just about the stress this places on the entire family.  Family labour is never accounted for in all of these points.  The Deputy is correct on those two points.  They are our proposals to attempt to address that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. T.J. Maher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I will pick up here.  Senator Lombard mentioned the live valuation and agreed that there is a blind spot in the actual live valuation scheme for what we would call mid-production animals, third-fourth lactation, suckler or dairy cows because they are not offered for sale on the open market.  Any of them that are offered for sale are offered for a reason and the market reflects that, so there is a huge blind spot for those animals that has to be addressed.  We raised this with Grant Thornton in the review and it was recognised.  One of the areas currently under active discussion is how to get an appropriate data-set for that cohort of animals.  I anticipate that the main disappointment in any live valuation is with that category of animals which are the most productive and profitable animals on the farm but yet the market value does not reflect that.<\/p> <p>  Early pregnancy is a similar point.  The system was changed a number of years ago whereby pregnancy diagnosis only takes place at a later stage in cows to address this huge shortcoming.  The difficulty here is that maiden and served heifers are treated in the same category so there is not a price differential.  The first point at which a price differential come in on the in-calf heifer is for the mid-term, from four to seven months.  Obviously, those are the animals to which the Senator refers.  While there is a market price for mid-term heifers, we argue that the pricing system should overcome this issue because there is no point giving the value of a mid-term heifer to put back in a mid-term heifer six months later when you are de-restricted.  It is a springing heifer or a first-calf heifer that you need, which is of a higher value, to maintain your farming system.  It is a huge issue and the Department continues to refuse to accept scanning certificates, which is somewhat offset by the fact that it is later in the gestation when the assessment takes place.  We all know how factory lines work and the speed at which they work at.  The issue is how to find a four-month old foetus.  That can have a huge impact on the valuation.  That is part of the live valuation review where categorisation changes are required.  That is being discussed and will have to come through.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the blood test and the solution, it certainly has a role.  If you look at why and where it is used, it is focused on breeding herds that have six or more reactors.  It is far more sensitive than the skin test.  The reason it is used is to identify reactors that the skin tests have not found, ideally sooner rather than later, and to try to get to the bottom of it.  The flip side of that is, and the Department readily accepts this, that it is overly sensitive.  False positives may be found.  That is why it is used where there is confirmed TB.  Has it a role beyond that?  We would not support it being used outside cases where confirmed TB is on a farm because of those sensitivities.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lombard made the point that because we are at it 70 years we should not call it eradication.  From a Mayo perspective, we are 70 years waiting to get the next one, but we will still go out this year to win it.  From a farmer's point of view, and as Mr. Maher outlined it, it is incumbent on us and on the State that we pursue eradication and that, in the process, we reduce the impact on farms.  That is why we make the point that this cannot be all about measures that will reduce disease.  Throughout this process, because of the examples given, farmers have to be supported as a result of the impact.  This will take time.  The Department will make mistakes.  Unless we are fully supported as a result of that, through the compensation scheme, we will carry the can.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice raised the contiguous testing.  It is covered in the Animal Health and Welfare Act.  We must be brutally honest.  If we outlined, which we have done in this committee today, our view that wildlife is the primary driver of TB, then we must expect that the TB is likely to be in the area and not confined to one farm because the badger and the deer do not recognise farm boundaries.  That is the logic behind the contiguous herd testing programme.  The figures show that farms contiguous to a high risk breakdown are more likely to have TB on them.  From our perspective, we cannot argue on one hand that the badger and the deer are causing the TB but that it did not cross the ditch from my farm to your farm.  That is why it closes out the loop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022021600002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s Bourke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Mr. Bourke has covered much of it.

However, it has a role to play in expediating TB off the farm.<\/p> <p>  In regard to contiguous testing, it is a statutory disease and must be notified.

It is a profitable organisation.  Many deer come through its plantations.  It has been utterly unwilling to engage on whether it should fence its own plantations.  It has said that farmers are welcome to fence and to keep out the deer but in some cases the deer come from uplands through the Coillte plantation and on to farms.  When I was a gars&uacute;n, there was a television advertisement about the neighbour who does not give a damn and know him for what he is was the phrase.

Eradication measures may be one way of driving it.  In our hearts, we know a great many things have to be addressed and changed or it is not possible.  There is no point saying otherwise as it is only misleading everyone else along with ourselves.  That is being honest with the taxpayer and everyone else, including ourselves, in terms of who is funding it.<\/p><p>Mr. Punch has covered the issue of blood testing.  On compensation, valuers and valuations, there should never have been a big forum or anything else.

It is like the members or anybody else in their own positions; everyone has their own job and we have to leave them to do it.  They are now being directed by people who do not have those qualifications.  This needs to be addressed.  It should go back to the valuer.  This would save a lot of time that is now being wasted when agreeing valuations, as Mr. Punch has said.<\/p><p> Regarding the factory return on salvages that Senator Lombard quoted, every cow going in there is coming back at a much lower grade, with the farmer being paid a lower premium.  I heard a man saying he had got &euro;210 for cows.  There could be 80 cent to &euro;1 lost on the salvage value, perhaps along with grade, weight and different things.  I always remember being locked up and getting back &pound;480 for cows.  Every of them was worth &pound;700 or more dead.  We have to address that.  It is not being monitored within the system.  That is a loophole.<\/p><p> I will go back to the Chairman's question on pregnancy and in-calf heifers.

Employment increase across all economic sectors was particularly strong, with jobs growth in life sciences, business services and digital technology.  There were increases in employment across all regions in Ireland.  In total, 20,342 new jobs were created by companies with the support of Enterprise Ireland.  The total employment by companies that were supported by Enterprise Ireland in 2021 was 207,894.  Corresponding strong progress also was made through local employment offices.  I am pleased, therefore, that today we have the opportunity to consider this matter.<\/p> <p>  I would like to welcome online from Enterprise Ireland Mr. Leo Clancy, CEO, Mr. Paul McKeown, chief financial officer and executive director and Dr. Carol Gibbons, divisional manager with responsibility for regions and local enterprise.  I welcome from the network of local enterprise offices, Mr. Padraic McElwee, chairperson and Mr. Ois&iacute;n Geoghegan, the former chair. <\/p> <p>  Before we start, I will read the note on privilege and a note to witnesses.  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in regard to references they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter, if they so wish.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  The opening statements by Enterprise Ireland and the network of local enterprise offices have been circulated to all members.  To commence the consideration of our matter today, I now invite Mr. Clancy to make his opening remarks on behalf of Enterprise Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Clancy is having technical issues, so we will suspend the meeting for five minutes.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644969600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 9.37 a.m. and resumed at 9.41 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Apologies for the technical issues.

I am joined by Mr. Paul McKeown, chief financial officer and executive director of Enterprise Ireland, and Dr. Carol Gibbons, divisional manager with responsibility for regions and local enterprise.  I am also joined by Mr. Padraic McElwee, chair of the Network of Local Enterprise Offices, who will address the committee shortly, and Mr. Ois&iacute;n Geoghegan, former chair of the local enterprise offices.  As will be noted from our strategy and presentations, close collaboration between Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices is a key priority for us.<br\/><br\/>Today, I will cover our 2021 performance and related achievements, as well as our new strategy and targets to 2024.  The purpose of Enterprise Ireland is to help Irish companies to start, grow, innovate and win export sales.  In this way, we support employment, regional development and sustainable economic growth.  The past two years have been highly challenging for the people of Ireland and the Covid-19 pandemic has affected all of us.  Our thoughts are with those who lost loved ones and livelihoods during the pandemic.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the people on the front line of our health and other public services and also those who worked at companies across the country to ensure that essential equipment was available and manufacturing and trade could continue during those difficult days.<br\/><br\/>Covid-19 has brought many challenges in relation to Irish business.  Key issues at the height of the pandemic included immediate liquidity pressures, a reduction in customer demand in certain sectors and supply chain issues resulting in increased operational costs.  The rapid move to remote working further added to these challenges.  Over the past two years, under the sustaining enterprise fund, Enterprise Ireland approved &euro;183.1 million in funding to 740 companies, sustaining 30,000 jobs across the country.  We supported over 8,000 companies with advice and guidance on dealing with Covid-19.  We also provided direct support to companies unable to travel overseas through our network of 40 offices around the world.  These significant supports made a very important difference to company performance and have led to the results we are now seeing in recovery.<br\/><br\/><b><i><\/i><\/b>Enterprise Ireland client companies saw strong employment growth in 2021 and the highest increase in net jobs created by Enterprise Ireland client companies in a single year, at 11,911 net jobs. <b><\/b>Employment increased across all economic sectors.<b><\/b>In total, 68% of new jobs created were outside Dublin.  The positive jobs figures saw increases in employment across all regions with, for example, employment increasing by 9% in the north west and west and by 7% in the south east.  Our teams internationally helped Irish companies to win 1,375 overseas contracts and helped 184 companies enter new markets despite the pandemic-related restrictions.  In 2020, companies supported by Enterprise Ireland spent &euro;29 billion in local economies across the country.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of 2022 and beyond, this is a time of very significant change.  The world of business and the world in general are being transformed by factors such as climate change, the accelerated adoption of technology and changing trends in globalisation.  There are also immediate concerns in the global and Irish economies, including inflation, skills availability, continuing uncertainty arising from Covid-19 and the changed trading relationship with the UK, all of which have the potential to impact on the competitiveness of the Irish enterprise base.  All of these trends represent both challenge and opportunity.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In the context of that changing global environment, we launched our three-year strategy, Leading in a Changing World, which is supporting a vision for Irish enterprise to 2030.  Underpinning our vision for Irish enterprise are five strategic ambitions, which provide the key areas of focus for our strategy.  Our ambitions are for Ireland and Irish enterprise, as well as for the organisation we wish to be and the service we offer to our clients.  The first pillar of our strategy is seeing Irish companies continue to deliver sustainable employment and economic growth at national and regional level.  In this context, we are planning to assist the creation of 45,000 new jobs over the period of the strategy, maintaining a strong regional focus.  We are also targeting a significant increase in the level of exports from Irish companies of all sizes to &euro;30 billion, as well as the overall number of Irish companies exporting.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the second pillar, Enterprise Ireland will target fostering further entrepreneurship, leading to increased start-up activity across the country and this will be done in collaboration with the LEOs.  We will also put specific focus on scaling of companies, enabling Irish firms to grow faster and further in global markets, including through increased leadership capability.  We are targeting support to 450 early stage companies over the next three years, growing our high potential start-up cohort by 20% over the previous strategy.<br\/><br\/>Our third pillar is for our clients to achieve increased productivity through higher levels of operational focus, more innovation and further digital adoption.  We are targeting a research and development spend of &euro;1.4 billion by Irish companies to support this activity.  In terms of the fourth pillar, in line with Government climate action targets for enterprise and with an increased global focus on environmental, social and governance requirements, Enterprise Ireland will work with Irish enterprises to transform their sustainability performance.  We will also work to enable innovative Irish companies to realise global opportunities from the low carbon transition, accelerating Ireland&rsquo;s green tech sector.  By way of the fifth pillar, Enterprise Ireland will focus on being a future-ready, highly connected, agile organisation that can help Irish companies at all stages of development.<br\/><br\/>As I mentioned, a key focus for us will be to collaborate closely with our colleagues in local enterprise offices around Ireland to achieve these goals.  That closer integration is a key theme in our strategy document, about which Mr. McElwee and Mr. Geoghegan will speak further shortly.  We will also continue to strengthen our relationship with IDA Ireland to ensure that Irish enterprise has access to and benefits from the multinational base here in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Our focus on continuing to build the innovation capabilities of Irish enterprise is a very important one and we will continue to work with colleagues across Government and industry to strengthen our research and innovation base.  As I outlined, Irish enterprise is well placed to recover and continue to grow following two very challenging years, but challenges continue for companies and we must continue to build and strengthen the Irish enterprise base across all sectors and regions.  Enterprise Ireland, working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and our colleagues in the local enterprise offices, has a key role to play in every community across Ireland. <br\/><br\/>I welcome any questions and I again thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to engage with them today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Leo Clancy"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Clancy.

I would like to be associated with the sentiments expressed by Mr. Clancy.<\/p> <p>  The local enterprise offices are the first-stop shop for any small business looking to start or grow access to business.  The LEO vision is to develop and sustain a positive enterprise ecosystem at local level throughout the country that will drive new added-value start-ups, facilitate further growth of micro and small businesses and enhance local economies.  The local enterprise offices were established in 2014, replacing the 35 county and city enterprise boards.<\/p><p>The local enterprise offices are located in all local authorities around the country.  The LEOs are an integral part of each local authority and facilitate close collaboration with various supports and enablers delivered by the local government sector.  From an economic perspective, local authorities play a critical role in putting in place initiatives to stimulate the local economy and to support business in creating employment.  Never has this role been more critical than in the past two years.  Local authorities work closely and in partnership with Departments and key State agencies to deliver on this promise.<\/p><p> As Mr. Clancy outlined, the integration with Enterprise Ireland is key to the success of the local enterprise office and ensures businesses of all sizes are assisted on their development journey from start-up to scaling.  Our core collective objectives are to boost the productivity of established businesses and connect enterprises with innovation opportunities at home and internationally, maximising their growth and job creation potential.<\/p><p> In 2021 we saw our eighth consecutive year of strong job creation spread across the country.  We financially support 7,158 companies operating in the manufacturing and internationally-traded service sector.  They employ over 35,000 people spread among our towns, villages and rural communities with 85% of those jobs being located outside Dublin.  In 2021, these businesses created 7,440 new jobs and we experienced net jobs growth of 3,000.  During that period we also transferred 114 companies to Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p> In 2021, we approved funding to 121 businesses of over &euro;24 million.  We trained over 60,000 entrepreneurs and owner-managers.  Of those trained, just under 6,000 participated in our Start Your Own Business programme.  We also supported over 14,149 business owners supported with one-to-one mentoring with people with specialist skills specific to the needs of that business.  We play a key and increasing role in developing innovation and facilitated the approval of 27 projects under the Enterprise Ireland agile innovation fund.  In the latter part of 2020, we supported 444 lean initiatives or interventions and 293 green consultancies.<\/p><p> Covid had a dramatic impact on microenterprises with many owner-managers finding themselves isolated and needing support more than ever.  The local enterprise offices were on the front line of proactively assisting these businesses.  This provided an invaluable lifeline throughout the pandemic.<\/p><p> We also play a key role in collaborating with various other bodies in our locality across numerous plans.  Examples of this include local community development committees, local economic and community plans, regional enterprise action plans, regional skills fora and the regional enterprise development fund projects.<\/p><p> We also have established protocols with a number of agency partners that govern the dissemination of information, signposting and inter-organisation referrals.  Local enterprise offices will continue to implement these protocols on an ongoing basis and review locally as required.<\/p><p> Our strategic ambitions in the years ahead are very much aligned with the recently-published Enterprise Ireland strategy outlined by Mr. Clancy.  The overarching ambition is enhancing the capability and competitiveness of microenterprises to grow, develop and create employment.  In particular, we will work closely with those enterprises that have a global ambition to ensure they have the supports and resources necessary to succeed in global markets.  In numeric terms, we have a number of challenging targets that are outlined in our submission document.  I would be happy to elaborate on them at a later point.  Appendix 1 to the document submitted also outlines the range of supports we offer that will drive that growth.<\/p><p> The past two years have highlighted the key role LEOs play in supporting local businesses and the benefits of having local support for local business.  During this period, many businesses faced loss of customers, uncertainty and potential loss of their livelihood.  It was a challenging time on numerous fronts, including economically and at the personal level.  We saw businesses open virtual doors when their physical ones had to shut using our trading online vouchers.  We saw over 70,000 people avail of LEO training during the first year of the pandemic.  This equipped them with the new skills required to sustain their business, be that selling online, social media, HR or financial skills.  We saw thousands of businesses access mentors to rewrite their business plans and pivot their company.  Sometimes this was to sustain it but in many cases we saw them grow and find new markets and opportunities.  The figures from last year indicate many small businesses were able to bring back on board those jobs that were lost in 2020 and across the board we saw good growth.  There are green shoots and the outlook for the future is positive.  The Look for Local advertising campaign run by the LEOs played an important role in encouraging our communities to support their local businesses and ensure their continuing viability.  It merits acknowledgment that communities responded positively to this call for support and in fact many discovered new treasures on their doorstep that will have a longer-term beneficial impact.<\/p><p> We should be very proud of Ireland&rsquo;s small business community for what they had to endure in the past two years in the name of keeping the public safe.  While some sectors remain challenged, many of those businesses have emerged stronger for the experiences they went through.  The staff members of every local enterprise office take great pride in the role we played to help small businesses over the past two years and we will continue to do so in whatever way we can over the coming years.  The ability and capacity for LEOs to proactively engage and support early-stage enterprises are fundamental to the future economic viability of our many towns and villages.  We play a key development role in identifying and nurturing early-stage enterprises with the ambition to become world-class Irish companies and achieve leading positions in global markets.  This focus highlights the important development role LEOs play in the wider economic development remit of the local authorities.  LEO supports underpin economic activity, job creation, job retention and vibrant communities.  Enterprise Ireland's strategy identifies the importance of the early-stage supports LEOs deliver and the platform this provides to achieve our shared vision of Irish businesses creating solutions for global challenges and delivering sustainable prosperity throughout Ireland.

People wanted to shop local.  I think we all felt that and it really chimed.  As it was very successful, I commend everyone involved with that.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions and if my time expires, I may get a chance to come back in.  This is going to be a bit confusing because Leo is from EI and we have the LEOs as well.  I have a question for Mr. Clancy on the skills shortage.  Is there scope for upskilling workers, retaining those who are out of work and further education in order to meet the skills gap?  That is one part.  Are there broader issues, as I believe there are, around pay and conditions that need to be addressed on the business side?  While there are workers who may be out of work for the moment and who are, we hope, getting upskilled and getting themselves ready for the labour market, is there something that should be done on the other side by business?  A follow-on question to that for both witnesses is on issues around workers' rights.  Obviously, their roles are more on the business side but I imagine there must be a focus, they can elaborate on this, not just on jobs and job creation but on the creation of decent and sustainable jobs.  I ask that they talk briefly about this.  I will contact both officials because I am very interested in continuing this in a more in-depth way.  Will they elaborate on how workers' rights are stacked into their work on a daily basis?  How is it done?  Time and time again we see, through the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and other inspections, issues around workers' rights being exposed.<\/p><p>Can something be done at the start of the process to ensure workers' rights are stacked into every transaction and every campaign?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#C00300","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I will address those two points, starting with the workers' rights and pay and conditions elements of the Deputy's questions.  As she said, it is clear we do not have a direct role in this space, but we work with employers across the board every day of the week.  My experience is there is high awareness of the need for continually improving pay and conditions.  We are in a very competitive labour market.  The Deputy will have heard in my opening comments that labour and skills remain one of the two major issues for employers at present, if inflation and supply chain challenges are included as the other.  In that context, employers are very aware of the need for competitive pay and conditions.  At the same time, the workers' rights agenda is very much the domain of our parent Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is certainly something that is focused on and, from an employer point of view, it is very much considered.  Where we give support to employers through capital or other types of grant, we always looks at the cost-benefit analysis and value for money to the State of those investments and, within that, is a consideration of the level of pay for the job.  There are a number of areas where we contribute to this although it is not our core area of responsibility.<\/p> <p>  The upskilling of workers for the labour market is critical.  Everywhere I have gone, and for every employer I have met in the eight months I have been in this job, there is a very strong focus on skills as well as labour.  Employers know that in order to retain and attract people they need to provide a lifelong learning environment.  I have seen some very good examples of this in, for instance, engineering settings, where we have automating of processes for welders whereby people can add skills in software and automation to their core skills.  They continue to maintain the trade they had but also to upskill themselves in new areas.  I have seen a couple of very good examples of that in recent months.  Both points are very important and the upskilling piece is certainly a focus.<\/p> <p>  We also work very closely with SOLAS, the national further education body, on programmes that can be relevant to employers.  We work with Skillnet Ireland, which works with a number of business associations, to ensure we have skill pathways for workers to come back into work.  There is lots of positive work happening in that space.  Labour and skills is certainly an area that will need to continue to be focused on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Leo Clancy"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Clancy for his response.  I appreciate it is not a core area of responsibility, but it should be.  I will outline the difficulty.  It is not a question but more of an observation that we can perhaps pick up at a later date.  Where there are issues around breaches of workers' rights and entitlements or non-recognition of trade unions, or where a trade union is active and a WRC recommendation is received, it is not desirable, certainly on the part of the workers, when they hear these companies are, in some instances, in receipt of State funds and engaging with the State, but at the same time, when there is a recommendation from the WRC, they walk away from it.  I am not suggesting for a minute, by the way, that workers' rights can be bought; they cannot because eventually the price becomes too high and it is not a good way to be.  I am just putting it into the representatives' heads that there is that kind of juxtaposition, which is not lost on workers who see that the State operates in a favourable way to employers, but does not then place an onus on employers to recognise the machinery of the State.  There is work that needs to be done.  It is an issue I have raised with business representatives in other arenas.  I know the witnesses are not representing business here, but I have raised that issue.  We have a lot of work to do because it is not good enough to say we know they need to up their game on terms and conditions.  As I said, that is more of an observation.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for both witnesses on the innovation opportunities for Irish companies specifically in renewable energy and the green economy.

There are some very ambitious targets at a national level.  The ESB strategy was launched on Monday, which again doubles down on that.  We are engaged with the ESB with regard to its plans at Moneypoint.  We are engaged with actors throughout the State on how we can help amplify that opportunity.  We are seeing a very exciting pipeline of innovative companies come to us through our high potential start-up unit and some of the research and innovation projects we are seeing in electrification and other areas.

In Clare, where I am located, we are starting to see that evolve.  In our start your own business programmes, we are seeing many people exploring the opportunity and early stage businesses starting up.

We recently heard from the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, NCPC, which told us: \"The attractiveness of a location cannot be focused solely on it as a place to work;...[but] also...as a place to live.\"  Almost every business representative body and agency that has appeared in front of the committee has referenced the impact of the cost-of-living crisis we are in at present.  Specifically, the issues of the housing crisis, energy, transport, and the cost of education and childcare, are significantly impacting on people who are on ordinary incomes.  Does Enterprise Ireland share the view of the NCPC on the State and its capacity to remain an attractive location?  We know the cost-of-living crisis is there and is referenced by everybody, but what will happen if housing, transport, education and childcare costs, specifically, are not addressed?  Does Enterprise Ireland have a view on whether these costs need to be addressed and on the impact the current crisis is having on the capacity of firms to expand or attract workers?  I am not talking about workers who may come here temporarily on one of the Government's visa programmes.  I am talking about sustainable, decent, long-term jobs.  I am not focusing specifically on the low-wage economy but low-income to middle-income earners, what my mother would have called people on ordinary money, and the impacts this is having on them.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#D00600","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I will start.

They are key factors for employers in terms of cost of labour and availability.  As Deputy Louise O'Reilly said, they are also key factors for people locally who are looking for mobility within the country and for people who are coming from overseas.  They are certainly issues for employers and areas about which we remain concerned.<\/p><p> There are regional and global issues in light of these factors.  We are seeing inflation across the world.  We are seeing housing challenges in most developed countries, particularly in urban centres.  We are certainly not alone.  There are counterbalancing factors, which mean that Ireland is still competitive as a business location.  That is to the good.  However, these are areas on which we need to continue to focus, both for the good of the workers and of the employers, so as to maintain their competitiveness.

However, in providing employment, there is one big advantage that we have, as an agency, which is that we work with local businesses.  That affords people in our local towns and villages an opportunity to get employment locally.  That is hugely important.  Another advantage of our micro enterprises is that they can offer a degree of flexibility, which suits more appropriate work patterns.  Those are their \"benefits\", for want of a better word, as distinct from those of larger organisations.  It will be challenging across the board.  That is why we will work proactively with those businesses.  Job retention is important to us, as is job creation.

I commend the work that has been done by Enterprise Ireland and the Network of Local Enterprise Offices.  For obvious reasons, LEO-supported companies had an extremely difficult 2020.  However, the bounce-back in 2021 was very impressive for companies backed by Enterprise Ireland and local enterprise offices.  Achieving positive figures in job creation over the course of Covid-19 deserves great credit.<\/p> <p>  The Galway local enterprise office, which is based in the Galway County Council offices on Prospect Hill, helped to create well in excess of 200 jobs.  That is a significant number, especially during difficult circumstances.  I highlight the excellent work that is done by Breda Fox and her team.<\/p> <p>  The trading online voucher scheme, which the LEO offices ran, was particularly helpful and provided vital support for SMEs.  Obviously, online trading has been increasing annually for a long time.  That trend does not seem to be slowing down.  I know of a number of businesses in west Galway and Galway city that use the scheme.  They were extremely grateful for the support.  From speaking to business owners, and I could cite various cases, I learned that the local enterprise office was very helpful and went above and beyond the call.  It is important to acknowledge that because public representatives, including me, are often critical.  During the pandemic, when owners looked for assistance LEO staff went to extreme measures to help.  They supported business throughout the period.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, a significant number of businesses need to make the transition and enhance their digital platforms.  In the strategic ambition of the statement, there is an objective to provide 5,000 online trading vouchers up to 2026.  I appreciate that considerable work has been done already, with over 17,500 businesses being supported over the past two years.  However, it appears that many businesses would still use the scheme, including perhaps some which are not aware of it.  Could more outreach efforts be made to ensure all SMEs are aware of the scheme?  If there is a greater demand, is the budget available to go beyond the objective of providing 5,000 online vouchers?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#E00400","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his kind words of support, particularly for the team in Galway, with whom I am sure he is very familiar.  The trading online voucher scheme has been a phenomenal success.  The Senator touched on one key objective that we will have.  Having helped over 17,000 businesses establish an online presence, we must now work with those businesses to make sure they maximise that opportunity.  There is, therefore, a significant amount of upskilling needed.  It is one thing to go online.  The next challenge is to make that effective.<\/p> <p>  On our targets, we are seeing a reduced demand because we helped a significant number of businesses.  The Department has been hugely supportive of this scheme.  We have recently conducted a survey analysis, the results of which will be published shortly.  The analysis has been largely positive.  The scheme has been effective, delivered real growth into those businesses and created employment.  I am confident that we will have a sufficient budget to meet demand.<\/p> <p>  On promoting the scheme, we do a significant amount of activity through local media.  However, we find that our best outreach is through social media.  That is where we get the best traction.  All local enterprise offices are actively engaged.  We simply cannot meet the demand on our digital marketing programmes around upskilling.  The demand is there and we are challenged to meet it, but we will meet it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic McElwee"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I have first-hand awareness of the terrific work because I was a member of the county and city enterprise board for five years, from 2009 to 2014.

What do they intend to do to assist companies that are too big for LEOs because they have more than ten employees and do not export or are not big enough to fall under the remit of Enterprise Ireland?<\/p> <p>  It seems to me and people with whom I speak that our trading relationship with the UK is a significant challenge.  That is certainly the case with the food exporting sector, particularly with regard to beef.  Companies in west Galway are especially concerned about this.  While I know that exports remained relatively steady in 2021, there is concern that UK trading deals with Australia and New Zealand will have a significant negative impact on Ireland&rsquo;s market share.<\/p> <p>  The Government has made significant investments to help food producers to diversify and attract new markets and customers.  The markets Ireland targets are often already served by local food producers.

Importantly, they can access our lean consultancy, which is about addressing their cost base.  That will be very relevant in the weeks and months ahead.  Equally, we understand that we probably need to enhance support for that sector.

We have worked with many enterprise offices in latter part of last year to ensure that companies with more than ten employees can continue to be supported, where appropriate, by the local enterprise office.  That has been an agenda item for quite some time for politicians.  We are keen to see it supported.<\/p><p> I will address the Senator's question on the UK trading relationship.  I am conscious of the time.  We have deployed a huge amount of support in preparation for Brexit.  The Senator will know that the key dates have shifted at various times.  As a result, we have seen a number of false dawns.  That said, we have run programmes like clear customs financial support and supported the ready for customs grant scheme.  We have supported more than 1,000 positions within Irish enterprise that are focused on Brexit readiness.  We have certainly put a huge amount of effort in.<\/p><p> We are seeing some risk into the UK market.  The Senator specifically mentioned other jurisdictions and potential trading displacements.  What we have been seeing in recent months with the resurgence of the global economy is that countries such as New Zealand and Australia are actually seeing more access to more markets in their own locations.  New Zealand in particular is looking potentially at further unfettered access to China in the coming period.  We are also seeing that markets in those locales are opening up.  It is a balanced picture in terms of the global economy.<\/p><p> Ireland is still the closest trading partner of the United Kingdom and will certainly be a key player.  What we are hearing from our clients is that they have made themselves ready generally.  There are still concerns about the way things may go depending on the final shape of agreements but we think that industry is generally in a pretty good shape.  There will always be uncertainty until there is a final agreement but we are actually hearing a lot of optimism about the market for the future.  Some of those global forces that were there in the past are abating a little bit as a consequence of some of the inflation and resurgence of economies around the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Leo Clancy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Clancy.

First, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr. Clancy on his appointment at Enterprise Ireland.  I know he has a difficult act to follow but I have no doubt that he will make a great job of it.  I congratulate Ms Julie Sinnamon on her tenure, which was an exceptional period.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions on which I would be interested to hear answers.  I am very interested in the circular economy concept, that is, this idea of taking the environmental damage out of the entire supply chain.  This will be significant for competitiveness in the long term.  In sectors that would be vitally important, such as food and others where these credentials will be crucial, what work is going on beyond the climate agenda to make sure that is a key element of strategic planning in all dimensions?<\/p> <p>  I would be interested to hear how Mr. Clancy sees the performance of high-potential start-up companies versus the more standard start-ups that come through either the local enterprise offices, LEOs, or Enterprise Ireland.  Mr. Clancy put a strong emphasis on high-potential start-ups, but there has always been the slight niggling fear that they grow to a point and then get sold off and the benefit goes into the multinational system.  Is that changing?<\/p> <p>  The arrival of town centre renewal and remote working is a key strategy of Government.  What new initiatives is Mr. Clancy taking to push, say, enterprise centres into the hearts of towns in order that we create a living centre?  Enterprise Ireland can be a very key strategic player in this area.<\/p> <p>  How have linkages with multinationals developed?  We had trade missions to Ireland in difficult times in the past but the difficulty seems to be getting into these global supply chains.  Have many Irish Enterprise Ireland companies made that leap into the global supply chain at this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#F00600","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>First of all, I thank the Deputy for his very kind words.  I am doing my best to follow a very hard act in Ms. Julie Sinnamon so I really appreciate that.<\/p> <p>  I will take the Deputy's questions, as raised, and ask my colleague, Dr. Gibbons, to cover the town centre regional hubs in a minute because we have done an immense amount of work in that space.  I will cover the circular economy first.  I met only yesterday with a company that is looking at transitioning some of its packaging to a circular economy approach to be ready for a demand it sees coming for the future.  There is, therefore, certainly much activity happening on the ground.  There is activity happening in certain university settings as well.  University College Dublin, UCD, has a very strong focus in this space.  We are supporting that also through a lot of our regional funds.  Wherever there is a focus on environment, there is a focus on circular economy as well as the more carbon-intensive aspects of the circular economy.  It is, therefore, certainly something that is on the minds of companies and continues to be on our minds also.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about high-potential start-ups versus standard start-ups.  We are seeing success across the board.  We might look at some of our companies that have been clients for longer, for instance, Kirby Group Engineering.  One of the first announcements I was present at last June in Limerick was about that company growing 300 jobs.  That company had been in the electrical sector in Ireland for many years and has actually found a really good export market in high-value construction.  It has grown very nicely and we are seeing quite a bit of that.<\/p> <p>  We are seeing high-potential start-ups grow also.  The Deputy will have seen the announcement of a number of unicorns in recent months, many of which are our clients.  I cannot quite remember if Wayflyer is our fourth or fifth unicorn in a short period of time but companies like Wayflyer and Flipdish are achieving global scale.  For people's benefit, a unicorn is a company that is valued at more than &euro;1 billion.  We now have four or five; I am just not quite sure of the number.  We expect to see more.<\/p> <p>  Our strategy is geared towards creating more and helping companies grow in scale while remaining Irish through that.  We are still seeing a trend of our leading companies being sold to multinational companies.  That is incredibly positive for the companies involved and mostly for the employees.  What tends to happen in our experience is that those companies continue to grow.  Irish companies by their nature are very innovative so they become very innovate parts of those companies that acquire them.  The activity generally stays in Ireland.  That said, we would like to see more public limited companies, plcs, out of Ireland.  We would like to see more companies growing.<\/p> <p>  We had wonderful results this morning from Kerry Group, one of our proudest Irish independent plcs.  Our ambition for Irish enterprise is that we will see more companies like Kerry Group in the coming years that can be leaders in their fields and remain proudly Irish.  In the context of where the global economy is and the increasing drive towards digitalisation, it is also entirely possible that a person can start a company now out of Ireland that can become fully global.  It is very positive.<\/p> <p>  Before I come back to the Deputy's question on town centres, I might move straight to the linkages with multinational companies.  That is an area that is strengthening all the time.  I have had a number of engagements IDA Ireland.  For the benefit of members, I come from IDA Ireland.  I worked with IDA Ireland until last May.  We have very deep linkages across the board.  Multinational companies are increasingly helping Irish companies to grow on the global stage.  If I pick companies like Stripe, Amazon and Microsoft, they are very vocally and practically supporting companies to embrace, for instance, digital technologies and online sale, complementing some of the things about which Mr. McElwee spoke earlier in terms of trading online.  That is a really positive linkage and it is growing.  Introductions to companies are still something we do in the context of the trade missions the Deputy mentioned.  We continue to focus on that.<\/p> <p>  With that, I will hand back to Dr. Gibbons to speak a little bit about our focus on town centres, remote working and remote hubs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Leo Clancy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Bruton for the question.  If we look at town centres, in particular, and connections to hubs for remote working, we work across government in that regard and particularly with the western development agency and Department of Rural and Community Development.  There are approximately 500 hubs across the country now that are linked on <i>connectedhubs.ie<\/i>to give people an idea of where they can go within their locality.<br\/><br\/>I will look at enterprise centre development and pick out a couple of areas in our regional development funds.  We have supported enterprise hubs in cities and counties.  The Portershed in Galway, for example, is an enterprise hub we have supported for the region, looking particularly at start-ups in areas such as medtech, adtech and technology across the board, which are really important.  It has worked with approximately 30 start-up companies in total to date and more in terms of the actual network itself.<br\/><br\/>In Dublin, we have supported the Guinness Enterprise Centre in terms of its expansion and again, we are looking at working with companies in the cities and in the regions in particular.<\/p><p>Tallaght would be another good example in terms of social and local and again looking at food and artisan and the connections across into the community as well.

Our news media are dominated by negativity every day, yet there is so much positive stuff going on.  Perhaps they should fly the flag a bit higher and give people some hope.  There are a lot of amazing people out there setting up their own businesses.  It takes a lot of courage and bravery to take the risk and provide employment for others who do not want to take the risk or who probably cannot do so.  Well done to the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the supports that have been given to small businesses across the country since the pandemic hit.  Many businesses have survived because of that.  Through the witnesses, I congratulate the Enterprise Ireland team across the country and staff in the LEOs on what they have done.  It has been remarkable.  People have gone above and beyond the call of duty in many instances and have saved jobs and livelihoods.  I thank them for that.<\/p> <p>  As I have the floor, I will pose a few questions.  I am interested in the lean approach to micro.  Last year, there were 449 lean interventions and it is planned to scale them up to 2,000.  In terms of climate action, there were also 293 green consultations and it is intended to increase that to 2,200.  Does Enterprise Ireland have its own team of people in-house to do that?  In my part of the world a company, the Leading Edge Group, does both lean and climate action supports for companies.<\/p> <p>  Could the witnesses comment on the need for export credit insurance?  It was brought to my attention recently that some companies find it difficult to get export credit insurance.  I know the Department commissioned a review on this recently and it is monitoring the situation.  In the experience of the witnesses, are there companies under a bit of pressure in attracting export credit insurance?  Has there been a change for some companies due to Brexit?  Has some of the support dried up?<\/p> <p>  I am also interested in student enterprise education at second level and primary level.  Has Enterprise Ireland carried out an evaluation of the student enterprise programme?  I understand it has been running since 2003.  It seems to be very successful.  Has an evaluation been carried out on how many of those completing the programme have gone on to start their own businesses afterwards, as a direct result perhaps of the experience they gained of making their first euro through business, which can be very exciting for young people?  What is the interaction of Enterprise Ireland with the third level sector in respect of that as well?<\/p> <p>  I also want to ask about the Open Doors initiative that has been established to help young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, migrants and people with disabilities to gain pathways to work.  I know IDA Ireland is part of that process.  Does Enterprise Ireland have any engagement with it?<\/p> <p>  The growth of Irish companies has been mentioned.  It was stated that the aim is to have more public limited companies coming out of Ireland.  Are there impediments to the growth of Irish companies?  Is it the case that they grow to a certain level and then they get sold off?  What is stopping them from growing further on their own?  Quite a number of Irish companies grow to a certain level and are then bought up.<\/p> <p>  With respect to advance facilities, Youghal in my constituency has been devastated over the years and a lot of people leave the town for work every day.  Reference was made to regional enterprise hubs and centres.  Has Enterprise Ireland looked at the geography of the country and considered where there are blackspots, Youghal for instance, to establish advance facilities where people could set up companies?  I have engaged with some people who have said Enterprise Ireland does not do that.  Is it looking to move into that space?<\/p> <p>  The LEOs do a great job but I suggest that we need more of them in areas such as Cork, which is very large geographically.  If there was access to excellent services in some of the more remote areas, it might improve matters a little.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#G00500","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I might address some of the questions specifically relating to LEOs and then I will hand over to Mr. Clancy.  In terms of the lean for micro and green for micro programmes, Deputy Stanton identified one of the companies that we do use, the Leading Edge Group.  It is very important that we get people with the appropriate expertise and knowledge to make those interventions with businesses.  That represents good value for money.  Each local enterprise office procures a panel of appropriately skilled mentors and facilitators to deliver the programmes.  To be honest, that includes upskilling the staff within the local enterprise office as well to ensure we have a good working knowledge and understanding of the issue.  They have the in-depth expertise, however.<\/p> <p>  The student enterprise programme is massively successful.  You get a great buzz if you ever attend one.  There is great enthusiasm.  I do not have information on assessment.  I would need to come back to the committee individually on that.  Anecdotally, what we tend to see is that while a lot of student enterprises are great, they then go off and explore other opportunities.  Quite a number come back to it, probably in their late 20s or early 30s.  That is when we see the impact, not immediately, but they love participating in a programme like this.<\/p> <p>  I will make a comment on the Open Doors initiative.  We did a pilot programme with Technological University Dublin on supporting people with disabilities.  There were approximately 24 participants.  We provided expert mentor support into it.  My understanding from feedback is that four or five of the participants went on to start a business.  We will now start to work with them through our normal channels and see if we can enable them.  The positive news is that the programme has now got the support to be continued.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic McElwee"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting Mr McElwee but he is running out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#G00700","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":140,"content":"<p>There are three LEO offices in Cork.

Well done to them on their work so far.  It has been a rocky two years and they have done a lot to help businesses to stay afloat.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to save everybody.  I have engaged with both the LEOs and Enterprise Ireland repeatedly in my role as spokesperson for enterprise, trade and employment.  I might send a circular to Deputy O'Reilly about the supports provided to date, because despite what she says, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have worked together to come up with lots of strong funding for the greening of the enterprise sector through LEOs and Enterprise Ireland.  A significant amount of work is also being done in upskilling.  There are hundreds of new jobs and courses in upskilling to get people into the workforce where we need them for Rebuilding Ireland and the green economy.<\/p><p>As a member of the Green Party, I will focus on that.  I secured funding in the most recent budget to support LEOs, and Enterprise Ireland in giving better and more supports, and expertise, to small and medium enterprises on how they can go green and reduce their carbon footprints.  It is now time to have targets.  Let us see the carbon reduction.  Green for Micro is welcome, as are the other initiatives, including the lean concepts.  I would like to hear more about what the lean intervention actually is.<\/p><p> Mr. McElwee referred to 293 million green consultancies.  I have two questions on that.  Will he expand on what exactly that is?  Are there targets of, say, a 10% carbon reduction or how is that being done so we know it is effective?  What can we do to ensure more of an uptake?  We need to see an increase in the uptake of the great services our guests are providing that will help to make businesses more economically sustainable, as well as environmentally sustainable.  It is important that we all work together.<\/p><p> I do not think our guests' jobs are to talk about workers' rights.  My experience of the SME sector shows that most employers, when they train somebody up, want to hold onto them.  It takes a lot of time and energy to train somebody up.  It is important we recognise that fact.  I know many people who own small businesses and the last thing they want to be doing is losing employees and having to do it all again and employ somebody else.  The SME sector has done very well in holding onto staff.  It is not the case that workers' rights are being dismissed by businesses and employers do not take care of them.  My experience of small businesses is that they take great care of their staff because they want to hold onto them.  Our guests have probably found that too.  They have probably not observed large amounts of people leaving small businesses because of mistreatment.  We must have a nuanced debate around that.  It is not simply a case of all workers need to get better pay and all employers do not take care of their workers.<\/p><p> The lean interventions and the green consultancy are important, as Deputy Stanton mentioned.  I know there is two-day mentoring but what is the next step?  Small businesses are busy.  We nearly need to do more for them to get them over the line, whether that is packaging or looking at their heating system and turning it into an air-to-water system.  I remember describing the air-to-water system to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, when I met him on the pre-budget submissions I made on decarbonising the SME sector.  He committed &euro;22 million to that programme.  I am interested to see the roll-out of that and to hear how it is progressing.  It is important to acknowledge the fact that the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, have worked well and hard on creating new centres of excellence for upskilling through two-day and four-day courses for existing tradesmen and entire courses to get people into trades to prepare for the new green economy.  I know for a fact the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications met the Institute of Guidance Counsellors twice and there is a good circular available about all the green courses that are coming online.  The Government, LEOs and Enterprise Ireland need to do more to promote those courses and get people into them.  That is something on which we must look at doing more.  We have created the courses and now we need to increase the uptake.  It is good that the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications has flagged that with the guidance counsellors.  We need to do more work on that because we have created the courses and extra funding for tradesmen to take on apprenticeships.  A great deal of work has been done but now we need to get it out there.  That is why I wonder about the low uptake of the green consultancy and Lean interventions.  There are not massive numbers availing of them, when you consider the amount of SMEs in Ireland.<\/p><p> That is all I want to say.  Our guests are doing great work.  It has been a tough two years so I do not want to criticise them.  However, we do have a climate emergency.  We need to forget about Covid-19 and go for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#G01800","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I will start the responses to her questions, if that is okay.  At the very top level, we published our strategy last month, as I said.  The headline target under pillar 4 of our strategy is to adopt the Government target of a reduction of 29% to 41% in the enterprise sector by 2030.  That is a critical and key target on which we are focused.  With every support we offer in this space at present, we are asking questions about the tonnage of carbon that will be reduced as a result of the intervention, whether under the Lean initiative or a result of direct green support.  If I go back one step, we have, in line with our strategy launch, created a new sustainability and climate action department.  We have staffed it up.  That team was active at an early stage last year but we have expanded it significantly.  There are three broad elements to that.  The first is to ensure we have funding supports available to business.  The second is to ensure we are monitoring that target achievement.  We have actions under the climate action plan to ensure we are monitoring the carbon output and actively working towards reducing it.  The third element, to the point Deputy O'Reilly mentioned, is around ensuring we maximise the opportunities from the green economy because I think they are many.  I know the committee will agree that there are considerable opportunities for Irish businesses if we can get the story right locally, and we are doing that.  We will see a big dividend in jobs from this space.  That is good.<\/p> <p>  On the Monday before last, I visited Tricel, a company of ours in Killarney.  Tricel, along with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, was launching an intervention around oil usage and solar power, among other things.  Tricel has done an extensive intervention on its plant.  We have seen that across many other companies in our base and I think we will continue to see that.  Companies are definitely on that track.  There was a question for Mr. McElwee about smaller company supports.  Certainly at the mid size, there is a lot of support available from Enterprise Ireland.  The key support we offered last year was the climate enterprise action fund, which was a voucher for companies to take the first step.  As Senator Garvey alluded to, we saw disappointing take-up of that, at least in the first half of the year although it improved towards the end of the year.  COP26 was not irrelevant to the improvement of the trend in that regard.  We want to drive that again this year and will do so.  We are preparing to launch a further campaign.  Awareness is the first step though, necessarily, that will not have targets associated with it because it is a small intervention.  As the Senator said, it is about getting the headspace right and getting companies to start thinking about these issues.  We see the same thing the Senator sees.  SMEs are busy and until climate change is an impending and compelling challenge, they will not focus on it.<\/p> <p>  We have for a number of years had environmental aid support to help with capital interventions for companies, including GreenStart and GreenPlus, which are effectively Lean projects about how to integrate more green techniques into a business.  Those supports are well established so we are not starting from scratch.  We are trying to increase the take-up of those.  We will see a lot more take-up of those during this year.  The more companies I meet around the country the more heartened I am by the level of attention to these issues.  We are absolutely heading in the right direction.  Conscious of time, I will hand over to Mr. McElwee to talk about the microenterprise element.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Leo Clancy"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I call on Mr. McElwee to be very brief because the time limit for this slot is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#H00300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

We have been encouraged by the take-up of it.  An evaluation will be done.

The model is also competitive.  Countries such as Scotland, France, Italy and Spain make great us of co-operatives.  What role do our guests see for workers' co-operatives in our economy into the future?  Perhaps we could focus on the medium term rather than the long term.

Amazon&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to Ireland is most welcome.   <\/blockquote> <p>Many people in SMEs, microenterprises and family-run businesses were shocked by those comments and they contacted me.

Has Mr. McElwee heard much from the companies and businesses he is working with about the potential threat from organisations such as Amazon and how they can stack up their resilience against those big massive players in the field?

The feedback we got from an evaluation of that campaign is that it supported approximately 69% of respondents to buy from their local businesses.  In a way Covid-19 highlighted the competitiveness of the services our local businesses can offer.  I had a view prior to Covid-19 and I hold it even more strongly now that the trading online voucher is about giving our local businesses the tools to compete in a virtual world with the likes of Amazon.  For a period during the pandemic it was easier to buy from Amazon than it was to buy online from a local business.  As the Deputy will know, most of our young people operate in a digital world.  Equally, to be fair to some of the large players, they provide quite good training supports to our small businesses to equip them with the necessary tools and skills.

It is a model that could be replicated and that will support our innovation culture.  I would not say there is a capacity issue there.  I would see it more as an opportunity to grow and develop that.  We will work with our colleagues in Enterprise Ireland on that.<\/p> <p>  Remote working hubs are well catered for.  A number of State agencies and private operators are facilitating them.  It is hard to assess demand because Covid restrictions meant some of the capacity was restricted but that was due to social distancing.  It will be more informative to assess how effective they are as we return to a greater degree of normality in the next month or two.  They are hugely important for what was mentioned.  It would be beyond my remit to comment on the small FDI companies.

I have been familiar with the Questum Acceleration Centre for a number of years.  The Senator&rsquo;s question on capacity is interesting.  It is interesting that in recent weeks I have met two large companies with well over 100 staff which told me that remote working during Covid-19 had been the saving grace for them as regards office space and continuing to grow because they have been able to bring their people back, even though they probably have 150 staff and room for only 100 of them.  Remote and blended working is a positive for them when it comes to capacity.  The same is true for remote working hubs.  There are probably business model challenges for a number of the remote working hubs in attracting back people who will want to take long-term desks in a physical centre with the advent of home working.  That is a challenge on one side.  There is an opportunity for them to become hubs in a much more general sense.  The one certainty is that every town that has a hub believes it is important to the vibrancy of the town to have a centre where business gets done.  Whether that becomes the place where people work all the time or where they come for events, advice and other services is a question that will be asked more often in the next 12 months.  It will be interesting to see the results of that.<\/p> <p>  We are always positive on developing road infrastructure.<\/p><p>Some sites in our base would not necessarily be as large as some of the very large foreign direct investment, FDI, sites, but infrastructure development is positive for all business.<\/p><p> We can look at the very small FDI on a case-by-case basis with our colleagues in the Industrial Development Authority, IDA.  We are open to and have had discussions in the past on that.  It is a discussion we can take away.

My questions are mostly for Mr. Clancy.  Ambition 4, as set out in the opening statement and the Enterprise Ireland, EI, strategy, is \"Irish enterprises leading globally on sustainability and achieving climate action targets\", which is mainly measured in terms of the climate action plan target of a 29% to 41% reduction in emissions from the enterprise sector.  How does that tally with the big emphasis on increasing exports?  Does that not contradict it to some degree?  Goods exports are transported around the world by fossil fuels.  The WTO says approximately 20% to 30% of total carbon dioxide emissions are associated with international trade.  More than 7% of greenhouse gas emissions come from international freight transport.  If one increases goods exports, it seems very difficult to achieve reductions in carbon emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#L00400","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":180,"content":"<p>There are a couple of elements to that.  First, the Irish enterprise sector is more manufacturing based than services based, at present.  I see that changing in the coming years.  I mentioned Wayflyer, Flipdish and a number of our other new unicorns.  I strongly believe that many of our exports in the future will be digital and services based and much of the growth will be in that space.  That said, we anticipate continued growth in the manufacturing sector.  All of what the Deputy has said is hugely relevant.<\/p> <p>  If one looks at this strategically, many of the goods that are shipped to any country in the world come from a very far distance away.  China is one of the very large producers, at present.  If one looks at where we are focusing on exporting to, we see much growth in northern Europe and the eurozone.  Those will continue to be key growth locations.  Our exports to those locations may compete with exports from even further away.  In that context, Ireland will still be a greener choice for exports to those locations.<\/p> <p>  Coupled with that, increasingly with the climate action plan, we are a high-quality jurisdiction in terms of our adherence to laws and regulations and traceability of carbon, in particular.  That will stand to us in terms of how Ireland can stand up and make the case that we certainly have an industry that is greener.  Many of our clients are thinking about their supply chains in terms of scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions and are looking at plans both for offsets and reductions in carbon.  It is a fair question, but in order to answer it fully, one has to look at the global context and the services and digital opportunities before us, which will grow very significantly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Leo Clancy"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Transporting goods, at present, uses considerable fossil fuels and it is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise, according to the OECD's international transport forum.

I see what Mr. Clancy is saying about how people in northern Europe will buy things from Ireland instead of China and therefore, overall, we will reduce emissions.  However, China is not similarly planning for that.  The whole world plans to continue to compete on the basis of exporting more and more stuff.

Many companies have had difficulty in the lead-up to Brexit and Covid.  Thankfully, the lead-up to Brexit has been longer than we had anticipated and so it has given companies more time to be ready.  Enterprise Ireland has been supporting companies since 2016.  We got out of the blocks very early in terms of supporting companies, as did the LEOs.  The extended period has served people well in terms of being ready.  In the period leading into Christmas last, where we had a deadline of 1 January, which was subsequently deferred, we saw a lot of registrations from smaller companies in particular that would not have had them.  There were some encouraging signs that companies are ready.  Large companies are very ready.  Anyone to whom I have spoken on the large company side, or even the medium side, have said they have made appropriate provision.  That said, I do not doubt that there may be some negative consequences yet to come from Brexit.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the overall picture, post Covid, of company stability and the potential for examinership or difficulties, we are not seeing huge trend data and we are not hearing massive concern from our client base that they will be in trouble.  The results last year speak to that.  There was a very strong resurgence.  Companies had been able to reopen gradually during 2021.  That said, there will be examinerships.  The low-cost examinership process that has been put in place is very welcome.  There will be companies that get into difficulty.  The bigger concerns at the moment are inflation, the cost of goods and the cost of shipping for companies.  Those are the areas that potentially are driving difficulty, maybe more so than market difficulties because markets have reopened to a large extent.  We are not seeing massive signs of difficulty.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the question around diversification, we have seen significant and continued diversification from the UK market over the years.  That has happened in a really positive way.  Since 2010, the UK has accounted for approximately 50% of our exports.  In 2022, that figure stands at 30%.  That is a proportion that we intend to maintain.  We think that 30% into the UK is a level we are going to maintain over the coming years.  That diversification has gone elsewhere.  Even in the context of the percentage diversification, we have seen the absolute amount of exports into the UK continue to grow over time.  We are targeting the same over the coming four or five years such that we will see exports to the UK continue to grow, albeit at a lower rate than might have been the case.  Exports elsewhere will continue to grow.  Through programmes such as Enter the Eurozone, we are very focused on particularly highlighting the eurozone as an opportunity for clients.  In my view and that of my colleagues, Irish companies are not availing enough of the opportunity that being part of the Single Market presents us.  That is a huge opportunity area for us in the coming years.

The reality is we deal with early stage start-ups and not all of them will succeed.  Some of that might be by choice in that people often get into business and decide it is not for them and they opt out.  There are a lot of transient jobs as well.  People might take a job with a local firm for a year or two but then decide to move on.  We focus so much on the net job position because that gives us a true test of the stickiness of those jobs.  I should also make the point that we transferred 114 companies to Enterprise Ireland, which included approximately 825 jobs.  That is a number that would not be reflected in our numbers this year.

I take the point that we are a small island but it is more complicated than just saying \"look at the carbon footprint\" because if we look at freight alone, we must miss a piece around the carbon footprint of the production of it abroad.  I have seen this in the past where the carbon footprint of something indigenous is actually higher than something produced abroad even if we take freight into account so it is not as simple as just looking at where it came from and saying if it came from abroad, it is worse.  That is not the case, unfortunately, in proper carbon calculations.  It is not all about the freight.  We must look at how and where it was produced.<\/p> <p>  I know big businesses are quite good at this so they can employ people full time to look at it but we need to see carbon targets if we are going to tie into the climate action plan.  Nobody has yet raised the circular economy.  It now makes more economic sense to be ecological in looking at where you get your stuff and end of use, waste and cost of waste as opposed to looking at the different components of every part of your business and how you can keep things back in the economy and reuse, reduce or repurpose in some shape or form.  We are way behind on that level.  I see best practice in other countries.  I was at the Rediscovery Centre yesterday, which has a good display model of some things around furniture, bicycles, paint and clothes, including fast fashion, but there is a significant piece of work to be done with small businesses around the circular economy.  They are going to need help with that to look at components, where they are sourcing stuff and even packaging.  It is now trendy to have compostable and biodegradable packaging but a lot of that stuff is only industrially compostable so we must be careful about greenwashing.  When we move towards a climate-focused economy, we must look at greenwashing and make sure what we are doing will genuinely reduce waste and carbon footprints so we must up our game in that regard.  This is where we might need upskilling across the people advising us.  Consultants can be great but sometimes they just make sure it looks green.  We must make sure it really is green, which is why I go back to the carbon calculations and carbon targets.  <\/p> <p>  Sometimes the SME sector just needs funding for capital to help upgrade existing equipment, which would be more energy-efficient, and buildings.  Then they might be able to take on more employees.  Some small businesses are successful but perhaps what they need most of is capital funding to help them improve their buildings and equipment so that they can be more efficient and afford to take on new employees.  <\/p> <p>  Are the witnesses looking at specific supports around the circular economy? As Deputy Paul Murphy said, the more we can produce in Ireland, the better.  We could not even produce face masks.  Manufacturing is very weak in Ireland yet I have seen CNC routers and 3-D equipment that can do this stuff.  I do not think we are really going for it in this realm.  I have seen a CNC router make a bicycle.  Most children's bicycles are coming from Indonesia.  I would like to hear about work being done in the circular economy if we are going to be serious.  I firmly believe that with the right supports, businesses can be economically viable and very ecological.  We must watch out for just saying the word \"sustainable\" everywhere and greenwashing.  We have been doing that for years.  We need to be very genuine.  We need carbon calculations and investment in the circular economy if we are serious about this as we move forward to be a resilient island.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#N00200","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>There is a lot there.  In respect of the Senator's point about the circular economy and how we support clients in that regard, I have been part of a number of conversations directly with clients where we have spoken about innovation support we can offer directly through research innovation grants.  Mr. McElwee mentioned agile research and development earlier so that is certainly a support we can use.  If a company is looking at changing its packaging format and needs some additional help or incentive to make that happen, that is somewhere we support.<\/p> <p>  We also support innovation partnerships, which is work that can be placed with the university.  I mentioned UCD and its focus on the circular economy earlier.  If a company finds an academic it can work with in a university setting, we will provide very substantial grants for the work that can be placed with those in order to achieve that outcome for them.  There are a number of areas like that.  <\/p> <p>  The other thing mentioned by the Senator was the elimination of waste.  We spoke about the Lean For Micro scheme.  We also operate the LeanStart, LeanPlus and LeanTransform programmes.  These programmes are very focused on productivity but the essence of productivity is that you cut waste out of your business be that time waste of employees or,  more specifically, material waste.  That is possibly a precursor to the circular economy.  It involves avoiding the creation of a product that needs to be recycled in the end.  Those are two of the key areas where we support the circular economy.  It involves avoiding the creation of waste and excess packaging and other things being created in the first place and supporting companies with changing their methodology.  A recent conversation I had involved changing from a non-recyclable pack to a recyclable one.  This is an area where we would look at providing innovation support directly to the company as well as what could be provided by universities.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with the Senator's point regarding freight and the carbon footprint abroad.  It works both ways.  In the context of the Senator's point and that of Deputy Paul Murphy, Ireland's increasing move towards a renewably powered economy provides us with significant opportunities to be greener in this space.  If we are an economy that will have significant amounts of our industry fuelled by wind and possibly by green hydrogen over time, we have an opportunity to be that country that even with any transport emissions still has a greener product produced here than somewhere that might be relying on coal-fired stations elsewhere so there are significant opportunities for us in that space.  The Senator's overall points are very welcome.  I know she started with the small and micro enterprise side.  I might hand over to Mr. McElwee to comment on that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Leo Clancy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":206,"content":"<p>We do capital equipment funding as part of our traditional measure one funding.

We believe that in the future, the businesses that are not sustainable and are not demonstrating that they are serious about their carbon footprint will be probably be pariahs in our society.  Much of the work of the local enterprise offices involves getting businesses on board in all of this.  That has been particularly difficult over the past two years because businesses have had to deal with a crisis.  Mr. McElwee mentioned the Green for Micro programme earlier, which has thrown up a lot of really interesting cases of businesses that have begun to understand the necessity of looking at how they are using their resources and ensuring there is resource efficiency there.  A lot of programmes relating to the circular economy are in their infancy.

I am trying to understand the point at which issues around workers' rights, supporting decent jobs and so on enter the process.  Perhaps Mr. Clancy might enlighten us as to the point at which Enterprise Ireland starts speaking about workers' rights, how they can be respected, how there can be decent jobs, etc.  We all talk about decent jobs and how that is what we want.  Luckily, most of us on this call have decent jobs, but I am speaking about people who do not.  When Enterprise Ireland speaks to its clients about workers' rights, how does that work itself into Enterprise Ireland's process and conversations?  Every person at this meeting is supportive of workers' rights, decent jobs and so on, but my question is on being proactive in that regard and giving practical effect to that support.  We are speaking about companies that are supported by the State, which itself says that it supports decent jobs and workers' rights, however that assertion manifests.

For instance, one of the matters that we ran programmes on last year was hybrid work, blended work and people evolving their workplaces to ensure that they are attractive to employees.

Sin sc&eacute;al eile as to whether that works, but it is what it is.  Mr. Clancy mentioned statutory requirements.  In many instances, those are only to adhere to the minimum wage.  In almost all instances, the statutory requirement is the bare minimum.  It is the floor.  It is what any worker in any business can expect to achieve.  We can follow up on the analyses at a later date, but would Enterprise Ireland be open to including a more rigorous analysis of workers' rights in terms of more than just pay?  Pay only tells us part of the story.  Would Enterprise Ireland be open to including a reference to workers' rights, adherence to Labour Court recommendations, matters of industrial stability and so on in the overall analysis?  Looking at pay, even if it is brilliant pay, does not provide the whole picture of how workers are faring within a specific business or industry.  Where the State is spending money, we want to see workers' rights being respected, upheld, encouraged and much better than the statutory minimum that all workers can expect.

I have been involved in the Open Doors Initiative since the start.  Has Enterprise Ireland engaged with the initiative or would it consider getting involved?  The IDA and many other State agencies are engaging with it.  It seems that many employers want to get into this space and support these groups, who face challenges.

If they are dealing with local authorities on this matter, can they please make sure the digihubs are not located in an industrial estate 2 km or 3 km outside the town, which most people would have to drive to?  I have unfortunately seen that quite recently.  I will not name the place but I decided to use this town's digihub as a meeting room, in order to support it, and it was 2 km outside the town.  It works well in Ennistymon, for example, where it is right in the heart of the town, which is brilliant.  It is not as if we do not have empty buildings in town centres.  We will not even go there.  If the witnesses have influence with local authorities, can they make sure the digihubs are not put outside the towns?  We want to bring things into towns, as the witnesses all know.  That is just one thing I wanted to flag.  Maybe they could learn from the mistake made with the particular digihub I mentioned.<\/p> <p>  Having worked with organic food and lots of producers, I know about producing food.  We still have issues around the branding of Irish food and how it can stand out from food imported from other EU countries or non-EU countries.  I have fallen foul of this myself and have bought things like rashers or cheese as I was convinced through the labelling that they were Irish products.  I was raised to buy Irish where at all possible and it is getting more competitive now.  The price of quality food and organic food has come down so it is becoming more affordable as we increase food production but the branding can be quite deceptive and it can be hard to distinguish.  Is there anything we can do about that?  I know there are EU regulations and so on.  I just wanted to flag that as an issue if we are serious about supporting indigenous food producers.  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, launched a grant last week to help with food packaging, which is good, but we need to support the indigenous food sector.  It has not been mentioned yet here today.  We talk about carbon footprints, and of course it depends on how the food is produced, but we are producing very little food in Ireland and we import an awful lot.  We bring in 80,000 tonnes of spuds from England and 30,000 tonnes of seed potatoes from Scotland every year.  If we are serious about indigenous jobs, there is huge potential for jobs in the food sector.  I know some organic growers who have created lots of jobs on their small family farms through producing good-quality food.<\/p> <p>  The supports for the digitalisation of equipment are good.  However, there is other equipment that does not need to be digitalised but just upgraded, and that can be quite costly.  Going back to the capital grant, sometimes people just need help with capital funding to improve their old equipment.  That will enable them to increase their employee numbers.  Unfortunately, it is not all about digitalisation, especially in the food sector.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses are doing great work but we are under pressure.  There is a climate emergency and we need to get this country to become resilient in so many different ways.  With the loss of biodiversity, we will not be producing food any more.  It is huge, so I will try to push the witnesses on it, unfortunately.  I have emailed both organisations to arrange meetings.  I will be meeting Enterprise Ireland's climate group, as well as Mr. McElwee about the lean and the micro and what else we can do.  This is something I am passionate about and I look forward to working with the witnesses on it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022021600002#P00400","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  We look forward to meeting her.  It is a pleasure.  She should keep pushing us.  That is what we are here for so she should not worry about that.  I agree with her about digitalising equipment.  Sometimes a capital upgrade is what is required.  Last year we launched the capital investment scheme in food, where we approved more than &euro;70 million worth of grant aid for refreshing capital equipment.  Many of those projects included upgrading the sustainability of the products and services being offered.  It was a multipronged approach.  In many of those plants, those were some of the first investments in quite some time.  It was certainly a huge support to the food industry in being able to do things to make it more sustainable, more productive and more future-ready.  Critically, it will give it an edge in export markets.  That scheme has been awarded and is under way.  It is certainly helping.<\/p> <p>  On a day-to-day basis, we have a capital investment incentive scheme that is availed of by companies to upgrade equipment.  We roll that out keenly.  We usually do so in conjunction with the lean products I mentioned earlier.  We want to make sure that if people are using valuable capital, not to mention the State's contribution, it is done in the right way and is as optimal as possible.  That is something we do.<\/p> <p>  Again, I agree with the Senator about the branding of Irish food.  I met a food producer in the last couple of weeks who is in exactly this space.  They said that the supermarkets were some of their favourite clients because they clearly brand the food with the IE markings and so on.  This is very important.  It is more a matter for Bord Bia and its branding and brand guidelines, which are quite strong.  It does a lot of work on this and has run advertising campaigns around consumer awareness.  It is continuing to drive that.  We send the message to our clients that everyone has a part to play in making sure people understand what excellent Irish food is.  The opportunities for organic and artisan Irish food are huge.  We can achieve an awful lot and we are supporting small artisan producers all the time.  Many of those producers were in trouble during the Covid period and many of the recipients of our sustaining enterprise funding were those artisan producers and people who were producing high-quality products for the Irish and overseas markets.  We are glad to have been able to support them.<\/p> <p>  On digital hubs and remote working hubs, the trend is firmly towards towns.<\/p><p>The mood definitely reflects that.  I recently gave a video interview from Ludgate Hub in Skibbereen, in the heart of the town.  We see many other good examples of that around the country.  Being able to walk to the hub from where you are staying when you spend a day in west Cork and being part of the community are important.  That is a growing trend.  We talked in a similar vein to Senator Crowe about PorterShed in Galway.  That is certainly the direction of travel.  I thank Senator Garvey for the questions.

Today's witnesses are giving their evidence in the committee room so we do not have to give the reminder about giving evidence remotely.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place at which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  I ask that everyone co-operates with this.<\/p> <p>  Today's engagement is the committee's fourth meeting on the issue of the indexation of welfare and the taxation system.  This is an issue that we will go into in some detail so I appreciate everybody's attendance.  I welcome Mr. Joe Cullen, principal officer, income tax policy unit, and Mr. Matt McGann, principal officer, fiscal analysis unit, at the Department of Finance; Ms Jasmina Behan, acting assistant secretary, and Mr. Cathal McDermott, assistant principal, at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Lawler, assistant secretary, Ms Aideen Mooney, principal officer, and Ms Saidhbh&iacute;n Hardiman, assistant principal, at the Department of Social Protection.  We will go to Mr. Lawler first, followed by Ms Behan and Mr. Cullen, if that is acceptable to everybody.  I call Mr. Lawler. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022021600002#A00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak.  We have provided members with some briefing material in advance of the meeting, which I hope they found useful and informative.  The issue of benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments has been a topic of discussion for many years.  It stretches back to the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986, through to the national pensions policy initiative in 1998 and the Final Report of the Social Welfare Benchmarking and Indexation Group in 2001, which was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.  More recently, the focus has been on State pension payments.  A Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 proposed a benchmark of 34% of average earnings as a rate of payment with future increases linked to the consumer price index and wage levels.  The Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 presented a defined approach to benchmarking and indexation of pensions, known as the smoothed earnings approach.  This is the approach that has been considered and endorsed by the Commission on Pensions and, along with other commission recommendations, will be considered by the Government in the weeks ahead.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is fully aware, the rate of State pension each year is decided as part of the budgetary process.  The introduction of a system of benchmarking or indexation can help to alleviate some of the difficulties inherent in that process.  I will highlight a few of them.  First, with no explicit link between pension rates and earnings, the real value of pensions relative to market-based earnings can deviate from year to year.  Similarly, with no link to prices, the real value of pension rates can lead ahead of, or lag behind, changes in prices.  Second, the uncertainties created by the current process, given the scale of spending on pensions, make public expenditure planning and budgeting across all of Government uncertain.  It is worth noting the Department of Social Protection is now the highest spending Government Department and pension expenditure will comprise approximately 40% of the Department&rsquo;s entire budget in 2022.  Third, workers planning retirement arrangements face significant uncertainty with regard to the real value of the State pension at retirement, which impacts upon their ability to make appropriate private pension arrangements.<\/p> <p>  A number of approaches could be taken to indexing pensions, some of which witnesses have outlined to the committee over the past number of meetings.  While not exhaustive, these include indexing to rises in prices; indexing to rises in earnings; indexing to a certain percentage increase each year; or indexing to the higher of a number of indicators.  Again, there can be difficulties with each of these approaches.  For example, linking to prices only would risk pensions falling behind average incomes in society generally, linking to earnings only may lead to the real value of the pension falling during periods of high inflation, and increasing to a set percentage each year does not take account of either earnings or prices and, while it guarantees certainty to pensioners, does not take account of developments in the wider economy.  Finally, linking to the higher of a number of indicators leads to a ratchet effect whereby the rate, over time, will exceed all of the indicators chosen and outstrip both earnings and prices. As noted by the Commission on Pensions, this can lead to fiscal sustainability issues and has been a recent subject of controversy in the United Kingdom, which has adopted a triple-lock approach. <\/p> <p>  The smoothed earnings approach endorsed by the Commission on Pensions seeks to overcome this by smoothing pension increases over time, anchoring to a particular benchmark such as a percentage of earnings, but indexing the pension rate to prices during periods where inflation outstrips earnings.  In subsequent years, when the value of the benchmark exceeds a prices-adjusted rate of pension, it is again tied to the benchmark.  In effect, over time this anchors the pension rate to the benchmark level over the medium term.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is an outlier in not having a benchmarking or indexation mechanism for State pensions.  Throughout Europe and beyond, governments have adopted approaches to calculating state pension increases that rely on earnings or prices indicators &ndash; or a mix of both &ndash; to determine annual pension rates.  Having said that, to adopt this approach would be a fundamental shift in how budgetary planning decisions are made.  In this regard, as outlined in the Roadmap for Social Inclusion, the approach could be overseen by an independent, expert body and could operate in a similar manner to the Low Pay Commission by making annual recommendations to the Government.  The body could also periodically review the effectiveness of the approach.<\/p> <p>  In the time permitted, we hope to give the committee an insight into current thinking around the benchmarking and indexation approach under consideration.  I thank the Chairman.  My colleagues and I are happy to respond to any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022021600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Lawler"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak with members on the issue of benchmarking and indexation.  My colleague from the Department of Social Protection has already outlined the background to benchmarking and indexation in relation to the State pension.  The report of the Commission on Pensions from October 2021 and the accompanying technical working paper on benchmarking and indexation set out an overview of the proposed policy recommendations and the key considerations relating to these recommendations.  Previously, officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform worked closely with officials in the Department of Social Protection on possible approaches to applying benchmarking and indexation to the State pension in advance of the publication of the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025, which was published in January 2020.<\/p> <p>  One approach discussed in the roadmap was referred to as the smoothed earnings approach.  This approach was endorsed by the Commission on Pensions in its report, which was published in October last year.  I will talk through the mechanism of the smoothed earnings approach in more detail and highlight some important considerations of potential changes to determining the State pension rate from a public expenditure management perspective.  Broadly, the smoothed earnings approach is based on two parameters: growth in wages and growth in prices.<\/p><p>Using wage growth as the benchmark, the State pension is calculated as a percentage of average earnings.  This percentage has frequently been assumed to be set at 34% based on an analysis from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, dating back to 1996.  By benchmarking the State pension rate to 34% of average earnings each year, changes in earnings are reflected in the basic State pension rate.  <\/p><p> The second component of the smoothed earnings approach applies price inflation to the calculation.  Here, the pension rate is adjusted using the harmonised indices of consumer prices, HICP.  Both the consumer price index, CPI, and the HICP are designed to measure the change in the average level of prices paid for consumer goods and services.  The HICP has gained prominence in recent years as it enables comparison across EU member states.  Its main difference from the CPI is that it excludes items such as mortgage interest, motor tax, house and car insurance and trade union subscriptions.  The HICP and CPI are typically very close in their measure but the HICP has marginally been the higher indicator of the two in recent months.<\/p><p> Once the pension rates are calculated, the smoothed earnings approach uses the higher of the 34% earnings benchmark or HICP growth over the period to determine the increase in the rate.  The smoothed earnings approach is designed to preserve the real value of pensions over time and to keep pace with both inflation and earnings, whichever is growing faster.  Linking pension payments to developments in earnings and prices in this way can provide greater certainty to individuals and to public expenditure planning.  If implemented, it could bring Ireland&rsquo;s approach to determining the appropriate pension rates more in line with other countries.<\/p><p> However, benchmarking and indexation would be a fundamental policy change which also gives rise to important considerations in relation to managing the public finances.  Future pressures on the public finances due to an ageing population are well documented.  Expenditure on the State pension is due to increase considerably as a proportion of modified gross national income, GNI, over the coming decades.  Department of Finance calculations included in the pensions commission's report estimate that expenditure on social welfare pensions will increase from around 3.8% of modified GNI in 2019 to 5% by 2030, assuming that the pension age is retained at 66.  By 2050, this estimate increases to 7.9%.<\/p><p> A change in policy such as implementing the smoothed earnings approach would impact on the current budgetary discretion available to the Government, which allows for consideration of the overall prevailing economic conditions.  Periods in which both earnings and prices are both falling, and periods in which the public finances are under pressure due to economic conditions, could represent problematic scenarios for the application of the smoothed earnings approach.  The Government is currently considering the recommendation of the pensions commission to establish a pension rate commission.  While the presence of such a commission may help with the deliberation process for applying a benchmarking and indexation approach, there is also the consideration of the administrative complexity and cost that may arise.  The Government is due to deliberate on the pensions commission's recommendations by the end of March this year.<\/p><p> I hope that gives this committee an insight into the high level detail of the benchmarking and indexation approach under consideration for pensions and the key considerations in relation to the public finances.  My colleagues and I will be happy to take any questions committee members may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022021600002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Jasmina Behan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Behan.

We are happy to provide the Department&rsquo;s expertise to support the committee in examining the question of indexation of the tax and welfare system and, in particular, the rationale for and against indexation of the tax system; the approach that might be taken, including how it might operate; and how automatic indexation might affect budgetary sustainability.<\/p> <p>  We have followed very closely earlier discussions which the committee has had with other contributors over recent weeks.  Those discussions have covered in some detail the rationale behind indexation of the tax and welfare system and we are happy to make available our analysis to further inform the discussion today.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Finance&rsquo;s responsibility, and hence expertise, in this area largely relates to tax policy.  However, the Department also has responsibility for overall fiscal sustainability.  In that regard, as part of our contribution, we can outline the extent to which the EU fiscal rules impact on budgetary flexibility and, in particular, how the rules would account for a system of automatic indexation, as compared with the present approach.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the underlying rationale, when welfare support payments or personal income tax credits and bands are increased in a particular year while earnings and prices are rising, such an approach seeks to ensure that the purchasing power of welfare supports is maintained and the value of take-home pay for those at work is preserved.  Our ESRI colleagues indicated during their appearance earlier this month that indexation of tax and welfare changes in line with wages growth as opposed to prices growth is the only way to ensure that welfare recipients and workers see their income grow at the same rate.  We also note in this regard that the current programme for Government contains a commitment that from budget 2022 onwards, \"in the event that incomes are again rising as the economy recovers, credits and bands will be indexed linked to earnings.\"  The question of whether the base reference for the index used should be prospective or retrospective is also a point for consideration and it is brought into particular focus at the moment by current price and wage movements.<\/p> <p>  A further key point made by our ESRI colleagues, one which we would underline, is that, historically, changes to tax and welfare parameters have, on average, kept pace with earnings.  This aligns with the Department&rsquo;s own analysis when we look at the effect of budget changes over time on the personal income tax system.  The picture as it applies internationally was addressed in detail by the ESRI in its presentation to the committee.  In our view, it would be important to explore this aspect and reflect carefully on any learnings, while remaining cognisant of the fundamental differences in approach to taxation and welfare that exist across countries.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the steps that might be required to create an indexation system, these would initially be likely to require policy decisions regarding the scope of the change.  Questions in this regard include whether it would involve both the tax and welfare systems; whether it would apply to all elements and supports or just a key subset; and whether the same degree of indexation would apply to both systems in any year.  Other questions include whether indexation should take place by reference to increases in wages or prices; whether the index used would be retrospective or prospective; whether, and to what extent, a facility for discretion to suspend or modify the system in any particular year would be built into the arrangements; and whether the system would be placed on a statutory footing or something less binding, for example, a set of non-statutory guidelines.<\/p> <p>  Were such a system to encompass both tax and welfare, it would be likely to require in advance of the annual budget close co-ordination and co-operation at the political and official levels across a number of Government Departments in order to discuss and agree matters such as the degree of any deviation from the expected extent of indexation, if the system allowed for this and, of course, the percentage index to be used.<\/p> <p>  Returning to the issue of the rationale for having a system of automatic indexation, a key attraction of such an approach is that it might be expected to give more certainty to beneficiaries on both the tax and welfare sides, both individuals and families, from year to year about the value of their income or take-home pay and entitlement to supports.  At the same time, as has been pointed out by contributors previously, the main drawback is that, to the extent that automatic indexation might apply, it would limit or curtail Government flexibility around the discretionary allocation or non-allocation of resources in any particular year.  This would be likely to have practical implications not only within the tax and welfare systems but also for the allocation of resources for support and incentive schemes across a wide range of other areas of government.<\/p> <p>  As noted earlier, the approach of successive Governments over the years has been one where automatic indexation has not applied each year and where budgetary flexibility has been retained in large measure from year to year.  However, as has also been noted, this approach has delivered results which are broadly similar to what would have been achieved if indexation to earnings growth had been in place.  Ultimately, the question of annual automatic indexation is one of political choice and preference.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chair and members of the committee for their attention.

Have other social welfare payments been examined in this context, aside from the pensions?  I refer to payments made to younger people, jobseeker's payments, the working family payment. WFP, etc.  Has all the focus in this process been on people of pension age?  Equally, in respect of side benefits, such as the fuel allowance and medical card and those qualifying thresholds, has consideration been given to indexing them as well, or is there a narrow focus on the pension rate itself?  I ask for some details on this point.  Turning to another matter, is it only the State pension being considered in regard to this process or is there also scope for making changes to semi-State pensions, such as those paid by Aer Lingus, ESB, etc?  The recipients of those pensions have been clear that they have not had any rise in several years, and their pensions are also being threatened by the impact of PRSI changes now as well.  I wonder where pensions such as those fit into the picture.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the taxation side, and Mr. Cullen outlined several aspects in this regard, it seems that what is being talked about is a proposal in respect of income tax for pensioners and younger people as well.

The starting position if there were to be indexing of bands and credits is that it would apply to everyone.  On the issue of what has been achieved in the absence of having a system of automatic indexation in place, I will give a concrete example.  We have taken figures for average earnings from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, publications and looked at the years from 2014 right up to the impact of budget 2022, which was a period when the economy began to stabilise after the financial crisis.  In that time, a person on the average wage back in 2014 would have been earning around &euro;36,000.  The current equivalent average earnings figure is &euro;44,191.  The effective rate of tax on those two figures has varied slightly over that time, but not much.  It was 21.8% in 2014 and, after budget 2022, it is now 22.5%.  Therefore, it is broadly similar.  This would suggest that the tax changes we have introduced have broadly kept pace with increases in earnings over that fairly decent period of eight years.  If we look at married couples with one earner, people in that situation have done even better.  In 2014, their effective tax rate was 13.1%.  That has reduced after budget 2022 to 11.7%, and this has been largely due to the impact of the increase in the home carer tax credit over that time.  Those are just some brief examples of how the system has matched the growth in wages over that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022021600002#C01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Cullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Ms Behan has indicated that she wishes to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022021600002#C01100","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Regarding other types of pensions, in the context of public service pensions, there are two different cohorts and different indexation policies.

Is it standard across Europe that pensions should be 34% of average earnings?  It is not a lot.  He stated that average earnings are &euro;44,000 at the moment.  It is not really a lot.  What is the particular rationale for that figure?  Is it just tradition?  Where does it come from?  Is there any variation across Europe in that benchmark of pensions being 34% of average earnings?  In other words, is it more or less, in general, in other countries?  Does Mr. Lawler have any sense of those comparisons?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of other payments, as other Deputies have noted, much of this discussion is focused on pensions and the possible indexing of pensions against inflation or wages, or a combination of the two, or other indexes, but not other payments.  If I heard Mr. Lawler correctly, he stated it is more complicated in those areas.  Is it done elsewhere?  I am not sure why he would say it is more complicated.  I take the point that there are many different types of payments, but all these welfare or pension payments are quite low and people who are on them are pretty much at the lowest levels of income possible.  I am not sure why there would be a rationale for not indexing all social welfare payments in some shape or form to ensure they retain some value or do not fall behind inflation or that a gap between those payments and average wages is not widened.  I am curious to know whether this is done internationally.  Why are we not looking at all of these payments to ensure they are indexed?  Obviously, this is a live issue, given the current inflation rates.  Certainly the &euro;5 flat rate increase introduced in the budget seems very inadequate in the face of the level of inflation and the rising cost of living we are seeing at the moment for all recipients of pensions and social welfare payments, so we need to do something to make sure these payments do not fall behind racing levels of inflation if they occur. <\/p> <p>  I understand the difficulty.  If it is pinned to wages and inflation is racing ahead of wages, there is a problem.  If it is pinned to inflation but not to wages, the gap between average wages and pension or social welfare payments potentially widens if wages increase ahead of inflation.<\/p><p>It seems some combination of both those elements would probably be the best, although I am interested in hearing an opinion on that.  I cannot see it being more complicated.  I would imagine it would be best to have all those options available to us and then have some sort of hybrid that would still be flexible enough to take into account changing circumstances.  There would be a minimum level of indexation but also discretion to deal with unusual circumstances or particularly marked changes that may leave the basic method of benchmarking inadequate in dealing with problems emerging either in terms of inflation, the cost of living or increasing gaps between social welfare and pension payments and earnings in society.  Those are my thoughts and questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022021600002#E01900","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy wish for those to be directed to a particular Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022021600002#F00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Not particularly.

He spoke about some kind of a mix between earnings and prices, with some kind of oversight for times when something unusual is happening.  That is the proposal endorsed by the Pensions Commission for State pensions.  It is exactly the mechanism described by the Deputy.  One cannot choose a benchmark that exists forever without some kind of review of effectiveness.  That is what is proposed for pensions.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned that he does not see why there could not be a rationale for not indexing all social welfare payments.  He could be absolutely right and it is something we must analyse in order to see how such a system would work.  Would it be exactly the same as what is being proposed?  We do not know.  Would it be some kind of other indexation?  We do not know.  Where would the benchmark level be set?  Would the benchmark be the same for all social welfare payments or would disability payments be different from jobseeker payments, for example?<\/p> <p>  When we speak about complexity, it relates to the range of payments and circumstances that people are in and what they need.  There is also the fact that there are already different levels of payment for different circumstances across the system.  That is what I mean by complexity, and it will require thought.  Generally, across the system in Europe and beyond, the focus to a large extent in most countries is on pensions, and probably for the reasons I have just described relating to complexity when dealing with working age payments.

It set a kind of nominal rate, although I cannot remember if it was &pound;50 or &pound;60 at the time.  The Pensions Board looked at it in 1998 in the context pensions and converted it to a percentage of earnings at the time.  Pension rates have largely tracked that benchmark over those years and subsequently.

The benchmarking and indexation group in 2001 was divided on the view but a majority indicated a figure of 27% of gross average industrial earnings, with a minority favouring a 30% figure.  The national pensions review board continued to recommend the social welfare and pensions figure of 34% of gross average industrial earnings.  The roadmap for pensions reform 2018-2023 also put that forward.  The 34% figure is the benchmark at which the rate is initially set but once it is locked, it is about the movement, as it is linked with earnings as always being 34%.  It matters at the start what is the figure but it just moves together.  The key issue is that once the rate is set, we are basically ensuring if we go with the parameter that the pension moves at the same pace as wages.<\/p> <p>  To echo previous comments, the complexity in looking at all welfare payments arises because there is a multiplicity of payments.  The first question is whether all or some payments will be considered; if only some are to be considered, we need to figure out how the process interacts with the rest of the payments.  Another question is what parameter is to be used, and whether it is to be prices, wages, a double lock or other approaches.  There is a cost implication of various options that must also be considered.  There is also the consideration of how these changes in policy will affect the labour market, incentives to work, replacement rates and so on.  There is much complexity that must be considered when looking at indexation and benchmarking of all welfare payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022021600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Jasmina Behan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":298,"content":"<p>The Deputy made an apposite point about the need to maintain some kind of flexibility.

Our own projections for wages tend to be from the very top down, because where we use wage projections is to feed into our macroeconomic forecasts.  We are looking at the aggregate level.  We use something called compensation of employees.  That is basically like the pay bill.  It has numbers in it.  The number of people at work drives that as well.  That is perhaps not as suitable for trying to maintain parity with wages.<\/p> <p>  Average weekly earnings is used for the benchmark.

I was interested that she brought up the HICP.  There was a new recommendation, I believe it was in November last year, around including house prices.  It currently includes rent and the recommendation was that it would also include the cost of home ownership.  I have formed what is perhaps an incorrect opinion over the past three sessions that a lot of the early generation of indexation started off linking it to prices, and the current thinking is that it may be more robust when linked to wages.  Given that we are experiencing huge levels of inflation with rental costs and house prices, is the HICP of particular interest?  Given Ireland's housing crisis, is the HICP a fair reflection of what is happening within our own system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022021600002#J00500","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I will ask a colleague from the Department of Finance to come in on the HICP piece, but I will try to answer it first.  As I mentioned in the opening statement, we moved towards the HICP and away from the CPI.  It is more in line with the EU comparison, so there is that international aspect to it.  It has always been the case that individual countries' circumstances may not fit neatly into the measurement.  There is an even greater complexity around what is measured in each case and what is appropriate to use for indexation of pensions, such as baskets of goods and so on.  The view that the HICP may be more appropriate for pensions because it excludes certain elements and might better reflect the basket of goods is one aspect to using that parameter, but other parameters can be used as well.  With regard to including house ownership, again the consideration is about who the indexation is trying to protect.  For some individuals who do not own, it might be appropriate to use a different parameter, and maybe the HICP is more appropriate.  There are pros and cons in using different indices to grow the inflation.

As we discussed earlier, this brings in an added layer of complexity.  For example, people are in different circumstances.

There are different rates of payment across the social welfare system for different contingencies.  All of that would have to be taken into account.  Where would the benchmark be set?

I tried to earwig on some of the contributions.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that struck me, and perhaps will have struck a lot of people, is the range of commissions, initiatives, groups, reviews, reforms and frameworks that have been put in place over the past 30 years, and even the raft of things that have happened in the last number of years.  Some people are terribly well provided for, as the finance officials will know.  There are even some semi-State public employees, and I can think of one company in particular, who are regarded as having the Rolls-Royce of pensions.  Curiously, that group is making representations to some politicians at the moment about indexation of pensions.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses may already have covered my question, and if so I ask that they would please forgive my ignorance about it.  Because of inflation in the last little while, and due to Covid dampening down so much consumer activity, I have been receiving representations from constituents around issues such as the home adaptation grant, and finding that the amounts available for them have not kept pace with the increased costs of construction.  Indexation does not just apply to pensions.  It clearly comes into stark relief at particular times. <\/p> <p>  I have previously raised the theme of future-proofing budgets in the Oireachtas Select Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  In the last two years we have begun to equality-proof budgets, so we should also embark on future-proofing budgets, if such a thing is possible, to ensure that spending now does not involve creating an increased burden on generations to come.  In the context of indexation, could any of the witnesses speak to that?  If we were to future-proof things, where do they see this given the demographics?  We hear about the ratio of pensioners to those who are actively involved in participating in the labour market.  This ratio will narrow in the coming years and more people will be dependent.  Clearly, indexation has implications for that.  Perhaps some of the witnesses could speak to that piece, if it has not already been covered.  It has been covered, I will get it back in the transcript.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022021600002#J01400","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will start, and my colleagues might want to contribute afterwards.  With regard to indexation and benchmarking, the idea is to preserve the real value for people in receipt of the State contributory pension and benchmark against earnings in order to ensure that the rates for pensioners keep pace with the growth in earnings and the real value.<\/p> <p>  On sustainability for future generations and the impact of demographic changes, the issue has been considered by the Commission on Pensions, which examines a wide range of issues of relevance.  These issues include the State pension age, the sustainability of the funding for pensions, and the indexation of rates to preserve the value and keep the pace.  These are just some of the issues that were considered by the commission.  The Government is considering the recommendations through the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment and has referred the questions on sustainability - or meeting funding demands associated with an ageing population and demographic change - and the parameters we might need to put in place to fund that expenditure to the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  All the deliberations will be presented as a proposal to the Government, to be decided on by the end of March.

Previously, colleagues from the ESRI and the Nevin Economic Research Institute pointed out that indexing to wages is fiscally neutral in that the tax&ndash;GDP or expenditure&ndash;GDP ratio stays the same.  However, that is based on all other things being equal in the abstract and there being no other emerging pressures.  In fact, we know we have many other emerging pressures, including in respect of how Covid will play out, the structural shifts in the economy, what those shifts will mean and how Brexit will fully play out.  We do not know how these will play out.  We know we will have to put considerable sums aside to fund the green and digital transitions.  We will probably have increased health expenditure as a result of Covid.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, there are demographic changes coming.  These are among the better-known knowns.  We do not yet have a good handle on some of the factors, such as the digital transition, but we do on the ageing population and demographic pressures.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, going from having four people at work for every pensioner to two will place an unsustainable demand on the system as it stands.  Indexation to wages is fiscally neutral in the abstract but, as others have pointed out, there is an argument in favour of maintaining some flexibility because there are many other pressures coming down the line that will eat into our available resources.

Is it innocent of me to ask whether the figures can be substantiated?<\/p> <p>  On the unknowns, as the delegates were talking, I was thinking about a move to the cost-rental model, for example.  Under this model, people might be in a position for the first time in Ireland to rent for the long term or for life.  In theory, they should have more disposable income because they will not be facing the cost of a mortgage, although we know that in some parts of Dublin the cost of a mortgage is half the cost of rent at the moment.  However, I am assuming they would have more disposable income.  Under the Vienna model and other such models, these people's rent obligations would taper off on retirement.  It would be built in that there would be a tapering-off when their income dropped and they were in receipt of the State pension.  Are considerations like these being factored in?  These are general questions.  I am not pinning them on the delegates because I would imagine they have answered more detailed ones already.

The fertility rate is falling and people are living longer.  There is a compositional issue in that the proportion of the overall population working by comparison with the proportion not working is changing.  That has two effects.  First, it affects age-related expenditure because it goes up a lot more.  Second, it slows growth because a big input to growth is labour force growth.  This is lost when not as many people are coming in.  It has been a big driver of growth.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, a big unknown in this regard is migration.  Migration can feed into it.  That is difficult to forecast.  The Department published a paper on population ageing and the public finances last September.  We use EUROSTAT projections for the demographics, fertility rate, long-term growth rate in the economy, etc.  The increase in age-related expenditure will place a huge burden on the public finances.

Before we begin, I will go through a few housekeeping matters.  If members or witnesses who are participating remotely experience any sound or technical issues, they should let us know through the chat function on Teams.  As this is a public meeting, the chat function on Teams should only be used to advise of technical issues or urgent matters and not to make general comments or statements.  I remind members and witnesses who are participating remotely to keep their devices on mute until they are invited to speak.  When they are speaking I ask them to have their camera switched on, where possible, and to be mindful that we are in public session.<\/p> <p>  In addition, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  On Covid-19, I ask everyone to keep their masks on unless they are speaking and to exercise personal responsibility.<\/p> <p>  Today, we will continue pre-legislative scrutiny of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2021.  We had our first meeting yesterday on this matter.  Our witnesses are: Professor Eilion&oacute;ir Flynn and Ms Cl&iacute;ona de Bhail&iacute;s from the Centre for Disability Law and Policy at the National University of Ireland, NUI, Galway; Ms Carol Baxter, assistant secretary, and Mr. Niall Brunell, principal officer, Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth; representatives of the Decision Support Service, DSS: Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn, director, and Mr. John Farrelly, chief executive of the Mental Health Commission; and Mr. Adam Harris, commission member, and Dr. Iris Elliott, head of policy and research, Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  They are all very welcome.  We are delighted to have them with us either present in the room or virtually.  We had a very interesting session yesterday and I hope they had the opportunity to listen to it.<\/p> <p>  I will advise the witnesses of parliamentary privilege before asking them to give their opening statements.  Witnesses addressing the committee from the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For those appearing virtually, there is uncertainty if parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Again, therefore, if they are directed by me to cease giving evidence, it is imperative that they comply with any direction.<\/p> <p>  The running order of the opening statements will be Professor Flynn, followed by Ms Baxter, Mr. Farrelly and Mr. Harris.  I call Professor Flynn to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#A00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Centre for Disability Law and Policy at NUI Galway, I welcome this opportunity for engagement with the committee on the important subject of proposed amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.  Our centre was among a coalition of organisations that campaigned for the Act to be introduced in 2015, as part of Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to bring our laws into conformity with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  We share the frustration of other groups who have made submissions to this committee that in the seven years since its enactment we have not seen sufficient change to protect the human rights of those subject to this legislation.  The centre has provided a detailed submission to the committee outlining our objections to some of the proposed heads of Bill and the need for further amendments to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s human rights obligations.  I am happy to discuss any of these issues with committee members in the discussion that follows, but in my opening statement I will draw their attention to three overarching issues with the process of developing, and the substantive content of, the amendments proposed.<\/p> <p>  First, as has been noted by other groups, especially disabled people&rsquo;s organisations, the process by which these amendments have been developed has not been inclusive.  A 174-page document containing the heads and explanatory notes was published by the Department on 22 November.  To the best of my knowledge, there was no public process organised by the Department to engage with disabled people&rsquo;s organisations, or other groups, in the development of these heads.  There is also no plain English or easy-to-read version of the text available.  Indeed, there is still, seven years after the enactment of the original legislation, no easy-to-read version of the 2015 Act available.  This law has a significant impact on the lives of disabled people, including people with intellectual disabilities, and it has not been made accessible to them.  This raises a broader issue with the accessibility of legislation, and legislative development in general, which I urge all Deputies and Senators to tackle.<\/p> <p>  Second, I am concerned about the overall direction of the amendments we are discussing.  While many of those amendments may appear minor or technical in nature, I believe a clear pattern emerges from them, which is the increasing bureaucratisation of support and the creation of an assisted decision-making industry.  Many of the amendments will make it more difficult for a person to designate their chosen decision supporter, or more challenging for a supporter to work in the way the person wants.  This is the exact opposite of what many of those who campaigned for this legislation wanted.<\/p> <p>  Third, I am disappointed that the amendments put forward in the heads of Bill are not more ambitious in respect of human rights compliance.<\/p><p>There are some obvious gaps in the original Act which are not addressed in the amendments proposed, like ensuring that advance healthcare directives remain fully applicable for those detained under the Mental Health Act and removing language concerning the deleterious effect on the unborn in the wake of the repeal of the eighth amendment of the Constitution.  Some of the provisions incorporated here from the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 also miss the mark in terms of what we hoped for, for example, in enabling disabled people to sit as members of juries.  The amendments also do not address the need for further resources to be provided to give effect to the decisions people may make under this law, including decisions about where and with whom to live.<\/p><p> Finally, the Act&rsquo;s reliance on the functional assessment of mental capacity remains incompatible with Article 12 of the UNCRPD according to general comment No. 1 of the UN committee on the rights of persons with disabilities.  We have waited seven years since the enactment of this Act but if we need to wait a bit longer to improve the Act&rsquo;s human rights compliance, it may be worth the wait.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Eilion&oacute;ir Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Flynn very much.

As members will be aware, the Bill is intended to amend the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to address issues that have arisen since its enactment and which must be rectified or removed before it can be commenced.<\/p> <p>  Commencement of the 2015 Act will enable a fundamental change of the law on decision-making capacity to be brought into effect, which will abolish wardship and provide persons with capacity difficulties, known as relevant persons, with access to new decision support options that are required to respect that person&rsquo;s decision-making autonomy to the greatest extent possible.  Once the DSS becomes operational, people with capacity difficulties will have access to the agency mandated to enable them to avail of these new decision support options.<\/p> <p>  The process of preparing for the DSS to become operational has enabled a critical review of the 2015 Act to be undertaken, identifying provisions which would operate more effectively if amended or which go counter to the objective of safeguarding the rights of the relevant person.  The new system for enduring powers of attorney, for instance, under which the relevant person registers the power while she or he has capacity, is intended to give the relevant person control of the process, including being able to resolve any questions in relation to the power rather than leaving them to an attorney when the relevant person has already lost capacity.  The DSS is being given powers, for instance, to specify certain matters such as in relation to the forms to be used when people are applying to establish, vary or revoke one of the decision support options.  This will allow it the flexibility to change forms as needed, including where statutory requirements change under other Acts.  It will also be able to provide services digitally.<\/p> <p>  The 2015 Act addresses challenging policy matters.  While the provisions on restraint were intended as restrictive, limiting the use of restraint in private settings to exceptional situations, we have been advised by a range of stakeholders that these provisions might be interpreted instead as permissive.  Accordingly, the general scheme proposes to remove these provisions from the 2015 Act.<\/p> <p>  The provisions on wardship proposed in the general scheme are designed to strengthen the protections for wards as they go through the process of being discharged from wardship or moved to the new decision support options.  Safeguards are also being strengthened where a decision supporter abuses his or her position.  The general scheme provides for the director to apply to the court for an order temporarily prohibiting someone from acting as a decision-making supporter pending the outcome of an investigation where there is a risk that the decision support might deplete the relevant person&rsquo;s assets or pose harm to that person.  The general scheme also provides for an offence of ill-treatment or wilful neglect of a relevant person by a decision supporter and for persons convicted of such offences to be disqualified from acting as decision supporters.  This is a complex area requiring careful deliberation.  It is not possible for the general scheme to address all the issues which arise in such a fundamental reform of the law on capacity.  The safeguards that will apply where a person is deprived of his or her liberty will be the subject of separate legislation, which is currently being prepared by the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  The Bill is also intended to enact key provisions of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which lapsed at the dissolution of the Houses before the latest election.  These provisions include giving IHREC a statutory mandate for its role to oversee implementation of the UNCRPD and for the National Disability Authority, NDA, to support this process.  It also provides for the incremental doubling of the percentage of people with disabilities employed in the public service from the current 3% figure to 6% by 2024.  This is a key measure to increase employment opportunities for people with disabilities in line with the objectives of the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities, the third action plan of which is currently being finalised for 2022 to 2024.<\/p> <p>  The general scheme proposes to amend the Electoral Act 1992 to remove the prohibition preventing persons \"of unsound mind\" from standing for D&aacute;il elections.  It also proposes to amend the Juries Act 1976 to enable people with specified disabilities to serve on juries.  This will open the door for more visible and meaningful representation and civic participation for persons experiencing capacity difficulties and for people with certain disabilities. It represents key progress in further realisation of the UNCRPD, in particular of Article 29.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, the Bill is intended to support the reform of the law on capacity.  We look forward to the joint committee&rsquo;s report on the general scheme and to enactment of this important Bill at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Baxter"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Baxter very much.

The Mental Health Commission's remit was extended by the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to include the establishment of this new decision support service.  The director of the DSS, Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn, is attending the committee.<\/p> <p>  Ms Flynn and her staff in the DSS are employees of the commission, with a distinct but complementary statutory remit.  Until shortly before the passing of the 2015 Act, the intention was that the DSS would be located in the Courts Service.  It is my view that the commission is a more compatible home for the DSS as the commission has been able to share its valuable experience of building a service to implement long-awaited, rights-based reforms.<\/p> <p>  The board and the executive of the commission have been strongly supportive of the DSS establishment project.  This is and has been a multifaceted project based on an approved, time-bound and costed plan.  It is worth stating that the business processes, IT systems, communications and draft codes of practice of the DSS have been developed based on assumptions about the content of the amended Act.  At this stage, any major divergence from the present general scheme would impact on our timeline to the commencement of operations.  We would hope to commence in June this year.<\/p> <p>  During the DSS establishment project, the service has had the opportunity to engage extensively with the Department of Children Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and previously with the Department of Justice and Equality on amendments to the 2015 Act.  At all times, this engagement has been with a view to ensuring that the Act functions in a way that is person-centred and provides ease of access to the new support framework.<\/p> <p>  We are pleased to note that a number of our proposed amendments are reflected in this general scheme.  As set out in our submission to this committee, we have particularly welcomed the following proposals.  Amendments with regard to the director&rsquo;s investigation of complaints clarify that informal resolution rather than escalation to the court should be available where appropriate.  The amendments also provide a means of temporarily suspending a decision supporter pending investigation in urgent cases.<\/p> <p>  It was our submission that the repeal of section 43(3), which provides for the court to confer on the director responsibility for custody, control and management of the relevant person&rsquo;s property, albeit in limited circumstances, is incompatible with the director&rsquo;s other functions and, indeed, had echoes of the approach in wardship.<\/p> <p>  We believe the revision of the process in relation to enduring powers of attorney should provide greater certainty for persons planning ahead.<\/p> <p>  The improved position of current adult wards whose cases will be reviewed under Part 6 is welcome.  We understand there are approximately 2,150 adult wards and that approximately 40% hope to apply to have their cases reviewed as soon as possible after commencement.<\/p><p>The improvements in access to the court and to ongoing review are important, as is the repeal of section 57 with its concerning reference to \"a class of wards\".  The removal of provisions around the purported exercise of restraint by attorneys and decision-making representatives is also very important.  In this context, we reiterate the urgent need for protection of liberty safeguards for institutional settings, which we understand are to be developed as stand-alone legislation by the Department of Health.<\/p><p> In our submission, we refer also to a number of minor outstanding matters and to more substantive matters not included in this general scheme, on which we understand work is continuing.  The commission is particularly concerned about the interface between the 2015 Act and the Mental Health Acts.  We must emphasise that access to the supports available under the 2015 Act cannot be withheld from persons in the mental health setting.<\/p><p> I reiterate that the commission and the DSS team is appreciative of the contribution we have been able to make to this amending legislation and the invitation to address this committee.  The 2015 Act is ambitious and complex legislation.  From our extensive and diverse stakeholder engagement, we are aware that there are varying opinions about the 2015 Act, whether it goes too far or not far enough, especially with regard to achieving compliance with the UNCRPD.  There may well be matters that need to be revisited in future and it is part of the director&rsquo;s duties to keep the operation of the Act under ongoing review.  It is, however, deeply principled legislation and we know that a huge number of persons are waiting impatiently for its delivery.  We are pleased to assist with this step forward on the journey to its long-awaited commencement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Farrelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Farrelly and invite Mr. Adam Harris.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#C00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I am joined by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission&rsquo;s head of policy and research, Dr. Iris Elliott.  The commission is Ireland&rsquo;s independent national human rights institution and national equality body.  Since Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UNCRPD, we have also acted as independent monitor designate of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under that convention.  In doing this we have operated under our own statutory mandate and powers while awaiting this legislation.  Today we will address the statutory role this legislation will confer on the commission as formal monitor of the UNCRPD, but also our recommendations more broadly on this Bill.<br\/><br\/>The commission has, over recent years, used our legal powers to act in a number of landmark cases around Ireland&rsquo;s wardship system.  These have included: AC <i>v<\/i>. Cork University Hospital, which made clear that people with disabilities are protected by the same constitutional guarantees and legal protections as any other person; L <i>v<\/i>. which clarified the rights of voluntary patients in approved centres; and AB <i>v<\/i>. Clinical Director of Saint Loman&rsquo;s, which found section 15(3) of theto be unconstitutional.<br\/><br\/>Being blunt, for far too long we as a State have put up with a system of wardship, which is detached and divergent from any contemporary understanding of the concept of personal autonomy.  The move to a rights-based approach, with respect for the will and preference of the person is long overdue.  Offensive legislative language of lunatics and lunacy must be dispatched to the dustbin of history, replaced by a recognition of the rights of people with disabilities, and viewed through a lens of dignity, agency and participation.<br\/><br\/>A strength of this new legislation lies in its greater assimilation of human rights standards as to privacy, expression, fair trial, liberty, and association, stemming from our Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, the UNCRPD and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  The commitment by the Government to commence the 2015 Act by June 2022 is absolutely necessary, but the commission holds concerns after years of delay, that such significant legislation is being moved at significant pace.  We would restate our ask, made first in respect of the original legislation in 2016, that in line with UNCRPD obligations, every opportunity is afforded to a wide range of stakeholders, particularly people with disabilities, to meaningfully participate both in this pre-legislative scrutiny, and in a continued exchange with relevant stakeholders in the development of and implementation of this legislation.<br\/><br\/>The committee's pre-legislative scrutiny yesterday with disability rights groups and disabled people&rsquo;s organisations, while welcome, must not be seen as job done.  With our commission&rsquo;s UNCRPD monitoring role, it is welcome that this independent monitoring mechanism will finally be cemented by way of an amendment to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  While the lapsed Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 had previously stood to provide for this, this amendment is now contained in head 85.<br\/><br\/>Compared to the text of the 2016 Bill, the amendment now proposed makes a number of changes.  This Bill for example does not make explicit provision for the commission &quot;to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of persons with disabilities&quot;, whereas the previous amendment did.  This Bill has deleted the word &quot;protect&quot; in the outlined tasks of the independent monitoring mechanism, compared to the previous amendment.  These proposed changes require further consideration to ensure that they do not give rise to a narrowing of the commission&rsquo;s independent monitoring mechanism role.<br\/><br\/>IHREC recommends that on definitions of &quot;disability&quot; we would prefer to see an alignment with the UNCRPD Article 1 concept of disability rather than the 2005 Disability Act.  More broadly, while we welcome provisions to establish a new statutory framework around wardship, and on particular provisions including changes aimed at the better inclusion of disabled people on juries, we bring to member&rsquo;s attention some significant issues that remain to be addressed, namely, weaknesses around the limited nature of appeals given to relevant persons under the legislation.  The 2015 Act and this general scheme only allows for a limited appeal on the many decisions that can be made on capacity and related issues, and on a point of law only.  This compares unfavourably, for example, to the full right of appeal provided by section 19 of the Mental Health Act 2010.<br\/><br\/>Another significant issue is that it is unclear the manner in which legal representation will be afforded to relevant persons, particularly again when compared with how the Mental Health Act 2001 affords involuntarily detained persons a legal representative by way of statutory right.  Part 10 focused on detention matters and it is unclear what the time frames are within which applications to detain must occur.  This again compares poorly with provisions of the Mental Health Act, which establishes time periods within which applications for involuntary detention must be heard by mental health tribunals and appealed to the Circuit Court.  We would like to see much more detail on how during the transition period, wards themselves will be kept fully informed of the changes to be effected to their wardship regime.  There must be consideration of the situation of people with disabilities in prison, as highlighted by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, who might need to avail of decision-making supports while detained, and make any legislative amendments needed to provide such supports.  There is also the continuing failure to provide for a system akin to the deprivation of liberty safeguards that exist in England and Wales.  I will conclude here as there is much to discuss, and we are now happy to take any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Harris and all of our witnesses for their presentations.

No plain English or easy-to-read version of this is available and it has not been made accessible to them.  The issues of accessibility of legislation needs to be addressed.  How is it proposed to do that?  We need to engage with the disability sector to do that, but how can we best do that?<\/p> <p>  The second issue is that while the amendments may appear minor or technical in nature, there is an increasing bureaucracy of support in the creation of an assisted decision-making industry.  The amendments will make it more difficult for a person to designate their chosen decision-maker.  How can that be addressed?

It is important to understand that the State has an obligation under Article 4 of the UNCRPD to proactively engage with the disability representative organisations and disabled people.  The UN has interpreted that in some detail in general comment No. 7.  It looks at the sorts of reasonable accommodations that the State needs to make in its consultative processes to ensure that the voices of disabled people are at the heart of the process.  The commission will be happy to circulate a copy of the general comment to members after the meeting.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked what implications for disabled people are in this regard.  It is important to realise that this is the start of a three-year process.  IHREC has to be clear how wards will be communicated with during this process of a journey from the wardship system towards this assisted decision-making system.  Furthermore, we are concerned about the limited nature of appeals that seems to exist when compared with the Mental Health Act.  We are also concerned about the lack of clarity about what right to legal representation wards will have and about timeframes that would enable a person to be detained, which are less clear and less specific than what is in place in the Mental Health Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":398,"content":"<p>On the point about consultation, we appreciate that there is a tight timeline.  There is a shared desire to commence the Act as swiftly as possible, given how long people have been waiting.  However, we feel strongly, as has been said by other witnesses, that it is not too late for the Department to undertake a more comprehensive and meaningfully inclusive consultation with those who are directly affected by this legislation and the amendments contained in the proposed heads of Bill.  That can be done in a number of ways.  It can start with some of the groups that presented yesterday and extend beyond them.  There are different means by which the Department can engage with people.  We encourage it to do so before bringing the final Bill to Parliament.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example of the bureaucratisation of support that we are concerned about.  There is a clear example in head 3, which is continued in heads 38 and 60.  There is a proposal to remove the opportunity to include decisions about healthcare treatment in enduring powers of attorney.  That would mean that if I wanted to create an enduring power of attorney and I also wanted to plan my healthcare decisions in advance, I would have to create not one but two instruments, which are an enduring power of attorney and an advanced healthcare directives.  I may then have two separate requirements for supporting evidence, witnesses for each instrument, and separate assessments of capacity to make both instruments, since capacity is to be assessed in a decision-specific manner under the legislation.  It is especially burdensome if the relevant people would like to authorise the same person who they are granting power to under their enduring power of attorney as their designated healthcare representative in an advanced healthcare directive.  While people should be free to create two instruments if they wish, we are concerned that the legislation is making this distinction and not allowing people the freedom that they would like to have to decide exactly how their support will be provided.  That is just one example of the bureaucratisation of support.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the need for legislation to be made available in an easy to read format, there are several precedents for how this can be done.  My centre and other groups have expertise in supporting the development of easy to read documents.  For example, in England, the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Act 2019 was developed as an easy to read version.  We have some good examples for how this kind of capacity-related legislation can be done, even though the legislation is complex, and it takes time to explain it in an accessible manner that retainers the accuracy of the legislation.  I will leave it at that for now and am happy to speak again if the Senator has questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eilion&oacute;ir Flynn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":399,"content":"<p>The decision support service has been in the Mental Health Commission for some years.

In our submission, we refer to two aspects in which we think this is important.  Professor Flynn also referred to the removal of the viability of an advanced healthcare directive where somebody is detained under the mental health legislation.  The DSS of the Mental Health Commission has been very consistent in saying that is discriminatory, it offends against parity and it should be removed but I understand that is receiving attention.<\/p> <p>  Another concerning section in the Act is section 136, which effectively disapplies access to supports under the 2015 Act in the mental health setting, but I believe that is also receiving attention.  We hope that it will be amended in the final version of this legislation.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if it is appropriate to refer to some of the matters that have come up in colleagues&rsquo; answers today, but regarding access to legal representation, which Mr. Harris raised, there is provision in the Act for access to legal aid for the relevant person who is the subject of an application under Part 5.  Mr. Harris also referred to some aspects of Part 10 and the detained ward.  I understand that part of the Act is also receiving attention.  On wards more broadly, the review of their circumstances under Part 6 is the responsibility of the Office of Wards of Court, but it has begun to engage in communications with those current wards, who number approximately 2,150.  That would be ongoing, as the review continues, but that is with the Office of Wards of Court.<\/p> <p>  I am in a position to pick up on the point about the excessive bureaucratisation, as exemplified under the removal of medical and treatment decisions from enduring powers of attorney.  Merely by way of clarification, that was not one of our own submissions.  The idea is not to create obstacles, but rather to promote clarity.  At the moment, when it is possible to plan ahead, in terms of healthcare by way of an enduring power of attorney and an advanced healthcare directive, there were a concern that the two are not necessarily aligned in terms of the protections and requirements under parts 7 and 8 of the Act.  In addition, at the moment, as the Act reads, enduring power of attorney cannot extend to a refusal of life-sustaining treatment, whereas an advanced healthcare directive can.  It was with that in mind other colleagues made the submission.  It was better if advanced healthcare planning around medical treatment was confined just to an advanced healthcare directive, not to make things more difficult, but actually to make them smoother.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#E00100","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>My first two or three questions are for the Department.  All of us have had concerns about how, particularly through Covid, that approximately 1,200 people being taken into wardship since the Act in 2015.  Yet, because of this slow pace, various levels of decision-making supports are not operational.  Perhaps someone could come back on that.<\/p> <p>  Wardship is a blunt instrument.  We all agree that it is very important that this be replaced by a new framework of support aligned to a person&rsquo;s need.  It is disappointing that this is taking so long and that is my biggest issue.  It is welcome that we are seeing wee progress.  <\/p> <p>  The guidance from the president of the High Court regarding vaccines and wards, together with the memorandum from the HSE, was a welcome development in assisting healthcare professionals in approaching the matter of consent.  I had a lot of these representations during Covid.  When it comes to this important public health measure, that was an issue I encountered.  Many families came to me regarding vaccines during Covid.  Perhaps the departmental officials could reply on that.<\/p> <p>  Could one of them go through the cost, if possible?  I have concerns regarding the costs involved, which are not guaranteed under this legislation.  For example, medical card holders are covered for any costs that had supporting documentation by doctors.  However, what about those without a medical card?  Is there a plan to make this affordable?  <\/p> <p>  The report entitled Mind the Gap, compiled by researchers at the Centre for Disability Law and Policy and the Institute for Lifecourse and Society in NUI Galway and commissioned by the Ombudsman for Children, states that the supports offered under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act apply only to adults, even though children and young people with disabilities might also benefit from specific and tailored decision-making supports, especially during this transition from childhood to adulthood.  Is there any update on this?  Is this being discussed, especially for a child who will soon become an adult?<\/p> <p>  I understand my next question has been brought up in respect of mental health.  Will this Bill address the current system whereby people are detained in hospital for mental health treatment without a legal right to have their advanced wishes about treatment respected?  <\/p> <p>  That is the bulk of my questions.  The first ones are for the Department, then Professor Flynn and, finally, Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn from the commission.  I thank everyone for this information.  It is really important that we try to get through this as quickly as possible and get this legislation passed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#E00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":402,"content":"<p>We will start with either Ms Baxter from the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#E00300","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  We share her view that wardship needs to be abolished as soon as possible.  We currently have priority drafting and a lot of work being done on the amendment Bills.  We think it is very important to meet the June deadline in the interests of the relevant people whom we believe very strongly will benefit from this legislation.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the costs, there is very much a commitment that this will be accessible.  The costs are not absolutely finalised, but they will be low.  One of the overriding concerns of the Department is that this will be the case.  The services of the DSS will be open and accessible to everybody.  That is very much the case. <\/p> <p>  In terms of why the legislation is for adults rather than children, of course we recognise that children have complex needs, but the situation is that children have a radically different situation in terms of guardianship than adults.  When someone is under the age of 18 at the moment, he or she is normally under the guardianship of a parent or another adult.  Therefore, children do not have the same rights in terms of decision-making autonomy as an adult who is not ordinarily under guardianship.  That was why there was very much the sense when the 2015 Act was being developed that the rights of adults, in terms of guardianship, are different.  This legislation is, therefore, for adults. <\/p> <p>  Perhaps it might be useful to just come back on the consultation point.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is absolutely crucial and we very much welcome the fact that the committee is engaging with disabled people&rsquo;s groups.  We see that as a very important part of the process.  We also see this legislation as a continuity with the 2015 Act.  We were very pleased at the time of the development of the 2015 Act that Professor Flynn and Ms Cl&iacute;ona de Bhail&iacute;s were actively involved in the consultation processes.  This is very much not new policy.  It is the elaboration of the policy that was put in place to guide the 2015 Act.  It is also very much an elaboration of the kind of lessons that we have taken from the work that the DSS is doing and what the NDA has learned in the consultations that it has had and, most recently, a major conference on the convention.  In many senses, this legislation is a response and a listening to a long-standing consultation process.  We very much take on board the fact that an easy-to-read version of the Bill would be very important.  We will take that away.  We are also very ready to engage with disabled groups to answer any queries that they may have on the legislation.<\/p><p>As Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn has said, there are certain provisions that we are continuing to work on, including those relating to detention matters and, if possible, we will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to deal with allowing the advanced healthcare directives to apply to people who come under the Mental Health Act 2001.

Our thinking behind some of the comments in that report and in our recent submission to the committee was predominantly around the area of healthcare decision-making.  Under the current law, although it is a piece of criminal law, it is broadly understood that 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds can consent to medical treatment.  That is further reflected in our national consent policy and understood in that sense as well.<\/p> <p>  Other witnesses mentioned this issue to the committee yesterday in the context of mental health and the need to provide additional safeguards.  Our thinking was that if we were, for example, to extend to this age group the guiding principles under specific parts of the assisted decision-making Act, such as the advanced healthcare directives, it would provide additional safeguards for the upholding of their rights and the provision of necessary supports they might use in a way they do not currently have.  While they are seen to be able to consent in many instances and may be subject to capacity assessments because the functional test in part of Irish law and case law, and is possibly already in use, they may not have the presumption of capacity that is to be found under the assisted decision-making Act.  They may not have the duty to take all reasonable steps and the other issues we find in there, which would be very welcome for them.<\/p> <p>  The committee heard in Professor Eilion&oacute;ir Flynn's statement that we are not happy about the functional test and its compliance with human rights legislation.  If we are doing it, we want to put as many other principles and safeguards in place as possible and further a culture of support and empowerment, rather than one of capacity assessments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Cl&iacute;ona de Bhail&iacute;s"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I will pick up on one point the Deputy raised, which Ms de Bhail&iacute;s also touched on.  The Deputy made observations about the roll-out of the Covid vaccine campaign, which was a really interesting illustration of what should be the key precepts of this Bill.  It was encouraging to see the words \"will and preferences\" used in the statutory instrument which gave effect to the delivery of the vaccine.  It was a recognition that the preoccupation that can sometimes exist with accessing consent was satisfied in favour of ascertaining a person's will and preferences.  The cultural shift which this Bill is part of is well under way.<\/p> <p>  I will pick up on the practical point around costs which the Deputy mentioned.  We have heard clearly from the Minister that costs should not be a barrier to access to the supports under this Bill.  Insofar as we have been able to influence what costs we charge, we have been concerned with ensuring they are minimal.  There will, in fact, be provision for a waiver of the costs of the services provided by the DSS.  We do not have control over other aspects, such as the costs of going to court, but I think the point that costs should not be prohibitive is well made.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned an issue relevant to the Department of Health.  People must access specific forms of capacity statement from medical and other healthcare professionals in respect of co-decision-making agreements and supporting documentation around enduring powers of attorney.  We would also like to see assurance that those capacity statements are going to be available and that costs are not going to be an issue in that regard.

Our view is that would probably be an enhancement and would ensure that if somebody has planned ahead so their authentic voice can be heard and respected in relation to refusals of treatment, that document can be readily accessed.  I think a register of advanced healthcare directives would be an addition in that regard.  However, at present we do not have, and have been led not to expect, those regulations.

At yesterday's hearing I made the more general point that many speakers have reiterated that a problem with this process is that we are looking at draft legislation to amend an Act that has not yet commenced.  Those of us who were involved in the justice committee hearings on what became the 2015 Act have a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>, therefore, in debating these issues around legislating for capacity and trying to create an appropriate statutory framework yet again.

I wanted to make that point again.  Could I ask for a couple of specific clarifications?  I apologise if they have been addressed in previous contributions.

I know we have already addressed the issue of how this will extend to persons in involuntary detention but I want to expand it.  Perhaps one of the witnesses would like to come in again on that.  Ms Flynn and Mr. Flaherty from the Mental Health Commission made a point on the DSS about the stand-alone legislation that is being developed by the Department of Health on protection of liberty safeguards for institutional settings.

We recognise that in the 2015 Act under section 85(6) on the advanced healthcare directives there is a provision which was necessitated at the time of the 2015 Act by the continued existence at that time of the eighth amendment to the Constitution.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWhere a directive-maker lacks capacity and is pregnant, but...does not specifically state whether or not she intended a specific refusal of treatment set out in the directive to apply if she were pregnant...the refusal of treatment would have a deleterious effect on the unborn, there shall be a presumption that treatment shall be provided or continued. <\/blockquote> <p>Similarly, there is a provision that even where the directive-maker has explicitly said he or she wants the refusal to apply where they are pregnant, even if it &quot;would have a deleterious effect on the unborn&quot;, that cannot be respected without further application to the High Court to determine the validity of the refusal of treatment.  These sections are simply unnecessary and can be deleted from the legislation.

It may also be useful to make another point on the deprivation of liberty safeguards.  The Department of Health has done an initial proposal which was subject to extensive consultation.  The big difficulty is how to respond to the human rights needs of relevant persons and at the same time do a safeguard that is not cumbersome in itself or that does not necessarily always involve recourse to the courts.

In some cases it would seem that the rights that are in place are less favourable to those that are granted within the Mental Health Act.  I know Ms Finn has come back on the point on legal representation.  It is clear that the right to legal representation is provided within the Mental Health Act.  However, there does not seem to be the same level of statutory certainty on what that legal representation will look like in the context of the assisted decision-making Act.<\/p> <p>  On detention in the Mental Health Act, it is clearly defined that this cannot exceed 21 days.  It is not given a clear timeframe within the assisted decision-making Act.  There is a full right to appeal under the Mental Health Act, while there are a range of rights to limited appeal under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  It is important that the rights extended to those under the assisted decision-making (capacity) (amendment) Bill 2021 have the same strength granted under the Mental Health Act 2001.

I want to revisit what Deputy Bacik mentioned about legislation that is developed and then not commenced, and the point that we are amending legislation that has not been commenced.  Members will appreciate that as the national human rights institution this is a conversation we frequently have to have with the UN to explain that although on the Statute Book it looks like the work of the Oireachtas has taken place, and obviously it has in terms of legislation being enacted, it often is not commenced.  I am mindful that we are anticipating a schedule review of Ireland in front of the human rights committee at the UN in June and July.  We will need to explain to it that although it looks like we have a range of legislation in place, that legislation is not commenced.  The position of IHREC is that it appreciates all the concerns with moving this amendment legislation through the challenge of timeframes etc.  The position of IHREC is that this legislation needs to be commenced in June, appreciating that this may take a great deal of effort because it has already been delayed so extensively.<\/p> <p>  I also want to raise IHREC&rsquo;s ongoing frustration at the lack of progress on the deprivation of liberty safeguards legislation.  If there are questions around human rights standards and deprivation of liberty, IHREC made an extensive submission in 2018 and now we sit before the committee in February 2022.  As the national human rights institution and the designated UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, independent monitoring mechanisms, we are mindful that there is a range of legislation that the Oireachtas is engaged in that is expected will realise the human rights of disabled people in Ireland.  We have assisted decision-making capacity legislation, we have the deprivation of liberty safeguards legislation and we are waiting for the inspection of places of detention legislation as well.  There are multiple Bills that will create a robust and UNCRPD-compliant Bill.  I appreciate the challenge there is, particularly with the work that is ongoing on the Mental Health Act 2001.

I gave an example earlier of requiring people to create two instruments instead of one, namely, an enduring power of attorney and an advanced healthcare directive.  If the person wanted to designate the same person with responsibility with carrying out their wishes in respect of health treatment, it seems unfair for them to have to create two instruments to achieve that.  I appreciate the intention was not to make it more difficult but to have clarity from the perspective of those viewing the different instruments; however, the unintended consequence may be to make it more difficult for the people creating the instruments, rather than those reviewing them or trying to determine their applicability.  If the concern was about making sure someone who holds an enduring power of attorney can fully give effect to the person's will and preferences, including stopping life-sustaining treatment where the person wishes to give that power, a better way to achieve it would be to amend the provisions on enduring powers of attorney to clarify that if a person gives that explicit power to individuals, under that enduring power of attorney they are free to carry out their wishes.<\/p> <p>  Some of the challenges relating to bureaucratisation of the support that emerge from this process are at the intersection of the amendment Bill and some interpretations of the Act emerging in the draft codes of practice developed by the decision-support service, which are currently out for consultation.  An area we are concerned about is the proposal to have an online registration of various agreements.  Due to the digital divide, which is a serious issue for many disabled and older people, the requirement to have things like a MyGovID will make it difficult and inaccessible for many people and it will be a process that people feel they cannot engage with and they will give up at the first hurdle.  Though that is not the intention, it is an unintended consequence that needs to be given greater attention.  Having more engagement with the organisations controlled by disabled and older people and people with experience of mental health services would have perhaps led us to avoid this problem because those groups would have been able to say quickly that this would not work for many people.<\/p> <p>  It is important that there be a full process of ongoing engagement, not just in the progression of this legislation and development of the codes of practice the DSS is working on, but in the ongoing implementation, review and monitoring of this legislation at every level.  That is critical to the success of the legislation and ensuring we bring it as close as possible to conformity with the goals of the UN convention.

The first concerns the area of bureaucratisation.<\/p><p>We feel that, in fact, the key change to enduring power of attorney is very much a reflection of the importance that we attach in the amendment Bill to supporting a person to choose his or her decision supporter.  Currently, an enduring power of attorney is registered only when the person has lost capacity, so any possibility of asking the person what he or she meant about a particular thing is lost.  Under the new process, which is as a result of direct engagement with the Decision Support Service and the advice it has received from different jurisdictions, instead the person has capacity and is able to execute the enduring power of attorney and to register it so that any of the issues that arise or any lack of clarity can be teased out with the DSS while the person has capacity.  It is much more responsive to the principle of the person being able to choose the decision supporter, and also to be very clear as to the decisions that he or she wants to put into an enduring power of attorney.  We believe that is a clear example of the commitment to a more streamlined process that is much more responsive to the person's will and preferences.<\/p><p> In terms of June, we feel we have an opportunity and we have momentum.  Witnesses have talked about the non-commencement of other legislation.  We have the opportunity now to commence an important legislative measure, to get things finished and to get priority drafting.  We have been working intensively through an interdepartmental steering group with the relevant organisations, including the DSS, which is crucial, the Courts Service, the Department of Health and the Department of Justice, so a series of organisations is teed up for June.  Inevitably, if that is missed, we probably will get delayed for a significant period and we think that would really delay what is very important.  The 2015 Act offers real benefits in terms of abolishing wardship and giving tailored decision supports to people.

One is the amendment proposed in the Bill regarding the inclusion of disabled people on juries.  We believe the language needs to be strengthened here and we explained how we believe it should be strengthened in our full submission.  We are happy to make that available to anyone who would like to view it.  In particular, we are concerned that there is a proposal, which was passed in the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in the previous D&aacute;il, but this is not the previous D&aacute;il and there is an opportunity to be more progressive now.  It still includes language that singles out people with mental or intellectual disabilities when, in fact, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act does not use any cognitive impairment descriptions in its text.  We feel that is not compatible with the spirit and purpose of the 2015 Act and we would like that to be changed.  I reiterate that for the consideration of the members of the committee.<\/p> <p>  Another issue we did not get a chance to talk about more is the provision relating to cases under the Act being heard otherwise than in public.  Again, there is the proposal to change the Act's stance from what it was in 2015, which was that all cases should be heard otherwise than in public.  The proposal in the amendment is to remove that so that all cases may be heard in public.  We would like more clarification in the language here to ensure that the decision about whether a case is heard in public or otherwise than in public is taken primarily based on what is in the will and preferences of the relevant person.  There may be situations where the person would wish the case to be heard in public but, equally, there may be situations where it would be very important for the person for the case to be heard otherwise than in public.  We would like further consideration on that.<\/p> <p>  The final matter is bureaucratisation of support, on which there has been some discussion.  We all want the Act to be successful.  We all want disabled people, older people and people who experience mental health services to be able to use this legislation in a way that gives them greater autonomy and greater control over their lives.  That was the intention when the legislation was drafted.  To that end, we believe there may be a need for a further alignment with the Act of the draft codes the DSS is developing to move away from an approach to assessment of capacity that suggests that assessments of capacity can be conducted by a person who encounters the individual in a bank or a doctor's office or any other setting.  Nobody wants to bring matters to court unless they need to be there but, at the same time, if we are talking about not respecting an individual's will and preferences based on somebody's assessment of the person's capacity, I would certainly prefer, if it was me, that a judge had overseen that and actually declared me to lack capacity before somebody was empowered to make a decision on my behalf, rather than somebody assessing my capacity in a community setting, perhaps on a bad day or perhaps without the relevant expertise, and making a decision to refuse to respect my will and preferences on that basis.  It is very important, in keeping with the spirit and purpose of the Act as drafted and in compliance with the UNCRPD, that we try to get that clarity into the codes of practice, which will be the first port of call for many people trying to understand what their obligations are under the legislation.<\/p> <p>  I leave that on the table as a final contribution from us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Eilion&oacute;ir Flynn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I will start with the codes.  I read today the Centre for Disability Law and Policy's detailed submission on the codes of practice that have been out for public consultation.  All submissions will be taken on board.  There is quite an amount of complexity with certain parts of interpretation of the Act.  Some people have very definite views on what it says and means.  The range of opinion is quite striking.  Coming into the meeting I was concerned that perhaps we needed to bring further clarity to the matter of restraint, which received an amount of attention yesterday.  I believe that has been achieved, so that we all are clear about what is intended about the removal around the provisions relating to restraint in very particular decision-support arrangements under the Act.  It is not a broader statement on restraint at all, but I hope we have achieved that clarity today.<\/p> <p>  There were also some submissions yesterday about the desirability of a transitional period.  I have engaged quite extensively with the organisation that submission comes from and I think, and I do not wish to presume, that is based perhaps on an apprehension that as soon as the Act is introduced things automatically have to become very formal and that everybody will be rushing to court to put arrangements in place.  I do not think that is the intention and I hope I can provide better reassurance there.<\/p> <p>  There was also discussion yesterday about inordinately long time delays, to some extent, as I picked it up, informed by our demand forecasting.  To reassure, we do not suppose that people will have to wait seven or ten years to become a decision-making representative, which was part of a submission yesterday but I hope I can engage further with the organisation in question to provide further reassurance.<\/p><p>Finally, from this meeting and from our broad engagement with stakeholders under this Act, I find it very encouraging to see the appetite for change.  Much has been said about the cultural shift that this Act brings about.  From my experience, this is well under way.  It is not, fundamentally, an Act about capacity or new tools for accessing consent, it is not even primarily about the new and very welcome framework that the Act introduces.  Primarily, it is about supporting people to have their own will and preferences respected and to be at the heart of the decisions that matter to them, and to support and enhance their opportunities to take those decisions themselves.  I hope that everybody sees that as the starting point.  The Decision Support Service, DSS, is more than happy to continue to play its part.  We will deal with whatever legislation we are eventually handed.  We will not be the owners of this Act, we will be servants of the Act.  As Mr. Farrelly has said, a lot of work has been to done to build up a DSS, a lot of which is predicated on the Act as is and the Act as we expected it to turn out.  It is probably appropriate to say that if we have to do a reset, there could be further delays flowing from that, but clearly we will respect the legislative process.

The topic has been well ventilated at this stage but it has been suggested that one could go further and look at a prohibition on restraint.  Perhaps for the committee's future deliberations on this it might be useful to elaborate a little bit on some of the considerations that we had around that.  It was something we considered and then we eventually found that on balance it was a more appropriate fit for the Act to remain silent on it.  One of the issues that is quickly encountered when looking at a prohibition on restraint is the range of individuals who could act as decision supporters and the range of individuals, and different policy and ultimately ethical considerations around depriving any person of their liberty.  At the hearing yesterday it was mentioned that there is a huge difference in somebody who is wrongfully restrained in certain circumstances - and in the vast majority of cases we would all agree that it is always wrongful to deprive somebody of their liberty.  This becomes more complicated in a situation where, for example, somebody who has advanced Alzheimers is being cared for at home and, for their own safety, their children lock the door to the house.  Legally that is depriving somebody of their liberty but in many cases it might be the appropriate thing to do.  If we say that a decision-making representative, DMR, can never deprive somebody of their liberty, what if the DMR is the child in such an instance?  The whole area becomes very complicated very quickly.  It is not an area that we could look at in absolute terms.  It does deserve its own dedicated piece of legislation and its own considered policy response.  Similarly, deprivation of liberty has arisen in the context of the Mental Health Act.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has also spoken about this.  Assisted decision-making is first going through the legislative process and a number of instruments across the system which will be needed for further UNCRPD realisation including reform of the Mental Health Act and protection of liberty safeguards being won, and there is a long and ongoing and very close conversation between the Departments involved on which aspects of which articles are appropriate to which specific Acts.  On balance, it was decided to take out deprivation of liberty or protection of liberty from this Act because the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2021 is about assisted decision making and it quickly becomes complicated by bringing in other concerns that deserve their own dedicated policy response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Brunell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I will make some final comments and then Dr. Elliott would also like to come in.  The conversation we have had today is very complex, and we should not lose sight of the impact of the wardship system on people today, and the impact the system has with every day that we delay commencing the legislation.  In many respects we have been speaking of a seven-year delay, but in reality we are talking about Victorian legislation.  We are talking about change that is long overdue.  The commission has consistently raised significant concerns about the non-commencement in full of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act.  We believe that this delay is in many key respects the main issue that needs to be resolved.  In our view, it is essential that there is not another delay beyond the June period.  For far too long the wardship system has remained in place, which is completely out of kilter with contemporary human rights and equality norms, and especially the modern understanding of the concept of personal autonomy.  It is really urgent that we move to the new supported decision-making framework without further delay.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, there are complex issues to be worked through.  Perhaps the committee should look to the ability of the Oireachtas to work through complex issues very quickly during the Covid-19 pandemic.  As this conversation continues we need to realise that this is the first step in the legislative process, and the remaining stages offer an opportunity for further refinement of the new regime without giving rise to further delay.  It is critical that this process is in line with general comment No. 7, directly and in an accessible way to engage disabled people and our organisations, and also recognising that under general comment No. 7 there is a role for family voices as well.  It is always possible for lingering issues to be addressed subsequently by amendment or clarified in court proceedings if required, but we urge that we move forward with the commencement of the Act without any further delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":457,"content":"<p>As commission member Mr. Harris has said, this is our opportunity to end Victorian legislation on the system of wardship.  One thing the commission would like to draw the committee's attention to is the opportunity to include a sunset clause on section 9 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 to ensure that the ending of wardship is entirely copper fastened and that there is no way back by any other route into a wardship system.<\/p> <p>  I was mindful yesterday that a number of committee members raised the concern that delay on this legislation may then delay ratification of the optional protocol, and that this is seen as an important milestone in that journey.  I want to use this opportunity to welcome the continued focus on the optional protocol for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, and to reiterate the commission's long-standing position that we are calling for the State to issue a timeline and a detailed map for how we are going to get the optional protocol ratified.<\/p> <p>  I was also mindful yesterday that there was quite a lot of comment on the high percentage of disability services that are provided through the community and voluntary sector.  Where those services are provided through public bodies obviously the public sector and equality and human rights duty comes into play in ensuring that those services adhere to equality and human rights standards.  As the commission has repeatedly said, procurement processes also need to ensure that human rights and equality standards are adhered to by providers of disability services by the community and voluntary sector.<\/p> <p>  We also heard a lot of concerns raised about a lack of awareness or understanding of the law and the operation of that law by service providers.  There is also a lack of awareness among disabled persons themselves around the legislation, that the legislation is coming along and, when it is in place, how they will know about it.  I note that they CRPD has an article on awareness raising.  As commission member Mr. Harris has said there are obligations on the State under article 4 to ensure that people with disabilities and their family members are aware of their rights.  <\/p> <p>  We do not want to see a delay in the commencement of the 2015 Act or any delay the progress of this Bill.  We fully appreciate that this is going to take a lot of intensive work by this committee and by the Oireachtas.  I commend the Oireachtas on engaging with the public sector duty that is on the Oireachtas, and the inclusive practices that we have the through the commission's engagement with a number of Oireachtas committees, namely this committee, the Committee on Disability Matters and the Sub-Committee on Mental Health.  We would really encourage the Oireachtas committees and the Oireachtas system to continue to consider how those inclusive practices can be built on, particularly when we are entering a period where there are quite a lot of calls on people with disabilities and their representative organisations to participate in parliamentary processes.

As members may recall, I attended a meeting of the committee a few weeks ago in December as part of the nomination process for my appointment as Ombudsman.  At that time, I spoke of my intention to use the power vested in me as Ombudsman in a targeted and effective manner with a view to ensuring that the voices of those who are more vulnerable in our society, who might otherwise be missed, are heard and responded to.  I also outlined my commitment to continuing to shine a spotlight on the issue of access to transport supports for people living with a disability.  This is an issue which has been of ongoing concern to the Office of the Ombudsman for many years, and which was championed by my predecessors in this office, both Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly and Mr. Peter Tyndall.  Therefore, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to be here with my colleague, Ms Sarah Cooney, to discuss the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  It is good to be here in person on this occasion.<br\/><br\/>I will start by recalling our commitments as a country in respect of access to personal transport supports.  In 2017, Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, which commits all signatories to promoting, protecting and ensuring the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.  Persons with disabilities, as defined in the convention, include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments, which in their interactions with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.  Lack of access to transport is one of the key barriers stopping the realisation of these fundamental rights and can lead to the economic, social and personal isolation of people living with a disability.  By contrast, access to transport for many people can be an extremely important equaliser and enabler, providing independence, and can change the lives of people living with a disability in a positive way.<br\/><br\/>It is within this context that in November 2021, my predecessor, Mr. Peter Tyndall, published a report entitled &ldquo;Grounded: unequal access for people with disabilities to personal transport schemes&rdquo;.  This report was the culmination of a number of investigations over a number of years into the following transport schemes: the motorised transport grant; the mobility allowance; and the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  It is the latter scheme that the committee has invited me here today to discuss, but I wish to briefly mention the other schemes.  The motorised transport grant was put in place in 1979 and the mobility allowance was put in place as far back as 1968.  They were operated by the Health Service Executive and its predecessors, to support people living with a disability to access personal transport.  The motorised transport grant was a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The mobility allowance was a payment to people living with a disability who are unable to walk or use public transport and who would benefit from being mobile by, for example, using the services of a taxi occasionally.<br\/><br\/>In 2012, my predecessor, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, published separate investigations into the motorised transport scheme and the mobility allowance scheme.  The investigation into the motorised transport scheme found that the manner in which the HSE interpreted the medical criteria for eligibility was unacceptably restrictive and contrary to the equal status legislation.  The investigation into the mobility allowance scheme found that this scheme was in breach of the Equal Status Act 2000 because it included an upper age limit.  In both cases the Department of Health and HSE accepted the recommendations of the investigations and committed to reviewing both schemes in light of their findings.  However, in 2013,<b><\/b>following these investigations, the then Government decided to close both schemes to new applicants.  At the time, this was announced as an interim measure and a replacement scheme was promised.  However, nearly nine years later, a replacement scheme is still awaited and has not been delivered.  I raise this matter in the context of our discussion today to highlight the length of time successive governments have been looking at this issue.<\/p><p>The closure of these schemes is also significant for our discussion today as without such schemes in place since 2013, the disabled drivers and passengers scheme has taken on more significance for people living with a disability because it is the only potential support available to them.<\/p><p> Before moving onto the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme itself, I want to deal briefly with access to public transport for people living with a disability.  I very much welcome all the work undertaken under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 designed to improve accessibility of public transport.  However, for some people living with a disability, public transport may not be the most appropriate or even a possible mode of daily transport.  For example, the inadequacy of access to some public transport facilities, such as the DART, is a matter of great concern to people with disabilities who endeavour to use the service.  Many journeys on public transport also require the use of other transport services, which means that any problem occurring with one of the services makes the whole journey impossible.  For example, if it is not possible to get to a train station or bus stop, then clearly such train or bus services are not accessible.  Therefore, while improving access to public transport is an important issue in its own right, I believe it is unreasonable to suggest that simply improving public transport can address the transport needs of all people with disabilities.  I am thinking particularly of people who live in rural areas, or of those who cannot get to bus stops or train stations.  In such circumstances, a car provides optimum, and often the only, mobility for many people living with a disability for whom it is the key to their quality of life.  However, often they may need to be supported to acquire or access their own personal transport whether that be through a vehicle adapted for them to drive themselves or utilise as a passenger.<\/p><p> While access to a car can be life changing for many people living with a disability, adapting a car can be very costly.  The disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme provides a range of tax reliefs linked to the purchase and adaptation of vehicles by drivers and passengers with a disability.  They include reliefs in relation to VRT and VAT as well as exemptions from motor tax and tolls and refunds on duty paid on fuel.  In order to qualify for tax relief under the scheme, the person with a disability must have a primary medical certificate from the HSE.  A person must meet one of six medical criteria to be eligible for a primary medical certificate.  Since as far back as 2001 the Office of the Ombudsman has been receiving complaints about the excessively restrictive nature of these six criteria.  The medical criteria are that a person must: be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; or be wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; or be without both hands or without both arms; or be without one or both legs; or be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; or have the medical condition of \"dwarfism\" and serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  There is no doubt in my mind that these criteria are excessively restrictive.  It is clear that, the administration of this scheme, based on these restrictive criteria, has resulted in people who do not meet the criteria, but who are equally as immobile as those who do, being excluded from the scheme.  <\/p><p> The complaints my office receives are against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, DDMBA, an independent body set up on a statutory basis by the Department of Finance in 1990 to review applications from individuals who were unsuccessful in applying for the primary medical certificate at local HSE level.  Since 2016, 335 complaints have been received by my office against the appeal board.  My office investigated each of these complaints.  However, in most cases, we were unable to uphold the complaint against the appeal board as it had acted in accordance with the very restrictive legislation governing its activities.  However, my office clearly communicated our concern at the overly restrictive nature of the criteria by which the appeal board is bound to make a decision.<\/p><p>   In 2020 the Supreme Court quashed a refusal of the appeal board to grant primary medical certificates allowing the parents of two disabled children to avail of tax relief under this scheme and noted in its judgment that the problem was with the &ldquo;under inclusive nature&rdquo; of the regulations.  In essence, this meant that the HSE and appeal board could not continue with their work for a time.  The Government, in response to this judgment, introduced an amendment to the Finance Act 2020 to enshrine the existing very restrictive medical criteria in primary legislation.  This was most disappointing.  I believe a far more appropriate response would have been to revise the criteria for the scheme to take into account an individual&rsquo;s level of mobility.  I understand from officials in the Department of Finance that this was intended to be an interim measure.  However, past experience has shown that such interim measures often remain in place for far too long.  I have already cited one interim measure that has lasted for almost nine years.  I was very concerned about this and the negative impact that this has on the daily lives of people with disabilities and their families.  I note the recent resignation of the members of the appeal board and that their concerns mirror some of the concerns I have expressed here today.<\/p><p> It very worrying that each time a problem is identified with a scheme designed to assist people with disabilities, the response by Government has been to either discontinue the scheme without replacement, or in the case of the scheme we are discussing today, to enshrine the inequitable eligibility criteria in primary legislation.<\/p><p> I was pleased to see from the recent announcement in January 2022 by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, that she intends to chair an interdepartmental group to examine the issues of accessible transport for persons with disabilities and to progress a review of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme as a matter of priority.  However, what we need now is action.  We need to see real progress and a system of access to personal transport supports put in place that is fair and inclusive to all people living with a disability.

I welcome Mr. Deering to the committee for the first time in his official capacity and I welcome Ms Cooney as well.  It is fitting that Mr. Deering is picking up where his predecessor left off and one of his last official duties was that report, which makes for difficult reading.  Peter Tyndall published Grounded in November 2021 and one line that stuck out for me in it was: &ldquo;Living with a disability in Ireland in 2021 should never mean that a person is grounded in their home&rdquo;.  Unfortunately that is where far too many people are.  Unfortunately, as he was preparing to publish that report we found out that the whole Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal had resigned <i>en masse<\/i>, something that has not been seen in this State.  They did so after they repeatedly raised concerns with the Minister.  I have said before at this committee that I am deeply disturbed by what has happened with that scheme, why those concerns were not listened to, why we have no board of appeal and why individuals felt they were forced into this type of action.  Listening to Mr. Deering&rsquo;s opening remarks and looking at Mr. Tyndall&rsquo;s extensive work on this, it is clear this is not the first time that concerns have been falling on deaf ears.  Mr. Deering&rsquo;s predecessor wrote to the Minister for Finance in December 2014 and again in June 2017.  He also wrote to the Secretary General in January 2020 and we are still not getting the changes.  Mr. Deering said there are questions and we will hopefully raise questions with the Minister for Finance on his inaction on this.  Mr. Deering said that the restrictive criteria for this scheme have resulted in people who do not meet the criteria but who are equally immobile to those who do being excluded from the scheme.

I welcome the fact that we have an interdepartmental group but my experience is that if one Department takes responsibility to deliver something there is a much better chance of it being delivered.  When something involves a number of Departments it gets way too complex.  The scheme we are talking about today might have a level of complexity within it but some of the other schemes were simple.  They were administered locally and they were relatively successful, albeit there were problems with them but the problems with those schemes should have been solved.  It would have been far better if the interim solution had been to fix the schemes that were there, at least the problems this office saw in them, while a new scheme was being devised.  It was not reasonable to stop the schemes and stop anybody from applying for them while they were being perfected.  We might never have perfection but we can do an awful lot better.  Some of this has been made unnecessarily complex but it is not that complex.  Certain people have certain needs and those needs should be met.

The story breaks that the appeal board has resigned, blaming the Minister for a lack of action, and that is followed by an announcement in regard to the establishment of an interdepartmental group to look at the issue of transport for people with disabilities, which will be chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.

As we speak, those mentioned in the report, including Tadhg, a young person in his 20s who has Down's syndrome, severe and profound autism and is non-verbal, needs this support yet he is not getting it.  He will not be approved for a primary medical certificate.  His issues were exasperated during the pandemic.  Going for a drive in the car helped him to relax and calm down but on one occasion he put his arms around the driver's neck forcing the car to come to a sudden halt.

Again, I would hope that it would be done quickly.  In regard to the case studies mentioned by the Deputy, our staff hear those stories on a daily basis.

Nine years is a very long time if you have no access to participate in life.

I note that 4,500 has reduced to 3,500, which means 1,000 people are no longer benefiting from the scheme.  There are people coming close to the end of their lives who need this scheme.  This all started because somebody over the age of 66 was not eligible to be in the scheme.  Where is the notion that one has to stop living and participating in society at 66 years of age?  There is a very real need.  When I met with this committee last December I made the point that we often look back and talk about the awful things that were done in the past.

Part of that is that question of the last mile and the issue of storage options for transport for that last mile.  We need a really radical overhaul of our public transport system.  We need initiatives, such as \"stop on request\", that other countries have to address these issues.<\/p><p>I was also struck during the extensive discussion on electric vehicles by one other aspect of which there was no mention.  Many things have changed in these nine years since the motorised transport scheme was suspended and been in somewhat of a limbo.  One of those changes is this focus on electric vehicles.  It does not seem, however, that prioritising or supporting electrified vehicles, and those could be cars or other types of electrified vehicles for people with disabilities, has been a central part of this debate.  I would like to hear some comments on this point.<\/p><p> The other important thing that has happened in the last nine years is that Ireland has now ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  Under the UNCRPD, it is very much the case that each individual has rights in respect of his or her needs.  I ask for a comment on whether this development also points towards the approach of the individual needs assessment which Mr. Deering has been suggesting as a new approach for the disabled drivers and passengers scheme.  Again, one of the aspects of the UNCRPD is that there cannot simply be blanket measures.  Each person is entitled to realise his or her rights.  <\/p><p> When people press for their rights and to improve things, it is sad that the reaction of the State is to shut things down or to go into retreat.  It is bad in respect of the context of public trust in their voice and ability to influence the system.  Therefore, it is concerning, and not only for the individuals affected.  For example, if people point to a legitimate gap in the system, the response is to roll back further.  In that regard, I ask Mr. Deering to comment on the suspension of the motorised transport scheme for nine years.  One aspect I am particularly interested in is inequality and inconsistency regarding age.  This is an issue across many of our systems for people with disabilities.  For example, we have problems in our social protection system whereby people at a certain point, namely, pension age, are just described as being \"older\".  In reality, their disability and related needs could then be made invisible by the system.  Does Mr. Deering believe that might have been one of the reasons, because it pointed to a wider flaw, for there having been a roll-back from addressing this issue?  I ask that because it is a clear issue.  Connected to that as well is the issue of employment.  There used to be an employment requirement, but I do not think it was often used in practice.  Should it be removed from any new scheme?  <\/p><p> Regarding the primary medical certificate backlog, which is an issue, we get letters every week about this matter at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  It is a major issue.  One suggestion made is that GP certification should be enough of an interim measure.  Should we, instead, be uncoupling the disabled drivers and passengers scheme from the primary medical certificate system, given the backlog and the flaws in it?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022021600002#D01200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":508,"content":"<p>Taking the Senator's last point regarding the primary medical certificate first, that whole process is based on a flawed system anyway.

We should not forget that the vast majority of these people, by virtue of finding themselves in this situation, will be interacting with the medical system, and probably at a very sophisticated level.  They will most likely be dealing with consultants and other people well capable of certifying their need in this respect.  Whether that could reach to the GP level is another matter.  An entirely different assessment system, however, is required to decide people's level of mobility.  There are systems and trusted measures of people's mobility that can be deployed more successfully than what we have now.<\/p> <p>  Moving to the point about linking to employment, it is fantastic that people can be in meaningful employment and have transport.  They need it for that context.  Transport, though, should not be linked to employment, because people are entitled to participate fully in society, whether that entails visiting relatives, working, volunteering or going for medical appointments.  The concept of there having to be almost some kind of economic benefit accruing from providing or assisting people with their mobility needs is an outdated one.<\/p> <p>  Turning to Senator Higgins's broader question on the human rights-based approach, the UNCRPD should, of course, look at the needs of the individual.  We operate on a human rights-based approach in our office in respect of examining how people have been dealt with by public bodies.  This is something we want to roll out more to public bodies.  In turn, then, we want to be asking them if they have considered particular issues in light of the UNCRPD and whether they took a human rights-based approach to how they dealt with an individual and made a decision.  I refer to this issue across the board and not just in the context of this scheme.  The question to be asked is if an individual and human rights-based approach is being taken.  I acknowledge that very often people in the public sector want or need rules surrounding everything.  Officials can sometimes experience disadvantage or negative comment when they apply their discretion, and perhaps apply it in a humane way.  Therefore, we must build into these schemes some level of discretion which officials can exercise when they are adhering to human rights-based principles and looking at individual's circumstances.<\/p> <p>  There is a little bit of competition or contention between the concept of looking at the individual and then designing some sort of universal scheme.  I have heard people use the expression that \"we like to have the harp on something\" to make things easier.  It is used to mean that people want something official and they want a document.  If we take this scheme, one of the reasons it does not work is that it involves ticking boxes.  That is no way to assess whether a person is mobile.  Therefore, I very much agree that we need to take a human rights-based approach and an individual-based one.  I acknowledge as well that there are challenges to be faced in doing that, but there are also methods by which people's mobility can be measured.<\/p> <p>  On the subject of electric cars, I agree.  I do not know why this topic has not featured in this discussion.  Sometimes I think the argument from an environmental point of view was made from the perspective that people should be using public transport.  If other methods of transport are available to people that complement the environment, however, then we should be encouraging them.  I am no expert on electric cars or cars and vehicles generally, but if the argument is that there are better vehicles than a standard petrol- or diesel-fuelled car, then that aspect can be taken into account in the context of any scheme and funding made available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022021600002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Deering"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":511,"content":"<p>On the age issue, I agree with Mr. Deering regarding the employment aspect.  My other query concerned people being disqualified at a certain age from the scheme.  As I understand it, that was one of the key findings regarding where the motorised transport scheme was in conflict with the Equal Status Acts.  Again, the concern here is that this might be a wider issue in respect of the intersection of age and disability.  I gave the example regarding the social protection system, where people at a certain age are simply treated as being older and their disability needs are no longer recognised by the system.  I would welcome a comment from Mr. Deering on this point, if he has one.  I refer to what the response should have been when that conflict was identified and should wider consideration be given to other places where this is occurring.

It is great to be here.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, so I do not normally attend the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  My colleague, Deputy Farrell, indicated that this issue was being discussed today.  It is also being discussed at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  Mr. Deering's predecessor, Mr. Peter Tyndall, was in with us - I believe it was one of his last days in office - to discuss this and the work he had done in his report, which was excellent.<\/p> <p>  It is alarming that the mobility allowance and the motorised grant scheme were abolished almost nine years ago.  There was something wrong with the scheme, as was highlighted in a previous report.  It was suggested to me by a Minister that it was being abused.  I do not know if that was the case or not but my feeling is that if there were issues around the scheme, they should have been sorted there and then.  At every meeting I go to with people with disabilities or their representative organisations, the issue of transport supports comes up.  The primary medical certificate criteria are far too stringent.  We know that.  Instead of the Minister for Finance dealing with that issue, he has amended a Finance Bill to slot in with the stringent criteria, which is terrible.  A review was promised a year ago, in 2021, but this still has not happened.<\/p> <p>  On Friday I shall accompany a person to a hearing for a primary medical certificate.  This is his third time to apply.  The person has all of his limbs but he does not have the use of all of the limbs.  Yet, he keeps being refused.  There is no way that he can use public transport because he does not have stability when he walks, and he will not be able to get onto a bus or whatever.  He needs personalised transport supports to help him get from A to B.   He had relied on his parents to do so but his mother has passed away, and his father had a severe illness and cannot do it anymore.  This is what we are seeing more and more.<\/p> <p>  We discussed this matter earlier in the D&aacute;il Chamber during a Private Members' motion put forward by the Regional Group.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, indicated it is under review as part of the national disability strategy but does the Ombudsman have any indication where that is or how long it will take before they put some of the schemes back in place or adjust them so that the primary medical certificate criteria will change?  Does Mr. Deering believe it is purely based on a financial reason rather than on need?  I am very conscious that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was ratified by Ireland four years ago.  We must implement it.  The optional protocol has not been ratified yet.  Is this one of the reasons?  This is not the only issue people with disabilities have to fight for.  They spend their lives fighting for the supports they need and they should not have to do that.  Is this a reason the optional protocol has not been ratified?  Does the Government know that people will take them to the EU over the issues such as the transport supports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022021600002#F00400","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":517,"content":"<p>It is difficult know why.  I suggested earlier that one of the reasons this has not been progressed is that it seems to be the responsibility of a number of Departments, and when that happens sometimes these things fall through.  I do not doubt the Minister's intent to resolve this, but as I said in my statement, and I will hold to it, we really need action.  People will not be able to wait for another action plan.  They must consult with the people with disabilities, but equally, those voices have been expressing themselves for a long time at this stage, as the Deputy said.  It needs a very quick consultation and a quick process but we do not have any indication as to when that will happen.  As to why the convention is not fully operational, we do not know the reason for that.  As we discussed earlier, people have individual rights.  They have these rights under the convention, but they have them in any event.  There just seems to be a lack of willingness for all of the actors to get together.  I appreciate that this is what the Minister is trying to do now, and we can only hope that it delivers.

Again and again it has come up.  Mr. Deering mentioned in his introduction, what I would call inconsistencies, in the determination of whether a person qualified or not.  I could never understand it.  The reference to partly or wholly the loss of one or both arms.  What does that mean?  I could never understand what it meant, and nobody else could understand it either.  It was either one or the other.  The question that would arise was: if the two were gone, would that qualify?  The answer was not necessarily, but if one was gone maybe it would.  I know people who, unfortunately, were disqualified at least 30 years ago and have never qualified.  It becomes a question of rubber stamping after the appeal, and then a further appeal is just refused automatically.  It may be unfair to say that, but that is the way it was, and it is.<\/p> <p>  The late Mr. Martin Naughton did a lot of work for people with disabilities.  He and I had discussions that far back on this particular issue.  It is without doubt shameful that it took this long.  There is no reason in this wide earthly world one person who has a similar disability to another person, who is equally disabled, qualifies for the primary medical certificate and the other does not.  It is absolutely shameful as far as I am concerned.  I do not know whether it is a financial thing, but it sounds like a financial matter.  If it is a financial matter then it needs to be attended to on the basis that it is grossly unfair to the people who are the victims.  People with such difficulties have enough problems without further imposing more difficulty upon them.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider two people who have a disability, whatever that disability is.  They may not be identical.  One person might be quite upfront and anxious to take up a full place in the workplace, and be able to do that.  Another person with a similar disability may not.  They may have psychological problems or problems around confidence in their own ability, all of which must be taken into account.  It is time to put an end to the practice of disqualifying a person arbitrarily on the basis that he or she does not tick a box.

The Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service very much welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the committee&rsquo;s deliberations on this important topic.<\/p> <p>  The disabled drivers and disabled passengers, DDDP, scheme operated by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners provides a range of supports towards the purchase and operation of specially constructed and adapted vehicles by disabled drivers and passengers, including tax relief on vehicle registration tax, VRT, and VAT, an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.  We flag that direct commentary on the logistics and tax implications of the scheme is not in the MABS area of expertise.  However, as an essential front-line service with a holistic approach to assisting clients with their immediate debt problems and supporting them to become financially independent in the long term, we can offer in-depth insight into the ways this scheme and related welfare supports work on the ground.  In addition, after 30 years of promoting financial inclusion for Ireland&rsquo;s most marginalised communities, MABS is in a unique position to comment on the ongoing challenges faced by persons with disabilities who access our services.  It is through this context that we position our statement and engagement with the committee today.<\/p> <p>  In preparation for the meeting, MABS support issued a comprehensive survey to all MABS staff and money advisers around the country, and consulted with our funder, the Citizens Information Board, CIB.  The CIB social policy team sent us collated data arising from transport and disability queries to local citizens information services, CIS, to which we also refer.<\/p> <p>  To start, we will list the five primary issues highlighted by local MABS services and-or CIS regarding the DDDP scheme as it currently operates.  We include examples of our clients&rsquo; lived experiences to illustrate these points.  The first issue relates to the medical criteria for the scheme.  The DDDP scheme is inaccessible for many due to the restrictive medical criteria for accessing the primary medical certificate, PMC, necessary for approval.  If an initial PMC application is rejected, an appeal may be lodged to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal.  To qualify, an applicant must satisfy at least one of six medical criteria that focus predominantly on physical disabilities, particularly a lack of limb function.  This criterion is exclusionary for persons with other disability types, including chronic illnesses, brain or neurological conditions, cardiovascular diseases and so on.  For example, a money adviser from north Dublin spoke of a client with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, who uses a wheelchair and is on oxygen.  She is unable to walk unaided or more than a few steps at once.  Her application for a PMC and subsequent appeal were denied as she was deemed to have use of her legs.<\/p><p> The second issue we wish to raise is the appeals process.  When operational, the primary medical certificate, PMC, appeals process requires persons to travel to Dublin for an in-person assessment.  This can often be extremely challenging, if not impossible, and costly for those clients who live far away.  A client in a local citizens information service, CIS, office lost her appeal after she was unable to travel the five-hour journey from her home to attend an assessment in Dublin.  The client lives alone and had no means of personal transport.<\/p><p> The third issue we want to flag is the scheme being exclusionary due to cost.  Even if their clients satisfy the physical requirements, money advisers highlighted the majority of their clients cannot access the scheme as they cannot afford the purchase of a vehicle, let alone maintenance, even with tax reliefs and rebates.  Many MABS clients with disabilities rely solely on social welfare payments to live, and face increased living costs already, in particular, for transport.  This was highlighted in the most recent report on the increased costs for persons living with disabilities in Ireland published in November last year by the Department of Social Protection.  A money adviser in Cork discussed how her clients who are wheelchair users must take taxis to medical appointments as public transport is unavailable and inaccessible.  While they can get their taxi fare reimbursed by the local community welfare office this could take up to two weeks to process.  In the interim, she has seen clients opt to go without food in order to cover these costs.<\/p><p> The fourth issue we want to raise is the inflexibility of the scheme.  Citizens information services identified how the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme can also be restrictive, for instance, when there is a sudden change of familial circumstances.  Family members of disabled passengers can be eligible for the scheme if they are living with, and responsible for, their transport, and own a vehicle for that reason.  However, problems arose for one CIS client with disabilities when her husband died.  He had been the driver of her specially adapted vehicle with the vehicle registration tax and VAT rebates attached.  The client&rsquo;s son-in-law was available to take over driving responsibilities but in this case the client had to explore transferring ownership of the vehicle to her son-in-law, which was not what she had wanted.<\/p><p> The fifth and final issue we raise is the scheme's applicability to replacing previous grants offered by the Government.  In 2013, the Government closed the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant schemes to new applicants. The DDDP scheme, therefore, took on an increasing importance for people with disabilities.  However, the scheme, in its current guise, is not effective to provide relief to those who truly need it, in particular low-income persons.  MABS money advisers called for the return and-or replacement of the prior grants and the mobility allowance, in particular, arguing it contributed greatly to their clients&rsquo; overall health and well-being, easing financial burdens for transport and providing increased opportunities for participation and social engagement.  Since 2013, citizens information services have also repeatedly highlighted this issue and the Citizens Information Board raised this in successive pre-budget submissions.<\/p><p> It is important to draw connections between these points and underlying issues of financial inclusion faced by persons with disabilities.  Research from the European Disability Forum found that 38.1% of persons with disabilities in Ireland are at risk of poverty and social exclusion, a number that has grown since 2010 and is worryingly higher than the EU average of 28.7%.  MABS services work to help alleviate financial pressures for those who are struggling and we find that, particularly for clients with disabilities, there are a number of barriers to accessing available social welfare supports, including but not limited to the DDDP scheme.  This includes a lack of knowledge of rights and entitlements.  Most clients are not aware of what they are entitled to until they come to MABS and-or citizens Information services and that they have the right to appeal a decision to reject their applications for social welfare.  Also, clients with disabilities face increased difficulties with the required online applications due to digital exclusion, not owning or able to afford the necessary smart devices, lack of home broadband access, which is particularly the case in rural areas, and lower than average levels of digital literacy.<\/p><p> Persons with disabilities also face increased household expenses, for instance, people may have to keep warm when they are not mobile and-or they might be homebound and require continuous electricity, lighting and so on, and, therefore, are even more sensitive to rises in energy prices than the general population.  Lack of accessible public transport, in particular in rural areas, leads to the reliance on taxis and personal transport options that, for many, are simply too expensive.  Unfortunately, we would posit that challenges have exacerbated in recent months due to Covid-19 and the spike in the cost of living.  Individual actions from our clients in terms of budgeting and entitlement maximisation are becoming insufficient in the face of insurmountable structural barriers.<\/p><p> We would list a number of direct actions to support the increased financial inclusion of persons with disabilities and, in turn, importantly, combat exclusion. They include the following.  The extension of employment supports and awareness of supports to enable those with a disability to find meaningful employment if they so choose.  This involves allowing retention of the medical card solely for medical need if working and regardless of income level.  There is a need to provide a savings incentive scheme for all on social welfare, including those with disabilities; to support the training of front-line staff to assist those with disabilities with specialised needs, including post offices, banks, credit unions and public services; to enhance educational and financial literacy incentives, for example, fully funded third level courses with extra supports that have occupational outcomes; the provision and long-term accessibility of non-fee and basic bank accounts with preferential overdraft and loan rates; and available interest-free loans for capital spends such as housing adaptation, equipment purchases, vehicle adaptation, disability aids and so on.<\/p><p> We strongly support the efforts of this committee to examine the DDDP scheme and further promote the full participation and financial inclusion of persons with disabilities.  We look forward to discussing these matters further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022021600002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Amie Lajoie","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Lajoie for that presentation.

People with disabilities should be able to do that without having to fight all the time for their rights.  Would a large number of MABS clients be disabled?  Of those, how many would cite transport costs as being a major problem?  From talking to people, I know people who live in rural areas, in particular, have no access to public transport and even if they have, sometimes it is not accessible for them depending on the nature of the disability.<\/p> <p>  People have told me that when they telephone to book a wheelchair accessible taxi they cannot get one in many areas.  Many of them are contracted to the HSE and while there are some available, and they are usually dearer to book than the regular taxi most of us can use, people find it difficult to access them.  Is that an issue raised regularly with MABS?  We have one of the highest rates of poverty among our disabled population in Europe and also one of the highest rates of unemployment.  Obviously, the two are directly connected.  While accessible transport may not only be needed for people with disabilities to be able to get to and from work, the lack of it may be an impediment to them taking up work.  Has MABS any hopes these schemes will be reviewed, that the criteria will be addressed and the other schemes suspended in 2013 will be brought back into line?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022021600002#H00500","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":527,"content":"<p>Which of the witnesses wishes to go first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022021600002#H00600","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":528,"content":"<p>Ladies first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022021600002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":529,"content":"<p>The Deputy has hit the nail on the head.  In the responses to the survey we issued to the local services I was struck by the number of people working in rural areas such as Sligo, Donegal and Mayo who highlighted over and over again the importance of these types of supports to allow their clients with disabilities to access meaningful transport.  One of the issues for clients is they must have some money up front in order to access the service.  They must be able to afford a car in the first instance to get access to this specific scheme, which is a marked difference from the prior mobility allowance, which was a monthly payment.<\/p> <p>  There are still a number of people participating in that scheme.  The Government closed that scheme to new applications in 2013 but we now have a two-tier system.  A number of MABS clients would still be participating in the former scheme and a number who would have been eligible under former circumstances have been denied access to that scheme for a number of years.  I know citizens information services have faced the same issues we have faced.<\/p><p>It is very important, when tackling it from that perspective, to consider whether the onus is on the individual to have access to disposable income in order to purchase a vehicle in the first instance or if we can do more to help that person from the other side of things.  Would a one-off set payment, such as a mobility allowance, allow for that?<\/p><p> In respect of the data on our clients, we do not specifically track data on the number of persons with disabilities we have, which is why it was very important for us, in preparation for this meeting, to speak to money advisers and those on the coalface regarding this engagement with the committee in order to understand their experiences.  One of the things that came back was that the clients with disabilities we work with are overwhelmingly reliant on the disability allowance and related supports as their number one source of income.  If they are in employment, it is only for a few hours a week to supplement that income.  As we know, the disability allowance is a very important measure.  However, if someone is relying just on that to live, his or her income is very tight when it comes to access to additional disposable income for many things, such as participating in public life, social engagements and all of that.  That is something we see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022021600002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Amie Lajoie","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":531,"content":"<p>In my previous role at MABS, I worked directly with clients as an adviser on the ground.

We are bringing the service to the client as opposed to bringing the client to the service, but people with disabilities, in particular, still have additional costs, especially as regards transport and communications, which Dr. Lajoie outlined.

Something that again struck us as we were preparing for this meeting was the number of money advisers we spoke with who told us that people are not aware they can appeal decisions when they are initially rejected.  We found some statistics from the Department of Social Protection on the number of initial applicants for disability allowance.  The Department rejects more than half of first applicants; those are the statistics from 2021.  Some 13,989 applications for disability allowance were turned down, while 13,298 of processed claims were granted last year.  Many people are not aware they have the right to challenge or appeal those decisions.  They will take that notice, or put that letter in the bin, forget about it and go back on jobseeker's, for example.  Those numbers are also conflated so we might not get an accurate picture of the social welfare supports and who needs what.<\/p> <p>  In cases where decisions are appealed, for more than half there is a change in that decision.  When people have access to an appeals system, they can get the supports.

They might not get on the provisional allowance from the get-go, but they can appeal that decision and take it further.

I commend MABS on the crucial work it does in assisting individuals in particularly difficult times during the pandemic and as we deal with the cost-of-living crisis.  Today, we are focusing on those with disabilities and the additional financial burdens that can be placed on individuals as a result of the discontinuation of a number of schemes.  Most of us argue that the disabled drivers and passengers scheme is not fit for purpose and excludes many individuals.  We know that six criteria apply to that scheme, where someone has to tick a box.  It is really asking disabled people to fit into this little square box and if they do not they are grounded.  In some cases, it means people cannot leave their homes to go to the shops or the cinema, or cannot visit a neighbour, because that is not possible for those living in a rural community.<\/p> <p>  Even if the criteria were changed to look at the issues, and to be more flexible in respect of mobility issues, what is the MABS view on how that would address the problem?  I raise this because MABS representatives have previously raised the point that even if more people are eligible for the scheme, they still would have to be able to purchase a car.  I am sure many of the individuals MABS deals with are not in that position.  I would like to hear the representatives' views on that because while it would be absolutely fantastic if the criteria were changed and we had the medical appeals board up and running, there is a danger we are likely to still have a large number of people with disabilities excluded from mobility because those concerned cannot afford the &euro;10,000, &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 to purchase a vehicle.  <\/p> <p>  I was thinking as I came to today's meeting of the perverseness of this year in that people who have money are being given &euro;5,000 of taxpayers' money.  People who have disabilities and cannot leave their houses are paying taxes while that &euro;5,000 is going to people who have money and can afford a &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 electric vehicle.  Yet, &euro;5,000 is not being made available to those people with a disability who are not looking for flashy new cars, but just want to be able to get out of the house to go to church or visit a neighbour or whatever.

As the Deputy said, fairly clearly, it is about making those kind of incentives available to people with disabilities to avail of grants to purchase these kind of vehicles.  Dr. Lajoie also has some figures on the number of people with disabilities who are not in the workforce, which are pretty stark.  Lack of transport is one reason they are not in the workforce, and lack of affordability is the reason for the lack of transport.  It is certainly a challenge for policymakers and legislators to invert that and try to incentivise people with disabilities to get into the workforce, if they can.  We are well behind the rest of Europe in trying to help people with disabilities to improve their circumstances, financially and socially.

This is about Jack who is sitting at home and Mary who has mobility issues.  Yes, she has two legs but she is in a wheelchair and, therefore, cannot avail of this support.

It is about not understanding that this is a diverse group of people with many different needs.  The issue is quite nuanced.  The requirements for inclusion in the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme and the focus on the primary medical certificate only focus on really restricted physical disabilities so it is a really outdated model.  With the introduction of the human rights legislation and the work of advocacy and support groups for people with disabilities in Ireland, we must combat that.

To go off on a slight tangent, you could make the claim that anybody who comes to MABS is disabled in some form because he or she is financially stressed.  They were previously people of huge capacity in some cases and a lot of capacity in others.  They have been disabled so to speak by their circumstances.  We saw it after the crash and we see it in mortgage arrears and unsecured debt.

We know many appeals are successful when they take them.  I sit on the disability matters committee as well and there is a frustrated sense sometimes that refusals were happening at an early point almost to wear down people with bureaucracy, with people feeling daunted by a delay in access.  They say that justice delayed is justice denied and there seems to be an element of that in people with a disability accessing entitlements.<\/p> <p>  In that regard I also pick up on the comment made about the importance of the local centres.

There have been two developments in the past couple of years.  One is the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and the effect on rights of people with a disability, and the fact that people have individual rights to participation in society, for example.

Unfortunately, even if we look at the ratification process of the UNCRPD, Ireland was the last EU member state to do that ratification, which says a lot.  It took until 2018 for it to be done when it was originally proposed in 2006.  I hope it has at least given those who work on the ground with people in communities a different and specific language of engagement in how to categorise what is going on in terms of a rights-based approach, which is very useful.<\/p><p>Even when we were having the preliminary discussions for our statement to the committee we heard some of that.  There was acknowledgement and recognition that there is now this international framework.  There is now a national framework because there was a strategy - I think it was last year - that has a specific provision in it focused on mobility and transport.  It is hopefully going to be able to allow those of us working in this space to better articulate what is going on and to better push for the kind of normative, legislative and policy change needed to allocate further resources in this area and better support this community.<\/p><p> I might comment on the Indecon report because it was something we highlighted and looked at.  While our statement centred the personal experiences and testimonies of the advisers and the CIS that engaged with us, it very much echoed what was found in this report, especially about the cost of transport and where persons with disabilities are not getting State support.  That was something interesting that was in the Indecon report.  For example, most are getting State support for something like public transport costs, if you are somebody who lives in an area where you have access to public transport.  Of those who took the Indecon survey, 51% said that is where State help was given to them but of course that is in and of itself exclusionary of everyone else not in an area where they can access public transport.  However, the extra costs incurred by the participants in that survey were only 15%.  That is a very small amount versus the 39% extra cost for private transport whereas the only State help given for private transport costs was 16%.  There are, therefore, significant gaps.  That further augments what we found in our preparations for this and what the money advisers are seeing with respect to the additional costs and burdens placed on persons with disabilities.  Mr. O'Brien mentioned in particular the cost of taxis and how if you are on disability allowance you can get that.  A lot of the time it is medical appointments.  That is what came up over and over again.  It is multiple medical appointments and some of them are very time-sensitive.  If you have chronic pain and live somewhere where you cannot access public transport, a taxi is your mode of transport.  You can collect a receipt and get that reimbursed in time but in that time period people might make choices to cover that cost.  For example, one adviser said people might opt to go without food or cut back on their food budget in order to cover that taxi cost to their medical appointment.  It is quite stark that people are making those decisions.  Mr. O'Brien might want to tackle the financial independence piece.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022021600002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Amie Lajoie","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":553,"content":"<p>We hear much about the exceptional needs payment, ENP, that is available via the community welfare officers.

We hear about it in times of somewhat crisis.  It would obviously be well-known to MABS because, as I said earlier, part of our remit is to maximise our clients' income, so if they are not getting the social welfare entitlements they are entitled to, we would be steering them in that direction.  In many areas of the country, there has traditionally been a strong relationship between MABS and the community welfare officers.  I have a sense that maybe the whole area of ENPs could do with a bit of highlighting to people with disabilities and other clients of MABS.  We have had very successful collaborations with the community welfare service in the past, I am sure we do at present and, hopefully, we will have into the future.

I was just so struck by that woman who clearly needs support with transport as she could not even fund transport to her appeal.  The emergency needs payment is one mechanism.  Dr.  Lajoie also mentioned the idea of interest-free loans.  Will she expand a little on that as an idea?  There is that concern Deputy Doherty raised that it is almost a wealth transfer.  Those who are most in need do not have the capital to access schemes and adaptation supports.  Within that, I am thinking of vehicle adaptation but also housing adaptation.<\/p> <p>  There are two other issues that have come up a lot and I wonder if MABS is finding them as a pattern in its work.  One is the idea around appropriate, adapted electric vehicles and recognising disability needs within those schemes, or even retrofitting and building adaptation needs into retrofitting schemes.  Are enough of these new green schemes that are coming on stream being designed in a way that is going to support people with a disability to avail of, and fully engage with, them rather than us having to go back and almost retrofit those schemes, so they work for people with a disability in the future?

It was before my time but something I looked at before joining.  It included looking at the likes of community banking schemes or saving initiatives rooted in the community to give people an opportunity to access, or to become familiar with different skills within the remit of financial literacy that are suitable to them, versus trying to get people into the services that currently exist.  There initiatives out there.  For example, members may have heard of the It Makes Sense loan scheme with credit unions or the personal micro credit scheme.  That is an affordable credit option that was rolled out I think around seven years and that is still being incorporated in different areas of the country.  That is a low-level interest rate of about 12.5% for people who are on social welfare, so they can access that.  However, there are a number of problems.  On the way credit works in general, as Deputy Doherty and Senator Higgins said, our whole financial system is set up in a way that banks do not offer the type of credit or loans people on low incomes need.  They would be short-term, low-level loans for amounts that are usually for not very high amounts that people can access immediately and that are inexpensive.  It tends to be that the less you borrow, the more you must pay back in interest, compound interest and all that.  That is where that recommendation comes from, that is, when we see a spend like this.  These services are not elective for many people.  It is very much a necessity that the person adapts his or her home to better meet his or her needs as a person with disabilities who has specific needs.<\/p><p>It would be quite helpful if those types of loans were available.

If people are under a certain threshold, they are not really benefiting from them.<\/p> <p>  My last question concerns an issue I raised with the Ombudsman, namely, the intersection on age and disability.  A concern raised in the past, when I was a member of the then Joint Oireachtas Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, was that once people are in that older age group when they reach pension age their disability needs and some of their access to disability supports and schemes seem to be curtailed.  As we heard, that was one of the reasons the mobility allowance scheme was found to be out of sync with the Equal Status Act.  Is that a frustration or an issue that has been raised with the witnesses through their offices?  Is it the case that people who are over the age 65 or 66 and who are trying to access disability supports are finding themselves instead rooted into general age-related supports that do not address disabilities?

When people with disabilities come to MABS, we will look at their complete budget, including income versus expenditure, etc.  Their capacity to afford a loan will be laid out in front of them.  They may have the capacity to afford a loan.  Of course, I would advocate interest-free loans for those people.  Why should people pay a poverty premium?  I hate using that phrase.  Even the 12.5% interest rate on the It Makes Sense loans could certainly be looked at in terms of a subsidy.  Lenders look at risk; that is their job.  Certainly, just to make the point again, some form of loan guarantee scheme or a central fund for people with disabilities who need transport could be looked at.  If they come to MABS, they know that they will get a good heads-up on what their affordability is.

I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee and the members for attending in person and online.  The witnesses mentioned exceptional needs payments and the importance of them.  They could be utilised to a greater extent than they have been in the past.  There is a tendency for us all to presume that because we spent a lot of money on Covid, we can continue to do that.  That is not going to happen, unless we want to go back to where we were in 2007: bankrupt.  That would not be to the advantage of anybody.  Therefore, we must proceed cautiously, carefully and prudently.  We have to address the issues of people with disabilities and recognise people with disabilities.  Again, the late Martin Naughton comes to mind.  On the question of isolation, we all learned a bit about isolation in the course of the pandemic.  It came home to us all.  It applies to people with disabilities on an ongoing and daily basis, 365 days a year.  It affects them in different ways.  It is a terrible position to be in to be dependent on all around you for the simple things that other people take for granted.<\/p> <p>  I note, for instance, what we call the housing adaptation grant.

The point is that since the decision was made, prices have gone up immeasurably, so it automatically follows that there needs to be a re-evaluation of the award.

I thank the committee for the invitation to meet it to discuss progress on the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  As the Chair mentioned, I am joined today by my colleagues Mr. Muiris O&rsquo;Connor, Ms Caroline Pigott, Mr. Jack Nagle and Mr. Bob Patterson.<\/p> <p>  The Oireachtas all-party Sl&aacute;intecare report sets out the Sl&aacute;intecare vision for a universal health and social care system, where everyone has equal access to services based on need, and not ability to pay.  I am happy to report today that alongside my colleague and the CEO of the HSE, Mr. Paul Reid; the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly; and the Government, we are making significant progress in delivering on this reform agenda.<\/p> <p>  Of course, the background to this discussion is the Covid pandemic.  This took up much of our management time over the past two years which, unfortunately, slowed down several reforms, but it also demonstrated the benefits of a universal approach and the capacity of the system to change and respond.  The Covid response, by necessity, accelerated many positive aspects of the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.  This included fast-tracking service innovation, new pathways of care, new ways of working and changes implemented rapidly in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare vision and principle.  In effect, these changes accelerated the move from a hospital-centric system to one where more services are provided in the community and near a person&rsquo;s home.  With the unprecedented funding support from the Government over the past number of years and again this year, it is now our challenge to galvanise a system to build on these reforms.<\/p> <p>  The context for healthcare reform is the need, which I believe is generally accepted, to change a system that is not structured around the new and emerging needs of our population.  Our population is aging rapidly.  By 2028 there will be more people aged over 65 than under 14.  We are living longer, thankfully, but many of us will be living with one or more chronic illness.  The health service capacity review, which was prepared in 2018, projected that the demand for healthcare to 2031 will grow significantly.  For example, it projected increases in demand of 46% for primary care, of 39% for long-term residential care and of 20% for home care.  These increases are clearly not sustainable and we need to continue to develop a more efficient integrated healthcare system that can meet these growing patient needs.<\/p> <p>  There are many aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare and I would like to focus on a number of aspects today: enhancing public capacity; improving care at primary and community level; encouraging innovation; and the multi-annual waiting list plan.<\/p> <p>  First, a critical aspect of Sl&aacute;intecare is to enhance the capacity of the public health system.  Significant investment has been made by the Government and this is delivering additional staff, more hospital infrastructure and capacity and unprecedented levels of activity.  For 2021, the Government has allocated almost &euro;21 billion to core health spending.  This is an extra &euro;6 billion over the original allocation in the budget for 2018, four years ago, and an increase of over 40%.  Priority investments include funding to reduce waiting lists, additional staff and more bed capacity.  The CEO of the HSE will touch on this in more detail, so I will just be very brief and give some of the highlights.  For example, additional critical care, acute and sub-acute beds were fully funded and opened in 2020 and 2021.  Staffing in 2020 experienced the largest increase since the foundation of the HSE and 2021 has seen that trend continue with more than 6,000 whole-time equivalent staff members recruited across all service numbers.  There are now over 12,500 more staff working in our health service than there were at the beginning of 2020.  That is the most rapid increase in staffing numbers over any two-year period since the HSE was established.  As colleagues know, a further significant increase in staffing numbers is planned this year.  Specifically, there have been improvements in staffing in our acute services, which increased by almost 4,000 in 2020 and by another significant number, 3,690, in 2021.<\/p> <p>  Second, significant investment has been made to enhance community care capacity and to affect the shift from a hospital-centric model of care to delivering more care in the community.  For example, an additional 837 community beds were delivered in 2020-21.  To date, 51 healthcare networks, 15 specialist teams for older persons and two chronic disease management teams have been established, as well as national coverage of community intervention teams, which are all targeted at reducing dependence on the current hospital-based model of care.  Each community specialist for older people will see between 6,000 and 7,000 people per year, which equates, in total, to over 210,000 patient contacts a year overall.  When the chronic disease management teams are fully established, they will have approximately 30,000 patient contacts a year, which represents more than 900,000 contacts a year on a full basis of implementation.  Almost 21 million hours of home care support were delivered in 2021, with over 55,000 people in receipt of the service by the end of last year.  This is about 2.9 million or 17% more hours compared to 2020, with increased funding maintained for this year.  Over 85% of GPs are registered with the GP chronic disease management programme and nearly 220,000 consultations were delivered in 2021.  GP direct access to diagnostics, which is another key element of Sl&aacute;intecare that has been debated and discussed for many years, has resulted in over 138,000 radiology tests being accessed by GPs in the community.  I understand that a further 17,000 tests were undertaken last month alone.  On the basis of that rate, we will be close to, if not above, 200,000 for the year as a whole.  Thanks to the efforts of the HSE, these resources not only enhance community care but avoid unnecessary trips to hospital, thereby freeing up bed capacity for more complex and urgent cases.<\/p> <p>  Third, we are fostering a culture of innovation through the Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund.  This involves investing in new care pathways, new technologies and new ways of working and eventually shifting care to the left and directly engaging with front-line staff.  Specifically, the fund facilitates the testing and evaluation of innovative models of care, with 105 out of 123 projects being mainstreamed through the HSE.<\/p><p>These projects resulted in over 15,000 reduced referrals, more than 18,000 acute beds avoided and over 8,000 patients off waiting lists.  More details are included in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation report, which the Minister published yesterday evening.  It sets out some of the numbers in more detail, as well as some of the significant benefits of these changes. <\/p><p> The National Ambulance Service, NAS, has successfully continued the development and implementation of alternative care pathways, with the aim of hospital avoidance and of an improved use of healthcare resources.  The total number of patients treated by the NAS alternative service was over 18,000, with 44.3% being treated at home or in the community.<\/p><p> Various e-solutions and e-changes have been brought about which are improving the overall efficiency of the system, freeing up staff time and reducing the administrative burden.  We have just mentioned two of them.  Some 14 million prescriptions were transferred electronically in 2021.  There was an enormous amount of activity in the community.  It enabled a much more efficient administrative management of that issue.  Some 333,000 video consultations were delivered based on our estimates.  Clearly, now that we see that video consultations can work, they will have a role to play in the future.  <\/p><p> A critical objective of Sl&aacute;intecare is to reduce waiting lists.  The short-term waiting list plan, which was published by the Government in October 2021, resulted in a 5.4% reduction in overall waiting lists, which was in line with the target reduction.  The 2022 waiting list action plan is being finalised by colleagues in the Department and the HSE and it will be brought to the Government next week.  This plan will set out actions to deliver further reductions in waiting lists, address backlogs, stem future growth and lay the foundations for future reform actions.  It will set out how and where additional funding will be allocated.  As members will know, &euro;350 million has been committed to support this plan.  Some &euro;200 million is to support waiting list initiatives and &euro;150 million has been allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  This is an increase of &euro;50 million on last year&rsquo;s allocation.  Each year, the number of new additions to waiting lists increases significantly.  The challenge is to increase activity, both to reduce the stock of people waiting too long and address the new additions.  In 2022, it is estimated that over 1.5 million people will be added to the waiting lists.  This reflects normal additions and an acceleration in presentations due to deferrals caused by Covid-19.  Under the proposed plan, which it is hoped the Minister and the Government will publish next week, the HSE and the NTPF propose to deliver services to remove many more patients from active waiting lists.  We estimate that this will be the largest level of activity ever delivered and that it will result in a significant reduction in these waiting lists.  It is hoped that by the end of this year, the number of patients on active waiting lists will be at its lowest point since the beginning of Covid-19.<\/p><p> Reducing waiting lists will also require further capacity enhancements.  Ultimately, plans are progressing for new elective hospitals in Cork, Dublin and Galway which will cater for up to 940,000 planned procedures and operations every year.  This is a critical short- to medium-term change in the configuration of the system and it will increase capacity to enable us to increase the number of elective procedures.  Of course, reducing lists will also require ongoing change and reform in productivity, as well as improvements in pathways and other issues that Mr. Reid and his team will no doubt touch on later.  Increasing productivity is a key part of the response to this challenge.  In addition, it will require progress on ensuring all patients are treated in public hospitals on the basis of need and not on the basis of their insurance status.  This will free up capacity in public hospitals but it will also ensure a more equitable system.  Removing private income from public hospitals is a key Government objective and a key objective of Sl&aacute;intecare.  It will require legislation and further discussions with the representative bodies.  Members will be aware that talks have been ongoing with representative bodies on the implementation of a Sl&aacute;intecare contract, which will pave the way for the removal of private care from public hospitals.  We look forward to further engagement on those talks.<\/p><p> I will turn now to Sl&aacute;intecare governance and oversight.  A new Sl&aacute;intecare programme board, which is co-chaired by Mr. Reid and me, has been established to drive the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.  The Sl&aacute;intecare board, which will report directly to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, will ensure enhanced co-ordination on delivering key reform priorities.  The board has met twice since December.  It will meet every second month going forward.  Responsibility for the overall project management office has been assigned to the leadership of an assistant secretary, Mr. Derek Tierney.<\/p><p> As this committee is aware, our hospital groups and community healthcare organisations are not aligned geographically, nor do they overlap on management, clinical oversight or budgets.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report identified that regional health areas, RHAs, are essential for the proper and improved integration of health services and for population-based planning in Ireland.  The allocation of resources will also enable better oversight and evaluation of costs and health outcome benefits.  RHAs will ensure the alignment and integration of hospital and community services at a regional level, based on defined populations and local needs.  The Government approved the geographies of the regions in the months preceding the pandemic.  The Government decision directed the Department to explore the organisational design, governance frameworks and funding methods via a business case.  A memo for the Government decision is being drafted, and the Minister for Health will bring it to the Government in the next few weeks.  A detailed implementation plan is being developed by the Department and the HSE, with input from the newly established RHA advisory group.  This will cover how RHAs will impact on workforce and HR planning, funding allocations, capital infrastructure and governance lines.  Our high-level timeframe is for design detail for this year, with implementation beginning in 2023.<\/p><p> With the unprecedented funding and support of the Government, we now have a real opportunity to build on recent progress, to continue to implement Sl&aacute;intecare at pace and to continue to translate the Sl&aacute;intecare report from shared vision to reality.  I would like to take this opportunity to again thank all of our colleagues in the Department of Health and in the HSE for their continuing work and dedication in delivering on this agenda for the Minister, for the Government and for the citizens of Ireland.  I look forward to working with the committee and to answering any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I now call on Mr. Reid to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#B00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I am pleased to present at the committee today, along with Mr. Watt and his colleagues and our colleagues from the Department of Health.  I thank the committee for its invitation to meet with it to discuss the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I am joined by my colleagues Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, chief operations officer; Ms Yvonne O&rsquo;Neill, national director of community operations; Mr. Liam Woods, national director of acute operations; and Ms Yvonne Goff, national director of change and innovation.  Sl&aacute;intecare provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to bring about sustained improvements in the quality and capacity of our health system.  The reform agenda we are now pursuing has the full support of the HSE board, which will have oversight of our progress in accordance with its statutory governance role.  Our primary focus will be to improve access across community and acute services, to increase bed capacity, to address health inequalities and to enhance patient experience.  As members will be aware, the HSE corporate plan 2021-24 details a transformation agenda for health and social care.  It was developed to align with the Sl&aacute;intecare objectives.<\/p> <p>  In quite an organic way, our response to the pandemic has accelerated many service changes that would ordinarily have required lengthy planning processes.  I mention, for example, as Mr. Watt has done, e-health, community healthcare and service integration.  These innovations are both enduring and system-wide.  They were driven largely from the front line, which ensured successful implementation.  Models of care were developed in line with one of the principal objectives of the Sl&aacute;intecare strategy, which is to provide care in a location that meets patients&rsquo; and clients&rsquo; needs.  The pandemic has therefore provided invaluable insights into how we can embed these ways of working.  I am keen to ensure we use all that we have learned to the fullest extent.  A key example of such progress last year was direct GP access to radiology services, with five external providers seeing just under 140,000 referrals by the end of the year, thereby materially reducing the demand on hospitals.<\/p> <p>  Between 2019 and 2022, &euro;210 million has been made available through the 2019 GP agreement in support of modernisation initiatives, the e-health agenda and the roll-out of the chronic disease management programme to over 430,000 people.  The enhanced community care programme was allocated &euro;240 million for the establishment of 96 community health networks and 30 community specialist teams for older people and for those with chronic diseases to provide integrated services locally.  Some 1,400 staff have been recruited, with over 2,000 additional posts to be recruited in 2022.  To date, 51 community health networks, 15 community specialist teams for older persons and two chronic disease specialist teams have been established.  Separately, the targeted 91 disability network teams are in place.  These developments are being delivered collaboratively with voluntary providers to deliver enhanced care across general and specialist services.<\/p> <p>  Expanded community intervention teams were further developed in 2021, with five additional teams and three enhanced teams, which means that we now have 21 community intervention teams in operation.  Immediate measures were also taken to introduce hospital and critical care pressures by permanently increasing surge capacity by 324 additional inpatient beds, along with 42 additional critical care beds.  Additional capacity was also contracted from the private hospitals to support demand.<\/p><p>We continue to work with the private sector to rapidly reduce waiting list numbers.  A further 314 public community beds and 498 private intermediate care beds were introduced as part of our Covid-19 response.  During the pandemic, ambulance services moved away from an emergency medical service to a Sl&aacute;intecare-aligned model reorientating healthcare from the traditional hospital-centric model by bringing care to patients rather than patients to care.  Such developments were planned pre-Covid to manage the impacts of an ageing population, chronic disease and the growth in our population more generally.  As a consequence of the pandemic, this was accelerated.   <\/p><p> Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund projects have been established in more than 100 locations nationally with project partners from acute, community and academic settings.  Many of these projects have already been mainstreamed - primarily through the enhanced community care fund and the HSE welcomes the &euro;4 million provided to support 29 more projects this year.<\/p><p> Although the HSE delivers approximately 3.3 million outpatient appointments, over 1 million day cases and 82,000 elective discharges each year, demand continues to exceed capacity in many specialties and I fully accept that patients are waiting too long to be seen.  During the pandemic, outpatients waiting lists grew by 98,000, or 18%, inpatient-day cases waiting lists grew by 9,000 and endoscopy waiting lists grew by 10,000.  Working with the HSE and the NTPF, the Department of Health published a waiting list action plan in October 2021 focused of providing additional procedures through public and private hospitals by the end of 2021 to reduce waiting lists.  By the end of December, the outpatient waiting list decreased by 35,000, or 5%, with a 21% reduction in those waiting 18 months or over.  There was only a slight decrease in the inpatient-day case waiting list due to the significant effect of the cancellation of elective surgeries due to Covid-19 and emergency department pressures and a decrease of 5,400 in the endoscopy waiting list.  A plan to improve waiting lists and achieve Sl&aacute;intecare access targets is being developed with Department of Health, clinical and managerial colleagues.  Essential to the reform of scheduled care is the concurrent redesign of care in the community.  We are also aiming to redesign acute care pathways by engaging wherever possible new technologies and innovative service delivery models.  Significant progress has been made to modernise and implement over 70 clinical pathways within 16 clinical specialties.  A waiting list plan for 2022 is currently in development and the HSE welcomes the additional funding of &euro;200 million, which will be focused on delivering additional capacity to support this work.<\/p><p> The implementation of RHAs using a population health management approach will significantly impact our health system.  Working with the Department, we expect to scope out design and development of RHAs and to finalise an implementation plan that is consistent with the Government's decision to establish RHAs.  It is anticipated that by the end of the year, corporate and clinical governance frameworks will be completed.  Aligned to Sl&aacute;intecare, RHAs will support population-based service planning and funding. <\/p><p> The scale and challenge of Sl&aacute;intecare's implementation should not be underestimated and methods of implementation and detailed planning will be important to ensuring our success.  Collaboration was paramount in 2021 and it strengthened relationships greatly with healthcare providers right across the public, voluntary and private acute and community settings.  This coalition allowed us to meet the relentless demands of the pandemic.  Given what our health service has faced in the last 23 months, the almost instinctive alignment of the system to Sl&aacute;intecare principles demonstrates the commitment of our staff and their belief in this hugely important national strategy.  I have no doubt that this spirit of collaboration is the key to unlocking the full potential and the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I assure the committee that the HSE will devote the whole of its efforts to ensuring that we deliver on Sl&aacute;intecare.  Achieving this would be a fitting reward for the public and also for our healthcare staff, who have given so much over the past two years.  I also acknowledge the significant commitment and sacrifices made by our teams over the past two years.  Not many organisations could sustain five waves of Covid and a cyberattack.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Watt and Mr. Reid for their opening statements and acknowledge the exceptional work of all healthcare staff and others in a supportive role during the pandemic.

I am anxious for us to move away from the area of a percentage improvement on last year's performance and the performance the previous year in areas like waiting lists, acute services and waiting in general.  We have to move away from that because people with a health problem are not happy when they are waiting because they do not know how long they have to wait and in some cases, experience has shown them that it is not a good place to be.  <\/p> <p>  Community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7 is the area encompassing south-west Dublin and Kildare, an area that is densely populated, has significant challenges and is low in the support staff required at all levels.  For example, the level to which social workers are deployed in that area is non-existent.  There is a crisis there that needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.

This is what Mr. Reid and I, along with our teams, are focused on and thankfully, able to focus on mostly full time as Covid is less of a challenge for the health system and society.  It is not totally defeated.  I know we are not going to talk about it but there are still a lot of people - almost 600 - in hospital with Covid and it is still out there in the community.  Thankfully, we are not suffering the more acute phases we have gone through over the past two years.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy's comment about waiting lists.  My colleagues and I compare changes year on year and if we have an improvement in waiting lists this year, which I hope we do, it is no consolation to somebody who is still waiting too long or is uncertain about when he or she will receive treatment.  We hope the Government will decide on the waiting list plan next week.  That will set out a variety of actions to buy more private sector capacity, drive more public sector output, change the way we work and so on to increase the overall level of activity.  We hope to have the highest level of waiting list-related activity delivered by the HSE, the NTPF and the public and private system this year.  Even with that, there will still be a large number of people waiting at the end of the year, some of whom will have been waiting for too long.  That represents a challenge.  After this year, the challenge for us will be to do even better in 2023 and make further improvements that will involve more resourcing and capacity and different ways of working.<\/p><p>Those different ways of working, which Mr. Reid set out in his presentation, are absolutely critical.

I will come in behind Mr. Watt on a number of points.  I will relay the Deputy&rsquo;s thanks back to the teams and I thank him for making those comments.  They make a difference.<\/p> <p>  To deal specifically with the general point which the Deputy has made about embracing these issues with the pace and agility that has been demonstrated over the past two years, I share the Deputy&rsquo;s appetite that we embed that into the future.  There are probably three things that I would take from the past two years that we need to consolidate in our ways of working.<\/p> <p>  The first lesson is a much better understanding of what value is added from the centre of the HSE and what value is added from the services.  That is a core principle of Sl&aacute;intecare.  For example, we focused on some of the national issues like the procurement of personal protective equipment, PPE, testing and tracing, and vaccination.  We let the services then get on with driving reform because they know best and can do it best on the ground.  That is something we have to unleash and embed in a stronger way in the next couple of years.  That is one learning.<\/p> <p>  The second lesson from the past two years relates to decision-making.  For far too long, we have taken too long to make decisions on business cases and on PowerPoint.  I certainly know, with Mr. Watt, that we are committed to this.  We used the principle during the past two years that we will probably get 70% of our decisions right, and I do not just mean from a clinical perspective, but in driving change.  We have to learn from the other 30%.  What we cannot do is wait for perfection at all times.  In the next phase of change we are certainly bringing in the principle that if we are 70% comfortable with something, it is probably good enough to let the system go at it.  That is the second principle we want to embed.<\/p> <p>  The third lesson, which is completely aligned with Sl&aacute;intecare, pertains to the whole issue of moving services to protect the acute hospital system by increasing the services in our communities.  We gave some good examples in our opening statements involving community health networks, community specialist teams, access to diagnostics with GPs, primary care facilities and staffing.  <\/p> <p>  One of my colleagues made a specific comment on CHO 7.  He touched on something that is a challenging issue for recruitment.  I will give a very brief outline of the scale of this.  Over the past two years we have recruited over 35,000 people.  We have to recruit 9,500 people every year to stand still as part of the natural churn.  We have 132,000 people now in the HSE, which is a net increase of 12,500.  As Mr. Watt has said, it is the biggest and most unprecedented increase.  On top of that, we have had to add a further 4,000 people who were working on testing and tracing, and vaccination programmes.  If one looks at the mix of that, and I will not go through it all here, one will see that for once we have got a very good mix.  Across that 12,500 over the past couple of years, some 3,300 have come from the nursing and midwives professions, 2,100 are actual staff nurses and midwives, almost 2,000 are healthcare assistants, 360 are consultants and 2,300 people are working on patient and client care.  These are people who are on the front line, perhaps as healthcare assistants or NAS staff.  We have difficulties in some areas, which I fully acknowledge to the Deputy, particularly in some of the areas he mentioned like south Kerry and Donegal.  It is an issue for us to recruit the specialists we need in those areas.  Generally, we are seeing that professional consultants, in particular, want to move to and be based in the big urban centres.  There is a quality of life issue that we are trying to promote in our recruitment process and we need to do more work on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":581,"content":"<p>This is something that Mr. Reid-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#D00800","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Deputy but he is out of time.

The focus was more to be on integration on a regional level, or the horizontal change.<\/p> <p>  I do not speak for the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Deputy has plenty of opportunities to ask him questions.  The Minister is in favour of delivering RHAs and he has set up an advisory group to advise on this.  There are many different questions we must address in how this will be done, how quickly it can be done and the phasing of it.  The Minister is well aware of the work that is proceeding.

It is a process that is ongoing.  It is an assessment of &euro;1 billion of provisions and accruals for the end of 2020.  That is the scale of what we have assessed.  We initiated that review jointly with the Department.  My judgment right now is it will be less than &euro;100 million and probably greater than &euro;50 million but I cannot be very specific.  That process will determine if we need to do it at all.<\/p> <p>  I will make some brief comments on two other issues that the Deputy might appreciate.  On the question of regionalisation, I ask the Deputy not to make too many early judgments based on correspondence between Mr. Watt and me.  On the specific question of corporate functions, there is no doubt there will be HR and finance functions in regions and they will need them.  They should have them.  We were having an exchange about a core principle; there will be some things that would be best held at the centre.  Clinical standards and guidance is an element in which we do and will need consistency across regions in future.  I urge the Deputy not to make too many judgments because we are still in the design phase of what that might look like.  The Deputy will, quite rightly, probe this strongly when we get to a better stage on that.<\/p> <p>  The recruitment question is topical and there are two points to make.  We are targeting to recruit 10,000 people.  I have a role as a public servant, which I respect hugely, and I know Mr. Watt has a role as a civil servant and Secretary General, to advise the Minister and the Government if we see a jeopardy at any early stage in the planning process.  Based on what we have done for the past two years, we see not just the health recruitment market but the complete recruitment market under significant stress.  That is particularly so in the health sector, which has a global market.  We have flagged to the Department and the Minister that 5,500 is our likely projection but we will be pulling out all the steps to achieve 10,000.  On a positive note, in January we had 675 net recruits, which is a good start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#E02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Will 300 people be recruited in the mental health area this year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#E03000","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":623,"content":"<p>That is what we are striving to do.

It will continue to deliver.  However, there are structural problems in relation to the capacity in the public system which create issues around trolleys, and there is a significant structural issue around waiting lists, where public patients have to wait too long for treatments.  A key objective of the plan is to address those concerns through a variety of actions and improve the performance of the system.  That is what we are doing.  Our focus is to continue to improve the performance of the system.  Can any of us give guarantees that we will have no waiting lists or people waiting on trolleys?

I believe that during Covid the public got a better level of trust and confidence in the health system for a number of reasons.  We operated as a more integrated health system than the public experienced many times in the past.  All elements of the health system came together, including GPs, pharmacies, statutory hospitals, non-statutory hospitals, private hospitals, the Department and ourselves, working in a more coherent and collaborative manner.  That is what the public expect and we need to keep it going.  They will judge us on what their experience is.  There is no immediate short-term fix but we have to focus on some of the priorities.  Waiting lists are one of our priorities.  What is probably not publicly understood is that we do over 3.4 million procedures per year; however, we have 800,000 or so on waiting lists.  People are waiting far too long.<\/p> <p>  To give some reassurance, we took from September to December 2021 a joint approach chaired by Mr. Watt and I and our teams looking at all aspects of public health delivery, private capacity, NTPF, reporting, hospital groups and specialties.  We asked what was the 80\/20, which specialties we could hold straight on and how we could focus on the longest waiters.  We will continue that process into the multi-annual waiting list.  It is not a short-term fix; it is a multi-annual fix.

We have tried to allocate responsible officers from both the HSE and the Department of Health to the large projects.  They and their teams are driving the change.  They are responsible to Mr. Reid and me, as co-chairs of the board.  Mr. Reid and I are accountable to the Government for the implementation.  We have established that board, which is an implementation board rather than an oversight board.<\/p> <p>  There have been debates about the extent to which an external challenge will be involved in this.  The Minister has set up a regional health areas advisory group, which has a large number of external people.  We are open to considering whether some other oversight or external function could help.  For the time being, we are happy with the structure and we think it is working.  We will review it and if people are concerned about the pace or failings of implementation, then Mr. Reid and I will address that, or the Minister and Government will address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I fully understand why the committee will ask about oversight.

The HSE has a board that strongly holds it to account on all aspects of performance, change, reform, delivery of our corporate plan and delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.  That is one strong goal of governance within the HSE, made up of individual experts.  The Deputy mentioned the Oireachtas as another avenue.  As Mr. Watt said, the regional health areas are independent bodies.  I want to make a final point similar to Mr. Watt's.  Regarding criticism or scrutiny, the model that we have provides ownership and accountability.  As I said earlier, I have been involved in change and reform in the private sector and the not-for-profit sector, central Government, local government, and the health service.  The only way I have seen it work effectively is when people who are going to manage or design the change are involved in it and accountable for it.

Mr. Reid and I give overall guidance, which then goes to the Minister.  The waiting list plan is probably the most ambitious plan that we have developed to increase capacity and activity.

They are galvanised and motivated.

I do not know how that works.  My constituency, Dublin South-West, includes Tallaght University Hospital.  Under Sl&aacute;intecare, disability services have been restructured, with the introduction of the children's disability network teams.  In CHO 7, that roll-out has had a rough start, with poor communications with parents and a major shortfall of clinicians.

The roll-out of children's disability networks has not all been smooth.  It is a change to how we do our business.  There is no doubt about that.  Enhanced community care has had the highest allocation of resources, with about 495 posts in that CHO to support some initiatives that we are talking about here, which is higher than anywhere else.  We know that there are people who are concerned about how the community networks are being developed.  It is a change in how we do our business.  In order to meet the needs of as many children as possible and to do it properly, this is absolutely the right way to go.  We will continue to communicate at a local level.  We have now commenced all networks.  It took us longer than envisaged because of Covid and some other reasons, but we now have all children's disability networks in place across the country, and, likewise, we are developing the enhanced community care networks and have 51 of those in place.  They will work together to meet the needs of local populations.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the reach into the services.  Having these networks in place provides a structure that allows us to work with people in their local areas to try to address their local needs, instead of looking at everything through either a bigger regional or national lens.  Ultimately, it is about the people working in those areas.  There is no doubt that we have a challenge with recruitment to secure sufficient health and social care professionals for those disability teams to be able to deliver all the services that we want to.

It is important to point out that we are coming to the end of the fifth year of what was supposed to be a ten-year reform programme under Sl&aacute;intecare.  I have to say that when it comes to regionalisation I think the system has stalled, if it is not going backwards.  My heart sank when I was listening to the two presentations this morning with regard to regionalisation.  Mr. Reid spoke about the senior management team having to own and drive reform.  I do not see any evidence of this here.  There is no sense of driving a reform programme.  I believe what we are seeing is capture of the reform programme.  I will support my contention that this is what is happening.<\/p> <p>  In 2019 the geographical regions were agreed for the regional structure and the map was provided.  That was in 2019.  They were announced by the then Minister, Deputy Harris, in July 2019.  Last year we were told in the strategy and action plan that with the geographical areas agreed, a business plan was being produced and we needed to address the issues of clinical governance, corporate governance and accountability with a population-based approach to service planning and integration of community and acute services.  I had been hoping to get an update from the witnesses this morning on these areas and the preparation they are doing on accountability legislation and on a population-based approach to the allocation of resources.  However, when I looked at the email Deputy Cullinane referred to earlier, I saw that in one of the paragraphs Mr. Watt spoke about expanding the remit of hospital groups to include community services.  A person who makes this statement does not get what Sl&aacute;intecare is.  That is not what Sl&aacute;intecare is.  The hospital groups will no longer apply.  These are the regions that have been agreed by the previous two governments.  These are the regions Mr. Watt is required to operate to.  All of the indications are that he is seeking to rework what government policy was and what was provided for in Sl&aacute;intecare.  What does he mean by expanding the remit of hospital groups to include community services?  That has nothing to do with the regionalisation plan as set out in Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#H00100","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.

What I can talk about are the past two and a half years.  Thanks to the Department, the Minister and the Government, we secured &euro;82 million to deploy an IFMS.  It is quite a complex system.  It will be rolled out.  The design phase has been worked on throughout the last year.  We have had issues with the systems integrator that we are in discussions with about termination.  We are going to procurement for a further systems integration.  However, the process is continuously moving on seamlessly.  The reality of it is that approximately 80% of the total spend activity across the entire health sector will be encompassed by 2025.  However, at the end of this year we will start loading financial data for the eastern region and Tusla that will go live in 2023.  It is a very significant programme involving the massive design of a new IFMS.  The Deputy is correct that it is a big loss that we do not have one but we have funding for it.

The HSE implements Government policy.<\/p> <p>  The real concern is with the Department of Health.  Mr. Watt's performance here this morning - what he has said here and his answers to the questions, certainly regarding the email - is concerning.  Clearly, Mr. Watt's understanding of Sl&aacute;intecare is somewhat at variance with the understanding of Sl&aacute;intecare that many people here have.  My worry relates to the Minister's understanding of Sl&aacute;intecare because if that is Mr. Watt's understanding of Sl&aacute;intecare, what is the Minister's understanding of it?  That would worry me greatly because the regionalisation of the structures is a key component of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We are five years into what was initially envisaged as a ten-year reform programme.  We have had a pandemic and any reasonable person would say that you are talking about an extra two or three years on top of that.  I am greatly alarmed by Mr. Watt's answers to the questions but, more particularly, the combative nature of his answers.  We will have to reflect on that.  I am concerned now that Mr. Watt does not understand Sl&aacute;intecare in the same way that we understand it.<\/p> <p>  While all this is going on, there are 96 people on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, at present.  They are the figures as of today.  The bones of &euro;100 million of Government money has been invested in UHL.  We are talking about &euro;20 million on a modular unit and another &euro;40 million for a state-of-the-art accident and emergency department.  I am wondering what has gone wrong in Limerick.  Mr. Reid might be able to shed some light on this.  Are there peer review performance comparisons with other accident and emergency departments?  How come Limerick accident and emergency department is constantly at the top of the scale when it comes to people on trolleys?  Even though tens of millions of euro of Government money have been spent over the past seven or eight years to try to alleviate the problem, we are still in a situation today where nearly 100 people are on trolleys.  Is there a problem with the management down there?  Does Mr. Reid have concerns with the management of UHL, given that we are in this situation today with 96 people on trolleys?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#J02000","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":728,"content":"<p>Will I come in and then maybe Mr. Reid will deal with the second part of the question?<\/p> <p>  First of all, to reassure the Senator and other members, and to add to what Mr. Reid has said, I am absolutely fully committed to this reform agenda and the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.

The group itself is undertaking work to look at the key drivers of that but the emergency department in Limerick has been extremely busy with regard to the volume of attendance and, more so than anywhere else, it has remained so throughout the pandemic.  In recent weeks, its level of attendances has really only been exceeded by the Mater.  It has that challenge at the front door.  Things are happening that can happen in the short term to assist with that.  Where there are any delayed transfers of care that can move, we have been seeking to support that movement to create better flow through the hospital.  The community has been supporting Dooradoyle, in particular, on that.  There are also some front-door initiatives seeking to use more of the pathfinder service, a service provided by the ambulance service, and to use the hospitals in Ennis and Nenagh for step-down to the greatest extent possible.

We work very closely with the group and the NAS on that.  There is already very strong work going on at both sites.  I do not necessarily see the benefit in extending the reception of emergency patients into the hospitals in Ennis and Nenagh.  Their use for step-down care for patients from Dooradoyle remains very important.

It is hard to get away from how very busy the front door of that hospital is.  There is a capacity challenge.  As the Senator has rightly said, there has been significant investment in new capacity.

There is a brand new road being built along the border between the counties of Limerick and Clare, the Limerick northern distributor road.  It is opening up tracts of land that heretofore were just grazed by cattle.  The first phase of that road will be completed in August of this year.  The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a non-profit private hospital group, is planning to open a 150-bed private hospital along that route.  It is perfectly located near the Limerick tunnel, it is accessible to people in Tipperary and, crucially, it is on that border between Clare and Limerick.  It is as centred within the region as you can possibly get.  If they really want to unburden University Hospital Limerick of its problems through Sl&aacute;intecare, it is essential that the witnesses look at having a public wing within that new hospital to separate things out at UHL.

I have had many emails and phone calls from people at various management levels in the HSE and I have a number of questions that I wish to ask Mr. Watt.  Mr. Watt and Mr. Reid have repeatedly been made aware that a group of senior management personnel in the HSE and voluntary hospitals have been unjustly picked out for unfair treatment, by the continued withholding of a pay award under report 42 of the review body on higher remuneration, which dates back to 2007.  The award was approved by the Government and subsequently sanctioned by the Department of Finance, but it was withheld from this group when all others in local government, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and across the board received this pay grade.  How can the witnesses stand over this injustice when the very same report specifically said that neither the pay of the HSE's chief executive or the Secretary General of the Department of Health merited being any higher than they were then?

It has been a challenging two years.  I thank everyone involved in dealing with the Covid issue and the challenges posed by it.  I want to move on to the here and now and where we go from here with regard to healthcare in Ireland over the next five to ten years.  One issue that will occur and already exists is with difficulties in recruiting.  I am concerned about the disparity in recruitment.  For example, since December 2014, the number of people working in the HSE has gone from 103,000 to 131,000, which is a 27% increase.  The number working in senior management has increased from 1,185 to 2,154, which is an 81% increase.  The number working in home help in 2014 was 3,703.  In October 2021, it was 2,352, which is a decrease.  The Secretary General referred to the demographic change that is occurring in the sector and said that by 2028, the demands on our healthcare sector and home care will see a dramatic increase.  We will go from about 740,000 people over the age of 65 to over 1 million people over the age of 65.  How do the witnesses propose to address shortfalls in recruitment and in getting staff?

In the last two years, the number went from 120,000 to 132,000, and there are plans for further increases again this year, of between 5,500 and 10,000.  As Mr. Reid mentioned, there are recruitment challenges.  There are two aspects of this from our perspective.  Mr. Reid and his team can address some of the details.  First, we need to become more effective at recruiting internationally.  We have made changes regarding the registration of nurses, to double the number of registered nurses coming from overseas this year.  Second, we need to provide more training opportunities for our young people and for people within the health system to progress.  This is a societal issue.  As demographic effects kick in, healthcare will become a bigger concern.  We will need to train more of our people to work in the sector and we will need to be attractive to people coming in from overseas.  There is a workforce plan for this year.  That will evolve into a multi-annual plan to try to address these issues.  The Deputy is aware of the areas that we are addressing.  Mr. Reid mentioned some of them.

Second, we have worked with the Public Appointments Service to accelerate the process, particularly in respect of consultants and senior professional medics.  That has helped significantly.  Third, we have put a new recruitment model in place with a third party provider to operate on a scale well above what we would be able to do because, as I mentioned, recruiting 35,000 people over two years is very significant.  <\/p> <p>  I will ask my colleague to comment on the home help issue the Deputy highlighted, which is a real challenge.<\/p> <p>  I will make two other final comments, the first of which is on people leaving.  I agree with Mr. Watt that people will leave for various reasons.  We all know many people who have left, including family members, some of whom have come back and some of whom have not.  That is a function of factors and the decisions people make.  Specifically for us, I mentioned earlier that we have to recruit 9,500 people every year in order to stand still.  When we talk the about 12,500 over two years, we have had to recruit a further 19,000 people just to stand still.  There is, therefore, a great deal of churn.<\/p> <p>  My final comment is not directed specifically at the Deputy but is more general.  There can be some awful generalisations made about the health service.  I have listened to some commentary over the weekend, not by politicians, that it is an awful place to work, asking who would go to work in it.  The health service is actually a very good place to work and is full of highly committed professionals.  Some of these general, tired statements that are made at times really hurt us and our staff in respect of retention.  The heath service is a good place to work.  <\/p> <p>  Similarly, at senior levels, there is an increasing personalisation of senior roles.  I am not talking of my role or that of anyone in particular.  The increasing personalisation of public service roles does not do good to get the right people into the public service.  I wanted to make a general comment on that because that is about recruitment and retention of the best people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":786,"content":"<p>I will move on to capacity in Cork and the wider Cork-Kerry region.

Senator Kyne is absolutely right; the pressure on Galway has been unbelievably high for many weeks and months throughout the winter period.  Any year in which we work with Galway in terms of its winter planning, as we did this year, they are very challenged in identifying a location where they could put extra beds, such as a modular build.  We have been working closely with Saolta in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Galway has been on the top of our priority list for the past three winters.  From their perspective, due to the lack of other capacity around them, unlike hospitals in other parts of the country around which there are different types of facilities, they are very challenged and they have not had as much capacity available to them in the private hospitals compared with other parts of the country.  They are in a bottleneck.  We have been working with them in terms of looking at their existing sites to see if there is capacity to build on the site of UHG, but that would involve them moving other capacity around.  Therefore, the UHG site is not a straightforward site, as the Senator is probably aware of.  For us, the solution lies in Merlin Park where there is obviously space.

He said that we could publish as many plans and reports on which we ideologically agree, but these reports must come with implementation strategies, and that we need to move to a place where we have a roadmap for implementation as a companion for such plans.  Can the Department provide a steer on the implementation of reporting on Sl&aacute;intecare?  For example, in the forestry sector, there is a dashboard that everyone has access to and they can see what targets have been met, such as how many trees have been chopped down and how many saplings have been planted, and how that aligns with the targets that have been set.  It is particularly good for public accountability, as well as for public representatives to be able to see what is happening.  Could something like that be done?  The public wants to know what is happening with Sl&aacute;intecare.  We want to know.  We invite witnesses to the committee in order to ask them questions.  As to a clear accountability measure, such as a dashboard, are there plans for or a conversation about providing something like that?  It would save us from some of the argy-bargy that happens sometimes.  It would create a clear and transparent accountability mechanism for Sl&aacute;intecare which, I believe, the members of the public would like.<\/p><p>I will ask my second question now and I am happy for both of them to be answered together.  I refer to the rates of pay that exist and m y party colleague, Deputy Kelly, listed a number of figures in the D&aacute;il Chamber yesterday, such as the 700 vacant consultant posts.  We know about the shortage of GPs across the country from reports by Simon Carswell in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  One in five GPs are expected to retire by the end of the decade and we need 2,000 more.  In 13 GP areas, medical card holders have been without a permanent doctor for a year, and so on and so forth.  I need not go into the depth of it.  I have a genuine question that is not designed to trip the witnesses up.  Considering the current rates of pay, will we ever be in a position to hire enough staff to implement Sl&aacute;intecare to its fullest?  We hear about the core rates of pay and how they are not sufficient to attract to people.  If we continue with current rates of pay, will we be able to get to where Sl&aacute;intecare needs to be or is there a need for a genuine conversation about how that to happen with those rates of pay?  My two questions are on implementation and the use of a dashboard system and whether we can reach Sl&aacute;intecare goals in the context of current rates of pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#O00500","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I will go first and Mr. Reid or a member of his team may wish to come in afterwards.  We produced a report yesterday along the lines of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation.   While it may not have produced in time for the Senator and committee members to go through, it sets out, in effect, what the Senator suggested.  Some 228 deliverables have been set out, of which 200 have been categorised as progressed, on track or with minor challenge.  That leaves 28 with a significant challenge.  We have set out a dashboard or traffic light system.  We certainly would welcome any comments on how that reporting could be improved.  That is a key part of our accountability and sets out what we have done in 2021.  It is a progress report that sets out where we are making progress, as well as where there are challenges and significant challenges.  We touched on some of that this morning.<\/p> <p>  No matter what we produce, there will always be argy-bargy.  Argy-bargy should not necessarily be seen as a bad thing.  Debate is good and being challenged is good.  No matter what we prepare, there will always be contested space in health and other areas of public policy given its importance.  We welcome any suggestions the committee may have in terms of improved reporting that would help it with its role in calling us to account.<\/p> <p>  As for recruitment, which was touched on earlier, a significant amount of recruitment has taken place.  There are challenges around that and we are doing a variety of things to address them.  There is a wider societal piece about making the health system attractive to people.  It is about pay.  It is about working conditions.  It is about the overall sense of the discussion around health.  Mr. Reid touch on this earlier.  Working in health provides a fantastic career and fantastic opportunities, and it is much more positive than negative.  Of course, there are negatives and, unfortunately, in the public debate, the negatives drown out most of the positives.  It is a challenge for Mr. Reid and me, as well as our teams and others, to better communicate the positives of the health system in terms of what has been done, the achievements and the enormous pride people have in their work.  We always get a sense of how people are enormously proud of working in the HSE, in other parts of the health system, and in the Department of Health, and how they feel they are making a contribution.  I do not believe it is just about pay.  It is about a whole variety of issues, including structural issues and making employment as attractive as possible for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":823,"content":"<p>I will add a few brief comments to what Mr. Watt said.  I referred to figures on recruitment earlier.  It was unprecedented to have recruited 35,000 staff, 12,500 net, in the past two years.  What is more important to me is that the mix of staff have been a much better mix than there might have been in the past.  They included the recruitment of 3,300 nurses and midwives, of whom more than 2,150 were staff nurses and midwives; almost 2,000 healthcare assistants; and more than 2,300 in patient and client care, including healthcare assistants.  The challenges we have, some of which the Senator touched on, include the recruitment of consultants.  There has been a 358 net increase in the number of consultants in the past couple of years but that is a massive challenge for us across all the specialties.  As I mentioned earlier, there are some geographical areas in which we find it particularly difficult.  South Kerry was a clear example of that and, indeed, Donegal can be as well.  There are severe challenges in some areas and regions.  Highly qualified professional consultants like to be in the big urban centres and urban functions.<\/p> <p>  I will add one other point to what Mr. Watt said and it is something I passionately believe in.<\/p><p>I talk to a lot of our staff regularly.  We would have been able to get out and about much more, but we have webinars and we talk.  I passionately believe that our teams like working in the health service.  When things go wrong, it is not good.  None of us can stand over things that have happened, whether it is in south Kerry or other instances that happened where wrongs or harms occurred.  Overall, the Irish health service provides, by equivalent with other health services, a good service in terms of people's longevity and life cycle, cancer treatment and cardiac treatment.  It does not always get reported.<\/p><p> I agree with Mr. Watt to the extent that it is a role for me as leader and it is certainly a role for me and my teams, but there is a wider public role in terms of how we draw out many of the clich&eacute;s about the HSE and the health system.  It does hurt the system and it does not make it easier for us.  I am not saying that people should not challenge, criticise or have a go at us, but the general commentary does not always reflect the reality of what our teams are committed to in the health service.  I am committed to help them as well.<\/p><p> I will not go through what has been said about GPs, but it is a challenge.  I went through some of the figures earlier where we are trying to scale up with the ICGP.  Everybody is committed this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":825,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reid.  It is one of those things that we will just have to get to grips with.  Not enough money is coming from the Government to employ people to achieve the goal.  I accept the comment Mr. Reid made that it is wider than just pay.  That is something that we as political representatives have to take very seriously.  As an advocate of workers' rights, a fair day's pay for a fair day's work is something that is very important, and perhaps we are just not getting to grips with that.<\/p> <p>  The forestry dashboard is a hard accountability system, but it is very accessible to the public.  The reality is that not all members of the public read reports.  Some will read a report but not everyone is going to read it.  Such a dashboard is hard accountability based on numbers and figures and something like that would be very useful for members of the public to see where Sl&aacute;intecare is going because we talk a lot about it and give a lot of time to it.  They are all my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#P00200","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":826,"content":"<p>We will look at that suggestion and see if we can improve on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":827,"content":"<p>Before I bring in other members, I wish to ask about the Sl&aacute;intecare programme board, which met once.  How often does it propose to meet?  The big question is what it will do differently in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Watt referred to elective hospitals in his opening statement.  What is the earliest date he hopes to see them opening?  I would have liked to ask about waiting lists.  There was talk of a 5% reduction.  Based on that, with 40,000 patients a year, it would take 18 years to deal with it.  Could he give a sense in a written reply of how we will reduce the waiting lists and a timescale for it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#P00400","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":828,"content":"<p>Regarding oversight, the new board has met twice since December.  We have a meeting every second month or more often if needed.  As we mentioned earlier, the teams meet every week on the different projects, and on some of the projects they could meet several times a week.  There is a lot of activity happening below the teams and issues are escalated to Mr. Reid and me each week but formally then at the board structure.  We will see how that evolves over time.  We are not wedded to this particular format.  We will see.  If it works, we will continue; if we think we can improve it, we will make those tweaks.<\/p> <p>  I do not have a timeline for when the elective hospitals will be delivered and when they will be opened.  It is now 2022, so I hope we will get to the stage where we are going out for detailed design and procurement mid-year.  It normally takes two to three years after that to get the procurement in and to build.  The facilities are not as big as some of the hospitals we have but they are large in terms of their footprint.  I will come back to you if I may, Chairman, with a more concrete timeline on that as I do not have it to hand.  It will be several years.<\/p> <p>  Regarding waiting lists, Mr. Reid and I touched on this very briefly today.  We are constrained in providing all the detail because the plan is not finalised yet and it has not gone to the Government.  It would not be appropriate for us to give all the details before the Taoiseach and Ministers have had an opportunity to consider it.  It is a very important decision for the Government, and I hope it will have an opportunity this week to consider it and to debate it formally next week when it meets.  The targets do involve significant reductions in waiting lists by the end of this year compared to where we are now, and a very long level of activity, but it will still involve large numbers of people waiting at the end of the year.  I hope the number of long waiters will also be reduced.  That is a key aspect of the plan as well.  The challenge of the waiting lists will take a number of years to address.  They are not going to be addressed in one year.  In order for us to improve our performance and reduce the number of people waiting, we want to get to a target where people do not have to wait more than 12 weeks, three months, in the main.  That is what we get to and it is a challenge to reduce the waiting time to a reasonable level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":829,"content":"<p>So it will be next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021600002#P00600","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644969600,"counter":830,"content":"<p>I hope the plan will be published next week, but it is up to the Government.

Deputy Shortall referred to the wording as well, which was that over time the HSE will seek to expand the remit of hospital groups to include community services.  It goes on to say that there are complexities in this, as the geographies of the CHOs and HGs do not align, which of course they do not.  They will only align once we set up new structures geographically, which have already been agreed.  Is it the case then from my reading of this, which may be wrong, that the HSE wants to expand the remit of hospital groups to include community services, and probably to align or amalgamate leadership teams across CHOs and hospital groups?   What is the timeframe for that?<\/p> <p>  Why is that being done within the current geographical alignment, as opposed to sticking with what Sl&aacute;intecare has agreed, which is the six regional health areas?

In terms of the direction that we are working under, the HSE senior management team, the Department of Health senior management team and the senior management team in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are working under clear direction from Mr. Watt and Mr. Reid to implement the regional health areas consistent with the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.  The commentary on the email is overplayed and is not consistent with the work programme under way.<\/p> <p>  The frequency of meetings was mentioned.  There are meetings every fortnight at least on the implementation of RHAs.  The implementation team, consistent with Mr. Reid's and Mr. Watt's overall responsibility for the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, connects their senior management teams on a very deep basis to implement the programme.  Our high-level timeline is to have a detailed implementation plan completed at the end of this year to work through 2023 to phase in implementation and, all going well, to introduce the regional health areas from 2024 onwards.  Recognising the importance of engagement with this committee, the public and in particular with staff across the health and social care system, in the preparation of a detailed implementation plan our intention would be by the autumn, September or so, to have a comprehensive plan for deep engagement with the committee and all interested parties.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of work programmes.  Mr. Watt and Mr. Reid have spoken to the scale of the reform programme.  It is not a caution about the ambition of it, it is a recognition of just how fundamental it is and how important it is to maintain service delivery through the period of implementation.

The gross allocation for Vote 37 in 2022 will now be &euro;23.35 billion.

As we face into 2022, we must be conscious of how far we have travelled in overcoming the challenges that Covid-19 presented both for society and the economy, as well as for our people.  We have experienced and dealt with waves of lockdowns and easing of public health restrictions since March 2020, which impacted all of us.  We did this by developing and delivering innovative approaches to mitigate as far as possible the impact of Covid on people's lives.  My Department played a critical role in supporting workers and their employers who were severely affected by Covid-19.  The roll-out of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, for workers whose jobs were in cold storage during lockdown and the provision of funding to the Revenue Commissioners to support employers through the employment wage subsidy scheme ensured individuals, businesses and the economy generally could withstand the impact of restrictions.<\/p> <p>  In recognition of the need to ease the financial impact of Covid on the most vulnerable, measures such as flexibility in rent supplement and the Covid illness benefit were also introduced.  The Government's announcement on 21 January 2022 of the lifting of most public health restrictions, allowing virtually all elements of society to reopen, is an indication we have moved into a new phase.  The Revised Estimates, which the committee is to consider today, reflects the start of this new phase as we emerge from almost two years of a very dynamic and volatile environment into what we hope will be a more stable base for continuing to develop our social protection system.<\/p> <p>  Projected spending for the Department in 2022 is &euro;23.3 billion, compared with an estimated outturn for 2021 of &euro;30.3 billion.  It should be borne in mind that spending in 2021 includes &euro;8.5 billion directly related to Covid, comprising &euro;4 billion for the PUP and &euro;4.5 billion for the employment wage subsidy scheme.  The provision of Covid measures in the 2022 Estimate is approximately &euro;700 million, reflecting the fact that in 2022, my Department will return to focusing more on its traditional schemes and services.<\/p> <p>  As members know, the work of the Department is broad in scope, supporting people throughout the life cycle, from the payment of child benefit to the provision of income support when people reach pension age.  The Department's expenditure, at &euro;23.3 billion for 2022, is still one of the largest of any Department, representing more than one third of gross current Government expenditure.  With this level of expenditure, we must ensure our social protection system is properly structured and provides support when people need it most.  As demonstrated by our response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we also strive to ensure the system is flexible enough to deal with changes in the economy and society so that we can respond to challenges when they emerge.<\/p> <p>  The projected 2022 expenditure of &euro;23.3 billion represents a normalisation of the pattern of social protection spending, but it is a new normal and a higher level of expenditure, incorporating budget day measures valued at &euro;600 million on a full-year basis.  This was the largest social welfare budget package in 14 years and included across the board increases for all welfare recipients at the same time as continuing the practice of recent years of implementing targeted measures to help the most vulnerable in our communities.  Those measures include increases in the living alone allowance, qualified child payments and the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance; the expansion of the hot school meals programme; improvements in income disregard for carers; and increases in the wage subsidy scheme for people with disabilities, to name just a few.  These measures are reflected in the expenditure subheads presented today.<\/p> <p>  The biggest single block of expenditure in 2022 will be on pensions, which will amount to more than &euro;9.1 billion or 39% of overall expenditure.  Thankfully, people are living longer lives but that, of course, means an increasing proportion of the Department's expenditure is now providing income support for people in their older years.  Expenditure on illness, disability and carer's payment amounts to &euro;4.9 billion in 2022, representing 21% of expenditure.<\/p> <p>  With the phasing out in 2022 of the PUP, we will see a reduction in expenditure on working-age income support schemes.  Working-age income supports will account for nearly 16% of expenditure in 2022, at &euro;3.65 billion.  This includes payments for jobseekers, one-parent families, maternity and paternity payments, and supplementary welfare allowance.  Expenditure on employment supports continues to make a provision for the employment wage subsidy scheme, albeit at a significantly lower level.  It also includes community employment, back-to-education allowance, T&uacute;s, the rural social scheme and the various employment and activation programmes.  Employment supports expenditure amounts to &euro;1.5 billion this year or 6.3% of my Department's spending.<\/p><p>Expenditure on children and families will account for over 11% of expenditure, or &euro;2.6 billion, of which over &euro;2 billion will be spent on child benefit and &euro;350 million on the working family payment.  Expenditure on supplementary payments like rent supplement and the fuel allowance is &euro;907 million, or nearly 4%, of 2022 expenditure.<\/p><p> The live register at the end of January 2022 stood at just under 163,000, taking account of over 80,000 who received a pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, in that week.  The total number of workers in receipt of unemployment-related payments stood at 243,000.  My Department will continue to work in 2022 to encourage the movement from unemployment to employment through our activation services and employment programmes, and meeting our commitments under the Pathways to Work initiative.<\/p><p> The broad overview I have presented of social protection expenditure is developed in detail in the briefing material provided to the committee.  I am sure the committee will agree it is a very comprehensive analysis of 2022 expenditure on one of the largest and most complex Estimates of expenditure.  There is little doubt that 2022 will bring challenges for social protection spending, including evaluating how changes in the economy are impacting those most at risk of poverty.  My Department has demonstrated its ability and flexibility to effectively support the most vulnerable, as evidenced in the last few years in particular, without which we would have seen a society where poverty and social exclusion increased.  Due to the measures we have taken, incomes were protected, the risk-of-poverty rates fell and inequality reduced.<\/p><p> The recent Government announcement of the &euro;500 million package of measures to mitigate the increasing cost of living is a further indication of our commitment to respond immediately to the needs of our citizens.  As part of that package, an additional &euro;125 lump sum will be paid to fuel allowance recipients next month and the Government also agreed to the earlier introduction of the &euro;10 increase in working family thresholds.  Both measures combined represent additional social protection spending of &euro;53 million in 2022.  The combination of the other cost of living measures and the significant improvements introduced in budget 2022 will provide further support to many vulnerable households faced with higher costs this year.  The measures taken in response to Covid and increased living costs show our determination to protect and continue the progress we have made in the face of challenges, and the Estimates presented to date reflect this determination.<\/p><p> I look forward to hearing the committee's views and welcome any questions members have for myself or for the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#A00400","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":861,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her opening statement.

Have we information on who remains on the pandemic unemployment payment and what sectors are most affected?  If we have that information, do we have a specific plan?  For example, if we know it concerns people within hospitality or the arts, do we have specifics as to how we are going to move people off that?<\/p> <p>  I will trust the Chair to steer me back if I stray into the wrong programme, so he can get his cattle prod ready.  I want to ask about the large increase in basic supplementary welfare allowance payments, given some 30% is listed.  I want to ask that more general question of whether we are seeing the rise in the cost of living feeding through into people looking for supplementary allowance welfare payments, and whether we have a plan for that going forward or whether we think the package that was announced last week is sufficient.<\/p> <p>  There is a welcome increase in paternity and parent's benefit.  Do we believe we are successful in the take-up of that payment?  I know, anecdotally, that it has been culturally more difficult for men to take paternity leave, which they absolutely should as it is an incredibly important thing to do.  Are we being successful in that, in the Minister's opinion?<\/p> <p>  In terms of redundancy and insolvency payments, I have a feeling this will be a big issue.  Many businesses were kept on a lifeline over the course of Covid.  Are we seeing a large number of insolvencies coming through in a bunched way?  We would have expected, over the last two years, that a certain number of insolvencies would pass through the system but many of those were put on hold because of the supports that were put in place for Covid.  Do we expect a large number of those to come into the system over the next couple of months?  Are we prepared for that and do we have a plan for dealing with it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#B00900","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":869,"content":"<p>I have some figures on the basic supplementary allowance.  My apologies; the first question was on the PUP so I will begin with that.  The amount paid in PUP this week was &euro;15.2 million.  I can provide the committee with a full sheet giving a detailed breakdown of who is on the payment from the different sectors.  The main sector is accommodation and food services, in which the number of payments is 12,326.  That is followed by wholesale and retail, with 9,647 payments.  Payments in administrative and support service activities stand at 6,776.  That gives an idea of the different sectors in which people are unemployed and still on the PUP.<\/p> <p>  On the exceptional needs or supplementary welfare allowance, the Government announced a package last week to help people experiencing difficulties with the cost of living.  As members know, the Department agreed to pay a &euro;125 payment to those in receipt of the fuel allowance.  The supplementary welfare allowance is available for those who need support.  I take this opportunity to encourage everybody who is experiencing difficulty and needs help to contact his or her community welfare officer.  People can do that by phone or they can arrange for an officer to call to their house or meet them face to face.  If people are having problems, they should contact their community welfare officer.  We have put community welfare officers on notice to inform people who may call to them that those supports are available.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the essential needs payments.  There has been a steady decline in the number of essential needs payments paid to customers each month in the period from November 2019 to date.  In December 2019, 7,935 essential needs payments were paid.  In January 2022, the number of such payments was 3,596.  The anticipated increase in demand for essential needs payments did not materialise.  Arising from the cost-of-living increases, officers administering the scheme have been advised that for individuals and households dependent on income support payments from the Department or those working on low incomes, or both, the increased cost of living due to inflation and rising energy costs may present a significant financial challenge and it is likely many may seek additional financial support under the supplementary welfare allowance schemes to assist in meeting the increased costs of daily life.  Our community welfare officers are on notice and are there to help.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about parent's benefit.  Policy in respect of that benefit and parent's leave resides in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We increased that by a further two weeks in the budget.  On the take-up of parent's benefit, we reckon that about 30,000 people are benefiting.  We have increased its duration from five to seven weeks for parents of children under two years of age.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned companies that have been on business supports and may not survive and asked what we are doing in that regard.  We provide the pathways to work programme and many different supports to help people get back to other work.  We have been working in conjunction with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, on upskilling and retraining.  All those supports are available to help people get back into the workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#C00100","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":870,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

When the public health restrictions were introduced in 2020 people in receipt of social welfare were given the option of being paid into a bank account.  This was an exceptional measure to help reduce the spread of the virus and ensure people could comply with social distancing guidelines.

They were then moved into the Department of Social Protection and Intreo offices, so they are a fair distance from the community now.  Many people do not even know they can approach community officers if they are really stuck with a bill or whatever.  I would like to hear the Minister's insight into that.  Is there a specific amount of money allocated to the community welfare offices to deal with exceptional needs or are they still dealt with on a case-by-case basis?  Are community welfare officers restricted in what they can allocate moneys for?  Given the situation we are in, should those officers not be closer to the community, perhaps based in the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, or a similar body, to improve access to exceptional needs payments?

Approximately 92,200 payments were made in 2019 and 67,600 payments were made in 2020.  It is there and it is available.  I also commend the work of the community welfare officers.  We all know them well in our constituencies.  They provide an excellent service.  They help people when they need it and they are only a telephone call away.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry there was a bad experience where somebody could not get through to the community welfare office, but if people call into the local Intreo office or email them they will be able to make contact with them.  There are three ways to do it.  The telephone is probably the easiest way.  There is also the in-person way and the officers will do house visits if necessary.  I know they were in the HSE and that they moved to the Department of Social Protection.  We want to support that service because it is essential.  It is important that it continues and that it is there to provide help to people.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the details, we gave an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125.  That will be paid to all households in receipt of the fuel allowance.  It is expected that this additional lump sum will be paid in early March, at an estimated cost of &euro;49 million.  The lump sum payment, in addition to the measures announced in budget 2022, will mean that low-income households will get an increase of 41% this fuel allowance season compared to the previous season.  A further measure to help with energy costs is the energy credit of &euro;200 to be applied to electricity accounts for all householders.  The introduction of the &euro;10 increase to the weekly income threshold of the working family payment will be brought forward to early April this year.  It was supposed to apply in June so we have brought it forward.  For those on low wages in receipt of more than a minimum payment on the working family payment the &euro;10 increase in all earnings thresholds will result in an increased payment of &euro;6. All these measures are in addition to the wide-sweeping measures in budget 2022, which was the largest social welfare budget in 14 years.  Not only did we do an across-the-board increase of &euro;5, we also did the targeted measures in the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance and the qualified child payments among a number of other payments.<\/p> <p>  We would always like to do more.  We make these decisions and the pot of funds is limited.  We do not have an endless pot.  However, we continue to try to target it at those most vulnerable and most in need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#D00200","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":882,"content":"<p>The Minister is ruling out bringing the community welfare officers closer to the community, where they would have been.

What we are doing is returning to the system that was in place prior to Covid-19.  It has always been the case that jobseekers, prior to Covid-19, collected their payments in the post office.  This is about supporting the post office network, which is an integral part of the community throughout the country.  It is not just post offices in rural areas, but also post offices in the inner city.  I spoke to a postmaster in the inner city and he outlined the need to support the post offices and increase the footfall to make sure they continue to be viable into the future.  I met with the Irish Postmasters' Union and An Post and they were very clear that the loss of footfall for these payments was having a severe impact on post offices, both rural and urban.  Deputies on all sides of the House have called on the Government to put more services into the post offices.  Here is an example of that happening.<\/p><p>As I said before, the postmasters and the postmistresses do great work the length and breadth of this country.  As Minister for Social Protection and as Minister for Rural and Community Development, I want to support them.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton is working to look at what other services can be provided via the post office network.  I am happy to work with her on that.  We know from the past, and the Deputy knows it himself, that if you do not use the services, you lose them.  This was an opportunity to put some services into the post offices.  I believe it was the right thing to do.  If there are some people out there who, for whatever particular reason, cannot attend the post office they should contact their local Intreo office.  We will deal with them individually.<\/p><p> I have outlined what is available under the essential needs payment.  We pay 4,000 to 5,000 essential needs payments per month across a range of categories, including heating, clothing, housing and funeral bills.  The level of essential needs payments was lower than usual during the pandemic.  It is usually closer to 8,000 per month.  Therefore, it has been lower.  However, it is available.  While we do not have the numbers of rejections, it is fair to say that most community welfare officers do a very good job.  They understand the needs of the people who come into them.  There is a review mechanism built into the system.  There is another higher grade officer who deals with any reviews or any appeals people might have.  We have a process in place whereby a decision can be reviewed if people are not happy with the outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#D00600","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":887,"content":"<p>I would appreciate if the Minister could answer the first question first.  I did not ask about the post offices.  I asked about the specific reference the Minister made relating to the two reasons.  I did not ask about the post office one; I asked about the fraud one.  Are there any other circumstances where a social welfare payment or any other payment that is made is included in a press release, which in this case states that one of the two reasons signing on at the post office was brought back related to fraud.  It demonises people who are on social welfare payments.  One of the two specific reasons given for bringing back signing on in the post office was to increase footfall in post offices, which I have no problem with, but that is not the one I asked.  The specific question was around fraud and the use of language in the context of bringing people back into post offices, where it specifically quotes the Minister in relation to those two reasons, one of which is fraud.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister provide us with the statistics of the rejection of claims for the essential needs payment?

Just to be very clear here, we have a control system within the Department of Social Protection.  I am sure the Deputy is well aware there were some very high-profile cases where people had been claiming social welfare while not living in the country.  If a person has to present at the post office, that means he or she has to be in the country.  The vast majority of people who get social welfare payments deserve them.  That is a fact.  There are those, and we saw a case in the news only last night, who claim social welfare to which they are not entitled or who claim it on behalf of others when they should not be doing so.  We have a control unit and we crack down on that because this is taxpayers&rsquo; money.  We have to be conscious of that.  I would say once again that the vast majority of people, and there are many of them, who receive social payments are well entitled to them and deserve every penny that they get.  I just wish to be clear on that and I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#E00300","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":889,"content":"<p>On the essential needs payment, one of the challenges, in my experience of how it has changed over the years, is that the welfare officers, as they used to be called, used to have huge discretion to help a person if there was poverty, and it was not on the basis of a means test.  That meant they could a family who had income coming into the house, which may have been a reasonably good income, but where there were serious addiction problems that meant partners and children were losing out greatly and were absolutely stuck for cash.<\/p> <p>  I was there when the change took place.  It was always funded by social welfare, but the administration used the HSE.  When it came into the Department, I was assured that would not change and the local community welfare officers would be left as they were.  For example, in our case in Connemara, we had somebody who was based in An Cheathr&uacute; Rua, An Cloch&aacute;n, and in north Connemara.  The reality was it was all retreated into the main social welfare offices.  It meant people had to go 30 or 40 miles, in some cases, to access it.<\/p> <p>  The second thing is, the community welfare officers used to go around and do clinics in local health centres.  I know the world has changed, but for the most vulnerable it has not changed as much as it might have for some of us, and we have to take this into account.<\/p> <p>  My experience of essential needs payments at the moment is twofold.  One is that a person gets an essential needs payment on a means-tested basis if he or she is waiting for a payment to come through.  If he or she is waiting for invalidity pension, disability allowance or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to come through, that person can apply for an essential needs payment.  In that case, of course, when he or she gets the payment, they claw back the amount that had been paid on the supplementary welfare system.  It is therefore very hard to see what were the discretionary extra payments because of severe hardship.<\/p> <p>  Second, will the Minister confirm that people have to fill a form, which I think is eight pages in length - basically a means test like would have to be done for any social welfare scheme - to get the essential needs payments now?  I do not think it is the way it used to be.  It is very hard to drill into the figures, because when you ask for figures from the Department, it mixes various things.  We are told it does not have the heading of the old-fashioned essential needs payment, that is, somebody who may have an income but has a circumstance that means he or she literally has no money.  It was a great safety net to prevent poverty.  I think the Department thought it was a little bit expensive; I do not think it was.  That is my first question.<\/p> <p>  A second, bigger and wider question in terms of big policy, the other one being a change that could be made quite simply by going back to the people to make sure there is a safety net there that, irrespective of circumstance, just measures up the circumstances and makes a payment, is whether there is any work ongoing on a policy basis to change radically the supports for working-age recipients?  I understood ten or fifteen years ago this work was ongoing and they were looking at introducing a uniform, universal working-age payment.  Then there was the debate, for which I have great sympathy, about a universal basic payment and integrating the social welfare system with the tax system so that there would be a clear, coherent interface and not two systems working at odds with each other.<\/p> <p>  The situation at the moment is there are many crinkles in the system.  There are a lot of anomalies.  More importantly, there are massive disincentives to work.  The Minister knows my hang-up on this.  If you are self-employed, it is a 100% disincentive to work.  If you are a farmer, it is 70%.  Let us take another case that is quite common, where one person in a couple is in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  If the partner has get up and go and gets part-time work, there is a penalty, effectively a tax.  Let us call it tax, although if I called it a tax, there would be uproar, but when it is only a social welfare clawback, it does not seem to hurt the State's thinking quite as much.<\/p><p>When it is only a social welfare clawback, it does not seem to hurt the State's thinking quite as much.  It is amazing.  It is the old Victorian attitude.  Our social welfare system was a hotchpotch created over 100 years.<\/p><p> I will give a few examples.  For a couple on jobseeker's allowance where the dependent adult takes up work and gets &euro;150 per week, the jobseeker's payment is reduced by &euro;54, effectively a 33% penalty or tax on the jobseeker's allowance or family income.  If the income goes to &euro;200, the clawback becomes &euro;84, which is effectively a 42% tax, not to mind that at this stage one runs into USC costs.  If the income goes to &euro;300, the clawback or tax becomes 48% or &euro;144.  People talk about incentives to work and encouraging people.  We all know that if someone on a basic income, which jobseeker's allowance should be, could raise the family income by &euro;300, it would do an awful lot to eliminate poverty and create great incentive.  At the present rate, one is taxed at 48%, higher than the highest rate of tax in this country, and is also subject on that income to USC, because 50 times 300 is over 13,000 so there is no exemption.  There is no tax rate in the country that is 48%, except this tax in these circumstances.<\/p><p> It is time we thought it all out again, rather than just tinkering with it, going through the Estimates and looking at how many euro are here and there.  Is there high level work or did they suspend the work that was going on many years ago to look at the issue so there would be an interface between tax and the social welfare system that would be coherent and mean that people were not running into poverty traps that hit many of them as they try to get out of poverty and improve themselves?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#E00400","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":891,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The issue of the incentive to work in relation to tax and the social welfare system is something the Deputy has great knowledge of and keen interest in.  I have met him concerning a number of suggestions he has put forward.  My officials are working on those, particularly in relation to the means test.  I was delighted to be able to make some changes to the means test, particularly for carers, in the last budget.  It is in the programme for Government that we are committed to a universal working age payment.  My officials are working on that.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that we should have a system wherein people are incentivised to go back to work if for no other reasons than going to work is good for mental health and helps bring people out of poverty.  The more we can do to get people back into work the better for our society.  We have huge demand in the labour market at the minute.  Pathways to Work will help us in all the different ways we have in that strategy of getting people back into the workforce and giving them the confidence to go back.  For those who have been out of it for some time, it can be daunting.  The Department wants to help people there. <\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the first &euro;100 of the spouse's income from employment being disregarded.  The Department has committed to preparing a paper on options to modify the jobseeker's allowance payment by using Revenue real-time earnings data to adjust payment levels in line with the person's weekly earning to guarantee a basic income floor and ensure that, in all cases, a person's income increases when he or she works.  We can do that and have that real-time contact with Revenue.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the essential needs payment.  The community welfare officers continue to look at the circumstances of each case.  Every case is different and those officers use their discretion when making payments to people in need.  They are not confined and have that discretion.  We have told them to expect people to come in because they are faced with higher fuel costs and such bills.  We encourage people to visit the community welfare officer if they have problems in that area.

One is on exceptional needs, which has been discussed.  That is a more important payment now, given that it is being relied on around high energy costs.  I have raised it with the Minister before.  I cannot understand why we cannot collect the data.  I am not accusing, saying community welfare officers are not doing their job or that there are any issues there, but it would be important to collect the data on the number of people seeking payments under exceptional needs and the numbers that are and are not getting them.  We collect data across the Department of Social Protection on almost everything and I ask the Minister to reconsider that.<\/p> <p>  Typically, those in full-time work over 30 hours per week cannot access exceptional needs payment.  There is an issue there, particularly when it comes to energy costs.  Those who receive the fuel allowance will see a gain in early March, which is welcome.  All others, particularly workers, will not be able to access that support.  Aside from the &euro;200 electricity credit, those workers have no assistance when it comes to heating and do not have assistance through the exceptional needs payment.  Will there be flexibility regarding that element of exceptional needs?<\/p> <p>  I did not realise this came under it and it is not something I have dealt with before but an issue has been raised with me on the deserted wife's benefit and access to fuel allowance.  I know deserted wife's benefit is a closed scheme but someone on that is allowed to earn &euro;120 on top of it and receive the fuel allowance; someone on the State pension can also earn &euro;120 and access the fuel allowance.  There is a difference because someone on the State pension is on a higher amount.  If you are on deserted wife's benefit at about &euro;213, when you earn that &euro;120, it is a lesser amount than those on the State pension who can earn &euro;120.  I have emailed the Minister on the matter.  I know it is not straightforward but I ask that she look at that.  Those on deserted wife's benefit should be able to earn the same amount as those on the State pension and access fuel allowance.  It is an important payment for them and their households.

I know the Minister is committed to ensuring this is as flexible as possible but the reality on the ground is different.  The first thing I would ask her to do as a matter of urgency is to have a remote meeting with every community welfare officer in the country to relay to each and every one of them that they need to be as flexible as possible regarding financial supports for families that are struggling.  The difficulty is that we as Members of the Oireachtas are finding individual cases where people are being denied supports and there is no measure to reflect that in the statistics provided by the Department.  The fact is that if any community welfare officer deviates from the means-tested support, that has to be accounted for separately within the Department.  We are asking for this information to be directly collated and provided to the Oireachtas.  The Minister needs to relay to each community welfare officer in the country that this is being measured.<\/p> <p>  There should be adequate income going into every household.  That is the objective behind the social welfare system.  We can talk all day about whether that is adequate or about anomalies.  The reality, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has noted, is that there are addiction issues in households where there is allegedly sufficient income going into that household.  We have all come across cases of coercive control where there is sufficient income going into the house but the mother and children are not the ones receiving that money.  We see it with regard to domestic abuse.  If the Government is clearly stating that it wants to take a different approach to gender-based violence, it must start with flexibility regarding this payment.  It is not just about a different approach being taken by community welfare officers.  I can give the Minister examples of the very worthwhile system she has put in place regarding the rent allowance scheme for victims of domestic violence where that has been denied by community welfare officers because they were not aware of the scheme.  If they are not aware of the something very basic like that, my concern is that some of them will not be aware of the comments the Minister is making about the flexible approach that should be taken with exceptional needs payments.<\/p> <p>  We need community welfare officers to go back out into local communities.  It is pointless to expect a family with no access to money to do a round trip of between 50 and 80 miles to get to a community welfare officer - they do not have the money to put petrol in the car to get there in the first place.  If there are issues relating to coercive control, a person will not have access to the information to fill out the six-page form.  That person may not have access to a phone to make that call in the first place.  Community welfare officers need to take a far more flexible approach.  I ask the Minister to have a remote meeting with every community welfare officer in the country before the end of this month and clearly convey to them her priority and that of Government and every Member of the Oireachtas.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#G00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":896,"content":"<p>Can I be very clear here?

I have no choice but to have an open and competitive procurement process for employment services and my Department must comply with its legal obligations.  We are procuring a new local area employment service in two distinct phases.  Phase 1 is the process for procuring new employment services and involves seven counties in the midlands and the north west without a local employment service.  Contracts were signed last December and services are in the process of being mobilised.  Phase 2 has commenced.  We published the request for tender in December.  It involves 17 lots covering 19 counties.  The closing date for tenders is 21 March.<\/p><p>That provides additional time for organisations to work collaboratively together.  Services for this phase are due to begin in July 2022.  The evaluation of bids for both phases is based on the quality of service offered and an organisation's ability to work with a range of local partners and stakeholder networks in the best interest of their clients.<\/p><p> I am aware of media reports referring to the potential involvement of certain multinational companies.  Obviously, I cannot comment on potential bids in what is a live procurement process.  However, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that 80% of the award criteria marks in the local employment service requests for tender are dependent on the quality of the service, community linkages, and impact on social value.  I am confident community-based providers who work collaboratively and submit high-quality competitive bids will be in a strong competitive position to secure a contract under phase 2.  This \"quality first\" approach will ensure that, as we expand employment services throughout the State, we retain a focus on providing the best possible service to the long-term unemployed.  Our priority is to provide the service to the customer.<\/p><p> I know some people are concerned that there will be a loss of community focus.  That is not my intention nor my Department's intention.  I instructed my officials that these employment services must have a strong local focus, and this will be evaluated as part of the tender evaluation process.  I am pleased the RFT reflected these instructions.  I wanted to make sure that community focus was there.  I have responsibility for all communities across the State.  Currently, there are no local employment services in 14 counties and only partial coverage in some of the other counties, such as Galway and Wicklow.  By summertime, I expect all 26 counties to have an appropriate service for the long-term unemployed.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I hope I answered all the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#G00600","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":901,"content":"<p>I refer to the community employment scheme, the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s.  It is, of course, welcome to see increases in expenditure for 2022 across the board.  They are very important.  A commitment was made late last year when the changes to the community employment scheme, CES, and rural social scheme, RSS, were announced, one of which was a significant increase in referrals.  I understand the Department will look at how it can ramp up referrals across those three important schemes, which are particularly important in rural areas for rural services.  I understand a review of the rural social scheme is to take place this year.  I would like an update on that because it is very important.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has been out on the ground and has met with people - I have seen that myself online - and that is important.  Many of the tweaks and changes that are needed particularly in regard to the RSS and T&uacute;s could be made by simply engaging with the co-ordinators and the supervisors without a long drawn-out review.  I appreciate the RSS will be reviewed.  That needs to be done in a timely manner.  I ask that an update be given on that.<\/p> <p>  I raised the issue of the referrals many times.  The last time I raised this, there were 1,900 community employment scheme vacancies online.  I am looking at the details online now and they state there are 2,967 community employment scheme places available.  This referrals issue is at crisis point when there nearly 3,000 CE vacancies.  This needs to be looked at.  Further to what was announced on referrals, will the Minister give an update on how that will work and how they will be significantly raised, because this is urgent?  She knows the jobs that are advertised for the community employment scheme and how important they are to services, in particular, in our communities.<\/p> <p>  As to the six-year rule, the impact of that has not been seen yet, but there will be an impact.  I know this issue has also been raised with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, by those on the ground.  It is an issue that needs to be looked at.<\/p> <p>  My position on local employment services and jobs clubs is well known.  I want to make the following point because the Minister and others have repeatedly said the legal advice leaves them with no choice.  That is fine.  If we take that as being read, that is fine.  But there was no legal advice on changing the model, and that is the problem.  I do not care about how it is procured or that it was necessary.  The model was a community-based not-for-profit model.  If there were issues in some local employment services or jobs clubs, and they were not meeting the targets they should have been meeting, that could have been looked at.  They could have been spoken to and changes could have been made.<\/p> <p>  There was a commitment in the programme for Government to extend the job activation, including local employment services, and that could have been done without totally changing the model.  We have seen what happens when profit is involved and private companies come in.  We have seen it with JobPath, with a success rate of 6.8% as regards people gaining employment that lasts for one year.  That has been at a massive cost, more than &euro;250 million of taxpayers' money, for a success rate of 6.8%.  It makes no sense.  I know companies like JobPath are and will be procuring for these new services, and I would love to see their community linkages.  As I said before, what is happening is a big mistake.  I believe we will look back on it and wish we had done it differently.<\/p> <p>  I refer to redundancy for people in jobs clubs and local employment services who do not want to move to the private for-profit model.  Some of them have given 20 to 25 years of service and they deserve better than the redundancy available through the State.  I ask the Minister to look at this.  These people have given so much to their communities over many years and they deserve better as regards redundancy if they decide to leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#H00200","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":902,"content":"<p>I will ask the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to deal with the CES, T&uacute;s and RSS.  As to JobPath, some 324,000 customers have engaged with the service.  The average cost per participant is &euro;873, excluding VAT.  A total of 69,000 people found full-time employment.  The fees are paid when an individual gains and sustains employment.  The local employment service request for tender is a completely different contract.  It is totally different to JobPath.<\/p> <p>  I know some people do not like the JobPath model.  I have spoken to our advisors on the Labour Market Advisory Council and they have said that JobPath works.  In a recent report by the OECD, in January 2022, it reiterated the point that JobPath led to a higher employment and earning outcomes for those who engaged with the service.  We are not going to agree on everything.  This is one area in which we believe we get results.  It is important to help people get back into the workplace, more so now than ever.<\/p> <p>  The Department has undertaken extensive reviews of the JobPath service.  It has been the subject of independent customer reviews, and econometric reviews and analysis by the OECD and the Comptroller and Auditor General, and it was consistently found to perform at a high level.  However, I continue to review all our employment service provisions, including JobPath.  As the Deputy knows, JobPath services finish at the end of June.<\/p> <p>  The legal advice was clear in that we had to put the local employment services out to tender through public procurement.  I did not have a choice; I had to do that.  We have engaged extensively with stakeholders during that period.  The request for tenders has been made at this stage, therefore, I cannot say any more on that.  I will hand over to the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, who will speak about the community employment schemes and T&uacute;s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#H00300","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":903,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kerrane for her questions.  On the initial question on community employment scheme vacancies and referrals, it is probably worth reiterating the changes that were made just before Christmas because they have made a very significant impact.  The CE baseline year was increased from 2007 to 2014.  That baseline will be maintained at seven years behind the current year into the future.  That will have a significant impact on people&rsquo;s ability to stay on CE schemes if they so wish.<\/p> <p>  The service support stream has also been expanded significantly.  When people turn 60 rather than 62, they can continue on a CE scheme until State pension age.  There was previously a cap on that number which we have also removed.  These two changes will certainly remove the worry of many regarding CE schemes nationally.  In addition, for a transitionary period, we have provided that in exceptional circumstances, where a CE vacancy is on the horizon and it is proving difficult to find a replacement, and for a temporary period the person can stay on the placement if he or she so wishes.  That is particularly important for key essential services in which CE schemes are involved.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to a number of vacancies.  It is important to keep in the mix that if we compare the current number of CE participants with the number in pre-Covid times, they are very similar.  Many of the vacancy numbers the Deputy cited are connected to the fact that we introduced 3,000 additional places as part of the July jobs stimulus package.  Some of these have been filled.  On referral rates, the activation service ramped up significantly in the autumn of last year.  Referral rates shot up in September and October.  The number of CE referrals at the end of January was 2,896, which is significant, although obviously not all of them are accepted.  We would like to see a higher level of acceptance among the CE referrals we make as part of the changes, acknowledging also that they need to be appropriate referrals.  <\/p> <p>  While the position has stabilised now in respect of CE numbers, it should be noted that there will be a large number of exits in the 12-month period from April this year until May next year.<\/p> <p>  The rural social scheme is a fantastic scheme.  I have visited a number of projects on the ground in the past number of weeks.  It has great potential.  I was in the Mayo area last week looking at how the scheme can also actually play a significant role in the Government&rsquo;s commitments on the protection of biodiversity, climate action and environmental protection.  There were some significant changes in that regard in the budget.  To qualify for the rural social scheme, applicants need to be on the farm assist payment.  We have opened up a range of other agri-environment schemes that will allow for a greater income disregard in the qualifications for the farm assist payment.  If, for example, farmers are interested or involved in the agri-forestry scheme, the ash dieback scheme or other approved schemes, and a range of other schemes, the income disregard will be increased if they apply for the farm assist payment.  That should open up the scheme.  <\/p> <p>  With that in mind, we have allocated an additional budget for a potential increase in the number of applications for farm assist payments.  Consequently, as I have said, these changes will not come into force until June.  We will not initiate a review process until we see what the impact of those changes will be.  From my point of view, I am considering what a review might look like.  I will also look at the opportunities for rural social schemes as they a play key role, particularly in some of the rural counties.<\/p> <p>  We have regular operational reform meetings which the Minister and I attend to get feedback from the ground on issues with community employment schemes, T&uacute;s and the RSS.  The next meeting will be held in the coming weeks.  We keep abreast of the issues that regularly arise in the programmes on the ground and also make on-site visits.<\/p> <p>  I believe I have addressed the majority of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.

It has been well made by Deputies Carey and Kerrane and I broadly agree with them.  I have the same concern that we are marketising social services.  I fully accept and take the Minister at her word on the legal advice she received but this is a concern for the future.  It is welcome that this committee has taken an ongoing watching brief in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kerrane beat me to the RSS issue as well.  One thing that jumped out at me, which the Minister of State mentioned, is the ecological services the scheme can provide.  One of the other measures listed is energy conservation work for older people and those at risk of poverty.  That especially jumped out at me given the retrofitting announcement made during the week, in particular, with regard to smaller interventions that are now 80% grant-aided.  These include measures such as attic insulation, which might not require the same level of qualification as is required to do a full deep retrofit.  I know that sourcing contractors for that kind of small-scale work will be one of the challenges facing the retrofitting scheme.  It jumped out at me, therefore, that this is an opportunity.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, will comment.<\/p> <p>  On the back to education allowance, it is very welcome that funding is close to doubling.  Will the Minister provide more detail on where the people availing of the allowance are going?  What courses are they attending and what is the planned outcome from those courses?  Are we taking an active role in directing people towards specific courses or are we taking the view that all back to education is good?  There is probably a middle ground to be found in that respect.  We know there are skills shortages in particular areas.  It would be interesting to see the Department directing people towards courses where we know those skills shortages are.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister to comment briefly on the work placement experience programme, which was announced as part of the July jobs stimulus package.  It is a very welcome move.  Is it receiving the level of employer interest we need to ensure take-up of the programme?  Have safeguards been put in place to ensure we do not undercut the pay and conditions of other staff through the workplace experience programme?  Do we have the necessary safeguarding in place?

I will give some further reassurances on the local area employment services.  I hear the Deputies comments and I am taking them on board.  We have been down this road a few times and the legal advice from the Attorney General is very clear.  These services have to go to tender.  In the first phase, community organisations won out in two of the three areas i which they submitted bids.  That shows clearly that community organisations can win these contracts.  As the Deputies will know, the requests for tenders for phase 2 were published in December.  Following feedback from the sector, a number of changes were made in the requests for tender, including increasing the marks awarded for quality to 80% and reducing the cost to 20% from 25% in phase 1.  There is also a minimum cost component in the request for tender below which no bids are accepted.  This dilutes the significance of the cost element in the request for tender.  We have now done that.<\/p> <p>  The tender for phase 2 also contains significant increases in the minimum annual referral numbers.  These are all issues that members have raised with me.  The requirements for reference contracts and minimum turnover have also been reduced.  The number of lots has been increased under phase 2 based on feedback.  Between phase 1 and phase 2, the total number of lots is now 21.  The lots and the geographic areas are now much smaller, with many of them mirroring D&aacute;il constituencies or the areas covered by education and training boards, ETBs.  For example, we have Cavan-Monaghan, Louth-Meath and Carlow-Kilkenny.<\/p><p>It is no longer a regional service, which is why it is now called the local area employment service.<\/p><p> The Department has also extended the period for parties to make a submission to the request for tender.  The deadline is 29 March.  This was done at was at the request of stakeholders to give them additional time to work collaboratively on submitting joint bids.  Many in the sector have welcomed these changes.  In my opinion, the existing providers are in an excellent position to bid successfully for the new local area employment service.  As I said, 80% of evaluation marks will be awarded based on quality community linkages and social value.  I know there are concerns and I reassure Deputies that I have taken them on board and incorporated many of them in phase 2.  <\/p><p> There was a question on the workplace experience programme.  Covid meant the take-up of the programme was not as great as we had expected.  Obviously, many sectors were just trying to keep going during Covid and did not take up the offer.  I had intended to hold road shows around the country to create awareness so that employers and people looking for work could be connected.  We anticipate that participation in the programme will continue to increase over the coming months.  Public sector bodies will be invited to support the programme.<\/p><p> The Department commenced a public information campaign designed to inform employers, business owners and jobseekers about the work placement experience programme.  I intend to go around the country and I would be happy for Deputies to join me at any of the events we will hold, if I am in their area, to raise awareness.  We want to connect people who are looking for work with those who want workers.  There are different incentives both to employers and those who are currently on jobseeker's payments who will get extra money for availing of these programmes.  I would like to think there will be a keen interest in that in the coming months.  I think I have covered all the questions.

There is certainly potential for the RSS to be involved in community-based retrofitting projects.  It needs that community-based link.

There were to be four ETB centres of excellence in retrofitting around the country.  I think they are all established now.  Some of the retrofitting proposed in the Government's plan published last week is shallow retrofitting.  People can be trained in that in relatively short courses.  There is potential for community employment participants to take retrofitting courses that can be undertaken in a relatively short period and ultimately go into employment, which is a big aim of community employment schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#K00200","speaker":"1563"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":908,"content":"<p>I did not answer the question on the back to education scheme, so I will do so now if I may.  The back to education allowance scheme is a second chance education support for jobseekers and people currently in receipt of the qualifying social welfare payments to undertake full-time second or third level education courses and retain access to the welfare payment.  The scheme's main objective is to raise the education and skill levels of the unemployed individuals to help them to progress from unemployment to employment.  The qualifying period for the second level option is three months and the qualifying period for third level courses is nine months prior to the date of the commencement of the course.  We have waived that period for those in receipt of the PUP who can avail of the back to education scheme to commence a new course of education.  Unlike existing social welfare recipients, no qualifying period is required.  They can go straight in and apply for a back to education payment.<\/p> <p>  The Department had a provision of &euro;96.5 million for 2021.  That has been increased to &euro;105.4 million for 2022.  This represents a considerable investment in supporting participants to acquire the necessary education and skills to re-enter the labour market.  The total number of scheme recipients, as at 31 December 2021, was 5,545.

The other issue is the privatisation of fundamental services.  I have serious concerns about that trend over the last 20 or 30 years.<\/p> <p>  I have been on a hobby horse for a long time.  I still find we are up against the same reluctance to change based on old attitudes and for no rational reason.  I really welcome the changes in community employment and the easing of conditions around staying on the schemes.  However, I still cannot get my head around how, on a big policy issue, the State believes it has to ration the right of people who are unemployed and getting a payment to make a contribution to the State through the provision of services.<\/p> <p>  Let us start with the RSS.  Only about 5,000 farmers are on RSS.  I cannot understand why all those who wish to go on the RSS cannot be accommodated.  We could not get a tsunami of applications.  That would not happen because some farmers are on farm assist and will not go on the RSS for whatever reason.  Instead, we went backwards.  At least, when people went on the scheme previously, they could stay on it because it is not an activation scheme.  Now there is a six-year cap, which I know was introduced before the Minister's time.<\/p> <p>  I have no doubt that if we were to create useful occupation for everybody who is eligible - I am obviously talking about eligible people - the advantages would outweigh any cost.  The cost is the difference between people being on the scheme and getting a little extra in wage and supervision costs etc. and paying them out money on the basis that they do not actively engage in part-time employment, on penalty of very serious means tests.  That is the cost.  It is quite modest.  I think the cost was calculated for T&uacute;s, which is a cheaper scheme than community employment, at about &euro;5,000 per participant per annum.  What is the upside?  Let us look first at the health service.<\/p><p>It is well recognised in the Department - very good evidence is available on the matter - that people who are forcibly unemployed suffer much higher morbidity and mortality, go to the doctor more often and take more medicines.  More importantly, however, there is also evidence that when people get employment there is a 99% improvement in the medical conditions they have that are caused by forced idleness.  We all know the social cost of forced idleness to the Department, but the problem lies probably in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, where there is a deeply inset mindset that it would be just too radical by half to suggest that it would be much better if everybody on jobseeker's allowance long term, that is, for over a year, in other words those eligible for a scheme, were able to engage for a very modest amount of money, if they so wished, in providing services in their communities.  It is a matter of measuring up the invisible costs in health, well-being and family issues.  For example, we know that people who are unemployed smoke more cigarettes.  That is a health issue.  Then there are all the other issues when people are cooped up with no money.  It is a matter of weighing all those invisible costs, which are nonetheless huge costs on society.  We are also damaging people's well-being, all because we somehow cannot find the money, even though there are useful things that could be done in the community to improve community life.  I do not believe it would cost any money in net terms if those things were done.<\/p><p> We need to start thinking big, breaking down the walls that have been there for a long time.  One of the reasons the rural social scheme got transferred into the Department with responsibility for social welfare is a syndrome the Minister of State is probably aware of.  He knows what happens when one Department goes for money.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will look at the cost to that Department.  However, when schemes come under two different Departments, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform never looks at the saving to be made to the other Department.  Then there is bailiwicking between the Departments.  Therefore, the reason all these schemes got transferred into one Department in 2010 was that at least there is a stop to the internecine strife between Departments, as if they were defending some great empire they had protected against another empire, that being another Department, when that was all meant to be subject to one Government.  The Minister of State knows this and has seen the system fight like tigers to preserve what little they have to preserve.<\/p><p> There is a reason the rural social scheme comes under one Department.  Previously, there was not that problem because there was only a transfer between two subheads.  In the case of the Minister of State's Department, all that would happen if enough scheme places were created for those who wanted them - I am not talking about workfare; I am talking about those who want places on the scheme - would be that the Department would have to take some money out of its jobseeker's allowance budget, put it into the community schemes budget, which is what we are debating now, and come up with a little extra money.  That would save on health costs, well-being costs and social welfare costs under other headings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#K00400","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":911,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy's questions and commentary, I wish to explain first that there are 2,959 RSS placements at the moment.  We have almost 400 vacancies on the scheme.  We will look at the six-year cap as part of the review.  The RSS is an optional scheme.  It is important to say again that we have more places than we can fill at the moment.  I am interested in seeing how we can broaden out the scheme and get more people involved because, from my knowledge of it to date, it is an income support measure as well as very much a social inclusion and community development measure.  It has real, positive impacts on people's lives, particularly in isolated rural communities.  They have the opportunity to get involved in group work and community work in the community and engage with communities where social isolation is a big problem.  My understanding of the rural social scheme is that if one is part-time farming, that is, underemployed in farming, the scheme will facilitate community work as well.  I do not necessarily see this as being penalised for doing additional part-time work because my understanding is that most participants will have some part-time work on the farm and then will do other part-time work in the community under the rural social scheme.  However, I take the Deputy's broader points about the health, well-being and family issues on which engagement in schemes like this can have a positive impact.

I am not surprised the Department is finding it hard to get people onto the rural social scheme at the moment.  A change was made when the six-year cap was brought in.  That cap, judging from what the Minister of State says, is now totally unnecessary because the Department does not have an over-demand for places, which was the argument in favour of the cap, that is, to create churn.  However, it also created uncertainty for people in their lives.<\/p> <p>  The reason there is no demand for the scheme is quite simple.  Initially, when one went on the scheme, as long as one qualified one got the payment because one was doing 19 and a half hours' work.  One got the full basic rate for oneself, for one's partner if one had a partner and if he or she was a dependent adult, and for the children.  Then the Department changed the scheme.  This affects people with partners; it does not affect single people.<\/p> <p>  The Department told people they would get the basic rate of &euro;203.  If, however, one has a dependent adult or a dependent child, the only benefit of going on the scheme is the top-up of payment of something over &euro;20 a week.  So people on the scheme do 19 and a half hours' work for a &euro;20 payment.  When they take up employment, even on this scheme, the Department claws the whole thing back off them.  If they earn &euro;100 a week on their farm, which is not a huge farm income, the Department effectively takes &euro;80 off the payment.  That is all it pays them, net.<\/p> <p>  Who is going to work 19 and a half hours a week for &euro;20?  There was a huge demand for the scheme before that because these are farmers who, no matter what they do with their land, will never be independent of some other off-farm income.  That is just a fact.  Before that, once people qualified, they got the full payment for the 19 and a half hours and got free of the means test that bedevilled them under the farm assist in respect of the claw-back of 70%.  I suggest that the Minister gets out the rules as they were originally written and the changes that were made and looks at them.  I think that was in 2016.  I will sit down with him anytime and go through that with him - because the first rules did not happen by coincidence or chance - and I think he will see that it is totally unattractive to go onto the RSS if one has a partner or dependent children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#L00300","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":913,"content":"<p>It is an opportune time to make these points.

With the discretion of the committee, I will come in before other members because I have to go into the D&aacute;il in a few minutes to speak about people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise two issues with the Minister.  The first is one I raised during the passage of the social protection legislation before Christmas and relates to the half-rate carer's allowance, specifically people who are in receipt of the State contributory pension and who receive the half-rate carer's allowance.<\/p><p>They are denied access to the fuel allowance scheme.<\/p><p> There is an anomaly within the social welfare code that discriminates against that cohort of people.  If that person was in receipt of a non-contributory State pension, along with the half-rate carer's allowance, he or she would receive the fuel allowance.  Even though these people's only income is from the State, since it happens to be a State contributory pension, they are denied access to the fuel allowance because the half-rate carer's allowance is, bizarrely, considered additional income.  The Minister gave a commitment in December that she would look at this anomaly.  Will she provide an update to the committee on that?<\/p><p> I flagged the issue of long Covid with the Minister's officials in advance.  We are talking about the enhanced illness benefit payment for people who are diagnosed with Covid.  The Oireachtas Library &amp;amp; Research Service produced a paper, which I commissioned, that has indicated there are 114,500 people in Ireland today with long Covid and rising.  This has a huge potential cost to the Minister's Department with regard to illness benefit and disability allowance claims, as well as an impact on workforce participation.<\/p><p> Long Covid has a disproportionate impact on women and people in their middle age.  We know, historically, that it is much harder to integrate people from those cohorts back in to the workforce after prolonged periods of absence from employment.  Based on figures the Minister's Department provided to me through a reply to parliamentary question, in September 2021, 767 people who had Covid for in excess of ten weeks, that is, people who had Covid symptoms for a considerable period of time, were in receipt of the enhanced illness benefit payment for an extended period.<\/p><p> Those figures have gone up, in the five months from September until now, to 4,314 receiving that payment on a long-term basis.  In the space of five months, the people who have been receiving the enhanced illness benefit payment for an extended period has gone up 562%.  That is before we have seen the impact of the Omicron variant, which will have a further significant impact on those claim numbers.  We face an avalanche of claims due to long Covid, even based on the Minister's statistics.<\/p><p> What measures are being taken by the Department to try to manage this to work with that cohort or people and assist them by providing supports and it is hoped, getting them back into work, either on a part-time or full-time basis, as quickly as possible?  If the Minister could address those two issues, I would appreciate it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#L00600","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":917,"content":"<p>The reason we introduced the enhanced illness benefit was to prevent transmission.  We wanted people to stay at home and isolate, rather than go into work.  For that reason, we gave them an enhanced payment, which meant they had financial supports while they were not at work.  That was the primary reason for bringing in the enhanced illness benefit.  In terms of those who are ill beyond ten weeks, the standard illness benefit may be paid for an extended period based on the person's continued eligibility.  This is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.<\/p> <p>  It would be very difficult to pluck out Covid and I understand those who are suffering from it, but there are others who have other illnesses that last beyond ten weeks.  How can one say that Covid is having more of an impact on them than any other illness they may, unfortunately, get?  Some 1% of the enhanced illness benefit claims have reached the ten-week threshold.  We have paid out a significant amount on that and it was right and proper that we did so.  However, just 1% of the claims have reached the ten-week threshold.<\/p> <p>  There are numbers there, but to isolate them and treat them differently to other people who have other long-term illnesses would create an inequity.  That is the position.  Most people who are still recovering from Covid after ten weeks will transfer to the standard illness benefit.  If they do not meet the contribution criteria for this payment, they can apply for disability allowance, subject to a means test.  Some will not be eligible as the usual qualifying conditions were relaxed due to public health concerns.  People with a serious level of ill health where it can be expected to be permanent or to last a long time can apply for invalidity pension, subject to the contribution requirements.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the half-rate carer's and fuel allowances.  I meet carers all the time, both in my constituency and through the carer organisations.  One of my priorities since becoming the Minister for Social Protection is to do whatever I can to support our carers.  The Deputy and I know well the huge work they do.  In budget 2021, as the Deputy is aware, I increased the carer's support grant to &euro;1,850.  It is at its highest level ever.  This year, I increased the weekly carer's allowance payment by &euro;5.<\/p> <p>  Most importantly, I brought in significant changes to the means test.  The Cathaoirleach raised that with me on a number of occasions.  He made some very valid points and I was delighted to be the first Minister in 14 years to do anything about the means test for carer's allowance.  It was something I was very passionate about.  That change means that all carers currently on reduced rate of payment will see their payment increase from next June.  It will also mean that tens of thousands of carers who did not qualify up to this point, due to the income thresholds, will now qualify for the payment.<\/p> <p>  The increase in the income disregard for a couple was also raised with me by the Cathaoirleach.  I wanted to improve on it because I was aware of many cases where a partner, usually a mother, might have to give her job up to care for a sick child.  However, because the husband was working or they had some savings, they did not qualify.  As a result of these changes I am making, a couple can earn up to &euro;750 per week and the first &euro;50,000 in savings will not be counted in the means test.  The family carers have welcomed that.<\/p> <p>  The Cathaoirleach asked about the half-rate carer's allowance and the fuel allowance.  We are working on a report on those.  As soon as we get that finished, we will publish it and lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is important to note that since 2013, the payment of half-rate carer's allowance does not automatically preclude a person from qualifying for fuel allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a qualifying, non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer's allowance, they are deemed to satisfy the means test and the fuel allowance is payable, subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.<\/p> <p>  If a person is in receipt of a qualifying contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer's allowance, the value of the half-rate carer's allowance will be assessed in the means test for fuel allowance.  Half-rate carer's allowance, which is the same as &euro;131 for anybody aged 66 or over, is paid in addition to many social welfare payments at a rate significantly more than the weekly rate of the fuel allowance, which is payable at &euro;33.  However, I am committed to looking at this.  A report is being drawn up on it and when I get that report, it will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#M00200","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":918,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response and while I will not dwell on the other issue, I will make the point again.<\/p><p>In the past five months, there has been a 562% increase in long-term claimants as a result of long Covid.

She spoke about Covid demonstrating how flexible the social protection system can be.  I wish to raise one issue concerning those on illness benefit accessing the fuel allowance.  We know it is not a qualifying payment.  I will give an example of a gentleman who was in touch with me, who has a terminal illness.  He is on illness benefit.  I know he can go on to a longer term payment and then qualify for the fuel allowance, but rather than putting that on him, I am wondering about flexibility within the system.  I know that for a lot of these payments it is very black and white, but is it possible for sections within the Department to consider giving the fuel allowance to recipients of illness benefit where they are terminally ill?  I know it is difficult to pick between one illness and another for people who are on illness benefit because it varies so much but where the illness is terminal, would recipients be able to access the fuel allowance?  Is there any flexibility in regard to that or could it be looked at?<\/p> <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of accessing illness benefit for people who are in receipt of a widow's pension and are working.  They are working and paying PRSI.  I have two cases of women - it is typically women - with children who got Covid, and they could not get the Covid illness benefit payment, or any illness benefit.  They are widows and they are entitled to their widow's pension given the circumstances, but they are working and paying PRSI, and I do not think they should be locked out of illness benefit, which is a short-term payment.  There are not many such cases, but in a case I had where a woman with young children got sick with Covid, she could not get the payment.  I have raised this with the Minister previously, but I ask her again.  They have an entitlement to a widow's pension, which is right and proper, but they should not be locked out of something like illness benefit.  I do not think it would cost a lot of money as it would only arise in certain cases.  I want to raise that with the Minister again.<\/p> <p>  I previously raised the new basic income pilot scheme for artists with the Minister.  I appreciate that it is a matter for the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, but the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has an input in terms of those artists who are in receipt of a disability allowance or the blind pension.  If they choose to move on to the income support, they should not lose their disability allowance or blind pension.  However, we are going to put them in a very difficult position if they cannot sign up to the new pilot scheme, as artists, because they are afraid of losing their disability allowance or blind pension.  This needs to be worked out while the scheme is being developed rather than having it arise when the scheme is up and running and people with disabilities are locked out of it.  That would not be fair or proper.  In fact, it would be discriminatory.  It is being put the to the Minister now and I have raised it with her previously.  I am sure others have also raised it.  We must make sure that the new pilot scheme for artists is open to those artists in receipt of disability allowance and that they do not lose the likes of a medical card, a place on a social housing list or a disability allowance or blind pension, in the case of the payments for which the Minister is responsible.  We must make sure that is in place for the pilot scheme before it is rolled out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#N00200","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":921,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised a number of issues.  Work is ongoing on the disability allowance, the blind pension and the basic income for artists.  There is a principle in social protection, and this applies to the widow's pension and illness benefit.  The principle is that a person gets one payment.  Our job in the Department is always to keep people out of poverty and to provide supports when they need it.  We do not pay two supports.  During the pandemic, retired people who were receiving a pension could not get the PUP, even though they were working.  The principle on which that is based is that we do not give two social welfare payments.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kerrane raised the case of a person who is terminally ill seeking the fuel allowance.

The scheme the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media is examining now is an enhanced one and my Department is happy to work with her to see how we can help artists that contribute significantly to society and to our culture and identity.

It reminds me of the day I asked someone about somebody that we knew.  He said: \"The kind of guy he is, if you were down in a hole, he would pull you out, but if you went up a ladder, you were getting above yourself and he would pull you down.\"  The Department of Social Protection seems to work on that principle.  There is no question that if you are down in a hole, it will pull you out, but if you start climbing the ladder, it will pull you down pretty fast as well.  There is that type of attitude there and we must move on from it.  Despite what some people believe, people who are dependent on social welfare have very constrained lives generally.  If you are totally dependent on social welfare, you live under a lot of rules and it is fairly constrained income.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on disability.  I am trying to focus today on high-level questions because it is important that we start thinking deeply about the architecture of the system we have.  The Minister is familiar with the partial capacity scheme.  That introduced a new idea; that we differentiate between people with a profound disability, a severe disability, a moderate disability and a mild disability.  The idea was that we would be a bit more generous to those at the profound end of the scale.  In that case, it relates to invalidity pension and disability allowance, and a person can go to work and keep the payment.  One of the big challenges we face is that the cost of disability is never taken into account.  For people with profound or severe disabilities, or what the Department would term moderate disabilities, there is an increasing scale of costs as we go up the ladder.  I know there were tentative ideas in the Department at one stage about creating a tiered scale of disability and invalidity payments that would pay more to people in the profound band and slightly less to those in the subsequent bands, and that those in the mild band would get the basic income that is currently available.  A person would get more for a moderate disability, more again for a severe disability and more again for a profound disability.<\/p><p>This would be a very humane response to disability.  It would stop the issue that worries the Department whereby if it increases the disability rate much above the unemployment payments, there might be migration.  They would not get that extra bit over and above what is available now unless they had a moderate, severe or profound disability.  Is there high-level policy debate in the Department looking at this issue and thinking about it?<\/p><p> This morning I received an email from somebody who makes a valid point.  It was from somebody who has a child with multiple disabilities.  This case involves a husband who is working and a wife who is a full-time carer getting carer's allowance.  At present there are enormous energy costs involved with all the equipment the child is on constantly.  The family is over the threshold.  This means no matter how severe the disability is and how much it costs to care for the child, the family receives the standard rate of payment.  The family has too high an income to receive an essential payment for increased energy costs.  I do not know how much the husband earns at present but let us say it is &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000.  For people who must pay a mortgage such an income means they are still in fairly constrained circumstances.  We need to look at the situation of the cost of disability on a graded basis.  Are there high-level talks about reform of this system rather than just tinkering at the edges?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#N00600","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":926,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy.  On 7 December we published a report on the cost of disability carried out by Indecon.  I brought the report to Cabinet.  We have referred it to the national disability inclusion strategy steering group, which is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  This group is responsible for monitoring the key framework for policy and action to address the needs of people with disabilities in Ireland.  The group will consider the actions and what the Government needs to do.  This needs to be across government.  We also need to look at other issues such as housing, health, education and transport costs.  There are a number of areas.  It is clear we have to find the right response to all of the issues.  The report that Indecon has prepared is very comprehensive.  It looked at all of the aspects of disability.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right when he says that at present there is a flat-rate disability payment of &euro;280 regardless of whether people have a mild, moderate or profound disability.  From a social protection perspective, one of the recommendations in the report is a payment linked to disability.  Some people with a mild disability could do some work.  Other people who have a profound disability cannot work.  We need to look at issues such as whether the payment should be graduated.<\/p> <p>  Good work is being done on trying to help people with disabilities to get into the workforce.  We have the Ability programme, which is EU funded.  It was due to end last year.  I met those involved in the programme and heard first-hand from them the very good work they do on the ground in helping younger and older people have an opportunity to make a contribution to society in many different ways and get back into work in whatever form or career they want to pursue.  We were able to allocate money from the Dormant Accounts Fund to keep the programme going.  It really is a good programme.  We also have EmployAbility in the Department.  It helps people with one-to-one contact and connection between an employer and employee.  It works very well.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point.  I am on the same page as him.  The Government and the Cabinet are committed to dealing with this issue to improve the situation of those with disabilities.

The issue of auto-enrolment is at an advanced stage.  I have brought proposals to a Cabinet subcommittee and I intend to bring final proposals to the Government very shortly.  As the Deputy knows, the programme for Government commits to introducing a pension automatic enrolment system.  It is a priority for me.  I want to see this introduced.  Only 35% of private sector employees have a pension.  The fear is that when they reach retirement they will have a reduction in living standards.  I will bring proposals to the Government or Cabinet very shortly to finalise the design of the auto-enrolment.<\/p><p>I can give some information on it.  We will seek to gradually deliver an auto-enrolment system based on following principles: a phased roll-out over a decade of the contributions made by workers and employers; matching contributions by both workers and employers; and the State to top up these contributions.  It will not come from the Social Insurance Fund because that is the fund into which workers make PRSI contributions.  There will be an opt-out provision for those who choose to opt out.  Workers will have a range of retirement savings products to choose from and a charges cap will be imposed on pension providers.<\/p><p> My Department has finalised a proposal for Government on the overall design of the scheme and, as I said, I intend to bring that for approval very soon.  Once the final design is agreed, it is intended that the necessary legislative organisation and process structures for implementation will follow over the course of this year and next year.  They were set out in the economic recovery plan in 2021.  That is the plan on the auto-enrolment.  There is no doubt that Covid has delayed it but it is my intention to bring it forward very soon.<\/p><p> We committed in the programme for Government that we would establish an independent expert Commission on Pensions, which is what we did.  It was chaired by Ms Josephine Feehily.  The commission worked very hard for six months, as the Deputy knows.  Its countless meetings produced for Government a very detailed and in-depth report and recommendations.  It was based on a lot of data.  There were economists, academics, pension experts, union representatives, youth representatives and representatives of older people.  I took that report to Government last October.  The joint committee has published its report on the future of pensions.  The Commission on Taxation and Welfare is due to come back with its views by the end of February.  <\/p><p> We will then look at all of this in the round and, through the Cabinet committee on economy recovery and investment, the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, the three party leaders and I will plot a way forward.  The intention is that we will bring a full response and implementation plan to the Commission on Pension's recommendations to Government for approval by the end of March.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are some very difficult decisions to be made and this Government needs to make those decisions.  We need to push on with auto-enrolment and make decisions on the sustainability of the pension system.  The social welfare code is the bedrock of the pension system and we need to look at it.  There are four and a half people working at the minute for every pensioner.  By 2050, there will only be two people working for every one pensioner.  Therefore, the system we have is not sustainable and there is no getting away from that.  It is not a problem unique to Ireland.  Countries all over the world are grappling with the same issue.  As I said, there are some difficult decisions to be made and, as a Government, we will do that.  At the end of the day, the interest of our citizens is our priority in making those decisions and ensuring they are to their benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#O00600","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":932,"content":"<p>One of the problems that the commission faced was that the interface between auto-enrolment and the age that some could access the pension were not interlinked.

In the longer term, the Government can only spend what it brings in.<\/p> <p>  It seems that something that has not been taken into account is that, on one hand, the Minister is saying that people, many of whom will not be fit to work after the age of 66, will come to the age and hit a wall because they will only be in receipt of the working age payment up to age 68, while on the other, the State will be able to fund in the same year money into an auto-enrolment system which, by its nature, will benefit those with a higher income more than those with a lower income, straight out of the Exchequer, as the Minister just said.<\/p> <p>  If she gave me a choice of what to do with the money, the first thing I would do is pay the people aged between 66 and 68 and put a caveat on that.  Then if there was money still in the pot, which has had a finite amount paid into it, it should be put into auto-enrolment.  <\/p> <p>  There is one caveat, but the commission disregarded it completely.  There was the principle of the transition pension.  Perhaps there is an argument for saying that if a person comes to the age of 66 and still earns a lot of money and  continues to work after their 66th birthday, he or she could not claim the contributory pension, as he or she could not with the transition pension long ago.   If a person is earning a few hundred euro per week, let him or her off.  However, if a person is on &euro;50,000, &euro;60,000,  &euro;70,000, &euro;80,000, &euro;100,000 or &euro;200,000, he or she could not claim and I would have no problem with that.  However, funny enough, the commission totally banged that one on the head.  If the Minister came back with a hybrid, I would say that is fair enough.  However, many people will not be able to work after 66 because of mental health issues, burnout issues or physical issues.  <\/p> <p>  These debates are not detached from each other.  As the Minister always reminds us, there is a finite amount of money, and choices have to be made.  We seem to be saying that we giveth 20 years hence with one hand but we taketh with the other hand, and I just do not get it.  That is just my view and I wanted to put that view on the record of the House because there has been some rather ill-informed commentary in some of the media where people have not read what the committee did or why it did it.  We were able to take a wider lens than the commission.  The commission's terms of reference were totally constrained and I accept that it was not within its remit to take some of these issues into account.  However, it is within the remit of Government and the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#P00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":933,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments again.

I accept and know how performance targets are established by the management board to measure performance within the Department, but, as a committee, we have a responsibility to monitor the ongoing spending within the Department on an annual basis.  The most effective tool for us to do that is through the departmental performance targets.  As the Minister is aware, we set out, in our pre-budget submission, issues relating to departmental performance and the need to modernise and update those performance targets.  I accept that the performance targets have been pretty much historic targets from year to year in terms of the number of payments issued, and so forth.  However, the difficulty is that we, as a committee, believe that they do not effectively drive the type of change that we believe is needed in terms of the delivery within the Department.  That is not taking from that fact that we all find, in our day-to-day dealings with the Department, that it is very responsive to the needs to individuals, but I think more can be done to try and improve the processing time for applications.  The difficulty is that when payments are delayed for people, it causes financial hardship.<\/p> <p>  We spoke earlier about the exceptional needs payment.  That is available to some people.  It is not available to others for various reasons.  Nevertheless, it does cause financial hardship for people.  There are mechanisms that can be used to speed up these applications within the confines of the challenges that are there in terms of making sure that there is proper scrutiny of every application.  I will provide the example of the time, previously, when there were ongoing issues with the domiciliary care allowance.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was the Minister in charge at the time.  That application form was radically transformed to facilitate parents of children who were on the autism spectrum.  That made a significant difference in the volume of applications that went for review and subsequently went for appeal at the time.  The committee has highlighted specifically one area in its report, namely, common errors that are made in application forms.  As public representatives, we all know that one of the biggest mistakes that many people make is they fail to sign the application form.  If the Department was to make the public aware of where particular applications fall down on a regular basis in order that they could be addressed by people in advance of submitting their applications, it would help to speed that up.  Again, in terms of when applications are granted on review, there are commonalities in terms of why they are granted on review.  If they were compiled and made available, it would help to streamline the application process.<\/p> <p>  The committee feels that the targets that are there at the moment need to be modernised and updated.  We would like an update from the Minister on that.  If not today, she might come back to us at a later date.  We are also anxious to have a meeting with the senior officials to go through this particular aspect of the programme.  We feel that it can help to improve the operation of the Department and the oversight by senior management of the Department, as well as bringing an extra layer of accountability that is required by this committee and the Oireachtas because of the size of the budget that we are dealing with on a day-to-day basis.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we look at ways of how we can have measurables that drive the type of dynamic change that we need to see happening across the Department of Social Protection.  The committee made reference, for example, to the working family payment.  Earlier today, the committee spoke about the exceptional needs payment.  Again, if the outcomes of applications for non-means-tested exceptional needs payment were compiled, including those that were granted and those that were refused, that would give the committee sight of what is happening with that, and perhaps endorse the approach that has been taken and articulated by the Minister today and address any inadequacies that we, as individual public representatives and Members of the Oireachtas, are identifying across our constituencies.  If the Minister is unable to respond, perhaps she will reflect on the points I have raised.  It is an issue that the committee would like to deal with in more detail with the officials in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#Q00300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":940,"content":"<p>My Department has already implemented a review process whereby performance metrics are formally reviewed on an annual basis and amended as appropriate.  We review our performance on a monthly basis when I meet with the management team.  If there are any issues that Deputies have brought to my attention or I have seen in my own constituency, I certainly raise them.  I have seen many cases where there have perhaps been longer delays or backlogs have developed for whatever reason, and we have redeployed resources as necessary.  I must say that I am very proud to head up a department of social protection that is agile and flexible.  When it comes to redeploying resources in certain areas in order to resolve problems that may arise, they do it quickly.  It is not always the case across Government that there is that level of agility and responding so quickly to the demands of the customers.  Ours is a very customer-based Department, where the needs of our clients and people come first.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned the issue of appeals.  We recently appointed two deputy chief appeals officers.  I passed legislation to do that.  We have the chief appeals officer and two deputies now.  The legislation is such that the chief appeals officer determines the decision if the appeal goes up the line.  The chief appeals officer had to do a great deal of work, so we have two new deputy appeals officers in place to help speed that up. <\/p> <p>  The Chairman suggested that the Department highlight the mistakes made in applications.  I know that it does not suit everybody, but if you make your application online, there is less chance that you will make some of those mistakes and the process is probably more streamlined.  In the case of applications for benefits with a medical component, sometimes the information required is not provided in the first application.  We know, from our own offices, that it may be that a person is applying for a benefit that is related to medical condition, and a letter is sent off with the application that is very vague and does not give the details needed.  We send the applicant back to the doctor to get a more detailed letter because when they tell you what is wrong with them, we tell them that it is not included in the letter and a decision cannot be made on the basis of the information included in the letter.   The applicant is asked to supply further information and in the majority of cases, the application is processed.  The Chairman is right that these are the sort of things that we need to tell people.  We must tell them to supply the right information in the first place to speed up the application.<\/p> <p>  The committee has recommended that all social welfare appeals be processed within a 12-week timeframe.  We have that down to a 12.9-week timeframe.  Sometimes things happen.  That is the current average.  Where we find that there are issues that lead to delays, we redeploy resources very quickly.  I think I have covered most of the Chairman's points.  If there is anything else, I am happy to come back to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2022021600002#Q00400","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":941,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response.<\/p><p>I have no doubt we would all agree that the Department of Social Protection has been exemplary in terms of its flexibility and management where issues have arisen, not only during the pandemic but prior to it.  In fairness, as correctly stated by the Minister, when issues are brought to the Department's attention it is very customer-focused in trying to address them.  She is also correct in saying that many of the issues brought forward by Members of the Oireachtas are customer-focused issues.  The difficulty is that we have a responsibility to monitor the spend and to ensure that the targets in terms of policy are delivered.  We cannot do that in terms of the measurables we have visibility of today.  Information on the number of people who are paid a benefit on a weekly or monthly basis provides very little indepth information to us about what is actually going on in the Department in terms of meeting overall policy objectives.  For example, an issue for Government in terms of policy is that of former carers transitioning back into the workforce when they are no longer in receipt of carer's benefit or carer's allowance.  That is a policy objective of Government but there is no measurable there of the number of former carers who are coming off jobseeker's allowance payments.  We all accept that one of the largest cohorts of people in receipt of social welfare payments in terms of poverty is the one-parent family yet there is no measurable in the performance indicators on that.  <\/p><p> An issue that has been brought up consistently by members in committee is the use of employment services to get people back into long-term sustainable employment.  A lot of the criticism of the employment services has been around whether the tender will provide long-term sustainable employment for people.  Again, there is no measurable in that regard.  The point being made by the committee is that we need a broader look in terms of the performance indicators within the Department.  The Minister and Minister of State are answering members' questions today, but the reality is the performance indicators are developed by management.  They are presented here as a key part of our consideration of the Revised Estimate, but it is impossible for us to make a determination based on what is in this performance indicators.  That is why the committee has made its recommendation.  We have asked for direct engagement with the Department on the design of a set of performance indicators that meet the Department's need but also meet the need of this committee and the Oireachtas in terms of scrutiny.  Ultimately, we all want the same thing.  None of us want to see this particular Vote being discussed at the Committee of Public Accounts following a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That ultimately is our primary objective in relation to this.  <\/p><p> I ask that the Minister would reflect on the comments we have made here today.

We all appreciate that.<\/p> <p>  Committee members now have available to us the Lacey report which was published in 2010.

It is important to note that this report was a Government-funded independent review of Ireland's maritime casualty investigation structures and its aim were to address the current organisational structures of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, to set out recommendations and suggestions that we could embody in law to ensure we are fully compliant with our EU obligations and that we would have a robust and properly resourced marine casualty capacity in Ireland.  The committee would like to know why this important report is not in the public domain.  It is essential that we would be privy to it and that it would inform decision-making in this committee and in the wider Houses of the Oireachtas.  I understand that one of the key recommendations in the report, which, as I said, I have not had sight of, is the establishment of a full-time professional unit to investigate marine casualties.  The current structure in Ireland is a part-time investigation board staffed by part-time investigators.  In order to properly provide for marine investigations in Ireland, surely we need to know the full content of the Clinch report and its recommendations.<\/p> <p>  Marine casualty investigation is the very poor relation of air and rail accident investigation in this country.  Taking 2019 as a base year, the air accident investigation unit, which is a full-time unit, had an operational budget of &euro;750,000 and the rail investigation unit, also a full-time unit, had an operational budget of &euro;350,000.  That same year, in which six lives were lost in Irish territorial waters, the part-time Marine Casualty Investigation Board had a paltry budget of just &euro;27,000.  I live in a coastal county where, thankfully, we have not had a major aircraft incident in recent years, although we have had some slight incidents involving aircraft crashing.  We also have not, thankfully, had a rail accident of great significance.  Every year there are lives lost at sea, however.  We need to have a robust investigations board to investigate in that regard.  That does not exist currently.  The report that would identify the shortcomings has not been circulated.<\/p> <p>  Following my contribution, I have to leave this meeting in order to attend another.  Before doing so, I would like to reference the Marine Hazards Limited report, which dealt with the 2016 accident off the coast of Kilkee, County Clare, in which Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas, a Coast Guard volunteer, lost her life.  She was a fantastic woman.  She gave her life trying to rescue and look after others.  There are deficiencies in terms of investigation that need to be of guidance to us as we try to prepare robust legislation.  I would like to pay tribute as, I am sure, would many here today, to Michael Kingston.  We get briefs from Departments and from everywhere and anywhere.  Michael Kingston has been hugely invested in this legislation and in guiding and informing us.  I want to pay tribute to him on the record.<\/p> <p>  It is essential the Clinch report is circulated.  This is not tiddlywinks.  These are lives.  In the context of legislation relating to safety, we need the guiding report, that is, the Clinch report, available to each and every one of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022021600002#C00600","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":967,"content":"<p>Prior to this meeting there was a private meeting of the committee with the Minister at which there was very open debate.  At that meeting, the Minister gave an assurance that he would make a public statement today to confirm that the Clinch report would be published, that the findings and recommendations set out in that report would be implemented with in the lifetime of this Government and that substantial work will be done this year.  It is very disappointing that to date the Clinch report has not been published.  It is with the Department since July 2021.  Work on it began last March.  On foot of a recommendation of this committee, Captain Clinch was asked to compile this report.  What are being cited are legal issues.<\/p> <p>  A series of different reports have recommended a fundamental reform of this area.  The first report was in 1988.  It was followed by the R&oacute;is&iacute;n Lacey report in 2010, of which I and other members of the Oireachtas have received copies.  I received mine in the past number of days.  It is a frightening read in terms of what is being sought by us and people vested in this area.  That report has identified the need for independence, competence and a full-time investigation unit.  The Bill before us does not address any of those issues, which is really disappointing.<\/p> <p>  The committee undertook in-depth pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill last January, during which we heard expert opinion from the maritime lawyer, Mr. Michael Kingston and also from Mr. Ciaran McCarthy.  There is compelling evidence that we are not up to scratch in this country in terms of this area.  Why are we not implementing reports drafted in good faith by people who were employed by the State?  The Clinch report is the third of these reports.  I do not know what we are at.  This committee would be better served if the Clinch report was published.  We should hold off on this legislation and implement the recommendations of the Clinch report.  If we did so, we could then move forward with a substantive Bill.<\/p><p>I take the Minister on good faith.  He said to us at that meeting a couple of weeks ago that he would make a public statement and that he would confirm in the Houses of the Oireachtas that he is determined to publish the Clinch report and implement the recommendations.  I call on him to do that today.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022021600002#C00700","speaker":"1517","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":969,"content":"<p>I thank all three Deputies.  As Deputy Carey said, I am happy to repeat what we said in private session but first it is important that we get this legislation through quickly.  This whole issue is about minimising risk, learning from previous accidents in order that we save lives, but time and speed are of importance.  If we are not quick then we run the risk of not having a proper investigation process that could be required with real urgency.  I am keen that we get this through the D&aacute;il and the Seanad as soon as possible.  As soon as the President's signature is dry on the parchment for a final Act, we will put in place the provisions of this very technical Bill to give us full complement and strength within the existing Marine Casualty Investigation Board and in doing that, comply with European law and regulations.  That is the most important thing we need to do.  Also, we agreed that we will publish, subject to legal sign-off.  We have to follow legal advice.  As the Clinch report was commissioned on the back of the Department's initiative, it is very much in our interest that it would be published and acted on.  I am happy to commit here to doing exactly that.  Central to that, as Deputies Carey, O'Rourke and Cathal Crowe and others have said, is that we look at a new structure and a new system, including the full-time independent investigation unit.  What I said in private session is that we expect the publication of the Clinch report at the end of quarter 1 and that is still the timeline, subject to the Office of the Attorney General and others signing off on it.  What I also said was that this year, we will develop and deliver that wider legislation.

It reflects the private meeting we had.  To provide the level of assurance, because there will be some scepticism from people who follow this closely, who will point to reports from 1998 and 2010 that were clear about the need for a new departure and a change in the direction of travel, as that did not happen.  Whether it is a reflection on the Minister or the Department or the system or whatever it is, that progress was never made.  What greater assurance can the Minister provide to those who are watching this closely that he will deliver on those commitments he has made?  Is there scope for him to bring forward amendments that might, in primary legislation, provide such assurance?  If it is not primary legislation, what other way, outside of his statements here today, can provide assurance to people?  I implore the Minister and the Department to engage with those stakeholders right throughout this process.  As Deputies Carey and Cathal Crowe have said, they have been absolutely expert witnesses and a huge resource and benefit to us as Deputies and as a committee.  I raise that matter of that extra assurance with the Minister.  I can see how people might refer to 1998, 2010 and a Clinch report we have not seen and say that what needs to be happening here should be absolutely black and white but it is not happening.  How can we be assured that what the Minister is saying now will actually come to fruition and that in six months' time we are not told something has come from left field and disrupted everything he has laid out there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022021600002#D01500","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1644969600,"counter":983,"content":"<p>There is a fear that the Minister will not honour what he is saying here.  I am not blaming him but this has happened before, in 1998 and 2010.  Even the Roisin Lacey report has not been published officially.  Perhaps he might give a commitment in regard to that, today.  On Second Stage of this Bill, reference was made by the Minister of State, Deputy Naughten, to that particular piece of work that was asked to be done by the Department but it was never published.  Here we are in 2022 and we have a commitment, and I do not doubt the Minister's commitment, but I would like if he could give us a bit more reassurance and more comfort.  I buy this Clinch report being published by quarter 1, but that is underlined on legal grounds.  I do not know what the issue is, legally.  Maybe the Minister cannot say, but legal issues tend to go on and on.  As this whole issue has not been dealt with over three or four decades, it is high time it was dealt with.  I would like to get some assurance from the Minister today in that regard, and he has given it, but perhaps he could nail it down even further.  I also agree with Deputy O'Rourke on engaging with the stakeholders.  They have been truly magnificent in their efforts, educating the committee in this field and the deficiencies that exist there.  This might be a niche area but it is an incredibly important area.  We are an island nation and we need to have a fit-for-purpose marine casualty investigation unit and sadly, we do not have that.  If we do not properly investigate problems we do not find out what the problem is, and that problem continues to happen, again and again.  That is why we are asking for these assurances.
