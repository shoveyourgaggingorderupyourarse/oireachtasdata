The report provides a comprehensive overview of the area&rsquo;s assets, services, and supports as well as its challenges. <\/p>  <p>  As well as important recommendations related to crime prevention and dismantling gangs, two key recommendations in the report include the need to strengthen community participants and leadership, and the need for more collaborative service delivery.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is currently\u00a0developing a Community Safety Policy which takes a new approach to policing, crime prevention and youth engagement. It echoes many of the elements in\u00a0the\u00a0Darndale\u00a0report, including the importance of strengthening community representation and leadership. Strong community participation in identifying the needs of a community and developing solutions is key.\u00a0 Also central to the new policy is a more collaborative approach to service delivery, as identified in\u00a0the report. Services need to work together to tackle the range of issues that makes a community feel unsafe, which goes beyond the sole remit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This new approach is to be established on a pilot basis ahead of a nationwide rollout as part of 'A Policing Service for our Future', the Government's implementation plan for the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with Dublin City Council and former\u00a0Assistant Garda Commissioner Jack Nolan on the follow up to this report in order to see how we can best support responses in the area.

As of\u00a020 October, design work is complete or on-going in target townlands across 25 counties and steady progress is being made with over 114,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year.  <\/p><p>This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year in Cork. NBI provides a facility for any premises within the AMBER area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. \u00a0<\/p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the \u00a0roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 174 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 55 of theses are now connected \u00a0with \u00a0high speed broadband service \u00a0through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools.\u00a0 Locations in Mayo in areas such as Taugheen, Bofeenaun, Islandeady and Killaser Community Centres were chosen by the Department of Rural and Community Development in conjunction with Mayo County Council and are all installed and connected.\u00a0Other locations installed and awaiting connection include\u00a0Belderrig Community\u00a0and Research Centre and Clare Island Community Centre.\u00a0Further details can be found at\u00a0<i><\/i>.<\/p><p>I understand that there can be instances where premises remain unconnected, although close to premises that are passed by eir&rsquo;s fibre network. Eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions regarding the areas and premises served are made by eir. My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators as to where they build infrastructure and provide services. Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focussed on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts. Where that network ends is where the National Broadband Plan in effect commences to ensure that nobody is left behind. <\/p><p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200088#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200088#WRB02000"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[32210\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200088#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government sets out that, as Ireland moves towards carbon neutrality, it does not make sense to develop LNG terminals that import fracked gas.

The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation.

The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The support will be available to companies and self-employed individuals who carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises.\u00a0 Generally, this refers to Covid restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.<\/p>  <p>  Where, as a result of the restrictions, a company or a self-employed individual is either forced to temporarily close their business, or their business is required to operate at significantly reduced levels, they will qualify for support under the scheme. \u00a0Certain other conditions will apply, including that the person has a tax clearance certificate.<\/p>  <p>  Qualifying businesses will be able to make a claim to Revenue under the CRSS for a cash payment, which will be known as an &ldquo;Advance Credit for Trading Expenses&rdquo; (&ldquo;ACTE&rdquo;). The ACTE will provide an immediate cash support to businesses. The amount of the ACTE will be based on an amount equal to 10% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or in the case of new businesses, the average weekly turnover in 2020) up to &euro;20,000 and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000. <\/p>  <p>  All eligible businesses can claim the support irrespective of their turnover levels, but the amount of the ACTE cannot exceed the lower of the amount based on 10%\/5% of the relevant weekly turnover or &euro;5,000 per week.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Where businesses ordinarily operate from a business premises (generally a building) located in a region for which restrictions are in operation, they may qualify under the scheme provided they meet the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services due to the specific terms of the Covid restrictions announced by Government. <\/p>  <p>  Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as certain musicians, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria.\u00a0 A business that does ordinarily operate from a music or entertainment venue (for example, a company that operates a theatre) located in a region subject to restrictions, and who meets the eligibility criteria, will however be able to claim support under CRSS.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is not sufficient that the trade of a business, such as a travel agency, has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19, or that the business supplies goods or services to another business that qualifies for the support because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close, or significantly reduce, its activity.\u00a0 However, where customers of such a business are prohibited or significantly restricted from accessing the business premises in which the business is ordinarily carried on, as may be the case with travel agents under level 5 of the Plan for Living with Covid-19, the business may qualify for the CRSS.<\/p>  <p>  Support provided under the CRSS will be in the form of a valuable upfront cash payment, enabling eligible businesses to meet costs associated with their business premises, such as rent, insurance and utilities, at a time when, because of the specific terms of the restrictions announced by the Government, they cannot, for a period of time, provide goods or services to their customers or can only do so to a limited extent. The scheme will not apply to a business in the events industry or in other sectors, which does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region subject to the restrictions, but rather supplies goods or services to a business that does qualify for support under CRSS because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close or significantly reduce its activity.\u00a0 Each business must satisfy the eligibility criteria in their own right.<\/p>  <p>  Companies and self-employed workers who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support live entertainment in 2021, and existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). They may also be eligible to warehouse\u00a0VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200089#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200089#WRC01800"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[32208\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200089#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will meet with the representatives of the financial services union regarding a bank (details supplied)","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":121,"content":"<p>I emphasised to\u00a0representatives of Ulster Bank in my meeting yesterday\u00a0that staff, customers and other stakeholders must be informed promptly about any decisions\u00a0made under the ongoing strategic review being undertaken by NatWest, Ulster Bank's parent.

This scheme enables visitors that are resident outside the EU to benefit from VAT relief on goods purchased in Ireland and subsequently taken outside of the EU.\u00a0If the scheme applies to UK visitors post-Brexit without changes UK visitors will be able to buy goods VAT free in Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This could give rise to a considerable displacement of consumer purchases, resulting in significant VAT revenue losses, as purchases by UK visitors in Ireland would not produce any VAT revenues.\u00a0Due to the volume of passenger movements between the UK and Ireland, the volume of refund applications is likely to significantly increase which simultaneously heightens the risk of abuse of the Retail Export Scheme post Brexit.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously advised, the measures in the Bill\u00a0are precautionary and aim both\u00a0to minimise the potential for abuse of the scheme and to reduce the possibility of diversion in retail consumption from Ireland to the UK, post Brexit.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The amended legislation proposed in the General Scheme of the Brexit Omnibus Bill 2020 provides for two elements to restrict the scheme. The first is a new requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.\u00a0 The second is to provide that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in value in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme. This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive. The monetary limit will apply in respect of all third country travellers who apply for a refund under the scheme, post commencement of the relevant sections. <\/p>  <p>  The Ireland\/Northern Ireland Protocol ensures that there will be no VAT Retail Export Scheme between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

This option is therefore not considered to be economically or environmentally sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  - Following the OPW&rsquo;s review of the Flood Analysis Report on Lough Funshinagh, the property-owners who have applied for the Voluntary Homeowners Relocation Scheme will now be advanced through this scheme.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works also understands, however, that there will remain a risk of possible prolonged flooding around the Lough, and have advised that it remains open to Roscommon County Council to make an application under the Minor Works Flood Mitigation Scheme should further measures be identified in the future that meet the scheme criteria to mitigate flooding.<\/p>  <p>  A meeting is to take place shortly between Roscommon County Council and officials in the Office of Public Works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200090#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":175,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200090#WRD02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200090#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[32212\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200090#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if gyms can remain open for individual training under level 4 restrictions as per the Living With Covid-19 Roadmap; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1453","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":176,"content":"<p>The Recovery and Resilience Plan states that in Level 4 gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools must close.

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.\u00a0 In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates of subject percentage marks staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A standardising\u00a0process\u00a0happens every year and\u00a0would\u00a0have happened\u00a0in 2020\u00a0had\u00a0the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.\u00a0\u00a0 In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types. \u00a0The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.\u00a0 This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.\u00a0 Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0overall data\u00a0on\u00a0school estimated marks showed\u00a0that there was a very significant rise\u00a0in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally.\u00a0This\u00a0level\u00a0of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been\u00a0unrealistic.\u00a0For example, based on the school data, there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year it is approximately 5.8%.\u00a0Even with the\u00a0standardisation\u00a0process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. <\/p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects.

To support the delivery of high quality Irish-medium education in Gaeltacht schools, the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme was launched in 2017 as part of the overall implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022. A package of additional targeted supports has been provided to schools in the Scheme since September 2018 including:<\/p>  <p>  - access to an annual grant of\u00a0&euro;1200 grant for the purchase of Irish-medium teaching resources<\/p>  <p>  - additional Irish-language\u00a0support teaching hours based on school enrolment<\/p>  <p>  - additional continuing\u00a0professional development for teachers, delivered by COGG<\/p>  <p>  - additional Inspectorate\u00a0support via advisory visits to support schools in meeting their targets in the implementation of Irish-language-based criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Schools in the Scheme are permitted to form clusters to create temporary full-time posts by combining part-time Irish language support hours. Since 2019, schools in the Scheme have\u00a0 also had the option to combine part-time Irish language support hours with special education teaching hours to create temporary full-time posts, provided that the teachers selected had a high level of proficiency in the Irish language and an understanding of immersion education, so that they could fulfil the roles, as appropriate. The terms of the operation of the Scheme are set out annually in Circulars which are published on the Department&rsquo;s website and disseminated to schools located in Gaeltacht language-planning areas. The most recent Circular relating to the operation of the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme in primary schools located in Gaeltacht areas during the 2020\/21 school year is Circular 0010\/2020. The operation of the Scheme in schools must also take place in accordance with the provisions of Department advice and circulars relating to COVID-19. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200091#WRE04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200091#WRE05000"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[32180\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200091#WRE05100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to previous requests from this Deputy, if she will include the much-needed new primary school for Waterville, County Kerry in the new capital programme; her views on the fact that the existing building is totally unsuitable for modern educational purposes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department is in receipt of an\u00a0application, from the school in question,\u00a0for major capital works comprising of a new school building.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan (NDP), increased funding has been provided for the school sector capital investment programme.\u00a0 This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and also provides for an additional focus on the refurbishment of existing school buildings, starting in the second half of\u00a0 Project Ireland 2040 period.\u00a0The school authority's application will be\u00a0considered under the Project Ireland 2040 capital envelope.\u00a0\u00a0The school authorities were notified of this position by my officials. <\/p>  <p>  Should\u00a0the school authority\u00a0consider that\u00a0it does not have sufficient capacity, in terms of mainstream teaching\u00a0accommodation,\u00a0it is open to them to apply for accommodation under the Additional School Accommodation Scheme, details of which are available on my Department's website www.education.ie.\u00a0The purpose of the ASA scheme is to ensure that essential classroom accommodation is available to cater for pupils enrolled each year and where the need cannot be met by the school&rsquo;s existing accommodation.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200091#WRE05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":263,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200091#WRE05300"},{"type":"question","counter":264,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[32191\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200091#WRE05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the repeat leaving certificate exams will take place; the contingency plans that will come into force if Covid-19 restrictions come into force which preclude the current intended course of action from taking place; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1510","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":265,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission (SEC) has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The SEC is continuing with plans to hold the postponed 2020 Leaving Certificate examinations in November 2020.

It is also the case that prisoners will not always declare their affiliation to certain groupings and it is therefore not possible to\u00a0provide definitive numbers in relation to the number of known members of criminal groupings currently in custody. It should also be noted that more than one criminal gang may group together under the umbrella of a particular group and in some instances some gangs may form splinter groups due to family or in house disputes.<\/p>  <p>  The emergence in recent years of criminal groupings has had significant implications for the management of Irish Prisons. Rivalries and feuds which develop on the outside continue inside the prison. Prison management must ensure that the various factions are kept apart, and as far as possible, that members of criminal groups do not have influence over other inmates in the prisons or criminal activities outside. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service is committed to preventing identified members of criminal groups from conducting criminal activities while in custody and also to prevent them exerting inappropriate influence over other persons. For example,\u00a0certain security initiatives have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison. These initiatives include the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines, as well as\u00a0the gathering and collating of intelligence information on members of criminal\u00a0groups\u00a0in custody, carrying out intelligence led searches and preventing the flow of contraband, including mobile phones, into prisons.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is regular contact between the Irish\u00a0Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss security issues including the operation of criminal groupings. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200093#WRG06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Data","counter":387,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200094#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":388,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[32217\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200094#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the degree to which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have successfully prosecuted drug gangs; the number of unsuccessful prosecutions in the past five years to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":389,"content":"<p>I am awaiting a report from the Courts service and will respond to the Deputy's question when the information is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200094#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Prevention","counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200094#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[32218\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200094#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the degree to which improved legislation has impacted on recidivism; the number of repeated offenders in each crime category in each of the past five years to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":392,"content":"<p>Public safety is an absolute\u00a0priority for me as Minister for Justice and Equality.\u00a0 Working to reduce re-offending and minimise the risk of further harm to victims and society, through the implementation of effective\u00a0evidence-based penal\u00a0policy,\u00a0is a key part of that task.\u00a0However, as\u00a0the Deputy may appreciate, it is\u00a0challenging to relate the impact specific legislation has\u00a0to general re-offending rates as recidivism may be impacted by a number of other\u00a0variables, such as social influences or other external factors. <\/p>  <p>  A new operating model has been implemented in my Department which has\u00a0increased capability in the policy space and will ensure that\u00a0my Department is developing holistic, research-based long-term policy, through research and analysis from multiple sources. It will ensure that we are adopting a proactive and strategic view of justice policy formulation and review, providing &ldquo;best-in-class&rdquo; advice in the long-term interest of all citizens.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to say\u00a0we have some statistical evidence available to suggest that the introduction of initiatives introduced to reduce prison re-offending have contributed to a decline in recidivism. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) use data from the Irish Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop comprehensive prison re-offending indicators. The 3-year re-offending indicator counts prisoners who re-offended within\u00a0three years of release from custody, and who secured a court conviction within a further\u00a0two\u00a0years. The latest reoffending statistics produced by the CSO demonstrate that prison re-offending rate has been in decline from 2011 to 2017. Looking at the three year re-offending rate, 55.2% of prisoners released in 2014 re-offended within three years of release, an 8.6% decrease on re-offending levels of 63.8% for prisoners released in 2011. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will wish to be aware that a number of initiatives were\u00a0introduced over the past decade to reduce reoffending including Community Return and Community Support Schemes and the Joint Agency Response to Crime (J-ARC). Community Return and Community Support Schemes were introduced in 2011 and\u00a0aim to increase support for prisoners prior to their release from prison, upon their release, and then for a period after their release in order to break the cycle of offending; <\/p>  <p>  The Joint Agency Response to Crime (J-ARC) is a multi-agency response to the supervision and rehabilitation of offenders which commenced in 2014. The programme aims to target prolific offenders who are responsible for large amounts of crime. In order to reduce crime and enhance public safety, the selected prolific offenders are managed through the integration of policy and practice between the J-ARC agencies.<\/p>  <p>  An example of the impact of legislation in this area includes the\u00a0Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 which provides that a court shall consider the appropriateness of a community service order in circumstances where a sentence of imprisonment of up to 12 months is being considered. \u00a0There has been a consistent increase in the management of community service orders by the Probation Service over the past three years. In 2019, the Probation Service managed 2,791 Community Service Orders, totalling 379,815 hours work, in lieu of 1,247 years in prison, which equated to\u00a0&euro;3 million of unpaid work.\u00a0 Despite this, the use of short sentences is prevalent with a significant increase in prison committals for persons serving less than\u00a0three months and, more generally, less than 12 months.\u00a0 The impact of this legislation does need to be considered, including in relation to the number of shorter sentences for offences committed by women and the high incidence of women on remand, \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year my\u00a0Department\u00a0launched the findings from an international evidence review on recidivism and policy responses. This research report is the third in a series of releases to be commissioned and disseminated by the Research and Data Analytics unit in my Department, \u00a0was prepared by Prof. Ian O&rsquo;Donnell from the Institute of Criminology and Criminal Justice, School of Law,\u00a0UCD. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0review sought to address a range of questions relating to the\u00a0factors underpinning recidivist and prolific offending behaviour; public policy interventions that tackle recidivism and prolific offending; and the\u00a0effectiveness of these interventions and likelihood of successful transplantation to an Irish context.<\/p>  <p>  Key findings of the report include the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Suspended sentences or community service can be more effective in terms of reducing recidivism than short terms of imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  - Planned and structured early release, including parole, may reduce recidivism.<\/p>  <p>  - Perception of fairness may have an impact on likelihood of recidivism. A perception of procedural unfairness can lead to alienation, resistance and noncompliance whereas a belief that one has been treated fairly may reduce the likelihood of future offending.<\/p>  <p>  - There appears to be a significant treatment effect associated with cognitive behavioural interventions delivered both in community and custodial settings.<\/p>  <p>  The review will constitute a valuable resource for researchers and act as a springboard for future empirical research on best practice in this area and provide a body of evidence essential to inform future policy discussions and development. The full report is available on the website of my Department and\u00a0builds on the Department&rsquo;s commitment, outlined in the 2018-2020 Data and Research Strategy, to support the development of more evidence-informed policy making.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Deputy will understand that\u00a0the\u00a0specific information on the\u00a0number of repeated offenders in each crime category in each of the past five years to date, as requested is not readily available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200094#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200094#WRH00800"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[32219\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200094#WRH00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which it is expected to deploy extra garda&iacute; to all stations nationally in line with the increase in the strength of the force; the way in which this is likely to manifest itself in areas of expanding population; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":395,"content":"<p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been allocated an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion for 2021.\u00a0 This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff. \u00a0As a result, Garda numbers are now some 14,600 Garda members and over 3,000 Garda staff nationwide. \u00a0Budget 2021 will allow for the recruitment of up to<b><\/b>620 new Garda&iacute;, as well as up to 500 additional Garda staff<b>.<\/b>On that basis, there should be 14,700 Garda&iacute;, with a further 300 recruits in training in Templemore, by December 2021 &ndash; a total of 15,000.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is by law\u00a0responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters and deployment of resources.\u00a0 The allocation of Garda resources is made in light of identified operational demand.\u00a0 This includes deployment of personnel among the various Garda Divisions.\u00a0 As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter. <\/p><p>I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. \u00a0Factors taken into account include crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, operational strategies and transfers applications, including welfare issues. \u00a0<\/p><p>I am further informed that when allocations are taking place, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local management during which all factors are taken into consideration.\u00a0 Where a deficiency in resources is identified, the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200094#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200094#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":397,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[32220\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200094#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total number of garda&iacute; that have retired or resigned in each of the past five years to date; the extent to which this number was replaced by new recruits in the same period; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":398,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, retirement of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is governed by law, which sets the mandatory retirement age for all members at 60 years of age.

The output of this HTA will be an important input into the decision-making processes of the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  Until such a time as approval for reimbursement has been granted in relation to the reimbursement of Sativex by the HSE, this product will not be available under the community drug schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The application for Sativex remains under consideration with the HSE and is being assessed in line with the 2013 Health Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200096#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Records","counter":511,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200096#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":512,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[32176\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200096#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties faced by patients accessing their medical records from private consultants in which a patient requires emergency medical care in the public health system; his views that there should be an obligation on private consultants to share information in a timely manner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":513,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to examine the issues raised and respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200096#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":514,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200096#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":515,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[32185\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200096#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current HSE Covid-19 advertising on social media platforms (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":516,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200096#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":517,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200096#WRK01100"},{"type":"question","counter":518,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[32190\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200096#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the timeframe for the completion of construction and the entrance into full operation of the new second cath lab at UHW; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1510","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":519,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of a second Cath lab in University Hospital Waterford.\u00a0 As set out in the HSE&rsquo;s options appraisal, the preferred option is for a second Cath lab and associated 12 bed day ward (delivering six additional beds) on the roof of the existing Cardiology Department, which will operate five days per week and provide diagnostic services only. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that funding was allocated in the Capital Plan for the provision of a second Cath lab at University Hospital Waterford and planning permission was received from Waterford City and County Council in January 2020.\u00a0 The Disability Access certificate was granted on 23rd April 2020.

The Irish bTB eradication programme uses two main diagnostic tests for live animals:<\/p>  <p>  -  The single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT), often referred to as the skin test,\u00a0which is the test most widely used in an Irish context.<\/p>  <p>  -  The gamma interferon test (a blood test) which is used as an adjunct\u00a0to the SICTT in known infected herds.<\/p>  <p>  These are the two tests recognised under EU regulation 64\/432, which is the basis for enabling our cattle to trade within the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, another blood test, the Tb ELISA test, is also used where necessary as a tool where there are intractable TB breakdowns to try to identify chronically infected individual animals which are still clinically normal but whose immune system is not capable of reacting to the tuberculin skin test.<\/p>  <p>  For samples taken from animals suspected of having TB lesions detected at routine slaughter, such samples are tested using bacteriological culture and histopathological examination.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has for many years supported and funded research and development of new diagnostic tools for bTB, and continues to do so. This includes work to validate new molecular diagnostic techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on post-mortem samples, research into the use of novel antigens to improve the performance of the gamma interferon test on blood samples and research into immunological variations in cattle affecting the response to bTB. This work involves collaborations with UCD and Teagasc, with private sector companies seeking to validate tests, and with research groups in other countries such as the UK which face similar challenges to us in respect of bTB.<\/p>  <p>  When performed correctly, the TB skin test continues to be the best\u00a0and most accurate\u00a0diagnostic screening\u00a0test available for use in cattle.\u00a0 In particular,\u00a0it has an exceptionally high specificity i.e. the rate of\u00a0false positive results with the Tb skin test is very low - less than 1 in 5,000 tests gives a false positive result.\u00a0 While the possibility of human error cannot be eliminated,\u00a0my Department has a robust quality control programme\u00a0in place\u00a0to ensure accuracy and consistency in relation\u00a0to test performance. Testing can only be carried out\u00a0by authorised veterinary practitioners and the\u00a0authorisation process includes taking part in a DAFM training course.\u00a0 The performance of Tb tests by veterinary practitioners is subject to unannounced inspection and supervision by DAFM Veterinary Inspectors.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An IT system is used\u00a0to evaluate\u00a0and measure the\u00a0testing performance of individual veterinary practitioners, using a number of\u00a0test performance quality indicators including the number of positives detected in comparable groups, and the results of this evaluation is communicated to each veterinary practitioner.\u00a0 The results of this evaluation is also used\u00a0as the basis for risk-based inspections of testing veterinarians by DAFM Veterinary Inspectors.
