Human rights issues therefore continue to constitute an important part of Ireland's engagement and dialogue with Iran.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the two cases raised, and note with concern that there are reports that the persons in question have been tortured. Ireland urges all States to safeguard the human rights of prisoners and detainees as set out in the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, also known as the Mandela rules.<\/p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy, and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is very important in that regard, and Ireland has regularly raised the case of human rights in Iran at that forum.<\/p>  <p>  At the most recent Universal Periodic Review of Iran&rsquo;s human rights record at the Human Rights Council in November 2019, Ireland raised concern about the continued harassment, arrest, and arbitrary detention of human rights defenders in Iran, and called on the Iranian Government to release all detainees, who have been imprisoned solely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly as guaranteed under the ICCPR.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Human rights concerns are also discussed in Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral engagement with Iran, and I have raised the need to have an open dialogue on the subject with the Iranian Ambassador. Senior officials in my Department raised our concerns about Iran&rsquo;s human rights violations directly with their counterparts in Tehran in February 2020, urging Iran to allow the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran to visit the country.<\/p>  <p>  The EU consistently pursues human rights issues with Iran, including the right to due process for all, as part of our overall engagement with Iran.\u00a0 Since 2011, the EU has also had in place restrictive measures related to violations of human rights, which both list individuals and entities responsible for grave human rights violations, including many responsible for violations of rights of detainees; and ban the export to Iran of equipment which might be used for internal repression and of equipment for monitoring telecommunications.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU will continue to monitor developments in Iran, and to call on the Iranian Government to make progress in relation to human rights, both in direct contacts with Iranian officials, and at international level, including at the Human Rights Council, whenever opportunities arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300105#WRB06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":64,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 18 and 19 answered with Question No. 16.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Defence Action Plan","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300105#WRB06300"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[8534\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300105#WRB06400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reason for the delay in providing personal security clearance and facility security clearance for companies here dealing with projects for the European defence industrial development programme;

In the context of the compelling need for immediate implementation of the TWSS, the scheme necessarily had to build on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system.  <\/p>  <p>  The key prescribed conditions of the scheme are that &ndash; <\/p>  <p>  - the business is suffering significant negative  economic impact due to the pandemic and is unable to pay normal wages to employees, but wishes to continue to employ the employees and is making best efforts to continue to pay some wages to the employees, <\/p>  <p>  - the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and <\/p>  <p>  - the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before, in general, 15 March 2020, but recently extended to before the 1 April 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The latter two conditions were particularly designed with a view to preventing abuse of the scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  The amount of the temporary wage subsidy payable in relation to eligible employees is based on the average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020 for each employee.  <\/p>  <p>  I clarified in my letter of 16 April 2020 to Revenue, which set out my determinations of the amounts of wage subsidy to be payable in relation to different classes of employees, that for the purposes of the operation of the TWSS, the Average Revenue Net Weekly Pay is the employee&rsquo;s average net weekly pay for January and February 2020 based on the payroll submissions made by the employer concerned to Revenue.  It is a matter for each employer concerned to decide what amount of normal wages should be paid to employees in addition to the wage subsidy amounts, and whether to try match the employees&rsquo; previous gross or net pay.  Ultimately, what employees are most concerned about is how near the aggregate of the wage subsidy amount plus whatever amount of normal wages is being paid net to them by employers is to their normal take home pay.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that it has now implemented the revised rates of wage subsidy as determined by me on 16 April 2020, with the remainder to be implemented shortly. The revised rates apply as respects payroll notifications received by Revenue on or after 4 May 2020 in respect of payroll runs to be made on or after that date. The revised rate now implemented include:<\/p>  <p>  the 85% subsidy rate for employees whose average net weekly pay does not exceed &euro;412,<\/p>  <p>  - non-tapering of the 85% subsidy where an employer contribution of more than 15% of the employees net weekly pay results in a salary payment of up to &euro;350 per week,<\/p>  <p>  - the flat rate subsidy of up to &euro;350 for employees whose average net weekly pay is more than &euro;412 but less than &euro;500,<\/p>  <p>  - the 70% subsidy rate for employees whose average net weekly pay is more than &euro;500 but less than &euro;586, with a maximum subsidy of &euro;410 applying,<\/p>  <p>  - a maximum payment of &euro;350 per week for employees whose average net weekly pay is greater than &euro;586 per week but not more than &euro;960 per week, subject to specific tapering reductions based on the employer contribution to the net weekly earnings. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the TWSS is operated in real-time by employers through the normal payroll process. To ensure that subsidy amounts are paid to employees on a timely basis as part of the relevant payroll run, it is necessary to calculate the amount of the subsidy due to an employee based on the employee&rsquo;s gross pay. This is necessary as an employee&rsquo;s net pay cannot be fully determined before the actual payroll is run. Revenue is aware that, in effect, this means that for some employees where the employer pays between (net weekly) &euro;586 and &euro;960, the full amount of the subsidy due to an employee may not be paid through the payroll run concerned.  However, Revenue has confirmed it will be implementing a system development to ensure that any subsidy amounts that remain due to such employees will be calculated, by Revenue, following the submission of the actual payroll or payrolls. Arrangements will then be made by Revenue to pay any outstanding subsidy amount directly to the employees concerned. The necessary system development to achieve this will be implemented shortly and will be applied retrospectively from 4 May 2020 to any impacted weekly, fortnightly or monthly paid employees. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I am advised by the Minster for Employment Affairs and Social Protection that workers who are in receipt of the one parent family payment or the working family payment will continue to receive these payments during their temporary layoff as a result of the Covid-19 related closures provided they continue to meet the eligibility conditions for these schemes.  In relation to Working Family Payment, it continues to be paid to persons who have experienced a temporary loss of employment, or a reduction in their working hours as a result of COVID-19. It is open to any person who considers that their circumstances have changed to request a review of their claim. If this results in an increased rate of payment, this increase will be backdated accordingly.  A reduction in a rate of payment is normally only applied from a current date, unless there is evidence that a person knowingly misled the Department or failed to report a change in their circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300106#WRC06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300106#WRC06600"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[8318\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300106#WRC06700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a matter regarding insurance during Covid-19 for a business (details supplied) will be reviewed; if the matter which is being faced by many businesses will be addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[9242\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300106#WRC06800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress to date in discussions with insurance companies in ensuring that claims are honoured in relation to business interruption; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":145,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 97 together.<\/p><p>I am aware that there have been many concerns expressed about how the insurance industry is responding to the needs of its business policyholders in these difficult times, in terms of honouring business interruption claims and with regard to whether forbearance and other flexible measures are being offered to them. I have considerable sympathy for such policyholders, however the Deputy should note that I have no legal authority to compel an insurer to pay a claim as this forms part of a contract between the insurer and the policyholder. However, as a general rule, I believe that insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage.\u00a0 Insurers should engage with those businesses honestly, fairly and professionally to honour those elements of the policies covered, in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. The Deputies should note however that neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank have any role in adjudicating on such matters.\u00a0 If there continues to be a disagreement between an insurer and a policyholder, then the appropriate channels for resolving them must be followed i.e. use of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or litigation.<\/p><p>Having said that, my officials and I have been engaging with the sector in an effort to get some much needed certainty for business policyholders.

It did however indicate that each insurance policy is different and there may well be other factors which lead to the adjudication of whether a business interruption claim is valid or not, other than Government advice to close. \u00a0Following on from this correspondence, I held a teleconference with Insurance Ireland, on 17 April, where I reiterated that some insurers, by adopting a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; rejection of all business interruption claims, were doing the industry significant reputational damage and were not treating customers fairly. <\/p><p>In addition, the Deputies should note that the Central Bank wrote to the CEOs of major insurers outlining its expectations of them in this crisis from a consumer protection perspective.

The Central Bank is continuing to engage with the non-life insurance industry on these matters and will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that firms are meeting the expectations as previously set out.<\/p><p>I would also like to set out my views on forbearance.

These profiles take into account the actual Exchequer tax outturn until end-April and attempt to reflect the potential impact of the pandemic on receipts.<\/p><p>As such, there are no revised\u00a0monthly taxation profiles for the months January to\u00a0April.

In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate or exemption from VAT.\u00a0 In addition, the Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland has retained the application of VAT exemption to the transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage. This means that the supplier does not register for VAT, does not charge VAT on the supply of their services and has no VAT recovery entitlement on costs where such costs are used for the exempt supply of passenger transport.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland may continue to apply the VAT exemption on the supply of domestic passenger transport as governed by Article 371 of the VAT Directive; however, it cannot change the conditions under which the exemption was granted. In accordance with the Directive, a reduced rate of VAT (Ireland currently has two reduced VAT rates, 9% and 13.5%) could be introduced to the supply of passenger transport in place of the exemption that currently applies; this would give the transport operator deductibility in relation to VAT on their business inputs but would involve charging passengers VAT on their fares. Under the Directive it is not possible to apply the zero rate in Ireland to these services, as their supply was never zero rated in the past.<\/p>  <p>  In the UK, where these services were previously zero rated, the zero rate of VAT continues to apply to the supply of passenger transport, except for a taxi service which is standard rated, and suppliers established in the UK have an entitlement to deductibility on the costs relating to the supply of these services where the place of supply is the UK.<\/p>  <p>  I would point out that there are reliefs from VAT available to passenger transport operators, whose businesses are established in this State, as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (Touring Coaches) Order of 2012 provides for a refund of VAT on the cost of acquiring &ldquo;qualifying vehicles&rdquo; used for the carriage of tourists under contracts for group transport; and <\/p>  <p>  - provisions within Section 59 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010, which allow a person established in this State to claim deductibility in respect of input costs incurred in relation to the transport of passengers outside this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300107#WRD05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300107#WRD06000"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[8744\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300107#WRD06100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when a double taxation agreement (details supplied) will be signed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>It is my policy to treat plans or negotiations for double taxation agreements as confidential until they are signed, at which point they are published on Revenue's website.

The public consultations and calls for evidence are generally open for submissions on any issue related to the impact of the macroprudential framework or specific policies. This includes submissions related to discrimination, equality and human rights. The Macroprudential Measures Committee or the Central Bank Commission (depending on the policy instrument being considered) is presented with the outcomes of public consultation and any implications for policy development. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is committed to being a socially responsible and sustainable organisation in how it delivers on its mandate and mission. As a public service organisation, the Central Bank&rsquo;s obligation to meet its public sector duty is a key part of this wider commitment.

Further strengthened in subsequent years, the CCMA, and within it, the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), is just one part of the national policy framework of supports and protections to assist people with mortgage arrears difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  The CCMA is a statutory Code put in place to ensure that regulated entities have fair and transparent processes in place for dealing with borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears.  Within this process, due regard must be given to the fact that each case is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the regulated entity, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his or her mortgage obligations. Regulated entities must comply with the CCMA as a matter of law.<\/p>  <p>  Under the CCMA, a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) with the borrower and other clear requirements are met or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating. This framework requires a regulated entity to exhaust the options available from its suite of ARAs before taking action which may result in the borrower losing his\/her home (whether by voluntary sale or repossession). During the legal process, the borrower has the opportunity to re-engage with the regulated entity to find a solution.  In some circumstances, however, loss of ownership may be unavoidable.  <\/p>  <p>  I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the Abhaile scheme, the aim of which is to ensure that people who are at risk of losing their homes get assistance to address their mortgage arrears and to help them wherever possible, to remain in their homes. The Insolvency Service of Ireland have stated that if a debtor can, at least, service the current market value of their home, irrespective of the mortgage balance, a Personal Insolvency Practitioner will be able to secure a permanent solution that returns the debtor to solvency and allow them remain in their family home. In over 90% of Personal Insolvency Arrangements, the debtor has remained in their home notwithstanding the fact that the majority of such cases were in long term arrears. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Government is committed to assisting all its citizens who are in mortgage difficulties and even more so at this difficult time. The Banking and Payments Federation Ireland announced last week that it's members had 78,000 mortgage payment breaks in place for customers who are affected by the Covid-19 crisis.  I would urge all those in difficulty to engage with their financial institution and with the Abhaile and Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS). <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300108#WRE02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flexible Work Practices","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300108#WRE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[8973\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300108#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has conducted research on the impact of moving to a four-day work week; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that the Department of Finance has not, at this time, conducted any research on the impact of moving to a four-day work week.<\/p><p>However the Department operates a number of schemes allowing staff avail of alternative working arrangements and a\u00a0number of these are listed below.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>Work Sharing<\/b><\/p><p>In the Department of Finance work sharing is available to all grades, subject to business needs.

The administration of the TWSS is under the care and management of Revenue. <\/p>  <p>  The burden of compliance in relation to the TWSS rests solely with the employer rather than the employee.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Any amount due to be refunded to Revenue under the TWSS,\u00a0where the employer was not entitled to receive the wage subsidy in respect of the employee, is treated as if it were tax due and payable by the employer from the date the wage subsidy amount in question had been paid by Revenue and is payable by the employer. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, I am advised by Revenue as follows.<\/p>  <p>  Of necessity, Revenue&rsquo;s primary focus in operating the TWSS so far has been on providing a timely and efficient customer support service to ensure that much needed financial assistance is paid to employers and employees as quickly as possible.\u00a0 In due course, Revenue will be undertaking a comprehensive programme of compliance checks and interventions in relation to employer eligibility for the scheme.\u00a0 While the scheme operates at employer level on largely self-assessment principles, Revenue will expect businesses to be able to produce relevant supporting documentation when requested to do so and to fully engage with Revenue on any follow up discussions or checks.\u00a0 Eligibility for the TWSS is initially determined largely on the basis of the self-assessment and declaration by the employer concerned, combined with a risk focused follow up verification by Revenue involving an examination of relevant business records where that is considered necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue further advises\u00a0that where an employer has been paid a wage subsidy in respect of an employee and it transpires that the employer has not passed on the wage subsidy to the employee, or that the employer was not entitled to receive the wage subsidy in respect of the employee, the relevant law requires that the employer must refund the wage subsidy amount to Revenue. Any amount due to be so refunded to Revenue is treated as if it were tax due and payable by the employer from the date the wage subsidy amount in question had been paid by Revenue and is automatically so due and payable by the employer without the making of an assessment. \u00a0However, where necessary, Revenue may make an assessment to recover the amounts in question and the provisions of tax law governing assessments to income tax, appeals against such assessments and the collection of and recovery of income tax apply in relation to the assessment, collection and recovery of wage subsidy amounts from employers. In other words, the full suite of tax collection and enforcement powers, including the charging of interest on amounts due to be refunded by employers, is available to Revenue to recover wage subsidy amounts due to be refunded by employers. <\/p>  <p>  Section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 also provides for penalties for abuses of the scheme but only in certain prescribed circumstances. Thus, an employer is liable to a penalty of &euro;4,000, where the employer fails to include in, and separately identify in, the wage slips legally required to be given to employees under the Payment of Wages Act 1991 the amount of the wage subsidy. Where the employer who fails to comply is a body of persons, the secretary of that body is liable to a separate penalty of &euro;3,000. These penalties are designed to ensure transparency around the wage subsidy and to protect employees who are entitled to know what wage subsidy the employer has received in respect of them. <\/p>  <p>  There are more severe criminal penalties where an employer knowingly or wilfully delivers an incorrect return or statement, or knowingly or wilfully furnishes any incorrect information, in connection with the temporary wage subsidy scheme or where a person knowingly assists another person to furnish incorrect information in relation to the scheme. The penalties can be a fine of up to &euro;5,000 and\/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year in the case of a summary conviction and a fine of up to &euro;126,970 and\/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years in the case of a conviction on indictment.\u00a0 The penalties in question are severe because they are designed to protect against deliberate fraud by unscrupulous employers seeking to abuse a generous and expensive State support. However, given the way the TWSS is structured, in that the employer must have been compliant with its PAYE\/PRSI\/USC reporting obligations and the employee must have been on the employer&rsquo;s payroll at 29 February 2020, the opportunity for deliberate fraud is limited.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would add that if employees have concerns about their employers incorrectly operating or availing of the TWSS, it is open to them to contact Revenue about their concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300108#WRE03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300108#WRE03900"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[9068\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300108#WRE04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of VRT and other tax liabilities collected on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners by NCT centres since a company (details supplied) was appointed to do so; when the tax collected by the company is transferred to the Revenue Commissioners; the amount outstanding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1496","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Applus Car Testing Service Limited was appointed as a competent person by Revenue from 1 September 2010.\u00a0 Since this date, Applus Car Testing Services Limited has collected, on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, a total of &euro;1,246,614,802 comprising VRT &euro;1,223,138,919 and VAT &euro;23,475,883 (overwhelmingly relating to used imported vehicles).\u00a0 These taxes are paid to Revenue on the fifteenth day of the month following the month the vehicles are registered.\u00a0 I am further informed by Revenue that there are no outstanding amounts and, as the NCTS Centres have been closed since 28 March 2020, there are also no accumulated amounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300108#WRE04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300108#WRE04200"},{"type":"question","counter":257,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[9103\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300108#WRE04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the remaining policy, legislative or regulatory obstacles that are preventing credit unions from being able to provide funding for social housing through investments in approved housing bodies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":258,"content":"<p>In 2017, the Central Bank undertook a review of the investment framework for credit unions.\u00a0 On 1 February 2018, the Central Bank published  amending investment and liquidity regulations for credit unions.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Since 1 March 2018, credit unions\u00a0have been\u00a0permitted to invest in regulated investment vehicles where the underlying investments are investments in Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) for the provision of social housing.

In essence: <\/p>  <p>  - a subsidy of &euro;350 is payable to employees with average net weekly emoluments greater than &euro;586, where the employer pays sufficient gross salary which equates to an amount up to 60% of the employee&rsquo;s net weekly earnings. <\/p>  <p>  - a subsidy of &euro;205 is payable to employees with average net weekly emoluments greater than &euro;586, where the employer pays sufficient gross salary which equates to an amount that is more than 60%, but not more than 80%, of the employee&rsquo;s net weekly emoluments.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - no subsidy is payable to employees with average net weekly emoluments greater than &euro;586, where the employer pays sufficient gross salary which equates to an amount that is more than 80% of the employee&rsquo;s net weekly earnings.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, for employees whose current net emoluments exceeds &euro;960 per week, no subsidy applies regardless of the level of any reduction in pay.\u00a0\u00a0 To calculate the level of subsidy payable, current pay is compared with previous average net weekly pay for January\/February.\u00a0 This subsidy will be tapered to ensure that the total weekly income consisting of the employer contribution plus the wage subsidy amount does not exceed &euro;960 per week in any individual case.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised the specific issue of taking into account income from occupational pensions when calculating the amounts of wage subsidy.\u00a0 I am advised by Revenue that the TWSS provides that wage subsidy amounts and limits in relation to individual employees are calculated by reference to the total emoluments of the employee concerned. For this purpose, there is no distinction made between the emoluments from an occupational pension and the emoluments from an employment.\u00a0 Where an individual has two or more sources of emoluments, be they employments or an employment and an occupational pension, all sources are looked at when considering the amounts of wage subsidy available in relation to the employee. \u00a0It would be inequitable to exclude occupational pension amounts, which can be significant in many cases, when calculating wage subsidy amounts available in relation to individual employees. <\/p>  <p>  I have also been advised by Revenue that during the transitional phase of the TWSS, up to 3 May 2020, if an employee had multiple employments, each employer individually operated the scheme based on 70% of each employee&rsquo;s average net weekly pay with that employer.\u00a0 During the operational phase of the TWSS from 4 May 2020, earnings from all active employments and occupational pension sources are combined.\u00a0 Thus, the average net weekly pay from each such source is aggregated to calculate the employee&rsquo;s overall average net weekly pay. This is then used to calculate an employee&rsquo;s maximum wage subsidy and the wage subsidy entitlement is split across each of the emolument sources based on the percentage of the employee&rsquo;s average net weekly pay from each such source, with each employer provided with an employer &ldquo;maximum weekly wage subsidy&rdquo; and the &ldquo;maximum weekly employer pay before tapering&rdquo; to apply to the employee&rsquo;s payroll.\u00a0 This personalised information will ensure that the employee&rsquo;s overall position is taken into consideration when calculating the employee&rsquo;s subsidy entitlements. This is to allow the concentration of resources to protect incomes, in a proportionate way having regard to available resources and employer contributions by way of wage top ups. <\/p>  <p>  It follows that if one of the sources of the employee&rsquo;s emoluments, such as, in this instance, the occupational pension provider, is not operating the TWSS, the employee will only get the benefit of the wage subsidy in relation to the employment that is operating the TWSS. \u00a0In the specific case that is the subject of this question, the employee&rsquo;s total average net weekly pay across his employment and occupational pension is greater than &euro;586. Consequently, \u00a0the maximum wage subsidy the employee is entitled to would be &euro;350 or &euro;205, depending on the amount of wage top up provided by the employer, and not as has been suggested by the employee concerned a subsidy amount based on 85% of his average net weekly pay from his employment on the grounds that that weekly pay from that employment is &euro;586 or less. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the administrative process for availing of the TWSS, Revenue advises me that it\u00a0has repeatedly advised employers that for a claim for the subsidy in relation to an employee to be identified and processed correctly, the employer must use the PRSI rate of J9 for that employee in its payroll submission to Revenue.\u00a0 Where a payroll submission is made to Revenue with a J9 PRSI class, it is extremely important to ensure that the payroll submission is not subsequently deleted or amended.\u00a0 As Revenue&rsquo;s systems were developed quickly to cater for the TWSS, attempts to delete or amend previous refund-related payroll submissions are necessarily flagged for attention by Revenue and may cause further difficulties for the employer and disrupt the refund process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Finally, where an employer wishes to engage with Revenue on general issues relating to the scheme, the employer should contact Revenue&rsquo;s National Employer Helpdesk via the myEnquiries system, providing details of the query and relevant contact information.\u00a0 I have been assured by Revenue that in the case that is the subject of this question the employer concerned received timely communication in relation to each query raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300108#WRE06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300109#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[9388\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300109#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will encourage banks to extend the moratorium on farmers repayments into the autumn in view of the ongoing impact of Covid-19.","asker":"1525","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar T.D. and I, along with the Minister for Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation, Heather Humphreys T.D., met with the Chief Executives of the five Irish major retail banks earlier this month.

It is important to note that these payment breaks must be applied for by 30th June 2020 as this is the deadline set out by the European Banking Authority.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is focused on ensuring that extensions to COVID-19 related payment breaks operate in borrowers&rsquo; best interests and in line with regulatory requirements.

These options may result in an increase in monthly repayments due to the overall increase in the cost of credit and this should be fully explained to the borrower.

The purpose of this research is to estimate the volume of non-Irish duty paid cigarettes being consumed in Ireland. Since 2013, this has been complemented by an additional survey on roll your own tobacco.  The results of the 2018 survey was published by Revenue in May 2019 and can be viewed on the Revenue website at<\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The key findings of the 2018 survey were that:<\/p><p>- 13% of the cigarette packs held by smokers surveyed were classified as illegal.<\/p><p>- a further 9% of the packs are found to be legal Non-Irish Duty Paid.<\/p><p>- 21% of pouches of fine cut tobacco for the rolling of cigarettes (roll-your-own) consumed were illicit.  <\/p><p>Of the 13% of cigarette packs found by the survey to be illegal: <\/p><p>- 78% were classified as contraband (i.e., normal commercial brands of cigarettes bought duty paid or duty free outside the country and smuggled here).<\/p><p>- 21% are classified as &ldquo;illicit whites&rdquo; (cigarettes manufactured for the sole purpose of being smuggled into and sold illegally in another market).<\/p><p>- 1% are classified as counterfeit packs (cigarettes manufactured without authorisation of the rightful owners, with intent to deceive consumers and to avoid paying duty). <\/p><p>The survey included an estimated potential loss in 2018 to the Exchequer from illegal cigarettes of &euro;211 million in Excise and VAT.However, this was viewed as a notional loss in Exchequer tax revenue as it assumed that the illegal cigarettes consumed would displace the equivalent full tax paid quantity of cigarettes, which is unlikely to be the case.<\/p><p>In relation to prosecutions, I am informed by Revenue that in 2019 33 prosecutions were brought for cigarette or tobacco smuggling and seven convictions secured, one on indictment and six on summary conviction, resulting in fines totalling &euro;15,000 being imposed. <\/p><p>In addition, 62 prosecutions were initiated for other cigarette and tobacco-related offences in 2019. 55 convictions were secured, three on indictment and 52 on summary conviction, resulting in fines totalling &euro;94,000 and two prison sentences &ndash; one consisting of 18 months imprisonment and the other consisting of 24 months imprisonment with 14 months suspended. <\/p><p>To date in 2020, 14 prosecutions have been brought for cigarette or tobacco smuggling and four convictions secured, three on indictment and one on summary conviction, resulting in fines totalling &euro;2,500 being imposed. <\/p><p>In addition, 19 prosecutions have been brought to date in 2020 for other cigarette and tobacco-related offences. 15 convictions have been secured to date, one on indictment and 14 on summary conviction, resulting in fines totalling &euro;26,000 and 240 hours community service. <\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that it uses a range of measures designed to identify and target those involved in the smuggling, supply or sale of illicit tobacco products, with a view to disrupting the supply chain, seizing the products and, where possible, prosecuting the persons involved.  Revenue&rsquo;s strategy involves developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources on a risk-focused basis. <\/p><p>Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work together on an ongoing basis in acting against tobacco crime, and both organisations cooperate closely with their Northern Ireland counterparts, in the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this form of criminality. In addition, Revenue works closely with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud office, Europol and other international organisations, including the World Customs Organisation, in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat tobacco crime. <\/p><p>Key actions undertaken by Revenue in this area include:<\/p><p>- Using risk analysis and profiling to screen cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.<\/p><p>- Post-importation intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.<\/p><p>- Investing in new resources, such as a new mobile x-ray scanner which uses imaging technology to analyse vehicles as well as shipping containers. This enables Revenue to identify suspicious consignments quickly and efficiently, with minimum impact on legitimate trade.<\/p><p>- the setting up of the National Profiling Centre, the development of the National Intelligence Management System and the setting up of specific senior management groups at Principal Officer and Assistant Principal levels to give a clearer strategic and operational focus to Revenue&rsquo;s work in the enforcement area, including tobacco fraud.<\/p><p>Revenue is a fully integrated tax and customs administration and so it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on tobacco related enforcement work. Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance. These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.  Resources are allocated to these different aspects of enforcement and compliance work are continuously adjusted in response to changes in the level of risk in different sectors.<\/p><p>The Government has also ensured through the Finance Acts over recent years that Revenue has the necessary statutory powers to tackle the illicit tobacco trade and I am open to considering any proposals for further legislative changes as needed.  Legislative reforms  made over recent years in this area include: <\/p><p>- The Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excise products.<\/p><p>- The Finance Act 2013 introduced new offence and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco and strengthened the offence provisions relating to the sale or delivery of unstamped tobacco products.<\/p><p>- The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provided that a person suspected of an offence of dealing in, or with, unstamped tobacco products must provide information to a Revenue Officer or a Garda and may be required to present any tobacco product concerned for examination, and makes provision for search by a Revenue Officer or Garda of any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that if tax on roll-your-own tobacco was increased using an annual tax escalator of 5% it would take approximately seven years for the tax rate on roll-your-own tobacco to reach equivalence with manufactured cigarettes. That is providing that there were no further increases in tax on manufactured cigarettes.<\/p><p>The Ready Reckoner published on the Revenue website at shows on page 24 the potential yield from increased taxes on packets of cigarettes. I am advised by Revenue that if tax on a pack of 20 cigarettes was increased using an annual tax escalator of 5% and the rate of inflation of -0.1% (April 2020), the most popular price category of cigarettes priced at &euro;13.50 would increase by &euro;0.52.<\/p><p>Overall responsibility for the WHO Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products rests with my colleague, the Minister for Health.  However, I am in a position to advise the Deputy on the traceability and security feature systems intended to secure the supply chain of tobacco products, which is one of the key elements of the Protocol.  The EU Tobacco Products Directive (2014\/40\/EU), which gives effect to elements of the Protocol provides for the introduction of a mandatory &lsquo;traceability&rsquo; system alongside a &lsquo;security feature&rsquo; system for tobacco products supplied on EU markets.  The traceability and security features systems required by the Directive were implemented by Revenue in 2019 in respect of cigarettes and Roll-Your-Own tobacco.These systems are to be extended to all other tobacco products in May 2024.  The &lsquo;traceability&rsquo; system requires that all cigarettes and Roll-Your-Own tobacco products manufactured in, or imported into, the EU must be marked with what is referred to as a &lsquo;unique identifier&rsquo;.  The unique identifier is scanned at each stage in the legitimate tobacco supply chain by the importer, wholesaler or distributor concerned using specialised equipment.  The Deputy will appreciate that tracking the distribution of legitimate, tax paid tobacco products through the domestic supply chain will not assist in tackling our illicit tobacco problem.  Tax paid tobacco is not the problem and there is no incentive to divert Irish tax paid tobacco onto other markets or to misreport its distribution for the purpose of such diversion. <\/p><p>The EU Commission has noted that the data collated from the traceability system will give an EU-wide picture of the quantity of tobacco products supplied to each member state market, up to the last point before retail sale.  All cigarettes and Roll-Your-Own tobacco products are also, under the Directive, required to carry a security feature which verifies the authenticity of the product concerned.  The tobacco tax stamp is used as the security feature in Ireland and several other EU states.  Revenue has also granted approval for an alternative security feature to be applied to Irish duty-free tobacco products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300109#WRF02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Customs and Excise","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300109#WRF03300"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[9638\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300109#WRF03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the fiscal monitor for excise duty receipts for May 2020 or the most recent date for 2020, by category in tabular form; the increase or decrease of each category from the same period in 2018 and 2019, inclusive in respect of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the most recent month for which data are available is April 2020.

Taking a break from work from a health and well-being perspective is a chance to recover from the demands of work. The benefits of taking annual leave are not limited to going on holiday; it can also be the taking time away from work to spend on personal interests. Even without COVID-19, time away from work is directly correlated with reducing stress. Regular breaks from work have been shown to reduce ill health and overall absenteeism. Managers should ensure that their team members are availing of annual leave in a way that supports well-being, and also ensures that their team is supported to take their statutory minimum entitlement. <\/p>  <p>  Employers should facilitate requests for annual leave where possible so that once the crisis passes, organisations can meet increased demand without having to cater to a large volume of annual leave requests. Section 20 (1) of the Organisation of Working Time Act provides that the times at which annual leave is granted are determined by the employer. In that regard, the employer should have regard to the opportunities for rest and recreation available to the employee but also the need for the employee to reconcile work and any family responsibilities. <\/p>  <p>  Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the various challenges facing Departments and Offices, a special once off arrangement was put in place on 13 March 2020 to allow civil service employees additional time to avail of their annual leave during the 2020\/21 annual leave year which runs from April 2020 until March 2021. In addition, an IT system change in recent days has retrospectively reverted some employees to their previous cycle year, to ensure that they have the benefit of extra time to use their annual leave entitlement. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade currently advises against all non-essential travel overseas. The Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business notes that people are currently to remain within 5km of home, expanding to remain within 20km of home up until phase 4 on 20 July. Further guidance on annual leave may be issued when guidance on domestic and international travel is updated. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300109#WRF05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Children's Hospital","counter":326,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300109#WRF05200"},{"type":"question","counter":327,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[8769\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300109#WRF05300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he has communicated with National Paediatric Hospital Development Board since 1 March 2020 on the cost projections for the national children&rsquo;s hospital caused by the Covid-19 pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":328,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[8770\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300109#WRF05400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he has communicated with the National Procurement Board since 1 March 2020 on the increased cost projections for the national children&rsquo;s hospital caused by the Covid-19 pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[8772\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300109#WRF05500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the communications that have taken place between his Department and the Department of Health regarding the potential for increased costs in the development of the national children&rsquo;s hospital in view of the Covid-19 pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 to 123, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  In reply, I would inform the Deputy that questions in relation to the costs associated with the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital are proper to my colleague the Minister for Health in the first instance.

Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013, construction workers in Ireland are legally bound to hold a valid Safe Pass Registration Card to access construction site.  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation recently amended these regulations to extend the validity of Safe Pass cards with an expiration date after the 1st March 2020 until SOLAS Safe Pass training has restarted. <\/p>  <p>  SOLAS has examined the potential for online delivery as a means of continuing national construction health and safety courses while adhering to public health measures.  I am advised that no immediate solution has been identified that is equitable with the existing Safe Pass course delivery model, in being accessible to all eligible workers, provides real time course participants supports (literacy and numeracy) and interpreter services, as well as ensuring assessment integrity. As the training authority, SOLAS does not have the authority to issue temporary Safe Pass cards in the absence of associated education and training.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the delivery of face to face training, planning is well advanced to support delivery of Safe Pass training within health and social distancing guidelines once public health considerations provide for the return to training for this cohort of learners.

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, officials from my Department have had engagement with teacher representatives where they have outlined their concerns and issues.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The English Language Education Working Group for this sector has been established with a remit to address the issues arising from the Covid-19 pandemic with a priority and focus placed in the first instance on issues affecting students as well as other issues arising e.g. how stakeholders can work together to promote the sector as international markets move into recovery. The working group is comprised of key sectorial stakeholders including officials from my Department, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Enterprise Ireland, as well as lead sectorial representative bodies of providers and learner advocates.<\/p>  <p>  The coordination of the response of the wider education system to the Covid-19 outbreak is a substantial challenge. In this context, the Department has found the current structure of the working group to be effective in delivering on its remit and, while the Department remains open to views, there are no current plans to expand membership.\u00a0 To date, the Group has facilitated an appropriate level of engagement with stakeholders alongside the ability to identify and help resolve issues as they arise.\u00a0 The Department and the members of the Working Group will continue to engage with external parties, to seek to exchange information where relevant and address queries where possible.<\/p>  <p>  In compliance with the Government Decision taken in March 2020, all providers in this sector closed their premises in accordance with public health advice as part of efforts to combat the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak. Following the closure, these providers have introduced new ways of providing services to their students including facilitating the provision of online classes. This reflects a similar approach that has been adopted by providers across the wider education system. If a student is having issues with the programme on offer or in accessing a provider&rsquo;s services, they can engage with their provider to address these issues. It is not within the remit of my Department to pursue providers for refunds arising from fees paid by students. This is a matter between the student and their provider.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, as part of the conditions for a provider to have its programmes included on the Interim List for Eligible Programmes (ILEP) and therefore be eligible to recruit International Students, it must have established policies and procedures for the refund of fees to students in addition to a complaints procedure in the event of student complaints. These should be communicated to the student at time of enrolment.\u00a0 If the student exhausts the internal complaints procedure of the provider and is still unhappy about the outcome, they can make a complaint to the Immigration Delivery Service of the Department of Justice and Equality.\u00a0 However, in the case of a complaint regarding refunds, this can only relate to whether a provider has followed their internal refunds policy. If the provider&rsquo;s refund policy was followed, there can be no further intervention into a private agreement between a provider and their student.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300111#WRH01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1548"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300111#WRH01600"},{"type":"question","counter":399,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[9080\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300111#WRH01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the July provision programme will be extended to six weeks or 60 hours of tuition (details supplied).","asker":"1623","askee":"1548"},{"type":"question","counter":400,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[9081\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300111#WRH01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the July provision programme will be extended to six weeks or 60 hours of tuition (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1623","askee":"1548"},{"type":"speech","counter":401,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 144 together.<\/p><p>My Department is aware of concerns that the closure of schools has impacted hardest upon families who have children with complex needs whose well-being and engagement with learning depend very much on the routine of school and their relationships with other students, teachers and Special Needs Assistants.\u00a0 <\/p><p>They have also lost out on specialist supports during this closure period.<\/p><p>My Department has taken a number of initiatives to support children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage during the period of school closures.<\/p><p>These include &ndash;<\/p><p>- Guidance issued to all schools to support the ongoing learning of children with special educational needs and children who are at risk of disadvantage;<\/p><p>- Guidance and resources developed by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) on supporting children with special educational needs<\/p><p>- &euro;10m in ICT grant funding to schools towards the purchase of technology and devices to support students at risk of educational disadvantage.<\/p><p>- Continued funding of Home Tuition or, where this is not possible, flexibility to bank hours for use at a later time in the year<\/p><p>- Resources to support good mental health and well-being amongst students produced by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) <\/p><p>- To help schools plan for the new academic year, schools have been informed that their SNA allocation is being frozen at this year&rsquo;s level and there is provision for additionality where this might be required.

This guidance documentation is available on my Departments website at<\/p><p>Guidance has also issued to parents\/guardians of primary school children and is available at this same link in 12 languages.<\/p><p>The guidance was informed by extensive engagement with stakeholder sand feedback from a range of school surveys. The guidance documentation included the topic of staying safe in the distance learning environment and reminded schools of the continued need to implement and monitor their school policies particularly in areas such as Child Protection, Data Protection, Student\/Pupil\/Teacher Wellbeing and policies relating to the safe and ethical use of digital technologies. \u00a0Links to the range of curricular and other supports that continued to be available to schools for that purpose were also provided. \u00a0Schools and parents were also reminded of the extensive resources available through the Webwise programme to ensure the safe and ethical use of the internet during distance learning.\u00a0 This website promotes the autonomous, effective and safe use of the internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy targeting school leaders, teachers, parents and children themselves with consistent and relevant messages. The website includes a dedicated School\/Teacher Hub; A Parents Hub; and a Youth Hub.<\/p><p>Because learning is now conducted in the home environment, the Parents Hub is of particular importance during this time and this resource continues to be highlighted. This Hub provides practical advice and information to help parents safeguard their children as they use the internet and helps forge the link between home and school.\u00a0 The Parents Hub features expert advice from professionals and offers useful conversation starters and tips on managing internet safety in the home.\u00a0 It includes information on privacy and parental control, managing screen time, posting and sharing online, cyberbullying, popular apps and more. <\/p><p>The Webwise programme, which is managed by the PDST, is an internet safety initiative funded by my Department and the EU Safer Internet Project.

Webwise is also represented on the National Advisory Council for Online Safety (NACOS) which was established by Government in 2018 and where much of the national conversation with regards to online safety is conducted.

But some students may find it difficult to manage full-time placement in mainstream and so placement in a Special Class or Special School setting may be deemed appropriate where placement in mainstream class is not in the best interests of the child.  Special Schools funded by\u00a0my Department are established as special primary schools and cater for children and young persons with complex special educational needs from the age of 4 years until the end of the school year in which they reach their 18th year.  Provision in our 124 special schools has also increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year.  Nationally, 167 new special classes opened this school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide; has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.<\/p>  <p>  It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding,\u00a0is made available to the school.\u00a0My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard.\u00a0In considering these applications, however, the NSCE, in conjunction with the school buildings unit of my Department, will be required to take into account the capacity of a school to establish such a class, including the provision of sufficient accommodation space within the school.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally to meet identified need for next year.\u00a0This process is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.\u00a0 However there are some parts of the country where the\u00a0NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or special school places.<\/p>  <p>  I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.  As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.  The legislation was used for the first time in April 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area.  \u00a0  Significant progress was made in a relatively short period with the establishment of Danu Special School as well as six schools offering to open special classes.  The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation was activated for a second time on the 29th October, 2019 following a report by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which identified 82 children in South Dublin needing special education school places in the current school year and a further potential 68 children needing special education school places in 2020\/21.  Since then, as required under the Act, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity among schools in the South Dublin area.  On 21 April 2020 I received\u00a0a report from the NCSE, pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018) in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.  Before reaching this opinion, the NCSE has undertaken substantial work reviewing provision and accommodation in the 231 mainstream primary and 23 special schools in South Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  Following engagement between NCSE local personnel and school management and Patrons, very good progress has been achieved. 78 ASD primary school special class placements and 12 ASD early intervention special class places have been created in 14 schools in South Dublin, with 13 new ASD special classes and 2 new ASD early intervention special classes to open for September 2020.  However, the NCSE has reported that to date, an insufficient number of schools have indicated a willingness to open additional special classes.  The NCSE is of the opinion that should this continue, there remains a need for an additional 43 ASD primary special class places and 36 special school places in South Dublin.  The report also outlines the schools that should be requested to make additional provision.  This report will now be considered and if I agree with the position as set out by NCSE, next steps in the process will be considered which may include serving a statutory notice on schools identified if required.<\/p>  <p>  At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration.  Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process, will continue to be expedited to ensure that every child has a suitable school placement, which is the key objective of my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300111#WRH05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1548"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Funding","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300111#WRH05400"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[8366\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300111#WRH05500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of a funding application by a school (details supplied); when the application will progress to the next stage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1548"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>My Department is currently reviewing the building project to which the Deputy refers in the context of construction sites restarting and projects at tender stage progressing.

In normal circumstances this would not be the position.<\/p>  <p>  Droichead as a process is not simply about teaching time.

The working group is comprised of key sectorial stakeholders including officials from my Department, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Enterprise Ireland, as well as lead sectorial representative bodies of providers and learner advocates.<\/p>  <p>  The coordination of the response of the wider education system to the Covid-19 outbreak is a substantial challenge.

Kilkenny.<\/p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places nationally to meet identified need for next year.\u00a0This process is ongoing,\u00a0<\/p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding,\u00a0is made available to the school.\u00a0The Department of Education and Skills works closely with the NCSE in this regard.<\/p><p>Normally, special class and school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.\u00a0 However there are some parts of the country where the\u00a0NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.\u00a0I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.<\/p><p>As Minister for Education and Skills, I have power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.\u00a0This legislation has been used to good effect in the recent past.<\/p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents\/ guardians of the child and the Board of Management of a school.\u00a0\u00a0My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools. <\/p><p>The NCSE team of locally based Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist parents\/guardians to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs and to discuss their child's special educational needs.

The mother can take maternity leave from casual or part-time employment. She can take up to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave, and up to a further 16 weeks of unpaid leave. Two weeks must be taken before the baby is due, and at least four weeks must be taken after the birth. As Minister of State for Justice and Equality, the legislation that governs the provision of maternity leave is my responsibility and any such amendment would likely require primary legislation. The provision of maternity benefit is under the remit of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. These matters are currently being examined by Government. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware on 29 May the Minister for Finance announced changes to the Wage Subsidy Scheme to accommodate the salaries of parents returning from maternity or adoptive leave. The changes are aimed at individuals who may not have been on the payroll of their employer on 29 February, or been paid in either January or February 2020 and will allow for consistent treatment with other employees. <\/p>  <p>  Minister Donohoe has advised that the amendment will be legislated for later in the year as part of the usual Finance Bill 2020 process, but that in the interim Revenue has agreed that the provision will be implemented from 26 March where applicable. Input from employers is required and relevant employers are therefore encouraged to contact Revenue when the system update is launched so that the process of including the salaries of affected employees may begin as quickly as possible. It is expected the update will be launched on 12 June. <\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of demands on parents at this time and hope that the additional measures to support working parents that I have introduced in recent years, including the new parent&rsquo;s leave scheme and an extension of parental leave, are helping to ease some of these demands. In addition to maternity leave, each parent may also avail of two weeks of parent&rsquo;s leave during the first year of a child&rsquo;s life and may qualify for parent&rsquo;s benefit during this period.  Parental leave is also available which entitles parents to take unpaid leave from work to spend time looking after their children. Parents can take up to 22 weeks of parental leave for each eligible child before their 12th birthday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300119#WRU01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1515"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Parental Leave","counter":905,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300119#WRU01900"},{"type":"question","counter":906,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[9744\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300119#WRU02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will consider extending adoptive leave to fathers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":907,"content":"<p>Section 6 of the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 provides for an entitlement to 24 weeks of\u00a0paid adoptive leave for an employed adopting mother or a sole male adopter, and an additional 16 weeks of unpaid leave.\u00a0Currently, adoptive leave is not available to a male same-sex couple where the couple is not\u00a0married, cohabiting or civil partners, and adopted jointly.

In order to protect the ongoing availability of vehicles and in anticipation of impacts of public health restrictions on motor factory or fit-out workplaces, 94 additional vehicles were purchased by the Garda authorities in March 2020 at a cost of &euro;2.4m. The fit-out cost of these vehicles was &euro;600,000.  The allocation of these and all other vehicles in the fleet is entirely a matter for the Commissioner and his management team.  <\/p><p>  >Garda Fleet in DMR 09-20<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300121#WRW05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1589"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":1085,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300121#WRW06000"},{"type":"question","counter":1086,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[9401\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300121#WRW06100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the weekly opening hours of Howth Garda station.","asker":"1464","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":1087,"content":"<p>The Garda Commissioner is by law responsible for the administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of Garda resources.

While COVID-19 is a public health issue, the infectious nature of the virus and the way in which it is easily transmitted through humancontact, makes it a workplace health and safety issue as well as a general health matter.

Once on site, the inspector will check for compliance against the Protocol and where there is a breach of a statutory obligation, the inspector based on the evidence and their expert opinion will determine what enforcement action may be needed.

There is, understandably, some reluctance by landlords to disclose such arrangements due to commercial sensitivities. However, it appears that other landlords have been less flexible.<\/p><p>I have also\u00a0raised the matter of legal protections for businesses who are unable to pay their commercial rents with the Attorney General. Specifically, I asked about the potential for legislation to prevent the eviction of commercial tenants who have failed to pay rent as a result of the pandemic and the possibility of legislating to place a moratorium on businesses having to pay rent for premises they cannot used due to the restrictions imposed.<\/p><p>The Attorney General had advised that there are significant legal difficulties in respect to both of the questions posed. The difficulties stem from a variety of legal bases including statutory, constitutional, contract and common law. I have asked my officials to consider the advice.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can support businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. The Government recognises the issue of &lsquo;out of pocket&rsquo; costs for businesses which have to pay ongoing fixed costs such as rents, despite not being able to trade. We have introduced a\u00a0suite of supports to\u00a0assist\u00a0businesses which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low costs loans, deferred tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates.

The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening. <\/p><p>On 15 May the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap from 18 May. .<\/p><p>This decision was taken having regard to the advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) at the time.

All of these retail outlets must implement physical distancing measures and measures set out in the National Return to Work Safely Protocol.<\/p><p>Government continues to monitor progress on Phase 1 and will assess progress this week.

Funding made available by the scheme facilitates long-term, strategic investment.<\/p><p>The scheme is open to eligible SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees), including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors. Loans under the scheme range from &euro;100,000 (&euro;50,000 for farmers) to &euro;3m per eligible business, with loans of up to &euro;500,000 available unsecured. The initial maximum interest rate is capped at 4.5% for loans up to &euro;249,999 and 3.5% for loans more than or equal to &euro;250,000 for the first six months. These rates represent a significant saving compared with the prevailing rates that are otherwise being offered for similar loans on the market.<\/p><p>This scheme has been expanded by a further &euro;200m to facilitate longer-term lending to Covid-19-impacted businesses and my Department is working through the details of this expansion and will bring this funding to market as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The Covid-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them access funding arising from the Covid-19 crisis.<\/p><p>These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.

This reduced rate is available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or referred by a bank or Local Development Committees.

As these loans are available interest free for the first six months, the net effect is to further reduce the net interest rate payable over the period of the loan. <\/p><p>Government has agreed a new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme as a further development of the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme already available.  This Scheme forms a major component of the government&rsquo;s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times by providing critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment.  It will provide an 80% guarantee on lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years.  The guarantee will be able to be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million that have a maximum term of 6 years or less.<\/p><p>The Scheme will be available to all SME sectors, including primary producers.  It will also have interest rates below current market rates.  The implementation of this Scheme will require primary legislation, the drafting of which has commenced.<\/p><p>There are a number of liquidity supports for COVID 19 impacted businesses available now, including the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme which was implemented in 2012, supporting loans up to &euro;1 million for periods of up to 7 years.  The scheme is designed to support a range of debt products appropriate to the borrowing needs of SMEs.An application to access the Credit Guarantee Scheme can be made through one of the participating lenders which are currently Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland.<\/p><p>The &euro;2,500 Trading Online Voucher Scheme for microenterprises is being expanded - an additional &euro;3.3m is being provided to the scheme bringing the total available to &euro;5.6m. The scheme is also being made more flexible - allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one; and allowing subscriptions to low-cost online retailing platform solutions to quickly establish a retailing presence online.<\/p><p>As the reopening of the economy proceeds, more and more businesses are transitioning from the planning to the implementation phase as we progress through the 5 stages of the Government Roadmap.  It is in this context that the Business Continuity Voucher is being phased out and since 15 May is closed to new applicants.

The awarding of vouchers under the BCV scheme will naturally taper off in the coming weeks as the Local Enterprise Offices process the outstanding applications.

Schemes and\/or individual aid measures notified under this framework will be processed by the Commission very quickly, usually over the period of a week.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s inputs into the development of the Temporary State Aid Framework and subsequent amendments was coordinated by the State Aid Unit in my Department. This included engagement with the Commission on the two subsequent amendments to the Temporary Framework, the first of which was adopted on 3 April 2020 and the second was adopted on 8 May 2020. These amendments have provided Member States with additional options to tackle the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis.<\/p>  <p>  During the consultation process for the development of Temporary Framework, the State Aid team in my Department requested, along with other Member States, that the de minimis threshold be raised from &euro;200,000 to &euro;500,000.  However, the Commission advised that any change to the regulation would take a longer period of time, and therefore be ineffective in dealing with the crisis. However, on the basis of these consultations with MS, the threshold in the Temporary Framework was increased from &euro;500,000 to &euro;800,000.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Framework is to provide temporary, targeted amounts of aid to undertakings that find themselves facing a sudden shortage or even unavailability of liquidity.  Aid provided under the Temporary Framework can be cumulated with de minimis aid and other existing state aid measures, provided the provisions of these measures are respected.<\/p>  <p>  The flexibility provided by the Temporary Framework allows aid to be provided to undertakings, including SMEs, who are facing difficulties due to the current crisis without impacting on their individual de minimis thresholds. Undertakings that have reached the de minimis threshold of &euro;200,000 over the past three years will be able to access aid from schemes that operate under the Temporary Framework.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that the de minimis threshold for SMEs must be managed and our approach has always been to look at other state aid measures first when developing schemes. It is for this very reason that the &euro;200m Sustaining Enterprise Fund, which is operated by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and provides repayable advances of up to &euro;800,000 to eligible firms was notified by my Department and approved by the Commission under the Temporary Framework.<\/p>  <p>  Two further supports that have been announced which will operate under the Temporary Framework are the Restart Fund and the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. These will operate under the Temporary Framework rather than under the de minimis regulation so as to ensure that those companies who have come close to the &euro;200,000 threshold can still access these supports.<\/p>  <p>  The Restart Fund which is open for applications has been notified by my Department to the Commission on 28 May. The expanded COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, announced on 2 May, will operate under the Temporary Framework and as such aid granted under these schemes, will not impact on the de minimis thresholds of beneficiaries.  This is due to be formally notified to the Commission shortly.<\/p>  <p>  For enterprises that have not yet reached their de minimis aid threshold some of the supports available under the de minimis Regulation are:<\/p>  <p>  - Covid-19 loans of up to &euro;50,000 from Microfinance Ireland for micro enterprises. Loans are available at an interest rate of between 4.5% and 5.5%, with the first six months interest and repayment free.  Businesses can apply through their nearest LEO or directly at microfinanceireland.ie;<\/p>  <p>  - The SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Schemes opened for eligibility applications on 23 March. The maximum loan size under the scheme is &euro;1.5m (first &euro;500,000 unsecured) and the maximum interest rate is set at 4%. Eligibility criteria apply.  Applications can be made through the SBCI website at sbci.gov.ie;<\/p>  <p>  - The current Credit Guarantee Scheme supports loans of up to &euro;1m for periods of up to seven years. Applications can be made to AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the new package of liquidity measures announced by the Minister last week, including for micro-enterprises, the full range of Enterprise Ireland, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness.

The Authority has also developed a range of checklists and templates which are available on its website for use by employers, workers and worker representatives, and further material is being developed.  The Authority&rsquo;s Inspectors have always and will continue to primarily use the model of advice, information and support when carrying out inspections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300124#WRZ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1278,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300124#WRZ03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1279,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[9126\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300124#WRZ03900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if new businesses that have not yet paid rates will be eligible for the grants to support small businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1280,"content":"<p>On Friday, 15 May 2020, the Government announced details of the new &euro;250m Restart Grant providing direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures; with the grant being administered by local authorities from Friday, 22 May 2020.<\/p><p>Eligible businesses who have stayed open throughout the crisis, as well as those who are reopening under Phase 1 (from 18 May) and Phase 2 (8 June) of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, are encouraged to apply for the Restart Grant.

Remote work also has the potential to stimulate regional growth and to widen the talent pool in Ireland. <\/p><p>This is reflected in the Remote Work in Ireland report, which my Department published in December 2019. The objective of this research was to understand the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce, the attitudes towards such arrangements, and the influencing factors for both employers and employees partaking in remote working.<\/p><p>This research was informed by a large volume of desk research; engagement with key stakeholders; the outputs arising from a ministerial Remote Working Consultation Forum which was held in the Cavan Digital Hub in July 2019; and the dissemination of an online Remote Work Employee Survey. <\/p><p>The Remote Work Employee Survey reflected a significant demand for remote working options amongst existing employees. Of respondents who did not work remotely, 82.7% indicated that they would like to. A reduced commute was identified as a key motivator for those who wanted to work remotely, accounting for 39.9% of responses. This was most common amongst those living in the Mid-East (63.2%), West (43.3%) and Midlands (43.1%).<\/p><p>The report identified three key areas to be addressed to ensure that Ireland could reap the benefits of remote working: <\/p><p><b>- Data:<\/b>The report found that there was a lack of current data available on employees, employers and the hub infrastructure. It was suggested that to aid informed policy in the area that more data should be collected.<\/p><p><b>- Collaboration:<\/b>The report found that whilst some collaboration had taken place between bodies working on the remote work agenda that this could be strengthened. It was suggested that an Interdepartmental Group comprising of relevant departments and state agencies should be formed to align national policies and strategies.<\/p><p><b>- Guidance: <\/b>The report found that there was a lack of an official framework on remote working and that employers were not always aware of the options available to support them. The report recognised that this presented a barrier to the increased adoption of remote working solutions. It identified the need for guidance for employers in the following five areas:<\/p><p>- Equality <\/p><p>- Health and Safety <\/p><p>- Employment Conditions and the Right to Disconnect <\/p><p>- Data Protection <\/p><p>- Training <\/p><p>To build on this work, my Department has committed to the establishment of an Interdepartmental Group comprising of all relevant Departments and Agencies to align approaches and develop clear guidance on remote work for employers and employees. This Group has now been formed and will be steering the development of guidance on this topic.<\/p><p>The development of guidance will take into account the main findings of the Remote Work in Ireland report as well as engaging in wide consultation with key social partners and stakeholders. This research will seek to identify any gaps and inconsistencies in the current guidance on remote working available and identify any news areas where guidance may be required.

Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to grow and improve their business in the current crisis and will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term. In April of this year support was increased for two online trading initiatives to a total of &euro;7.6m: Trading Online Vouchers for micro enterprises in partnership with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Richard Bruton TD; and a special Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme for indigenous retailers with 10 or more employees administered by Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p>Firstly, in conjunction with Minister Bruton's Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment,\u00a0I\u00a0have\u00a0increased support for the Trading Online Voucher Scheme which is available to all micro enterprises with up to 10 employees, including those in the retail sector through the Local Enterprise Office network nationwide. The &euro;2,500 Trading Online Vouchers are a key government support to help small and micro enterprises, with very limited or no e-commerce presence, to\u00a0get online, boost their sales and reach new markets &ndash; particularly during this difficult period,\u00a0when so many small businesses are closed to the public. Flexibilities to the Trading Online Voucher scheme are now in place allowing businesses apply for a second voucher where they have successfully utilised their first one, which brings the overall total voucher amount available up to &euro;5,000 for each eligible business.\u00a0 Further details about the expanding Trading Online Voucher Scheme are available at <i><\/i><\/p><p>The Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme, which closed for applications on 27 May 2020, is complementary to the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) Trading Online Voucher Scheme. The objective of the Scheme, administered by Enterprise Ireland, is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector which have started an online journey, which will have the most immediate impact enabling them to respond to both domestic and international consumer demand with a competitive online offer. <\/p><p>My Department has\u00a0introduced this Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability. Applicant companies must employ 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. Successful applicants will be awarded funding to support a maximum of 80% of the project costs. Grants ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;40,000 will be awarded under the competitive scheme. <\/p><p>This Scheme is not about taking the first steps; it is about raising the bar, in an informed, planned and strategic way.\u00a0 The total fund size will be up to &euro;2 million under this call. Further details on this Scheme available at <i><\/i><\/p><p>I am committed to supporting the needs of the retail sector at this time and in developing their online capability and enhancing their competitiveness.<\/p><p>The Temporary Wage Support Scheme (TWSS)\u00a0is provided\u00a0for in section 28 of the recently enacted Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.\u00a0 Deputies will be aware that the TWSS is an emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and in particular to support employment relationships which were already in place before the commencement of the scheme.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed quickly, having regard to the urgent Government objective of getting much needed assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the pandemic and the necessary restrictions introduced as a result of the Public Health Emergency.<\/p><p>The\u00a0TWSS can only operate in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.\u00a0 The TWSS builds on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. The core principles of the scheme are that:<\/p><p>- the\u00a0business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the\u00a0pandemic,<\/p><p>- the\u00a0employees in respect of whom the wage subsidy is claimed were included on the employer&rsquo;s payroll on 29 February 2020, and<\/p><p>- the\u00a0February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted to Revenue before, in\u00a0general, 15 March 2020 but recently extended, by concession, to 1 April\u00a02020.<\/p><p>The latter two conditions were particularly designed with a view to preventing abuse of the scheme.<\/p><p>While the issue of Commercial Rates is a policy matter for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, I can inform you that, on 2 May, the Government announced that commercial rates are being waived for a three-month period beginning on 27 March for businesses that have been forced to close due to public health requirements.<\/p><p>The Government will continue to actively engage with business owners and representative bodies. Local Authorities, who have longstanding experience in dealing with ratepayers and showing an understanding of their financial situations, are assessing the impact of COVID-19 by engaging directly with individual ratepayers, recognising that there may be impacts on sectors outside of those initially identified as being most under threat. <\/p><p>Furthermore, my Department will continue to monitor the issue and engage with other Departments, in particular the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, to ensure there is continued support to business in this regard. The position will remain under review as part of a wider review of options to support enterprises and employment, and associated local authority funding implications, once the unwinding of public health restrictions has advanced.<\/p><p>Issues relating to taxation are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance who has announced that &lsquo;deferred&rsquo; tax liabilities will be warehoused for a period of 12 months from the time when restrictions are eased for the sector the business operates in. Interest will not accrue during this 12-month period. This represents a very significant boost of liquidity for businesses of all sizes across the country.\u00a0 It is estimated that by the end of April approximately &euro;800m in payments relating to the first quarter had been deferred.<\/p><p>I am also informed that Revenue also announced a suspension of interest and late payment charges on tax debts for SMEs automatically and for larger businesses by arrangement.

This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March.

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals\u00a0to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of an Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of the Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients. It is intended that each patient will remain under the care of their existing consultant, where that can be facilitated and if that is not possible, they will be transferred to the care of another consultant as a public patient. <\/p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. The NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300128#WRFF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Tests","counter":1555,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300128#WRFF02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1556,"qnumday":559,"qnumall":"[8539\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300128#WRFF03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason it is not possible to be referred for a Covid-19 test by the Covid-19 HSE information line which would save time and money; the reason only a general practitioner can refer persons for a Covid-19 test; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1580","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1557,"content":"<p>A GP is the best person to advise a patient if they are concerned that they have symptoms of COVID-19 infection and is\u00a0best placed to make a clinical judgment as to whether a patient should be referred for\u00a0a test. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE advises that it now has the capacity to test 15,000 people a day.

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:<\/p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on\/off trigger criteria:<\/p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,<\/p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,<\/p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing,<\/p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups,<\/p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.<\/p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.<\/p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.<\/p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.<\/p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on\/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. <\/p><p>On 9 May the &ldquo;Return to Work Safely Protocol - COVID-19 Specific National Protocol for Employers and Workers&rdquo; was published.

It is designed to be used by all workplaces to adapt their procedures and practices to provide protection against the threat of COVID-19.<\/p><p>In general, with the exception of public health advice, the responsibility for providing guidance in relation to a particular sector of our economy or on a specific activity remains with the Government Department with responsibility for that sector or activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300129#WRGG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Speech and Language Therapy","counter":1607,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300129#WRGG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1608,"qnumday":576,"qnumall":"[8634\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300129#WRGG00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a child (details supplied) will receive services such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy;

It is hoped that such organisations can resume their income raising activities in the near future,\u00a0in line with the Government&rsquo;s roadmap for re-opening society and businesses.\u00a0<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has agreed to allocate substantial additional funding to the Health Vote to meet the costs associated with the implementation of the measures outlined in the National Action Plan in response to COVID-19.\u00a0 The HSE Executive Management Team has agreed a structured approach to addressing the financial challenges of Section 39 Agencies due to COVID-19. The objective of this approach is to provide a structured governance process and modus operandi through which such agencies can engage through the HSE to ensure, where appropriate, continuity of\u00a0provision of essential services. Furthermore, the HSE has given both Section 38 and Section 39 providers of disability services and supports assurance that budget allocations confirmed to each provider via the relevant CHO, will remain in place to year end, subject to co-operation with the HSE and compliance with the relevant Service Arrangements.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Independent Review Group on the role of voluntary organisations in the health and social care sector contained a broad range of recommendations in its report, including a strengthening of the relationship between voluntary organisations and the State.\u00a0 In this regard, I have established a dialogue forum, as recommended by the Review Group, to consider the report's recommendations. The forum, which is chaired by Peter Cassells, has met on a number of occasions to date. The most recent meetings of the Forum had to be postponed due to Covid-19, but I understand that the Chair has been in touch with Forum members in the past week in relation to continuing the good work that the Forum has started. The challenge of and the response to Covid-19 has brought into focus even more the importance of the relationship between the State and voluntary organisations and the interdependency of that relationship. I believe that there is an opportunity to build on good practices and collaborative working developed as part of the Covid-19 response and I look forward to engaging with the Forum as it continues its work. <\/p><p>In respect of the issue of pay restoration for Section 39 organisations, the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) agreement reached in October 2018 provided for pay restoration in relation to 50 pilot organisations in the first instance. Pay restoration for these bodies commenced in April 2019 with further payments due in October 2020 and October 2021 as appropriate. The agreement recognised that some of the remaining Section 39 organisations were also likely to have pay restoration issues and a process to address these issues commenced in recent months under the auspices of the WRC. Despite the engagement which took place, it was not possible to reach agreement. However, HSE management remains available and committed to the process and it is hoped that engagement with the WRC can re-commence when the demands of the pandemic allow.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300130#WRHH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":1689,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300130#WRHH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1690,"qnumday":606,"qnumall":"[8830\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300130#WRHH02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if funding will be expedited for the accommodation and care of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1496","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1691,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of an Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of the Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June.

This work should enable non-urgent elective care to resume within the necessary constraints.

Areas targeted by the programme include county Cork.<\/p>  <p>  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017 - 2021, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of accessible public transport.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE provide specialist disability services, including Day Services and Rehabilitative Training, to people with disabilities who require such services. Transport is not considered a core Health service and as such Day Service funding does not include transport.<\/p>  <p>  While there isn&rsquo;t a statutory requirement to provide patient transport services, it is acknowledged that some transport supports are provided by the HSE or funded agencies on a discretionary basis; and that without this support many people with disabilities would not be able to access services.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, it is only in the most complex cases that HSE Disability Service considers a contribution to the cost of transport to and from day services. Where such a need is identified it is usually negotiated with the service provider on a case by case basis. On occasion where the service provider is not able to support the provision of transport, the HSE Disability Service or the service provider would engage with Rural Link bus services to see if a service can be facilitated.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has liaised with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the Authority&rsquo;s services could assist people with disabilities. The National Transport Authority has a total of 17 Transport co-ordinating units called Local Link which provide safe secure and reliable Public Transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled Public Transport services and door to door services.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard and in partnership with the National Transport Authority, the HSE secured Dormant Account monies to fund a project which will map all Disability transport routes nationally, via information gathering by Disability Service providers and HSE Services who provide transport, the &ldquo;HSE Open Routes project&rdquo;. The project will identify options to integrate transport services provided by various service providers, and possibly undertake a series of pilot projects based on these options.

Services are only allowed to operate if they are registered with HIQA and they are inspected regularly to ensure that they maintain a high level of care.\u00a0 HIQA\u00a0has significant and wide-ranging powers, up to and including, the cancellation of the registration of a nursing home, where it has significant concerns about the quality of governance and oversight in such services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department engages with HIQA on a\u00a0regular and ongoing\u00a0basis on a range of matters related to the provision of high-quality and safe care for people using our health and social care\u00a0services in Ireland, including the regulatory framework.\u00a0 My\u00a0Department\u00a0and HIQA share the view that\u00a0moving the current national regulatory framework towards a &lsquo;service provider&rsquo; model of regulation is an issue which should be examined and progressed over time.\u00a0 This approach is being actively planned for in the context of the forthcoming statutory homecare scheme.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition,\u00a0my Department continues to progress work on the Patient Safety (Licensing) Bill which will, for the first time introduce a licensing requirement for all hospitals, public and private, and certain designated high-risk activities in the community. The drafting of this Bill is on the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, the general scheme of the Bill having been approved by Government and subject to Pre-Legislative Scrutiny at the Oireachtas Joint Committee of Health.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Regulation and accountability are not contingent on a commissioning model, since the latter is generally associated with a purchaser\/provider split which is a feature of health reforms in some countries, but which is not universal by any means and is subject to ongoing health policy debate.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  On 29 and 30 of March 2020, \u00a0key officials from the Department, HIQA, HPSC and HSE met to discuss nursing homes. It was agreed that representatives from the Department, HIQA, HSE and HSPC would collaborate to prepare a paper, encompassing a framework of necessary information, for consideration by the NPHET at its meeting of 31 March on the specific issues and risks relating to COVID-19 infections in residential healthcare facilities. To inform the development of the paper, HIQA provided an information framework document to the team on March 30. A variety of potential risks were identified. These included the risk of small providers, access to infection prevention and control (IPC) advice, access to PPE and timely access to testing. Following consideration of the paper referred to at the above NPHET meeting of 31 March, NPHET requested HIQA to risk assess all nursing homes\u00a0and liaise with relevant national and regional governance structures as necessary in light of mitigating actions. This was part of an overall\u00a0package of public health measures recommended following this meeting. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The risk assessment, amongst other things, outlined\u00a0that the private nursing home sector has no clinical governance oversight by or relationship with the Health Service Executive.\u00a0 It should be noted that registered providers must provide appropriate medical and health care, including a high standard of evidence-based nursing care in accordance with professional guidelines. Furthermore, regulations provide that a nursing home must have a person in charge. In cases where the\u00a0person in charge\u00a0is also the registered provider, that person may be a registered medical practitioner with required experience. Where the registered provider is not the person in charge, the person in charge must be a registered nurse with the required qualifications and experience.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the fact that the primary legal responsibility lies with individual providers, as recommended by NPHET on 31 March 2020, the HSE has further strengthened its National and Regional Governance Structures to support the response of nursing homes to COVID-19.

The government must next review and approve the policy at which point the policy can then be published. This policy was developed following a process of research into international innovation and best practice in the field of mental health and an extensive national consultation of over 1,000 service users, family members, friends and carers, and other stakeholders. The revised policy contains an implementation roadmap that organises recommendations into short (0-6 months); medium (6-18 months) and long term (beyond 18 months) actions that will be costed within the various time frames allocated. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The revised policy recommends the establishment of a National Monitoring and Implementation Committee (NIMC) to oversee the implementation of the policy over the next ten years. In addition, the policy recommends that a national mental health and wellbeing strategy be developed by Healthy Ireland. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health would consider that the process which led to the finalisation of the new policy was very comprehensive as regards research and consultation, including detailed engagement with the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Mental Health and with many other stakeholders, and therefore a high-level taskforce is not warranted at this stage. Our focus now is on setting up a focussed comprehensive implementation process with the HSE, once the new policy is approved by Government. <\/p>  <p>  However, in view of the recent requests, the Department of Health proposes that such a task force could be established as a sub-committee of the NIMC and work with the members of the Healthy Ireland mental health promotion strategy group to expand provision of existing Covid-19 interventions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This approach maximises collaboration and efficiency and ensures a strong implementation focus while minimising duplication of work, given that the proposed taskforce would carry out similar work to developments already afoot. Additionally, as the same personnel who have been involved in the above developments are likely to be involved in future developments going forward, this avoids duplication and creates space for mental health plans to be created without risk of overlap. The development of such a structure would take account of priority needs identified during and following Covid-19. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With regards to the provision of mental health services during Covid-19, a planning Group (HSE, Department of Health, NGO sector) has been established to plan for additional current and\/or anticipated needs as the crisis extends in duration. There are existing HSE guidelines, published in 2014, on &lsquo;Psychosocial and Mental Health Needs following Major Emergencies&rsquo;.\u00a0 These guidelines recognise that prior to, during and following national emergencies there would be a need to support certain members of the population with their emotional, cognitive, social and physical needs.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is continuing to provide all community services, in so far as possible, while following Covid-19 guidelines to ensure the protection of patients and staff. At present, there is a range of existing services which offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. These include Samaritans, Pieta House, MyMind, Turn2Me; Aware, Crisis Text Ireland, Shine, BeLongTo, LGBT Ireland, Jigsaw, Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.\u00a0 NGOs currently funded by the HSE are being supported and encouraged to develop updated responses to the Covid-19 outbreak. Details of these services are listed on the HSE website, www.yourmentalhealth.ie, and information on available services is also provided through the free mental health telephone information line, 1800 111888. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In order to respond to the anticipated additional needs of the population during this crisis, additional online services are being delivered to support the population, including online counselling, expanded crisis textline support and online life skills training, building on existing pilot schemes and developments in digital mental health in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300133#WRLL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1913,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300133#WRLL01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1914,"qnumday":680,"qnumall":"[9253\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300133#WRLL01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to make greater use of capacity in both public and private hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1915,"content":"<p>A major part of the Government's Action Plan in response to Covid-19 was to substantially increase the capacity of public healthcare facilities to cope with the anticipated additional demand.

This work should enable non-urgent elective care to resume within the necessary constraints.<\/p>  <p>  The key to maintaining reduced acute hospital occupancy is to address the gap between capacity and demand as set out in the Health Service Capacity Review 2018.

This was part of an overall\u00a0package of public health measures recommended following this meeting.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At the NPHET meeting 17th April an action was agreed that &lsquo;HIQA publishes and assesses a COVID-19 Quality Assurance Regulatory Framework&rsquo;. This Framework has been designed to ensure that providers\u00a0are prepared for, and have contingency plans in place for, an outbreak of COVID-19.\u00a0As part of the programme HIQA has developed a self-assessment tool for nursing home providers. This self-assessment tool sets out the minimum standard required to effectively respond to an outbreak of COVID-19 in a designated centre. This involves a self-assessment by the registered provider and an onsite assessment by inspectors of social services to verify the provider&rsquo;s compliance against specified regulations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  If further action is required by the registered provider to ensure compliance with the specified regulations, a compliance plan will be issued to the registered provider by the inspector of social services following the in-site assessment.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300133#WRLL05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Public Health Emergency Team","counter":1949,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300133#WRLL05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1950,"qnumday":692,"qnumall":"[9328\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300133#WRLL05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the membership of the NPHET committee from its first meetings on Covid-19 in January 2020 to date; the persons added to the committee and when in each case; the reason for their inclusion; and the record of attendance of such persons at subsequent meetings of the committee.","asker":"1486","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1951,"content":"<p>The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) for COVID-19 was established on 27 January 2020 in the Department of Health and is chaired by the Chief Medical Officer.

Since 2009 the HIQA has been the statutory independent regulator for the nursing home sector.\u00a0 This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards. These have all been revised and amended since their introduction.<\/p>  <p>  Since the onset of this pandemic, HIQA has put in place a quality assessment process whereby all designated centres, including nursing homes are formally contacted on a regular basis by an inspector of social services to assess how they are coping, the welfare of the residents, any concerns they have, and any deficits identified in their ability to sustain a safe, high-quality service. HIQA has completed a risk assessment of all nursing homes. On 6 April, it commenced a focused COVID-19 Infection Prevention and Control Hub to provide nursing home providers with guidance and supports; including an escalation pathway, where required, to the HSE.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I would like to note that HIQA has developed a regulatory assessment framework of the preparedness of designated centres for older people for a COVID-19 outbreak. The regulatory assessment framework aims to support those centres that are currently free from COVID-19 to prepare for an outbreak of COVID-19 and put in place the necessary contingency plans. This programme is in line with HIQA&rsquo;s established Authority Monitoring Approach.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of this programme is to provide support to nursing home providers to ensure that they are fully prepared and to build confidence in their ability to mitigate and manage COVID-19. The HIQA team will support providers, as necessary, to ensure that they plug into the supports being provided by the HSE. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. All nursing homes, public and private have a duty to ensure continued adherence to the existing regulatory and standards framework in the discharge of their duties.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the ongoing support of independent regulator the HSE continues to provide unprecedented supports to nursing homes including relevant clinical and infection prevention and control advice, funding, access to PPE and in some cases, where necessary, staffing support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to advise the Deputy that there has been ongoing engagement with Nursing Homes Ireland, the representative body for private nursing homes, at Ministerial and Official level.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300133#WRLL05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":1955,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300133#WRLL05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1956,"qnumday":694,"qnumall":"[9337\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300133#WRLL06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the restrictions in place to prevent minors from purchasing paracetamol tablets in supermarkets and other retail units at self-service tills and other such checkouts; his plans to introduce measures to prevent the abuse of such purchasing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1957,"content":"<p>There is no prohibition, on age grounds, as regards the retail sale of paracetamol-containing products.

These regulations provide that paracetamol may only be supplied, without prescription, from pharmacies and non-pharmacy outlets, subject to certain restrictions on presentation and quantities that may be supplied.<\/p><p>Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market, the manufacturer must seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), or in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Restrictions on the sale of medicines are based on their licensed indications and the indicated patient population, as contained in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC). The SmPC is a legal document that forms part of the authorisation for a medicine.<\/p><p>The HPRA is the competent authority for the regulation of medicines in Ireland and is responsible for determining the method of sale and supply of a medicine.

There is generally no prohibition, on age grounds, as regards the retail sale of medicines because the medicines are normally indicated for use in minors as well as adults.\u00a0<\/p><p>However, in non-pharmacy outlets the pack sizes available are restricted under the legislation to:<\/p><p>- 12 or fewer dosage units, each of which contains more than 120mg of paracetamol but not more than 500mg of paracetamol<\/p><p>- 10 or fewer dosage units, each of which contains more than 500mg of paracetamol but not more than 600mg of paracetamol<\/p><p>In the case of a medicine intended for use in children under 6 years of age:<\/p><p>- Packs must contain 12 or fewer dosage units, each of which contains no more than 120mg of paracetamol<\/p><p>- Pack size of liquid forms should contain 60ml or less with no more than 120mg of paracetamol contained in 5ml<\/p><p>In addition to these requirements, a non-pharmacy retailer may only supply one pack of a paracetamol medicine per sales transaction.<\/p><p>In recent years the HPRA has highlighted to retailers the need to adhere to the legal requirements with respect to selling paracetamol and to ensure that all staff are aware of the restrictions that apply.

To inform the development of the paper, HIQA provided an information framework document to the team on March 30th. A variety of potential risks were identified. These included the risk of small providers, access to infection prevention and control (IPC) advice, access to PPE and timely access to testing. Following consideration of the paper referred to at the above NPHET meeting of 31st March, NPHET requested HIQA to risk assess all nursing homes\u00a0and liaise with relevant national and regional governance structures as necessary in light of mitigating actions. This was part of an overall\u00a0package of public health measures recommended following this meeting.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At the NPHET meeting 17th April an action was agreed that &lsquo;HIQA publishes and assesses a COVID-19 Quality Assurance Regulatory Framework&rsquo;. This Framework has been designed to ensure that providers\u00a0are prepared for, and have contingency plans in place for, an outbreak of COVID-19.\u00a0As part of the programme HIQA has developed a self-assessment tool for nursing home providers. This self-assessment tool sets out the minimum standard required to effectively respond to an outbreak of COVID-19 in a designated centre. This involves a self-assessment by the registered provider and an onsite assessment by inspectors of social services to verify the provider&rsquo;s compliance against specified regulations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  If further action is required by the registered provider to ensure compliance with the specified regulations, a compliance plan will be issued to the registered provider by the inspector of social services following the in-site assessment.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300134#WRMM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabilities Assessments","counter":1980,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300134#WRMM01000"},{"type":"question","counter":1981,"qnumday":704,"qnumall":"[9398\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300134#WRMM01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures that will be implemented to reduce the perceived unacceptable waiting times in relation to assessment of needs in counties Cavan and Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1982,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of an Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of the Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients. \u00a0<\/p><p>The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs.\u00a0<\/p><p>Under the agreement payment to the private hospitals\u00a0is on a cost only Open Book model whereby the hospitals\u00a0are to be\u00a0reimbursed only for the operating costs properly incurred during the period. The costs that will be covered will be limited to normal costs of operating the hospital. While the private hospitals are paid a monthly sum equal to 80% of estimated monthly costs, the hospitals will only receive their actual operating costs when these have been verified. The final cost will be verified by independent firms of accountants appointed by the HSE and the private hospitals and there will be an arbitration mechanism in place in the event of any disagreement.\u00a0As the\u00a0funding of the agreement is based on cost  recovery,\u00a0validated costs will not be available until the agreement  is completed, however\u00a0it is estimated that the cost of the agreement will be of  the order of &euro;300m.<\/p><p>As the hospitals are private enterprises, the detailed information regarding payments to individual hospitals or hospital groups is commercially sensitive and therefore in line with the Heads of Terms regarding confidentiality these details will not be published. In the interests of transparency, it is intended to publish summary financial information regarding the arrangement in due course.\u00a0<\/p><p>The HSE has been working with National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to establish a mechanism to allow for return of electronic data from Private Hospitals.

Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.

The government must next review and approve the policy at which point the policy can then be published. This policy was developed following a process of research into international innovation and best practice in the field of mental health and an extensive national consultation of over 1,000 service users, family members, friends and carers, and other stakeholders. The revised policy contains an implementation roadmap that organises recommendations into short (0-6 months); medium (6-18 months) and long term (beyond 18 months) actions that will be costed within the various time frames allocated. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The revised policy recommends the establishment of a National Monitoring and Implementation Committee (NIMC) to oversee the implementation of the policy over the next ten years. In addition, the policy recommends that a national mental health and wellbeing strategy be developed by Healthy Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health would consider that the process which led to the finalisation of the new policy was very comprehensive as regards research and consultation, including detailed engagement with the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Mental Health and with many other stakeholders, and therefore a high-level taskforce is not warranted at this stage. Our focus now is on setting up a focussed comprehensive implementation process with the HSE, once the new policy is approved by Government. <\/p>  <p>  However, in view of the recent requests, the Department of Health proposes that such a task force could be established as a sub-committee of the NIMC and work with the members of the Healthy Ireland mental health promotion strategy group to expand provision of existing Covid-19 interventions.<\/p>  <p>  This approach maximises collaboration and efficiency and ensures a strong implementation focus while minimising duplication of work, given that the proposed taskforce would carry out similar work to developments already afoot. Additionally, as the same personnel who have been involved in the above developments are likely to be involved in future developments going forward, this avoids duplication and creates space for mental health plans to be created without risk of overlap. The development of such a structure would take account of priority needs identified during and following Covid-19. <\/p>  <p>  With regards to the provision of mental health services during Covid-19, a planning Group (HSE, Department of Health, NGO sector) has been established to plan for additional current and\/or anticipated needs as the crisis extends in duration. There are existing HSE guidelines, published in 2014, on &lsquo;Psychosocial and Mental Health Needs following Major Emergencies&rsquo;.\u00a0 \u00a0These guidelines recognise that prior to, during and following national emergencies there would be a need to support certain members of the population with their emotional, cognitive, social and physical needs.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is continuing to provide all community services, in so far as possible, while following Covid-19 guidelines to ensure the protection of patients and staff. At present, there is a range of existing services which offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. These include Samaritans, Pieta House, MyMind, Turn2Me; Aware, Crisis Text Ireland, Shine, BeLongTo, LGBT Ireland, Jigsaw, Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.\u00a0 NGOs currently funded by the HSE are being supported and encouraged to develop updated responses to the Covid-19 outbreak. Details of these services are listed on the HSE website, www.yourmentalhealth.ie, and information on available services is also provided through the free mental health telephone information line, 1800 111888. <\/p>  <p>  In order to respond to the anticipated additional needs of the population during this crisis, additional online services are being delivered to support the population, including online counselling, expanded crisis textline support and online life skills training, building on existing pilot schemes and developments in digital mental health in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300135#WRNN05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Public Health Emergency Team","counter":2094,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300135#WRNN05200"},{"type":"question","counter":2095,"qnumday":742,"qnumall":"[9589\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300135#WRNN05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide all the minutes of the expert advisory group, the advices and position papers provided to NPHET and the minutes of the vulnerable and elderly subgroup of NPHET as previously requested through the Covid enquiries line and directly with the CMO at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2096,"content":"<p>The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) was established on 27 January last in response to the emergence of Covid-19 in Wuhan, China.

There is limited national discretion available to Member States in relation to a number of the Regulation's provisions.\u00a0It is not, however,\u00a0open to any Member State\u00a0to seek a derogation on the implementation date of this Regulation.<\/p>  <p>  In 2004, European legislation established a requirement that all veterinary medicinal products that are intended for use in food-producing animals should be subject to a veterinary prescription.\u00a0 However, a 2006 EU Directive allowed for the maintenance of non-prescription status for certain veterinary medicinal products which did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment, and which met the specified criteria for exemption from veterinary prescription. Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006\/130\/EC at the time and antiparasitics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription.<\/p>  <p>  There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019\/6.\u00a0However, since that time, worldwide knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of antiparasitics has changed.\u00a0 For example, antiparasitic resistance has been widely reported in parasites of livestock species in Ireland and globally, resistance is developing year-on-year and is now a significant animal health issue.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, the Health Product Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (HPRA) Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines (ACVM) established a Task Force to review the method of supply of antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products that are intended for food-producing animals against the criteria set out in Regulation 2019\/6.\u00a0 A copy of the Report is available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website\u00a0www.hpra.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The Report states that the available scientific evidence shows that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019\/6. It also states that a consequence of this determination is that any such products that are supplied without veterinary prescription will need to be upregulated to supply under veterinary prescription.

The Teagasc report examines the effect of price decrease scenarios\u00a0on family farm incomes but is not forecasting price decreases or their extent.<\/p>  <p>  The report's analysis of a range of scenarios (price decreases of 10, 15 &amp;amp; 20%) finds that income across the sector as a whole could,\u00a0in the scenarios examined, drop\u00a0relative to the income forecast for 2020 (in the absence of the COVID-19); impacts on sector incomes could range from a drop of 22% (&euro;0.7 billion) to as much as 50% (&euro;1.6 billion). <\/p>  <p>  As an essential service, the agri-food processing, manufactruring and retail sector has remained open and functioning over the period. However, the Irish agri-food sector exports some 90% of production. The food service industry across Europe is experiencing a near-total collapse in demand due to the temporary shutdown of the hospitality sector. While food retail demand has increased, it is not offsetting the decline in food services. This demand imbalance has significant consequences for primary producers and agri-food businesses. Prices to date have dropped; beef by about 8% and dairy by 6%. The recovery of food services and export markets globally are vital for the Irish agri-food sector. We will continue to monitor the actual outcome.<\/p>  <p>  The agri-food sector is an essential part of the economic and social fabric of Ireland, especially in rural and coastal areas. I am working with all the agri-food stakeholders and ensuring that the sector, as our largest indigenous industry, is considered as part of the ongoing whole-of-Government response. <\/p>  <p>  The response to the economic impacts on the sector should include a strong, shared EU response, using the instruments available in the Common Agricultural Policy. I have already highlighted to Commissioner Wojciechowski the serious consequences for farmers and the food industry and the need to ensure that the full range of market supports available under the Common Market Organisation Regulation are made available. Following Ireland&rsquo;s efforts in leading an agreed EU-27 statement on the need for further supports, the Commission have introduced Aids to Private Storage for Dairy (SMP, Butter, Cheese), Beef and Sheepmeat.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am also working with my colleagues in Government to ensure that all businesses, including those in the agri-food sector, get access to suitable supports, and the measures in place are being kept under review. <\/p>  <p>  Working with my colleague Minister Humphreys, I have ensured that up to &euro;180 million in new lending capacity is available for the agri-food sector:\u00a0 40% of the &euro;250 million COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme will be available for food businesses. Similarly, 40% of an additional &euro;200 million tranche of the Future Growth Loan Scheme will be ring fenced to provide long-term investment support for farmers, fishers and food businesses.\u00a0 I continue to liaise with the banks on liquidity for the primary sector, and also want to highlight the availability of working capital assistance to farmers and fishers through Microfinance Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Loan. We will continue to keep the finance needs of the whole agri-food sector under review.<\/p>  <p>  I have already provided\u00a0&euro;85m in supports for the beef sector in Budget 2020.\u00a0 This includes a &euro;45 million provision for the\u00a0Beef Data and Genomics Programme and &euro;35m for a\u00a0Beef Environmental Efficiency Programme (Sucklers), which will deliver a maximum payment of &euro;90 per suckler cow for the first 10 cows, and &euro;80\/head thereafter. <\/p>  <p>  Conscious of the cash flow pressures on farms at present, I have brought forward &euro;26m in GLAS payments by a month.\u00a0 Balancing payments under the Organic Farming scheme have also been brought forward. I have also increased funding in my Department&rsquo;s Calf Welfare Investment Scheme from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;4 million, to assist farmers with extra calves.\u00a0 A range of practical flexibilities have been introduced in departmental schemes, including, for example, the extension of completion deadlines for TAMS by 3 months, and the submission for Nitrates records to the end of June. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and agencies will continue to monitor the impacts on the agri-food sector as the situation evolves, and to provide appropriate supports to the sector.\u00a0 My Department remains in constant contact with stakeholders right across the sector to share information on emerging issues and contingency planning, and we will continue to develop appropriate supports as the situation evolves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300137#WRPP01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1454"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":2212,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300137#WRPP02000"},{"type":"question","counter":2213,"qnumday":781,"qnumall":"[9372\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300137#WRPP02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on reviewing the tie-up scheme and the fact that the current start date of 1 June 2020 fails to recognise the previous six months of hardship suffered by the fishing industry due to the Covid-19 crisis.","asker":"1525","askee":"1454"},{"type":"question","counter":2214,"qnumday":782,"qnumall":"[9373\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300137#WRPP02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the tie-up scheme provides for retrospection; and the steps he is taking following the amended EU Regulation 2020\/560 of 23 April 2020 with specific measures to mitigate the impact of the Covid\u201019 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector.","asker":"1525","askee":"1454"},{"type":"question","counter":2215,"qnumday":783,"qnumall":"[9374\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300137#WRPP02300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason for the tie-up period of one month; and the way in which it is envisaged this period will relate to the objective of removing oversupply of product on the market.","asker":"1525","askee":"1454"},{"type":"question","counter":2216,"qnumday":784,"qnumall":"[9375\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300137#WRPP02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason he did not adopt proposals of applying 30% of the full grossing of the vessel in the same period in 2019 in view of the fact that this approach is being implemented in other jurisdictions.","asker":"1525","askee":"1454"},{"type":"speech","counter":2217,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 781 to 784, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's primary objective for our seafood sector throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic has been to maintain fishing activity so as\u00a0to ensure critical food supply lines to the domestic and European markets. For this reason,\u00a0the Government classified fishing as an essential service and kept the fishery harbours and related support services open throughout the Pandemic. This remains the primary Government objective in relation to the fishing industry.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the disruptions to international seafood markets arising from the Covid-19 Pandemic and the impacts on our export markets and prices for our seafood.\u00a0 There are, of course, similar impacts across the food sector and indeed the wider economy.\u00a0 I have met with representatives of the fishing\u00a0sector on a number of occasions throughout March and April to discuss how Government can assist the sector in this difficult period, bearing in mind Government's objectives outlined above, the universal income supports being made available by Government\u00a0which are open\u00a0to fishermen, and not least the capacity of Government to provide special supports to any one sector of our economy when businesses across the economy are facing many similar difficulties.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In response to intense lobbying from Member States and industry, the European Union amended the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Regulation to make certain types of supports specifically relating to the impacts of Covid-19 eligible for EMFF aid under Member State's\u00a0Operational Programmes, together with the existing array of supports for capital investment, innovation, marketing, and professional advisory services. However, no additional EU funds were made available to Member States to assist in implementing the new measures, so our\u00a0capacity to use these measures is subject to the level of uncommitted funds remaining in Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF Programme, and to the availability of uncommitted funds in BIM&rsquo;s 2020 budget.\u00a0 It is important to note that BIM continues to pay out on grants previously awarded and seafood enterprises continue to apply for new EMFF grants, including some that cite Covid-19 as the reason for their proposed projects.<\/p>  <p>  One of the measures made available by the EU in\u00a0 response to the Pandemic is aid for temporary tie-up of fishing vessels and, in my meetings with fishing representatives, selective tie-up aid was the overwhelming request for support in order to reduce the amount of fish being brought to market to match supply with demand and support prices.\u00a0 In response to those requests, I announced a Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme on 8 May with three one-month tie up periods to commence\u00a0on 1 June\u00a0and end on 31 August.\u00a0 I will be reviewing the Scheme at the end of each month to ensure it is achieving its objectives and that market conditions continue to warrant its operation.\u00a0\u00a0It is necessary that each tie-up period is consistent with the fisheries quota management regime which makes quotas available to each vessel for a one month period.\u00a0 Given the\u00a0objective of the scheme, it would not be appropriate to have vessels tie-up for say two weeks with tie-up aid\u00a0and then land their quota in the remaining two weeks.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Bearing in the mind the universal income supports being made available by Government and the banking measures that assist fishing enterprises with vessel mortgages and other borrowings during the Pandemic, there was widespread acceptance by fishing representatives in our discussions that a tie-up scheme should assist only the fixed costs of vessel owners while tied up.\u00a0 The Scheme I have put in place supports 100% of the fixed costs of fishing vessels across eight size categories and these figures come from the official EU Data Collection statistics gathered by BIM from information submitted by the fleet on their fixed costs.\u00a0 I am aware of the proposal put forward by the Killybegs Fishermens Organisation,\u00a0that the Tie-up Scheme should provide aid equivalent to 30% of the gross earnings of vessels per month in 2019.\u00a0 However, that proposal is not consistent with aiding only the fixed costs of the vessels tie-up and would result in\u00a0very significant over-compensation of the vessels involved.\u00a0 In addition, it would cost many multiple of the funds available to me to support the entire seafood sector with the impacts of the Pandemic. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While the EU Regulation allows for the possibility that aid could be retrospective, this would do nothing to assist\u00a0in\u00a0 matching supply with demand or in supporting prices, as it would be aiding activities that have happened in the past.\u00a0 It is important to bear in mind that the Tie-up Scheme is not an income support scheme.\u00a0 The Government's Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Wage Subsidy Scheme\u00a0support the incomes of those who cannot work because of the Pandemic.\u00a0 Some other important considerations\u00a0arise from the EMFF Regulation, which requires that vessels receiving aid for tie-up cease all fishing activity for the\u00a0 period concerned and Member States are required by law to ensure this is the case.\u00a0 This cannot be verified retrospectively for the majority of the fleet which are not equipped with on-board vessel monitoring systems.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to aquaculture, my officials have met with\u00a0Aquaculture sector\u00a0representatives on a number of occasions, most recently on 22 May.\u00a0 It is worth recalling that aquaculture enterprises and their workers may avail of the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment or wage subsidy Scheme.\u00a0The representatives of the sector\u00a0agreed to reflect on the discussions and revert\u00a0with a further submission which will seek to demonstrate how their\u00a0enterprises are affected by the Pandemic in ways that are not common to businesses in the wider economy and which might warrant a special sector specific intervention by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300137#WRPP02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1454"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greyhound

For this reason,\u00a0the Government classified fishing as an essential service and kept the fishery harbours and related support services open throughout the Pandemic. This remains the primary Government objective in relation to the fishing industry.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the disruptions to international seafood markets arising from the Covid-19 Pandemic and the impacts on our export markets and prices for our seafood.\u00a0 There are, of course, similar impacts across the food sector and indeed the wider economy.\u00a0 I have met with representatives of the fishing\u00a0sector on a number of occasions throughout March and April to discuss how Government can assist the sector in this difficult period, bearing in mind Government's objectives outlined above, the universal income supports being made available by Government\u00a0which are open\u00a0to fishermen, and not least, the capacity of Government to provide special supports to any one sector of our economy when businesses across the economy are facing many similar difficulties.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In response to intense lobbying from Member States and industry, the European Union amended the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Regulation to make certain types of supports specifically relating to the impacts of Covid-19 eligible for EMFF aid under Member State's\u00a0Operational Programmes, together with the existing array of supports for capital investment, innovation, marketing, and professional advisory services. However, no additional EU funds were made available to Member States to assist in implementing the new measures, so our\u00a0capacity to use these measures is subject to the level of uncommitted funds remaining in Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF Programme, and to the availability of uncommitted funds in BIM&rsquo;s 2020 budget.\u00a0 It is important to note that BIM continues to pay out on grants previously awarded and seafood enterprises continue to apply for new EMFF grants, including some that cite Covid-19 as the reason for their proposed projects.<\/p>  <p>  One of the measures made available by the EU in\u00a0 response to the Pandemic is aid for temporary tie-up of fishing vessels and, in my meetings with fishing representatives, selective tie-up aid was the overwhelming request for support in order to reduce the amount of fish being brought to market to match supply with demand and support prices.\u00a0 In response to those requests, I announced a Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme on 8 May with three one-month tie up periods to commence\u00a0on 1 June\u00a0and end on 31 August.\u00a0 I will be reviewing the Scheme at the end of each month to ensure it is achieving its objectives and that market conditions continue to warrant its operation.\u00a0\u00a0It is necessary that each tie-up period is consistent with the fisheries quota management regime which makes quotas available to each vessel for a one month period.\u00a0 Given\u00a0the objective of the scheme, it would not be appropriate to have vessels tie-up for say two weeks with tie-up aid\u00a0and then land their quota in the remaining two weeks.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Bearing in the mind the universal income supports being made available by Government and the banking measures that assist fishing enterprises with vessel mortgages and other borrowings during the Pandemic, there was widespread acceptance by fishing representatives in our discussions that a tie-up scheme should assist only the fixed costs of vessel owners while tied up.\u00a0 The Scheme I have put in place supports 100% of the fixed costs of fishing vessels across eight size categories and these figures come from the official EU Data Collection statistics gathered by BIM from information submitted by the fleet on their fixed costs.\u00a0 I am aware of the proposal put forward by the Killybegs Fishermens Organisation\u00a0 that the Tie-up Scheme should provide aid equivalent to 30% of the gross earnings of vessels per month in 2019.\u00a0 However, that proposal is not consistent with aiding only the fixed costs of the vessels tie-up and would result in\u00a0very significant over-compensation of the vessels involved.\u00a0 In addition, it would cost many multiple of the funds available to me to support the entire seafood sector with the impacts of the Pandemic. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While the EU Regulation allows for the possibility that aid could be retrospective, this would do nothing to assist\u00a0in\u00a0 matching supply with demand or in supporting prices, as it would be aiding activities that have happened in the past.\u00a0 It is important to bear in mind that the Tie-up Scheme is not an income support scheme.\u00a0 The Government's Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Wage Subsidy Scheme\u00a0support the incomes of those who cannot work because of the Pandemic.\u00a0 Some other important considerations\u00a0arise from the EMFF Regulation, which requires that vessels receiving aid for tie-up cease all fishing activity for the\u00a0 period concerned and Member States are required by law to ensure this is the case.\u00a0 This cannot be verified retrospectively for the majority of the fleet which are not equipped with on-board vessel monitoring systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300137#WRPP06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1454"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Advertising","counter":2249,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300137#WRPP06100"},{"type":"question","counter":2250,"qnumday":796,"qnumall":"[9831\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300137#WRPP06200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount that has been spent on advertising in 2020 by his Department and its agencies on social media platforms (details supplied) in tabular form; and the name of each campaign advertised.","asker":"1514","askee":"1454"},{"type":"speech","counter":2251,"content":"<p>My Department provides\u00a0public information about\u00a0the Department's wide range of schemes, services and policies.

It is widely expected that, over the next number of years, the combination of improvements in technology, reductions in vehicle purchase prices, increasing driving ranges and model availabilities, coupled with Government incentives and new investment in the recharging network will maintain the current positive policy environment under which electric vehicle sales have risen steeply in recent years, albeit from a low base.<\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan therefore sets targets for electric and low emissions vehicles by 2030 as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the number of passenger EVs on the road to 840,000 (split between 550,000 BEVs and 290,000 PHEVs)<\/p>  <p>  - Reaching 95,000 electric vans and trucks <\/p>  <p>  - Procuring 1,200 low-emissions buses for public transport in cities<\/p>  <p>  Critically, the Plan expects the bulk of the shift to EVs (and the resulting emissions reduction) to occur in the second half of the next decade, when prices have fallen\u00a0in line with\u00a0technology development, and purchasing behaviour patterns have changed.

The legislation is the cornerstone of the EU&rsquo;s strategy to improve vehicle fuel economy and has driven car manufacturers to develop innovative energy efficient technologies. The regulations have iteratively been made more stringent, progressively decreasing EU fleet-wide average emissions along with increasing the availability of lower emission vehicles across the EU. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the coming decade, Regulation (EU) 2019\/631 sets CO2\u00a0emission performance standards to ensure that, by 2025 and 2030, the average emissions from new cars will be 15% and 37.5% lower, respectively, compared to 2021 levels.\u00a0 The Regulation is also structured to incentivise manufacturers to increase the production of zero- and low-emission vehicles. <\/p>  <p>  Achievement of these targets by manufactures will make an important contribution to both the EU and individual Member State\u00a0emissions reductions targets for 2030. Due to the absence of vehicle manufacturing here, Ireland will remain strongly dependent on continued action at an EU level in this respect.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this, Member States may introduce additional domestic policies and measures and impose more ambitious targets for specific sectors. The Climate Action Plan adopted by Government imposes specific and differentiated targets for individual sectors, based on an analysis of the most cost-effective split of emissions reductions across the economy in order to meet Ireland's emissions reduction targets for the 2021 - 2030 period. The Plan targets a 45% - 50% reduction in transport sector emissions by 2030 relative to existing projections.<\/p>  <p>  The new European Green Deal proposes that, by June 2021, the Commission will revise the legislation on CO2 emission performance standards for cars and vans, to ensure a clear pathway from 2025 onwards towards zero-emission mobility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300138#WRQQ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1549"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trading Online Voucher Scheme","counter":2287,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300138#WRQQ02600"},{"type":"question","counter":2288,"qnumday":808,"qnumall":"[8526\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300138#WRQQ02700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when the next tranche of funding will be made available under a scheme (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1549"},{"type":"question","counter":2289,"qnumday":820,"qnumall":"[9010\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300138#WRQQ02800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if his attention has been drawn to local authorities that are oversubscribed and or have exhausted grants regarding the &euro;2,500 trading online voucher (details supplied); if he will release further funding to local enterprise offices; if local enterprise offices have requested further funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1549"},{"type":"question","counter":2290,"qnumday":822,"qnumall":"[9043\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300138#WRQQ02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will issue local enterprise offices with an additional and increased allocation of trading online vouchers in view of the fact that there is a significant demand for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1549"},{"type":"speech","counter":2291,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 808, 820 and 822 together.  808,\u00a0822 and\u00a0820 together. <\/p><p><font color=\"#212121\">The Trading Online Voucher Scheme is funded by my Department and delivered nationwide in partnership with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and the 31 Local Enterprise Offices.

The measures in Ireland&rsquo;s management plan included closure of the eel fishery, improvement in water quality and assessment of barriers to migration.\u00a0 In addition a trap and transport initiative, employing experienced eel fishermen to transport migrating eels around ESB Hydro-electric plants was also initiated.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind that the European eel is a panmithic stock &ndash; a single stock across the entire continent - which spawns in the Sargasso Sea before arriving into European rivers and lakes.\u00a0 The distribution is naturally random between countries.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has followed the objective of the EU Regulation which aims to ensure\u00a0that escapement of eels to the sea should be at 40% relative to &ldquo;pristine conditions&rdquo; - those pertaining in the early 1980s which was the reference years selected. <\/p>  <p>  The scientific assessments carried out in each review and the recent EU proposals for a review and strengthening of the existing Eel Regulation do not support the assertion that elver runs are at a record level across Europe. <\/p>  <p>  The latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) is that the species remains critically endangered and that recruitment of juveniles in the Northern part of the Atlantic is currently at 1% relative to pristine conditions.\u00a0 The very latest international scientific advice is that anthropogenic (man-made) mortality should be kept at zero or as close to zero as possible. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In consideration of the economic and social impacts of the Eel Management Plan reported by fishermen, the Irish Government&rsquo;s Eel Support Scheme fund was made available from 2018 to all persons who were the holder of a State commercial public eel licence or an eel fishing permit in the 2007 season (the base year).\u00a0 The scheme provided payments to former fishermen based on their track record in the 5 year period 2003-2007.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300139#WRRR02475","answer":true,"speaker":"1482"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":2373,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300139#WRRR02500"},{"type":"question","counter":2374,"qnumday":840,"qnumall":"[9521\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300139#WRRR02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of the roll out of the broadband connection points nationally and in County Kildare specifically; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1586","askee":"1549"},{"type":"question","counter":2375,"qnumday":841,"qnumall":"[9522\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300139#WRRR02700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of the roll-out of the national broadband plan in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1586","askee":"1549"},{"type":"speech","counter":2376,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 840 and 841 together.<\/p><p><font color=\"#212121\">The government is committed to delivering high speed broadband to every home, farm, business and school in Ireland. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#212121\">The High Speed Broadband Map which is available at<\/font><i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i><font color=\"#212121\">shows the areas in\u00a0Kildare\u00a0which will be included in the National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led intervention as well as areas\u00a0targeted by commercial operators.

I can assure the Deputy that in the same manner that no sector was deliberately included, no sector was deliberately excluded. <\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the Taskforce will establish working groups to carry out specific tasks and that the Taskforce will undertake a widespread stakeholder consultation process whereby all sectors and interested parties will have an opportunity to provide constructive inputs and innovative ideas on how this vital sector to our economy can adapt and recover in a meaningful and sustainable way. The CTTC will have an opportunity to contribute to the work of the Taskforce in this way.<\/p>  <p>  I should also point out that in addition to the Tourism Recovery Taskforce, there are other fora whereby tourism stakeholders, including representatives from the coach sector, can contribute. Representatives from the sector have been invited to participate in F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Covid Advisory Group which meets on a weekly basis. Furthermore, officials on the Transport side in my Department are in regular contact with the CTTC in the context of the difficulties its members are facing as a result of the Covid crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300139#WRRR05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Services Provision","counter":2406,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300139#WRRR05900"},{"type":"question","counter":2407,"qnumday":850,"qnumall":"[8299\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300139#WRRR06000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the engagements he has had with the airline industry to ensure refunds of cancelled flight fees to customers will be made as quickly as possible and in line with the recommendation of the European Commission;

Public transport, including the small public service vehicle (SPSV) industry, remains an important service for those it has continued to carry, including essential workers and those making necessary journeys, and it will continue to play an important role in supporting Government&rsquo;s Roadmap to Reopening Society and Business in the weeks and months ahead.<\/p><p>That is why we have worked to introduce a wide programme of Government supports for impacted businesses.  The range of supports available includes new schemes of wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports for example. I also note that self-employed owner-operators of SPSVs may avail of the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment of &euro;350 a week.<\/p><p>The day-to-day regulation of the small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector is, of course, a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.<\/p><p>In its role as regulator, the NTA recognises the very difficult business environment that small public service vehicle (SPSV) operators are now dealing with and, as part of its response to this situation, has published information for the SPSV industry which includes guidelines, based on the latest available public health advice, on measures operators can take to reduce the spread of COVID-19.  This document is available on the NTA's website. <\/p><p>The NTA has also taken a number of important actions to reduce the immediate financial burden on SPSV operators. It has extended licences expiring before 12 June 2020 by three months, waived late licence renewal fees, and temporarily relaxed rules around vehicle age limits. The need for further measures will continue to be reviewed in the context of the Government's Roadmap to Reopening Society and Business<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>As industry regulator, issues relating to vehicle standards for SPSVs and insurance requirements for SPSVs come within the NTA&rsquo;s area of responsibility and I have, therefore, forwarded your correspondence to the Authority for consideration and direct reply. Please advise this office if you do not receive a response within 10 working days. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300140#WRSS03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cycling Facilities","counter":2455,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300140#WRSS03800"},{"type":"question","counter":2456,"qnumday":865,"qnumall":"[8368\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300140#WRSS03900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to provide cycle lanes on the N7 to and from Rathcoole; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":2457,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.\u00a0 Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the\u00a0planning, design, construction and upgrading\u00a0of individual national\u00a0roads\u00a0is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII),\u00a0in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred your question to TII for a direct reply.\u00a0\u00a0Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300140#WRSS04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety","counter":2458,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300140#WRSS04100"},{"type":"question","counter":2459,"qnumday":866,"qnumall":"[8369\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020060300140#WRSS04200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a location (details supplied) will be reviewed for safety for both cyclists and motorists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":2460,"content":"<p>As\u00a0Minister\u00a0for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have\u00a0responsibility\u00a0for policy and for the overall funding of\u00a0sustainable mobility.\u00a0<\/p><p>The\u00a0National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility in the Greater Dublin Area for the planning and development of\u00a0sustainable mobility\u00a0infrastructure, including cycling infrastructure.\u00a0<\/p><p>Noting the NTA's responsibility in this matter, I have\u00a0referred your question to\u00a0the NTA for a more detailed reply.
