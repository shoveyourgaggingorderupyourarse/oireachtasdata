Furthermore, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, task force report into antiparasitic resistance has highlighted the need to address effectively antiparasitic-resistance measures for cattle, sheep and horses using a multi-stakeholder approach.<\/p> <p>  The ILMA also welcomed the support for responsible persons, RPs, we employ at all licensed merchants' outlets from the Chief Veterinary Officer, CVO.  In his letter to the EU in June 2020, he not only affirmed that the existing route of supply and distribution were not associated with increased resistance and environmental damage but also that the RPs undertake a professional, internationally recognised qualification and training regime.<\/p> <p>  The committee is acutely aware of the consequences of failing to include the RP in the prescribing of antiparasitic medicines and has worked tirelessly with Ministers and stakeholders to find the solution.  The stark reality of these warnings was underlined by the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, last week, with the collapse and loss of more than 90% of intermammary sales to private vet practices and virtually no vet prescriptions given to farmers to use at co-operative stores, effectively creating a monopoly in this market.  This windfall of new businesses will multiply at least tenfold if antiparasitic medicines are allowed to go down the same vet-only prescribing channel.  Recognition of anti-competitiveness and accessibility was also noted in the CVO&rsquo;s letter to the EU.  He stated that if sales of these products were undertaken largely by veterinarians, the current competitive environment for these products would be significantly weakened.<\/p> <p>  The ILMA, as a stakeholder, has agreed that antiparasitic medicine prescriptions will be entered onto the national veterinary prescription system, NVPS, once the technology is available and working and that licensed merchants and RPs will invest time and money into systems compatible with the programme.  To this end, NVPS-prescribing terminals should be installed at all licensed merchants&rsquo; premises and the required technology training undertaken.  Continuing professional development programmes will also be introduced to ensure the best and most up-to-date advice is given to farmers on antiparasitic-resistance methods.<\/p> <p>  Close examination of the RP professional qualification, introduced in 2012, emphatically proves that the RP was meeting all EU-required criteria to avail of the derogation Article 105(4) at the time of its entry into force.  The qualification consists of an intensive, 100-hour course, with four hours of practical and written exams, and is accredited to an internationally recognised standard and approved by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As part of the course, a comprehensive prescribing protocol was introduced to help guard against the rising number of reports and trials showing anthelmintic resistance in cattle and sheep and environmental issues that needed urgent addressing.  The Department moved swiftly to include in the qualification many prescribing responsibilities on the dispenser, including record-keeping and all other information relevant to the sale and use of the appropriate products.  To this end, it is clear the Department accepts that the RPs are professionals.<\/p> <p>  In summary, the Department must retain a level playing field in the prescribing and dispensing of antiparasitic medicines and ensure they adhere to the expressed wishes of Irish MEPs, the recommendation of the HPRA report and the advice of the CVO, coupled with the unified support of all the stakeholders.<\/p><p>Compliance with the directive to enhance the internal market and increase the availability of veterinary medicinal products will thus met in full.  The RP must remain able to advise and deliver a consistent message on antiparasitic resistance measures, help preserve the life of the existing groups of available wormers and introduce responsible use measures across entrenched farming practises.  A holistic multi-pronged approach is nothing short of imperative if Ireland is to effectively address antiparasitic resistance.  A fresh solution has been offered to the Department that stakeholders believe has no legal impediment to its implementation and this is the only route of travel to resolve this outstanding issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022100500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ollie Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Fitzell to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022100500002#B00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the kind invitation to contribute to this discussion.  We look forward to highlighting the concerns of our members.  The IPU is the representative and professional organisation for more than 1,900 community pharmacies and more than 2,300 individual pharmacists.  Our vision is to be the authoritative voice of community pharmacy and a driving force in the evolution of accessible, equitable primary healthcare.  The sector employs 31,000 people directly and indirectly.  Of our members, in excess of 300 pharmacies operate dedicated professional services to animal owners through the supply of veterinary medicinal products, advice on their correct use and associated recording keeping and legislative requirements.<br\/><br\/>Pharmacists are trained healthcare professionals and are fully committed to the Government's one health strategy.  We are acutely aware of the serious global public health challenge presented by antimicrobial resistance, AMR, that we are facing not only from the perspective of medicines used in human health, animal health and welfare but also from our shared environment.  We are actively supporting initiatives such as the Pharmacy Antimicrobial Stewardship Network, which promotes the responsible and rational use of antimicrobials, including antiparasitics from the animal welfare perspective.  <br\/><br\/>The committee will be well aware of the current situation and, therefore, I will focus on our concerns and potential solutions.  Implementation of the regulation in its proposed format will have a myriad of unintended consequences.  The impact on antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products, VMPs, will be quite the opposite of that intended as stated in objective 5 of EU Regulation 2019\/6, which states: &quot;This Regulation aims to reduce the administrative burden, enhance the internal market, and increase the availability of veterinary medicinal products, whilst guaranteeing the highest level of public and animal health and environmental protection.&quot;  With regard to antiparasitic VMPs, we anticipate an increased administrative burden for all stakeholders, reduced competition in the sector, reduced availability of products, increased costs for animal owners, adverse impact on animal welfare, increased cross-Border trade due to different regulatory stances, reduced accountability of use, diminished food quality assurance, loss of services and jobs, reduced viability of essential small rural pharmacies that have a sizeable veterinary business and reduced compliance with the one health approach.  <br\/><br\/>The experience since the implementation of Regulation EU 2019\/6 came into effect on 28 January 2019 regarding VMPs other than antiparasitic medicines, which took effect in Ireland on 28 January 2022, has resulted in what can only be described as a seismic downturn in the dispensing of some prescription-only VMPs by pharmacists.  Intramammary antibiotic tubes have seen a downturn of between 80% and 90%, which is similar to that reported by ICOS last week.  Some prescription-only veterinary vaccines, dispensing and supplies from pharmacies have decreased by 50% to 60% over the same period.  We understand that veterinary pharmaceutical manufacturers and suppliers have not reported any differential in the Irish market.  It is our assumption that pharmacists, licensed merchants and co-operatives have all experienced a significant downturn in their business and this business has migrated elsewhere.  The critical factor is the absence of veterinary prescriptions for the aforementioned products.  <br\/><br\/>The IPU along with other stakeholders was assured that the NVPS would achieve the objectives of reduced administrative burden, enhanced market and increased availability of VMP prescriptions and VMP choices for animal owners.  Despite the best intentions and efforts, the NVPS has been beset by challenges, one of the most significant hurdles to date being the lack of engagement by veterinarians.  Other challenges that we have encountered with the current NVPS solution are an initial lack of engagement with pharmacists and other end users to gather essential user requirements before design; no integration with prescribing or dispensing systems in pharmacies; the need for double administrative activities when dispensing to comply with legal requirements; no facility to amend a record, which is essential before this solution comes into place; no facility for generic substitution; no engagement by veterinarians; slow response time to queries raised regarding the solution; no facility to print a pharmacy information label to attach to the VMP to meet pharmacy legal requirements; the fact that no pharmacies have been registered to use this system despite submitting registration forms for access; and the fact that the system is set to pharmacist level, not pharmacy level, which is highly problematic when it comes to our record-keeping requirements. <br\/><br\/>Regarding our recommended solutions, resolution of the impasse regarding prescribing antiparasitic VMPs can be achieved by retrospectively amending SI 786\/2007 European Communities (Animal Remedies) (No. 2) Regulations 2007.  Precedent exists throughout the Statute Book of such retrospective amendments.  Article 105(4) of EU Regulation 2019\/6 provides a derogation designed for precisely this purpose.  It is intended to facilitate professionals other than veterinarians to issue veterinary prescriptions, where such individuals will qualify to do so at the time the regulation entered into force.  The availability and potential application of the derogation were confirmed in September 2020 by Ms Stella Kyriakides on behalf of the EU Commission in response to letters from Chris McManus, MEP and Martin Blake, Chief Veterinary Officer.  In summary, this means that Ireland can confirm by means of submission that the terms of the derogation have been met by virtue of the retrospective amendment of SI 786\/2007.<br\/><br\/>The IPU call on the committee to delay further implementation of the regulation and the associated Bill until the NVPS is fit for purpose; ensure the completion or sharing of the HPRA task force recommended impact assessment as we are not sure whether it has been completed; design and implement an education programme for the animal owners to address this serious issue, as highlighted by at last week's meeting of this committee and as proven by UK studies, this measure was the most successful; consult pharmacists on a multi-actor stakeholder approach to be taken to elaborate national guidelines for sustainable parasite control, including the development of consistent scientifically-based advice on targeted selective treatments; and ensure that involve all stakeholders involved in the prescribing and dispensing of antiparasitic VMPs are provided with access to training-continuous professional development on sustainable parasite control as recommended by the HPRA task force.  <br\/><br\/>Removing pharmacists and responsible persons from their prescribing roles in the supply of antiparasitics will result in the loss of the holistic approach previously favoured by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and required as part of the one health strategy.  Collaboration is the key to ensuring that the focus on compliance and patient-animal safety is maintained as part of the safe and responsible use of antiparasitics.  To this end, the <i>status quo<\/i>in the supply route should be maintained and we respectfully suggest that the committee plays a significant role in ensuring this equity.  I thank members for your time.

I have a statement that I can read out, if that is okay.<br\/><br\/>Merchants' co-operatives and agri-retailers around the country have aligned their businesses in a way that best serves Irish farmers.  The resulting landscape of the agri-retail trade in Ireland means that there are businesses of varying size across the country, but the core principles of these businesses remains similar across the board, with sales of fertiliser and animal health products playing a fundamental role in the economic survival of their businesses.  Merchants and co-operatives around the country are acutely aware of the sustainability requirements set on the agricultural industry as a whole and they are willing to put their shoulder to the wheel.  These businesses employ a significant number of suitably qualified people across the industry that they service, including nutritionists, agronomists, RPs for animal health, specialists for human-consumable foods, and so on.  Many are qualified to a reasonable level, including to level 8, level 9, and even to PhD level.  Farmers rely on these people for expertise and advice to maximise efficiency on their farms.<br\/><br\/>It is imperative for the industry that all of these businesses are kept economically viable so that the trade can continue to provide its far-reaching service to farmers.  These businesses and the people who work there will be crucial to providing services, expertise, advice and knowledge to farmers as we all embark on the journey to reduce emissions from the sector without compromising output.<br\/><br\/>The implementation of the veterinary medicinal products medicated feed and fertilisers regulation Bill 2022 in its current form threatens the viability of many agri-retail businesses around the country and, in turn, also threatens the jobs of the many people with specific qualifications whom I have outlined.  If the sale of animal health products is taken away from many of the smaller merchants around the country, then those businesses will become unviable and close their doors, leaving farmers with no option but to look further afield for the services and advice that they require.<br\/><br\/>I will note some issues with the Bill in its current form.  With regard to the North of Ireland and the Border, there is free trade and movement of goods on the island of Ireland under historic agreements.  While the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine correctly maintains that it cannot impose legislation on the North of Ireland, it makes it quite difficult to successfully implement legislation on one side of the Border.  Fertiliser has been traded across the Border for many years by both farmers and agri-retailers.  Until recently, this has tended to happen in just the Border counties.  However, this has extended much farther with commercialisation.  If farmers in County Cork want a load of fertiliser from a retailer in the North of Ireland, all they have to do is make a phone call and the fertiliser will land in their yard within days.  It would be incredibly naive for anyone to think that farmers who are pushing boundaries will not use this angle to avoid recording some of their fertiliser purchases.<br\/><br\/>While we have been involved and engaged with the Department through stakeholder meetings, it seems that the current route of travel regarding the IT requirements of agri-retailers is overly comprehensive.  There are currently two proposed ways by which the Department will accept sales information.  In one, merchants have a responsibility to input fertiliser sales data into the <i>agfood.ie<\/i>portal, transaction by transaction.  This is a laborious and tedious process.<br\/><br\/>The second option is for the Department's IT system to link with agri-retail systems through the use of an API, which will cost a significant amount for agri-retailers that have meticulous and secure IT systems.  It would potentially force smaller merchants away from fertiliser sales, since they may not have the IT systems or resources to implement this Bill in their businesses.  Some of these smaller businesses still use pen and paper to record sales.  The API to link IT systems has yet to be disclosed to the trade, leaving very tight timeframes for it to be ready and successful.  The requirement for the Department's IT system to link with the IT systems of agri-retailers for the purposes of the legislation seems to be overly comprehensive.  A simple monthly reporting mechanism, where data can be exported to a .csv file and sent to the Department, which can use its IT system to seamlessly extract the required data, is a far more feasible solution that would not incur the huge costs and potential security problems that can arise from IT systems linking together.<br\/><br\/>In summary, agri-retailers around the country have many concerns about the Bill in its entirety.  However, the availability of goods from the North of Ireland puts most aspects of the Bill in question.  An all-Ireland approach would be better, if possible, or at least we could have the same processes in place on both sides of the Border, with RPs on both sides.<br\/><br\/>Merchants throughout the country have a full understanding of why the Bill is being introduced.  It will address water quality and emissions from fertiliser and antiparasitic resistance, which is an animal health issue.  All businesses are willing to achieve what is required to make our island a better place.  However, an increasing financial burden is being placed on agri-retailer businesses across the country, including administrative, IT system, and staff training costs.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine can take pathways to successfully implement this Bill.  It seems that we are going down an overly comprehensive route for both the anti-parasitic medication and fertiliser issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022100500002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>That was a comprehensive answer.<\/p> <p>  I have questions for the IPU.

All pharmacists spend at least four years in university, with one year of postgraduate study.  Their training is essentially about pharmaceuticals.  All pharmaceuticals are common for both humans and animals.  Many pharmaceuticals at the core of this discussion, mainly antiparasitics, are routinely supplied by pharmacists in community pharmacies in their everyday jobs.  That is done in a competent manner because those pharmacists have done five years of study.  A human is a different species from a cow or sheep but the drugs and medicines are the same.  There are different dose rates for each species but the same principle applies to each species.  Some pharmacists have undertaken postgraduate masters' degrees in veterinary pharmacy.  All pharmacists undertake continuing professional development and continuing education annually, which is regulated and monitored in Ireland.  As a component of that, I as a veterinary pharmacist undertake veterinary pharmacy as part of my continuing professional development.<\/p><p>Pharmacists have a considerable knowledge in that regard and that builds upon their core education as pharmacists.  In discussion of medicines, the pharmacist really should be the top of the tree because they are the experts on medicines.  We work in primary healthcare with our doctors, nurses and physiotherapists in a collaborative practise so that everybody works as part of that team for the optimum outcome for the healthcare of the patient.  It would be nice to apply the same principle to veterinary medicine and that there would be a collaborative effort involving the veterinarians, the veterinarian nurses, the pharmacists, the responsible persons and the farmer - the animal owner at the end of the day.  We all have a responsibility to sustain these medicines so that we get the best outcome from them and animal welfare is primary to our input.<br\/><br\/>To address the Senator's second question, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, established a task force back in 2019 to review these medicines.  It became apparent subsequent to its review that there were issues with regard to the antiparasitic medicines.  There were issues of resistance, within the different parasites, to the particular medicines, that had become apparent since the previous review occasion.  That meant that the exemption Ireland had availed of when SI 785\/2007 - Infectious Diseases Maintenance Allowance (Increased Payment) Regulations, 2007 was implemented, an exemption for prescription status for these medicines recommended by Europe because Ireland had no evidence at that stage of any resistance, had changed.<br\/><br\/>Come the review by the HPRA expert task force, a group of seven experts from different backgrounds including the Department of agriculture, University College Dublin, Teagasc and various other sources, decreed that because there was evidence of resistance in that incidence, the antiparasitics had to be upgraded to a prescription-only medicine.  As pharmacists, I referred earlier to the fact that we counter prescribe antiparasitic medicines for our human patients on a regular basis.  To extend that, as a veterinary pharmacist, I have counter prescribed, or de facto prescribed, these same medicines in my practice for over 30 years, as have many of my colleagues and the responsible persons who are suitably trained in that regard.<br\/><br\/>In essence, what we have been doing is prescribing these medicines in response to the symptoms presented by the animal owner or the animal keeper whereby we use a protocol and ask a routine series of questions.  As pharmacists, we ask who the patient is; what the background is; whether there have been any other medication supplied; the cohort species; the weight; and the background details that are required.  We establish a picture and are not making a diagnoses but respond to the symptoms and use the data that is available.  Nowadays, this data is routinely available be it a fecal egg count test, a bulk milk sample test or post mortem results.  We can use this data as can my colleagues who are responsible persons, to make a judicious decision or recommendation and on the back of that, we direct a course of treatment.<br\/><br\/>The word &quot;prescribe&quot; is derived from Latin.  It is a long time since I did Latin under the auspices of Father Flannan and I was not his top scholar but <i>scribere<\/i>is to write and <i>pre scribere<\/i>is &quot;direct to write&quot;.  When we put that in context in modern English, we are actually writing a direction and that is what we have been doing.  We have been giving a direction.  Even though it was not written into the statute in 2007, we have been doing that in practice as far back as the last 20 years.  I would like that to be taken into consideration by this committee and hopefully we will progress on.

The first is in respect of the evidence we have now heard from the co-op sector, the licensed merchants sector and the pharmacy sector in that the sales of veterinary medical products that fall under the regulations currently implemented across all three sectors, have essentially reduced from somewhere in the region of 60% to 90%.<\/p> <p>  If I am correct, and this can be clarified, the evidence from the Irish Pharmacy Union is that overall sales have not actually reduced.  Essentially there were four sectors, including the witnesses' own three and the vets that dealt with these products.  In three of the four sectors, sales have reduced dramatically and in one they have increased dramatically.  The question I have is whether the various organisations have raised that issue with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, or whether they have any intention of doing so because it appears to me that legislation and regulation is actually distorting the market,   On the evidence that the witness groups have now, can the representatives say with authority that the new regulations, if implemented in their current guise, would have the same proportional impact in terms of sales across the other products that would be included?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022100500002#D00300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>One of the figures that has not been mentioned is the 300 prescription-only medicines a licensed merchant can currently stock.  The majority of licensed merchants do not stock any of those products because they failed to secure prescriptions from veterinary practitioners.  The national sales trend on that range of prescription-only medicines is that less than half of 1% are sold by licensed merchants premises.  In reality, the figures provided by the Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society, ICOS, applied to licensed merchants but a long time ago.  We have been squeezed out of a substantial part of the retail industry already.  The majority of licensed merchants focus on the sale of antiparasitics, be they for the treatment for internal or external parasites.  Some 80% of my turnover is antiparasitics.<\/p> <p>  One of the things we have looked at over a long period of time is to try to get a financial or regulatory impact assessment of how this will impact the licensed merchant industry.  The bottom line is that the majority of licensed merchants, people like me who focus strictly on antiparasitics, would close.  My estimation is that my own business would be closed within a period of six to 12 months.  My turnover would collapse, it would be no longer profitable and I would have to close my door and walk away.  Other merchants who may be involved in the sale of agrichemicals, fertilisers or feeds would obviously exit the veterinary medicines industry and focus on other aspects of their business.<\/p> <p>  The important thing in all of this is that every business closure and every job loss is a blow to rural Ireland.  I live in rural Ireland.  I service part of west Cork and south Kerry: the Iveragh Peninsula, the Beara Peninsula, the Sheep's Head Peninsula and the Mizen Head Peninsula which is as rural as you can get.  We do see tourists in the summer but there is a lot of winter there.  Every single job in important.  My business is important to me and it is our only source of income, our only livelihood.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the financial impact assessment, the IMA carried out such an assessment on our members and I will give an example of the results that came back from two counties.  One of the counties had 12 licensed merchants in total.  Some 11 of those engaged in the survey.  Four of these businesses would close in their entirety, seven would exit the sales of veterinary medicines, and no business would continue to trade.  In another county with 11 merchants, there would be two business closures, seven would exit the industry to focus on other aspects of their business, and one of the businesses would survive.  In two counties then, where there are 22 licensed merchants premises, there would be one remaining.  If this was replicated in the farming and the co-op industry, all of a sudden where there was competition with maybe two licensed merchants-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022100500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I will cut across Mr. O'Shea because I am going to end up not getting an answer to an important question.

It is my understanding that when those businesses are being sold for the medicine side of it being looked into, which gives you more money to be quite frank about it.  It makes it more valuable.

Corporates are active in buying veterinary practices throughout Ireland.  There is no doubt about that.  Like anybody who buys a business, if you invest a substantial amount of money in buying a business, you are looking for a return.  You get a return from your business by doing two things, namely, by increasing sales and by increasing margin.  If the current proposal was carried through as it is proposed at the moment, that would move the emphasis of the sales to veterinary practices.  That would be the way they would increase their volume of business.  If you end up in a situation whereby only one stakeholder group is involved in the supply of any product, it would be anti-competitive.  That would be the word to describe it.  You can dominate the market and you can create whichever price you wish.  Remember that if a corporate owns it, it does not take over one veterinary practice, but a group of veterinary practices that are geographically near to one another so that it can dominate a certain sector of the industry in the county or the county in its entirety.  It then has the ability.  Everybody becomes a customer of that veterinary practice and the veterinary practice becomes the only entity that can issue a prescription.  It will then hold all the key cards in its hand to issue the prescription.  It will carry out the diagnosis, it will prescribe the product and it will also supply it.  The world really is its oyster.  As the Deputy can appreciate, when a customer is standing at the counter, he or she is getting a product that cannot be supplied anywhere else.  Then, obviously, the ability of the retailer to get an increased margin is presenting itself.  Anybody who is commercially driven will take the margin.  Does that pick up on the point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022100500002#E01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daragh Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I want to go back the question that was asked about the legal advice that was given on the fact that responsible persons could not dispense prescriptions.  It is quite difficult because we do not have all of the information.  We have not seen the advice but we also do not know exactly what was the question that was asked at the particular time.<\/p> <p>  The licensed merchants, co-operatives and ourselves all want to know if the derogation will apply to us because we were prescribing.  When you go back to 2007, the way the tradition of veterinary medicines, including the anti-parasitics, have been supplied was by us dispensing or de facto prescribing or whatever way one would like to describe it.  The general consensus seems to be that we need a solution to the situation that we are in at the moment.  The only way to get a solution and to have everything in place for the projected date, which is 1 December, is to have a strong regime in place to protect anthelmintics.  This is only going to be achieved with a collaborative approach.  There are four main stakeholders in the situation we are in at the moment.  Three of these four are suffering and we need to look at how the four groups can work together.<\/p> <p>  The UK was able to halve the sales of antibiotics for food-producing animals just by collaboration between the Government and the stakeholders.  This is what we need to do.  I would like to see, if it is possible, either the Minister or this committee contacting the Attorney General to specifically ask how this derogation comes into play for licensed merchants, responsible persons and pharmacists.  The three main stakeholders need to be considered in this approach.  The only way we can do that is if the Attorney General gives specific guidance to these stakeholders.  We all have our legal advice that tells us that we were prescribing, that this derogation should be continued and that the situation as it is at the moment should be allowed to continue.

It was my understanding that there was something on the table between Britain and Ireland a few years ago and Ireland did not sign up to that.  Ms Cantwell might enlighten me on that.  Is it not a dangerous road to go down to speak about derogations?  In my opinion, if you are a licensed prescriber or responsible person where there are grandfather rights or whatever, you are either capable or you are not, to put it very bluntly.  Why would you be going down a road of a derogation?  I know personally from a different field that the EU does not keep giving derogations.<\/p> <p>  I will put a few questions together so that the witnesses can address them.  I believe Mr. Larkin is dealing with the question of fertilisers.  Has any analysis been done?  Earlier today, some of us met representatives of the company that makes stents and different things here in Ireland.  It is the pharma crowd.  New regulation is coming in from them.  A CE mark at one time cost &euro;35,000 but it now costs &euro;235,000, along with three or four years of a wait.  The same thing seems to be coming with more paperwork for fertiliser.  There is this EU paperwork trail that seems to be coming the whole time.  Have the witnesses done an analysis on this?  I am thinking of the local fellow down the road from me in the local shop who sells bread, butter and a bit of meat, and when you go out the back, you can get stakes, wire and fertiliser.<\/p><p>This business is not a co-op as it is not big enough.  Is there data to show that these people are being pushed out of business because of the introduction of IT systems and keeping track of this, that and the other?  It started with diesel a few years ago.  They have to keep track of that and report to Revenue.  Has analysis been done on that and how much it will cost each of them?  It might be fine for a person selling 10,000 or 20,000 tonnes, but it could be problematic for a person in a local area selling 1,000 tonnes.  Has the cross-Border market been assessed and what could happen?<\/p><p> On the veterinary issue, what engagement have both groups had with the Department of late?  It was said that the Department is looking at legal opinion.  You can look at legal opinion all you like, but you have to give a decision.  When will these decisions be made?

To answer the Deputy's question on whether we have done an analysis of costs, the simple answer is \"No.\"  However, there are reasons for that and we have tried.  The Deputy gave an example of going to his local store that sells milk, bread and butter as well as fertiliser, a few stakes and a bit of wire in the back.  As I said earlier, if any one of those things are taken out, such as animal health, fertiliser or hardware, the business may become unviable.  The costs incurred will have a greater impact on that type of business, as the Deputy said, rather than on a business that sells 10,000 or 20,000 tonnes.<\/p> <p>  There are reasons we have not done a cost analysis.  While we might try, we are unsure about the application programming interface, API, system that links the Department's IT system with the agri-retailers' IT system.  We have been given no direction on that as of yet.  In my view, it is overly comprehensive and incurs costs on these businesses.  I have spoken to a couple of IT people who maintain that there are ways in which a report can be generated by my IT system that would be sufficient for the Department's IT system to withdraw the data.  It is impossible to do a cost analysis when we do not know what the link between the API systems entails.  By way of an example, the multi-species sward scheme was introduced this year.  While it worked well, and we are all happy to be a part of it, the administrative burden was put on the trade rather than taken up by the Department, which has caused huge problems.  The benefit of the scheme was given out on the day of purchase, yet there are still merchants throughout the country waiting for payment four months later.  It is those types of problems that will arise.  There are administrative, training, and IT costs, but it is hard to quantify what is required in that regard.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the cross-Border market, not much different from animal health legislation, there is free movement of goods across the Border.  If I were a farmer in Cork who wants a load of fertiliser, all I have to do is pick up the phone and there will be a load of fertiliser in my yard within days, but that fertiliser does not have to be recorded.  That has been happening over recent years with cross-Border trade in the Border counties.  As I said, it is happening more frequently in commercialisation.  However, where guys are pushing boundaries there will be a shortfall in data.  Essentially, the guys pushing boundaries may be the ones who are causing the problems with water quality and they are the ones who will continue to purchase fertiliser from across the Border.  If we could have an all-Ireland approach, while it may be difficult, it would be better, or we could put the onus back on the farmer to declare his fertiliser purchases on an ongoing basis rather than having the merchant do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022100500002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>The fertiliser issue was discussed in detail at the last committee meeting.

It might be ageist of me to say this but the majority of those veterinarians are not getting any younger.  In most cases, no young veterinarians are interested in getting into large-animal practices on the western seaboard.  That is one matter.<\/p> <p>  In respect of sheep farmers who do not keep bovine, there is no reason for a veterinary practitioner to visit the farm unless he or she is invited to do so.  Many sheep farmers would not engage with a veterinary practitioner from one end of the year to the other.  Sheep farmers' trusted source for medicinal supplies and up-to-date advice around practice, especially in respect of anti-parasitic resistance, has always been their supplier.  That supplier may be a veterinary practice, if the farmer is involved with veterinary medicine.  It may be the local co-operative, merchant or pharmacist.  The success of any business is not based on how cheaply you can sell something but is based on the soundness of the advice you can offer your customers.  Repeat custom is based on advice and best practice.  As I said earlier, if the licensed merchants, pharmacists and co-operatives exit the industry, there will be nobody left to take up the slack in large parts of rural Ireland because people are not there, are not interested and are not involved.  Veterinarians in a one-veterinarian practice are involved in all aspect of their practice.  They are not at the coalface.  They are not at the counter when a customer comes into the practice because they are out on farms.  Veterinary pharmacists or pharmacists are required to be on the premises for the pharmacy to operate.  A licensed merchant's premises does not operate unless the responsible person is on the premises.  As long as the door is open, the person who can provide the sound and solid advice is available for a discussion and interaction, or to offer any advice that the farmer needs.  We are considering promoting prudent and appropriate usage of anti-parasitic medicines.  That is a constant engagement between the customer and the supplier. It happens on a weekly and daily basis.  There are cases where someone will come in and buy a product before ringing back a week later.  We are there and available to the customer.  We are qualified to give the service and capable of doing so.  We need to continue giving that service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022100500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>There is a shortage of veterinary practices, particularly in the part of the world we are talking about, and in County Kerry.

If there is no veterinary practice, or a veterinary practice is very busy, a veterinarian cannot make an on-farm call to every one of the people considered his or her clients, whether they are owners of a dairy herd, a suckler herd or sheep.  That is the first and most important thing.  Consider a location such as the Iveragh Peninsula in south Kerry.  In the 120 miles from Kenmare to Killorglin, there is one veterinary practice, one co-operative store and two licensed merchants.  If the current proposal is carried out, both licensed merchants will exit the industry, as will the co-operative.  The co-operative will continue to provide other supplies but will exit the industry.  All of a sudden, the whole of south Kerry would be serviced by one veterinary practice based in the general area.  That veterinary practice provides a fantastic service as it is.  It is brilliant and provides a great service.  However, to expect a veterinary practice to provide the extra service of going onto farms to provide animal health plans and prescriptions for part-time farmers with nine suckler cows, 43 sheep and a donkey would not work.  It would be not be cost effective.  It would not be effective in any way.  A part-time farmer such as the one I described can now go into his local pharmacy, co-operative or merchant to get advice.  Those outlets have provided that advice for more than 20 years.  It is a generational thing.  Customers do not return unless sound advice is being provided.  At the stroke of a pen, that sound advice can be put in the bin.  It does not make sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022100500002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of the IPU and the ILMA for their comprehensive presentations.

They are an integral part of that particular area.  They are all over the place.  Mr. Willie Gibson is a merchant in Donegal.  People like him are at a crossroads.  They provide a service and interaction for the many farmers who never see anybody.  If this segment of the business is taken away, the farmer at home in his yard will say to himself that if the merchant does not have everything, there is no point in visiting him or her.  The farmer will go wherever he or she can get everything.  A farmer will take a Tesco approach to the matter.  He or she will go to the biggest place which supplies everything.  It would mean a wipeout of all rural merchants in such places, including on the western seaboard, across the midlands and everywhere else.  Small merchants play a significant part in local communities in small villages all over the country.  If those merchants are taken out of the picture, those communities will be gone.  Veterinary medicine is an enormous part of the business.  If one segment of a business is taken away, the rest will ebb away until it is all gone.<\/p> <p>  I would not like to be a merchant near the Border.  Such a merchant would be wiped out.  Why would a farmer go to a veterinarian, pay for a prescription and go to his merchant to buy anti-parasitic medicines when he or she could go across the road into the North and buy them over the counter without any hassle?

I have not previously had the opportunity to say the following to the IPU, which I ask its representatives to take back to its members.  I congratulate the pharmacies in this country for the job they did during the pandemic when other professions were not available.  They did an excellent job.  Many people were unable to get professional people when they wanted them.  They went into the professional people in the pharmacies and dealt with them.  Human beings are important.  It was important they were there and I want to put that on the record.  I have not previously had the opportunity to do that publicly.  Pharmacists did a fantastic job during the pandemic.  I previously named in the D&aacute;il a profession, the members of which went on holiday and could not be found.  People were very sick.  I am sure the case was the same for animals.  It is sometimes not easy to get a veterinarian because they are busy people.  The arrangement we have at present is working very well in Northern Ireland and other parts of Europe.  Why can we not have the same arrangement here?  There are issues in this country in respect of EU and national regulations.<\/p><p>I will give an example.  I recently went to buy a small bit of sterling because someone was going to a wedding in England.  It would be easier to go in and rob the bank than get the sterling.  That is the truth.

At the moment, the pharmacies and merchants are all doing a fairly good job.  They understand rural people and rural life and the needs of rural people and rural life.  We have a crowd of people in Dublin and Europe and every Monday morning they must get up and ask themselves what they can do this week to upset rural people.  They are getting paid, of course, so they do not care.  They are bringing in rules and regulations and we are over-regulated.

I agree with him 100%.  The merchant industry provides a valuable service in Ireland and we have done for a long number of years.  Osmonds was one of the original companies in Ireland and was there since 1932.  It has now exited the business after 85 or 88 years.  That was a huge loss.  We have taken up the mantra that antiparasitic resistance, APR, is the big issue here.  We believe that as merchants, and I am sure the pharmacists and those who represent the co-ops will agree, we are best placed to deliver a response to antiparasitic resistance.  We are suitably trained.  We are quite happy to have continuous professional development and embrace all the modern technologies.  We can deliver if we are included.  There is a simple solution to this issue.  If the Department recognised the role a responsible person can play as a prescriber of antiparasitics, that would solve the problem.  That can be done with the stroke of a pen or one line.  It rests with the Minister and his officials.  I ask the committee to ensure the message is delivered to the Minister and his officials that this needs to be done.  This will secure our future.

Sometimes in life, one just has to stand up and be counted.  The EU has implemented this regulation.  There is an onus on us as a country to provide data back to Europe about the use of antimicrobial and antiparasitic medicines.  There is a responsibility there.  However, sometimes we feel we go above and beyond the requirements in implementing these regulations in Ireland.  Many other European countries have taken different approaches to implementing the regulation, such as in Northern Ireland and the Scandinavian countries, and it has been seamless.

I am only a part-time visitor to this committee.  There was a time when I thought I would be here much more regularly.  The issue here is antiparasitics.  The issue of fertiliser usage and the registration of fertiliser usage is understandable in the context of water quality and so forth.  We will have to live with that.  I was at this committee about a year ago and I do not think we are much further on than we were then.  The initial departmental interpretation of this directive is not workable.  That is widely acknowledged by all concerned.  I think they have come to that realisation now.  Its impact on licensed merchants and pharmacists and, by association, farmers, is not one that will be accepted, quite simply.  They have all been very quiet, understanding and patient to this point.  We cannot guarantee that will continue if the legislation that is brought to bear to give effect to this directive does not meet with the approval of all concerned.<\/p><p>Last year we spoke about the potential of veterinarians carrying out annual audits on herds based on the historical needs of that herd, in relation to the expectation and provisions there would be in a given year.  That would be forthcoming initially and used thereafter the same way it has been in recent years.  That does not appear to have gathered any momentum and does not appear to be in the mind of the Department with regard to the proposals it may eventually come up with.  As Deputy Ring says, in the meantime, the <i>status quo<\/i>remains the same in the North.  That is at variance with the interpretation of this by our Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, despite the fact that we need an all-island economy for agriculture and animal healthcare.  We cannot have that while this continues.  Deputy Ring is quite right.  It may well be that the meeting in the middle is done around the duty, the responsibility, the qualification and the ongoing review of the capacity of the responsible person to maintain their role into the future.  There is nothing to suggest that these people have broken any trust in years past but there may be some merit in an agreement for them to continue to augment their own qualifications, capacity and ability to do their job into the future.  That could be reviewed on a regular basis and proof could be provided for those who initiated this rule in Europe around the capacity or capability of the State to manage its affairs adequately, properly and effectively.  That comes from the best intentions to maintain our standards in the delivery of our products in the agriculture sector.<\/p><p>I appreciate the witnesses being here again and the efforts I am sure they have made in the meantime to discuss this with relevant departmental officials.

This has gone on too long.  It needs to come to a conclusion.  People's livelihoods cannot continue to be threatened in the way they are by the fear about what is contained in the initial interpretation by the Department over 12 months ago.  I ask this committee to do what it has been doing, and I am sure will do again, and ensure the officials who are charged with responsibility for this legislation reach agreement with the parties and stakeholders concerned.  That is our direction and that is the direction of members of all parties and none on this committee, which is representative of the D&aacute;il itself.  There is a majority within the D&aacute;il that wishes to see this resolved forthwith, to allow these people to get on with their business and allow us to get on with what we do best in producing the sort of quality that is renowned throughout the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022100500002#H00700","speaker":"1591"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":72,"content":"<p>On the EU directive, is the proscription on selling antiparasitic medicines without a prescription or on buying them?

Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means that witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chair's direction.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and they may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.

The nature restoration law proposal was released on 22 June 2022 alongside the sustainable use of pesticide regulation.  Together they formed the nature package, as it was dubbed by the European Commission, and were brought forward in connection with the goals of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030.<\/p> <p>  COPA-COGECA, the organisation I represent, has continually supported the European Union&rsquo;s objectives of protecting, conserving and restoring our natural environment for the future of our planet, especially due to the role farmers and forest-owners can and already play for nature.  In times of war, which we are in, the focus on food security becomes an aspect of critical importance.  It is essential to take the necessary steps to ensure food supplies continue reaching those most affected, in Ukraine and globally.  The cumulative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, the energy price hikes, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have profound and long-lasting effects not only in the EU but also elsewhere in the world.  With Covid-19 and the war between Russia and Ukraine this issue has re-emerged as a threat that can radically shake our society.  Given the current politically precarious situation presented by the war in Ukraine, the risk of food shortages and unaffordable prices for food in numerous countries, the EU should put the objective of food, energy and raw material security at the forefront.<\/p> <p>  The main tenets of the nature restoration law are as follows.  The European Union will enact legally binding targets upon member states up until the year 2050.  The first target is for the entire EU to have 20% of all EU land and sea covered with restoration measures by 2030.  The more comprehensive targets are restoration measures across the EU encompassing those habitats and ecosystems which have been designated as in \"bad\" condition within the reasoning of the habitats directive from 1992.  The aim is to achieve a \"good\" condition of these target habitats up to 30% by 2030, 60% by 2040 and 90% by 2050.  Among these habitats are wetlands; grasslands; river, lake, alluvial and riparian habitats; forests; steppe, heath, and scrub habitats; and rocky and dune habitats.  In order to aid in the fulfilment of these targets, the EU will have every member state create a national restoration plan, in the same guise as the CAP strategic plans each member state had to fulfil.  However, these will have the exact details of specific restoration measures with time-specific deadlines up until the year 2050.  Each plan must designate the exact amount of area that will be covered in each decade up until 2050, the estimate financing, the funding mechanisms behind the measures, and the identification of harmful subsidies that will inhibit the fulfilment of these targets.<\/p> <p>  Within this law, there is a variety of articles to be aware of.  First, Articles 4 and 5 speak of the overall targets over all EU habitats covered within the habitats directive, with specific note made for the only cases where non-fulfilment of the targets are acceptable.  Article 9 focuses on agricultural ecosystems and inherent in this are targets for the restoration of 70% of all EU agriculturally-drained peatland by 2050, with 30% of all EU peatland to be rewetted by that year.  Article 16 focuses on the access to justice clause which is long enshrined in the Aarhus Convention.  However, these targets are clearly unachievable at the current rate and this article allows anyone who fits the requirements to bring a state to court for nonfulfillment and failure of that state to fulfil the targets.  <\/p> <p>I would be happy to elaborate on all of the above in order to allow for a better understanding of the proposal.  I have attached a PowerPoint presentation I hope members have had a chance to look at carefully, as it refers to the specific targets.<\/p><p>No matter how much I can explain this, it pales in comparison to reading the document as well as the 12 impact assessments and annexes that will pave the way for the future of nature across Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022100500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Curley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Curley for highlighting this.

In conjunction with nature restoration, it is expected that these eco schemes, which run up to 2027 when the current CAP ends, will aim for the fulfilment of these targets.

There are schemes already in place for example, farmed peat in the midlands that aims to restore peat on farmlands.  There are some smaller schemes that do this work but also the Bord na M&oacute;na scheme.  The Government can look at what already happens.  For example, a couple of acres, which adds up to the percentage that Ireland has, will begin to fulfil the target.  Overall, completely new measures will be put in place to fulfil the target.<br\/><br\/>On the percentage of land that will be put beyond use and supports to be put in place, this will come down to available funding.  If my memory serves me correctly, the EU has pointed out that 12 EU funds should be able to fulfil this.  According to my PowerPoint presentation that I circulated today, there is &euro;14 billion to go to member states from 2021 to 2027 and this will cost about &euro;7 billion a year.  While that technically fits into half of the funding it does not take into account the other biodiversity funding that has already been put in place and utilised for other systems.<br\/><br\/>The scheme is completely disconnected from what measures will be needed.  The main issue is to get farmers and forest owners or landowners in general to put in measures on the ground to rewet lands, plant trees and rewild to a certain extent but depending on the condition of the land.  The measures have not been fashioned and the funding is not necessarily there.  Currently, they will have to depend on the Common Agricultural Policy or CAP eco-schemes, the European agricultural fund for rural development, EAFRD,  and the European agricultural guarantee fund or EAGFunder CAP.  A complete dependency on CAP funding is going to be used.  One of the things that I as a representative of COPA-COGECA, alongside other stakeholders, land-based stakeholders and even green NGOs - with whom we seldom agree about a lot of things - agree on is that an EU nature restoration funding should be set in place here under  multi-annual financial framework, MFF, negotiations in 2026-2027.  Without that these targets will never be fulfilled and the money for the schemes that are not peatland-based will never be fulfilled.  It is mainly about talking to the landowners and explaining why it is important this work is done, how it is done and what are the benefits.  Restoration is important but the issue is getting there.  If the money is not there and the extent of the law overreaches then nobody will benefit and this provision will literally be a waste.<br\/><br\/>The CAP will run up until 2027 so that is the current one that has eco-schemes, which we have just put in place.  These are short-term measures for long-term goals up until 2050.  Therefore, these measures are not adequate for long-term planning, especially when building a national restoration plan up until 2050.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022100500002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Curley"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Curley know how many sectors are excluded under the new measures and if so, which ones?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022100500002#N00700","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022100500002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Curley"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>The Committee on Public Petitions has discussed the technical side of the nature restoration target over the past month or so.

The measure will primarily affect people like the Senator and people where I come from, where land has been drained for use by suckler farmers or sheep farmers at the side of the bog.  Sometimes it will be an entire farm, and sometimes part.  That is what the specific target is for.  The preference is for the rewetting and restoration of peatland that has been used for arable purposes.  Such land might be drained better in certain areas but it is still regularly ploughed, harrowed and seeded.  The whole point is to stop the use of tilling implements as tilling releases carbon into the air.  When using peatland for arable use, you are regularly opening up the soil and releasing carbon.  Retaining carbon is the point of rewetting peatlands.  We do not reject or negate this; it is a commonly known fact and we understand this now.  The objective will be to turn arable peatlands into pasturelands.  It will entail farmers converting their business model from an arable one to a livestock one if they wish, but it comes down to the dependent region.  Where there is pastureland on the side of a bog, it is usually because it is not fit for arable use.  It is this land that will primarily be targeted for rewetting.

The rapporteurs have been appointed, and a report will be produced.  The process is currently headed by C&eacute;sar Luena, of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats.  The report will be published.  I have heard recently that it is expected in January.  Currently, there are other committees that are looking for the competence to have an opinion on this matter.  Among them are the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on Fisheries, and the Committee on Regional Development.  The competences are divided up in the Conference of Committee Chairs, CCC.  The CCC was held recently on 13 September, if memory serves me right, but a decision was not made due to conflict on the specific articles in respect of which each committee wanted to have competence.  A meeting was held on Monday with regard to this specific area, again, on co-ordinators.  As far as I am aware, no actual decision was made.  So far, the competences have not been divided up and the rapporteurs have not been appointed for each of the other committees.  It cannot be finished within the Parliament until all competences have been divided up and opinions made, and a common position from the Parliament is created.  They are expecting that this can be done by summer but I would be very wary of that possibility.

Apologies for going off on a tangent there.<\/p> <p>  Currently the Council is under the Czech Presidency.  The Czechs have had six meetings within the working party on the environment on this matter, mainly to properly clarify certain issues within it.  As I mentioned, there were a lot of issues with regard to definitions and the lack of clarity.  As was remarked upon recently to me, the fact that there have been five meetings since July shows the sincere lack of clarity with this law and the amount that needs to be cleared up.<\/p><p>The Czechs are expecting to have the drafting process done in November.  It is then expected to go to the Swedish Presidency.  However, it will be moderately delayed under the Swedish Presidency due to the lack of will and the fact that it has a new government coming in.  As Sweden has the largest area of peatlands in Europe, and this is completely about peatlands in certain respects, I doubt that they will be that fast with regard to getting it done.  It will then go to the Spanish Presidency, which is in the second half of next year.  However, the original plan was that by the summer of next year the Swedes would have created a common position within the Council and then it would go to trilogues under the Spanish Presidency.

It is going to be basically a greenwashing of any future trade agreements because of the fact that we will already need to import different types of food and resources from different areas.  I always refer, for instance, to the area that will need to be reduced to fulfil the targets in Finland and Sweden, because of the thousands of hectares of forestry that will need to be completely removed to specifically fulfil these targets, specifically when we are going into a resource crisis due to the war and previously due to Covid.

We found the briefing very good.  It is time that we sat down with the Minister and pointed out these issues.  We have a serious problem at the moment with getting land for forestry.  This is going to make the availability of land for forestry impossible, as the amount available will be reduced.  At the moment a good proportion of land is designated as SACs or protected areas for various birds and the compensation paid to farmers is minuscule.  The capital value of designated land has been reduced by 80%.  After such designation, land that was worth &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 an acre is worth &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,200 an acre.  If the proposals Mr. Curley talks about go ahead, the capital value of the land that will be \"restored\" will be decimated.  Regarding Sweden and its opposition to this measure, it is time that some straight talking was done.  As he stated, the world's ability to feed its population is coming under more and more pressure.  The climatic benefits must be balanced with our ability to produce food.  He has given us a very clear indication of the impending regulation.

I have received no apologies today.<\/p> <p>  Our engagement is with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, regarding an update on quarters 1 and 2 and matters relating to the Department.  The Department is responsible for advising and implementing the Government's policies that relate to developing the productive capacity of the economy and fostering an environment that provides for employment and job creation and sustainability.  The Department is also engaged in developing policies that enable fair competition in the marketplace, protect consumers and safeguard workers.<\/p> <p>  Today, I am pleased that we have the opportunity to consider these matters further with the Minister.

As he mentioned, I am joined by Mr. John Newham, who is in charge of commerce, consumer and competition law; Ms Tara Coogan, who is responsible for industrial relations and workplace relations; and Ms Jill Colquhoun, who is here from the intellectual property side.<\/p> <p>  Last week was my third budget as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Over the past two years, we have experienced many ups and downs.  From Brexit to Covid restrictions, the war in Ukraine and soaring inflation, it is fair to say that we live in interesting times.  The Government has not gotten everything right all the time but we have always sought to protect lives and livelihoods as best we can, and protect jobs and businesses for that reason.<\/p> <p>  In the round, budget 2023 was about putting money in people's pockets, with specific measures for the most vulnerable and the squeezed middle.<\/p> <p>  Many businesses around the country are worried heading into the winter.  Energy and other input costs are rising.  Interest rates are rising too and consumer confidence is waning.  The Government has to intervene again, just as we did during the pandemic, to support viable jobs and businesses and, therefore, we have announced five measures in the budget to help with energy costs and sustainability.  The first of these is the temporary business energy support scheme, T-BESS.  That will provide qualifying businesses, which will be almost all businesses, with relief on 40% of the increase in their electricity or gas bills up to a maximum of &euro;10,000 per month per business unit.<\/p> <p>  The second is a &euro;200 million targeted Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme to assist viable but vulnerable manufacturers and exporters.<\/p><p>One strand of the scheme will provide up to &euro;2 million for energy-intensive companies.  The third is a State-backed Ukraine credit guarantee scheme of up to &euro;1.2 billion.  That will assist the wider business sector with liquidity and will help to invest in energy efficiency.  This will provide low-cost working capital to small businesses and primary producers like farmers and fishermen.  The fourth is a &euro;500 million growth and sustainability loan scheme, which is the successor to the future growth loan scheme.  The growth and sustainability loan scheme will provide low-cost, long-term lending to SMEs.  Finally, we are allocating &euro;4 million in funding to the local enterprise offices, to include a new grant for micro-enterprises to implement energy efficiency measures, including solar panels, for example.<\/p><p> Turning to other priorities, we are developing a White Paper on enterprise policy which will be published before the end of the year.  We have become a prosperous country not because of natural resources like oil, gas, diamonds or gold.  Our success as a nation is based entirely on trading the goods and services we produce internationally, our attractiveness as a place to invest and our ability to enter into international free trade agreements, under the umbrella of the European Union, with other countries.  I think some people take our economic success for granted.  I think they believe that businesses will continue to expand and that employment will continue to rise, no matter what we do.  They tend to focus on how we can divide up the cake differently or, in their view, more fairly.  It rarely occurs to them that the cake can shrink, meaning less for everyone, or get bigger, meaning we have more to allocate.  This is definitely not a time to rest on our laurels, in a rapidly changing world.  We will not stay successful economically by standing still.  We have to get ahead of the next wave and catch it.  That is why the White Paper is so important.<\/p><p> I understand that businesses have been through a lot in the past three years and that many are focused just on surviving the next few months.  However, the green and digital transitions are also existential threats and we have to help businesses to take notice and take action and help them along the way.  We are already helping out with an &euro;85 million multi-annual Grow Digital fund and a &euro;55 million fund to help businesses move away from fossil fuels.  There are more than 20 different energy efficiency schemes available to businesses, but take-up is not what it should be.  We have work to ensure that the right incentives are in place and the right information is available to improve take-up by businesses.<\/p><p> In February we launched nine new regional enterprise plans.  They will form an integral part of our overall enterprise policy and are aimed at strengthening the regional enterprise ecosystem to drive economic growth and to maintain better standards of living in all parts of the country.  Up to &euro;180 million will be made available to implement these plans.  It is great to see that employment is growing so strongly now in every part of the country.  The border area of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Monaghan and Cavan has performed the strongest over the past two years, with employment there growing by 29%.  The south east and the south west were the best performers last year.  There are now 2.55 million people at work in Ireland, which is a record high, youth unemployment is close to a record low and female labour force participation is also at an all-time high.  Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland had record jobs figures last year and their work, along with that of the local enterprise offices and InterTradeIreland, will be crucial to maintaining our momentum on employment.<\/p><p> Regarding housing, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has a crucial role in facilitating accelerated innovation within the construction sector and driving increased productivity.  We have established a modern methods of construction group to help the transition from conventional to modern construction methods.  We have made additional categories of construction workers eligible for general employment permits, and IDA Ireland is engaging with international construction companies to make them aware of the opportunities that now exist in the Irish market.<\/p><p> Apart from backing business, we are recognising the contribution of workers by introducing reforms to strengthen workers' terms and conditions.  We are working to ensure that the pandemic leaves a legacy of a more inclusive and secure society, with full employment, good jobs and secure jobs, making work pay more and rewarding effort.  Back in June I outlined proposals to introduce a living wage for all employees in Ireland.  My Department is working through the results of the public consultation on this, and I intend to bring a memo to the Government later this month, seeking formal approval for the phase-in of a living wage and a timeline to do so.  In addition to this work, the Government has accepted the recommendation of the Low Pay Commission to increase the national minimum wage to &euro;11.30 an hour from 1 January, or &euro;1,600 per year for a full-time worker.  In addition, I have prioritised the enumeration of enhanced workers' rights, including a new public holiday, which will take place on St. Brigid's Day or Imbolc; statutory sick pay, which will come into effect in January; the Covid-19-related lay-off payment scheme, which is now up and running and administered by the Department of Social Protection and ensures that people who were laid off temporarily during the pandemic restrictions do not lose out on redundancy rights; the protection of workplace tips and gratuities, which we anticipate to be commenced in the coming weeks, certainly by 1 December; the right to request remote working Bill, which will be published later this quarter; and, as the committee will know, the introduction by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, of new flexible working laws as well as more affordable childcare.<\/p><p> As Deputies and Senators will be aware, employment permit applications have more than doubled since 2019.  I am very pleased that the backlog in processing permit applications has now decreased from nearly 11,000 at its peak to around 2,000.  Waiting times for all types of employment permit are now down to four weeks or less.  That number should improve further due to the measures employed by the Department, which can now be continued into 2023 due to our increased budget allocation for staffing.  The forthcoming employment permits Bill will also help.  We are examining European proposals to bring together the employment permit process in our Department and the visa process in the Department of Justice.<\/p><p> To mention briefly some other legislation, the Competition (Amendment) Act 2022 was enacted earlier this year.  It is landmark legislation and the biggest reform of competition law in decades.  It will enhance the ability of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, to break up cartels, stop bid rigging and other anti-competitive practices and block anti-competitive mergers.  The Consumer Rights Bill, which is being piloted by the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, will enter the Seanad in the coming weeks.  It introduces new rights for consumers and will better protect them from misleading and unfair commercial practices.  Crucially, it extends consumer rights to the digital area.  The small companies administrative rescue process, SCARP, has been in place for less than a year.  While take-up has been muted so far, I anticipate that many more companies will avail of it in the coming months.  The feedback on the scheme so far has been very positive and its existence alone is an important factor when companies are in distress.  The Screening of Third Country Transactions Bill completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in September, and the control of exports Bill has been prioritised for publication this autumn.  These Bills will strengthen Ireland's scrutiny of potentially harmful inward investments and the export of controlled goods to third countries.  It will also ensure that Ireland retains our position as an attractive location for FDI and as an exporting economy.<\/p><p> I thank the committee and the Chairperson for facilitating a number of waivers of legislation from pre-legislative scrutiny.  I know we have not always given the committee adequate notice, but I hope members can understand why.  The past two and a half years have required us to adapt very quickly to unforeseen events, and this committee has played an important role in helping us to respond quickly to save thousands of businesses and jobs.

I have some questions, which I will get to in a moment, but I wish to refer first to an article by Ellen Coyne in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>today that refers to an objection by the employers' group, IBEC, to the introduction of paid leave for victims and survivors of domestic abuse.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that I have legislation that would provide for ten days' leave.  I understand that the Government is considering five days.  There are somewhat mixed messages coming from the Government, given that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has written to the universities advising them to follow the example of NUI Galway, which is ten days.  The submission from IBEC, however, refers to concerns about the rights of those accused of domestic violence, querying if an employee could be in a particularly acrimonious relationship and intentionally seek to defame his or her partner.  It also refers to the need to require proof.<\/p><p>I know the T&aacute;naiste will remember that during the debate on the eighth amendment, we debated at length whether the State could provide access to terminations for women who had been raped.  We agreed that was a good idea.  However, we also agreed that we could not ask for proof.  What is the T&aacute;naiste's view on what IBEC is saying now?  There is a dispute between what two Departments are saying, which is confusing.  I would like if the Government and Oireachtas could unite behind my legislation, which I think is simple legislation.  Notwithstanding that, the advocacy groups in this area have been absolutely clear that one cannot ask a victim or survivor of domestic abuse to give proof to his or her employer.  What are victims supposed do?  Are they to come in with a black eye?  How do they prove coercive control?  What is the T&aacute;naiste's view on this?  I understand it was not referred to in his submission.  It is in the paper this morning, which is why I refer to it.  It does not just exercise me.  I understand it exercises many members of the Oireachtas.  More than that, it is an issue for victims and survivors.  I had a hearing about my legislation at the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We heard from Women's Aid.  It was clear about the issue of proof.  I did not hear any dissenting voices from the members of that committee about the need for proof.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#B00300","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I have not seen that article, the objection from IBEC or whatever observations it has made.

Many of those workers will receive what ICTU has described as an inadequate rise in their minimum wage.  When will the regulation orders for the statutory sick leave scheme be ready?  I know the T&aacute;naiste has not done this yet, but will he start an awareness campaign in the run-up to the scheme being introduced?  There is little time left between now and January for the roll-out of a campaign that will be seen by workers and employers, in their workplaces rather than just at a high level, so that they understand what will happen in January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#C00700","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Statutory sick pay will be a reality.  It has been delayed by 12 weeks.  I had hoped and intended to introduce it in October.  I conferred and worked with officials over the summer to see if we could do that, but we ran into many issues, not least the fact that many things that interact with it, such as illness benefit, are annualised.  From 1 January, people can claim three days of sick leave from their employer.  That is how it works in the first year.  On the fourth day, illness benefit kicks in.  Starting it mid-year just did not work for many reasons.  I was disappointed when I had to come to that conclusion, accepting my officials' advice.  I did not accept it initially, but they turned out to be right.  I had to accept it in the end because it would not have been workable.  There is a delay of 12 weeks, which I regret, but it is happening and is a significant step forward for workers' rights in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We have not yet made a decision on the awareness campaign.  We have talked about it, so we may well do it.  The same thing applies to the legislation on tips.  We are keen to ensure that employees, particularly more vulnerable employees who do not have English as a first language and do not follow our media, are aware of these rights, because they are the people who are most likely to be denied these rights.  I am sure the trade unions will do something similar.  We will confer with the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, unions and employers about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#C00800","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>It would be good for the Migrant Rights Centre to be closely involved in this, given that it has direct access to those workers who would be most impacted.  ICTU should also be involved in that regard.  I have a question about the T&aacute;naiste's opening statement.  I am glad he is sitting down, because I agree with some of it.  He said, &quot;This is definitely not a time to rest on our laurels in a rapidly changing world.&quot;  He also said that, as a State, &quot;We have to get ahead of the next wave and catch it.&quot;  I fully agree with that.  The T&aacute;naiste might remember that I tabled a parliamentary question this time last year regarding the development of a comprehensive cross-sectoral industrial strategy for the economy.  I welcome the announcement regarding the White Paper.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste about his views on a story in the Irish Examiner recently, which stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSenior sources in the Department of Finance said the economy is now relying on data centres, spending on remote working by businesses, as well as investment by one or two major companies. <\/blockquote> <p>Does the T&aacute;naiste agree with those remarks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#C00900","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I did not see those remarks or the article.  I am always loath to comment on an article that I have not read or comments I did not hear.  If they are as the Deputy characterises them, I profoundly disagree.  One of the strengths of our economy is that it is diversified.  We are heavily dependent on about ten companies and about 10% of people who pay over a third of the tax in the country.  When one adds in property tax, VAT, capital tax and excise, they probably pay more than that.  It is important to be aware of that vulnerability and to protect ourselves against it, but also to look after it.  When one has an asset like those great companies in our country and the amazingly skilled people who work for them, we should treat them well.  It is important to do so because wealth, capital, skills, people and investment are footloose in our world.  If we pursue the wrong policies, that could quickly turn on us and change overnight, and then the cake would get smaller.  That is a matter of tax revenues, but there is more to the economy than tax revenues.  I would never look at things just with regard to GDP or tax revenues.  I look at employment, for example.  Approximately 250,000 people are employed by foreign direct investment, FDI, companies and companies involved with IDA Ireland.  Very few of them are employed in data centres, by the way.  They are mostly in the tech, pharmaceutical and medical devices sectors.  Almost as many people work in Enterprise Ireland client companies, which are domestic Irish companies that export.  There is a public sector which is crucial to any economy of about 300,000 people.  There is a tourism sector, agriculture, and small and medium enterprises.  When one looks at the 2.5 million people working in our economy, it is quite diversified.  We do not have all our eggs in one basket, which is a strength.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#C01000","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

In his opening statement, the T&aacute;naiste said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tOur success as a nation is entirely based on trading the goods and services we produce internationally, our attractiveness as a place to invest and our ability to enter into international free trade agreements... with other countries. <\/blockquote> <p>I would add that non-exporting SMEs, microbusinesses and family businesses have also played and will continue to play a significant role in the economy.  What are the T&aacute;naiste's views on the establishment of an Irish enterprise agency to assist small and medium enterprises that are trading domestically?  The T&aacute;naiste will know this is a long-standing policy of Sinn F&eacute;in.  IBEC recently backed a similar idea.  We think this would be of tremendous benefit to our non-exporting small and medium-sized businesses, microbusinesses and the family business sector which do not fall under the remit of local enterprise offices, LEOs, Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland.

I do not think it is a bad idea.<\/p><p>My principle is when one makes decisions on policy one starts with what one wants to achieve and then decide whether one needs a new agency to do it.  I am not saying the Deputy is responsible for this but there is a default position sometimes in Ireland that the solution to any problem is a new agency, task force or maybe a citizens' assembly.  I tend to start with what the objectives we want to achieve are.  We have identified a gap in helping a cohort of businesses and the way we have decided to deal with that, at least for now, is to expand the role of the local enterprise offices.  They are really good and getting better at what they do.  With the budget allocation they are going to expand their role to businesses that have more than ten employees and moving up closer to 20.  The Deputy has already seen the way Enterprise Ireland has expanded its role in recent years and done so very successfully.  However, if it does not work I would not have a closed mind to establishing something like a small business administration like the one in the US.<\/p><p> Sometimes this does not come across in media coverage but I point out there are fairness, competition and state aid rules.  Often one will deal with a business, which could be a shop, a barber or a butcher, that feels it is not getting any support from Government and sometimes they are not.  They are getting support on energy and got support during the pandemic but sometimes the reason they are not is that the business is in competition with another butcher or barber down the road and for the Government to back one disadvantages the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#C01200","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#D00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Whereas it is not like that with exports, so-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#D00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I understand that and agree with what the T&aacute;naiste says about the LEOs.

Despite the substantial supports outlined in budget 2023 it is a very challenging time for these businesses, especially SMEs such as restaurants, bars and the hospitality sector generally.  I have spoken to may business owners in Galway city and county that say the VAT returning to 13.5% is a very significant worry and will really challenge their sustainability because it obviously makes products more expensive for customers during a cost-of-living crisis.

That is a gross rather than a net figure and I appreciate if one factors in other things it might be less of a cost but we need to bear that in mind.  The decision of the Government is to extend the 9% rate until the end of February.  Members should bear in mind that preferential rate does not just apply to hospitality at the moment as it also applies to some personal services like hairdressing.  Furthermore, it applies to electricity and gas.  Not going back to 13.5% could be very expensive for the Exchequer.  We will have to examine the situation a bit closer to then and see where we stand with respect to the state of the public finances and of the economy.

The number of companies that have gone bust and insolvent in the past couple of years has been extremely low.  What did happen was that many businesses that would otherwise have failed have managed to survive on Government supports.  Since the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and Government supports were removed a lot of companies tried to make a go of it but now with high energy prices and falling consumer confidence some companies will not survive.  That is the truth, unfortunately.  On the plus side, that situation will free up staff and custom for other businesses.  Nobody likes to see any business fail but the nature of a market economy is that some businesses succeed while others do not and those that fail often get replaced by new ones that are better.  We anticipate an increase in company insolvencies over the next few months.  Crucially, we now have the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP.  That is a really good system as it allows small companies to restructure where they can be made viable.  So far a very small number of companies have availed of SCARP but the feedback is very positive.  The fear of SCARP has caused debtors, banks and others to write down debts in a way that they would not have done previously but SCARP does help.

The more pertinent question is how much of the EU's trade and imports is that 1% responsible for, and I think that the bulk of imports would relate to that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Ireland's informal position, we are generally in favour of any proposal that promotes responsible business but the directive does need to be enforceable, proportionate and effective.<\/p><p>We are currently awaiting clarity.  We hope to undertake our own public consultation process towards the end of the year and that will help inform the Minister's position in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Newham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being here and for his presentation.  Last week's budget was clearly about protecting jobs, people, families and employment through a difficult time of uncertainty.  He used a cake analogy.  We cannot take it for granted it will always be there.  It is sometimes accepted that we are in a position that other countries are not, which means we are able to give out &euro;11 billion without borrowing any money at all.  However, we have also been responsible by holding back some money.  Can the Minister elaborate on the rationale behind that?  What will be possible in the new year?  There is responsibility involved.  People have been talking about the &euro;11 billion that will be spent but we are holding back &euro;2 billion, and there will be another &euro;4 billion on top of that in 2023.  Where does that leave us in protecting businesses into the new year?<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Stanton said, many businesses are looking to change their ways and become more energy-efficient, through, for example, solar panels.  We have 20 schemes available but when I talk to business owners, they are not fully aware of all of them.  Many schemes have become available in a short time and some business owners are not aware of them.  We need to increase awareness in that respect.  Business owners to whom I speak want to invest in different forms of energy, particularly solar panels.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the four or five big new schemes that have been brought through in the budget to support businesses and protect jobs.  Other schemes are just as important.  Approximately 15 measures to support businesses have been brought through.  The VAT rate for newspapers has been reduced from 9% to zero.  That is important for local employment in every county and rural area.  In my area, the excise relief on cider is important.  We in County Tipperary are very well-known for cider and apples.  The excise relief will protect jobs there.  A number of schemes are available for low-cost loans.  Because of the uncertain times we are in, some people might suggest that there will be fewer applications for low-cost loans.  I suspect that will not be the case.  What is the rationale behind those low-cost loans?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#F00200","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":270,"content":"<p>The availability of low-cost loans is a relatively new innovation.  We have had Government-backed low-cost loans for only the past ten or 12 years.  They are essentially designed to give businesses access to credit at a lower interest rate and for longer terms than would otherwise be the case.  We encourage the banks to do that by sharing some of the risk.  That tips the balance and encourages banks to grant credit where they otherwise would not.  Those loans are available with slightly lower interest rates than would otherwise be the case.  We ensure such loans are not 100% guaranteed by the Government because we need to ensure the banks have plenty of skin in the game and they would be burned if they made foolish lending decisions.<\/p> <p>  The take-up of those loans varies.  The most successful has been the future growth loan scheme, which has encouraged small businesses, in particular, to borrow to expand.  That scheme was fully subscribed.  We are going to replace it with a new scheme that is similar but focused on expansion and sustainability.  In addition, there will be a scheme to help businesses that are struggling with bills linked to the war in Ukraine.  We ran a similar scheme during the pandemic that approximately 10,000 businesses availed of.  There are good levels of take-up for these kinds of schemes.<\/p> <p>  Budget 2023 is done, as the committee knows.  The tax and welfare spending decisions for next year have been made.  The departmental spending ceilings for next year have been set.  There is no prospect of a mini-budget in the new year or at any time next year.  We have included flexibility in the budget for very good reason.  The reserve fund, which the Senator mentioned, is designed to store away some of those corporation profit tax receipts for a future shock.  There is also contingency in the budget for a further wave of Covid-19, which will probably happen, and for further migration from Ukraine, which will probably happen too.  There are other surpluses included.  As the Taoiseach said the other day, budget 2023 contains flexibility to allow us to make decisions and intervene to help businesses and families during next year if we need to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#F00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming before the committee.  It is impressive that we have such a low unemployment rate, which has happened on his watch, despite the pandemic and all the other things that have been happening.  We must acknowledge that.  It is super that we can say we have such a low unemployment rate.  There are many jobs out there.  We must acknowledge that and give some gratitude to the Minister for it.  I wish him luck when he takes on his new role in December.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to slightly more challenging topics.  I have a couple of quick questions.  I will again raise the corporate sustainability due diligence directive.  What is Ireland's position on the directive?  We all know there are deep concerns around human rights and environmental violations.  Irish companies and multinationals based here are not immune from the problem.  Half of the top 60 companies in Ireland scored less than 20% on embedded respect for human rights in their global operations in a recent study by Trinity College Dublin.  We have all seen images of child labour, devastating pollution and all that goes with fast fashion and all of that.  It is a serious issue and there is an opportunity at the discussion tables at EU level for Ireland to strengthen the case and this potentially good EU legislation.  What is our position in that respect?  Who is at the table for us?  Is it the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  Who do we go to about this issue?  I know it is not a matter for the Minister before us.<\/p> <p>  I thank him for the great supports provided to small businesses in the budget.  He mentioned T-BESS in his opening address.  If businesses are not given proper advice or a half-day energy audit, they will not necessarily invest in the best places.  I conducted energy audits with schools for many years.  We often used to focus on the low-cost stuff first.  Some schools were putting up photovoltaic panels but leaving the lights on all night.  The education piece is of paramount importance.  I would like to see local enterprise offices, LEOs, and Enterprise Ireland with boots on the ground and going into businesses.  It would not be a bureaucratic thing.  We could offer a free energy audit and then offer a grant to a business that avails of that audit.  Otherwise the grant will be spent on measures that are not the first things required.  It is like the retrofit scheme.  Photovoltaic panels should not be put on a roof if there is no attic insulation.  We cannot assume that businesses are energy conservation experts because they are not.  They do not have time to be.  They really want practical advice.  I do not see the training being provided in that regard.  That piece is missing.  We want the money to go to the best place to provide the most energy efficiency.<\/p> <p>  Because of the climate and biodiversity issues we face, we should have specific measures for food production and food businesses.  We are currently importing 20% of our potatoes, 95% of our apples, 80% of our onions and 37% of our carrots.  It could be said that relates to agriculture but these are food businesses.  We have some growers here but need to up our game big time if we want food security.  The future is unpredictable for many reasons.  I would love to see the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment take food production in this country seriously.  Indigenous fruits and vegetables are being grown so that they are more resilient to our weather and will require fewer chemicals.  I am talking about seed sovereignty and supporting brilliant organisations such as the Irish Seed Savers Association.  If we cannot feed people, they cannot go to work.  I highlight food businesses.  I will stop talking now, otherwise the Minister will not have an opportunity to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#F00400","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.<\/p><p>I echo what Senator Garvey said on food production.  Senator Ahearn referred to apple and pear growers in Munster and it is similar in north County Dublin.  It is a great form of agriculture that helps us produce indigenous products and may be more climate friendly than other forms of food production.<\/p><p> We support the corporate sustainability due diligence directive in principle and think it is a good idea.  Our Department will be the lead Department on it.  It is done through the competitiveness council.  The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, attends that on behalf of the Department.  We want to make sure we get it right and do not want to make it too onerous.  There are a huge number of information obligations on businesses.  We are adding new ones every day and do not want to go too far on that front.  We want to make sure it is sensible and that we do not put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage relative to other countries but when it comes to issues such as child labour or environmental destruction, companies need to be exposed if they are engaging in such practices.   We need to call out and expose greenwashing from companies.  There are many things Irish people would not buy if they knew how and by whom they were manufactured.  Having transparency around that is to everyone&rsquo;s benefit.  <\/p><p> Energy audits are a good idea.  We offer grants and vouchers for businesses to get energy audits done, and want to increase the take-up of those.  There are new LEO grants for businesses to act on those audits.  There are many savings to be made.  There are two obvious ones I have come across.  One is open fridges, which I did not know much about until the students came in here and did their climate assembly in the D&aacute;il.  It was one of the ten things they put forward.  I have met retailers who have cut their electricity bills by as much as 50% by covering their fridges.  It is nice to be able to look into a fridge and not have to lift a lid but if those are the savings that can be achieved, we can all lift the lid.  It is extraordinary to freeze the air.  We should freeze the fridges and products in fridges, not the air around them.<\/p><p> I hope we will see a big uptake in solar from business and farmers.  We are putting the grants in place and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, announced just the other day changes to the grants for business to make them more accessible.  Planning rules have been changed too, so it will be much easier to put up a solar panel without planning permission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#F00500","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":274,"content":"<p>If putting up solar panels, you should check first you have done all you can to reduce electricity demands.

That is no small task and required much bravery from both sides to negotiate a potential way forward.  The next step is consultation in the coming months.  The timeline for implementation would require some major changes to our industrial relations law.  A lot of that would be governed by how quickly the EU directive progresses.  One reason we are doing this is that there is a new EU directive on minimum wages and collective bargaining.  We do not need to do much on the minimum wage side because our system with the Low Pay Commission, which I appreciate was established by the Senator&rsquo;s party, covers that.  However, our laws are not adequate on the collective bargaining side so the timeline will be determined by that directive.

It is for parents and carers, whereas remote working is not just for parents and carers - it is for all workers.  It is largely about where people work, rather than flexibility.  We decided to do it as two pieces of legislation for that reason.  It is probably too late now to put it in as an amendment to the Minister's legislation, but I can assure the Senator that we are not dragging our feet on it at all.  I thought we would have this done by now.

In his opening statement, the T&aacute;naiste described the south east as being one of the best performing regions over the past two years.  I am just wondering what qualitative and quantitative research the Department used to form that description.  I might provide the T&aacute;naiste with some of my own.  The south east has 8.9% of the country's population and 5.4% of IDA Ireland jobs.  I believe this shows that the IDA strategy has failed the south east to date, notwithstanding that I have engaged and am engaging with some of the companies that are presently announcing down there.  In terms of share of GDP, we have 6.7% of national GDP.  We are missing nearly &euro;10 billion of GDP.  At present, we are at &euro;28.5 billion, and I estimate that we should be at &euro;37.8 billion by that metric.  We have 209,000 people in the labour market, which is a record high, but we still have lower participation and higher unemployment rates.  It shows a shortfall of 11,000 individuals in the work area.  In terms of taxation, individuals in the south east pay 51.2% of the national average of all income taxes.  We have progressive tax, but this demonstrates the low job quality we have in the region.  In terms of PAYE jobs, the south east provides 48.5% of the national average of PAYE and the USC tax take.  On those metrics, I do not think we could be described as one of the best performing regions in the country.  I would say that in fact, we are still a laggard.  I have asked the T&aacute;naiste in the House and have engaged with the Department on it, but will the Government now consider establishing a western development-type commission for the south-east region?  It has been done very successfully in the west.  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, it is underpinned by statute and receives funding of around &euro;2.5 million per annum from which it can lever additional moneys.  It does applied research and comes up with strategic analysis that it is able to lobby the Government very effectively for.  That is something that is missing in the south east.

Last year the south east was either the best or the second best performing region in terms of jobs growth.  That is from Central Statistics Office, CSO, data.  It is a region that is catching up, and a region that is in the catch-up phase.  I believe that the Government's investment in infrastructure, in roads, in the national broadband plan, in tourist infrastructure like the greenways and in the technological university is the kind of investment that is now helping a region that is behind other regions in the State to catch up.  The Deputy will be aware of the hundreds of jobs announced in Waterford in the last year or so.  Most of those jobs have yet to be created, but when they are, they will bring a lot of well-paid jobs into Waterford city.  That will generate increased consumer spend and other jobs in that city.  Over 1,000 jobs have been announced in Kilkenny in the last few months, including 300 by State Street in financial services and the best part of 1,000 by Abbott in pharma.  Kilkenny, which is a relatively small city of 15,000 to 20,000 people, is seeing a huge level of investment, which I think is very encouraging.<\/p> <p>  I need to be frank about IDA jobs.  IDA jobs gravitate towards the large cities.  That is true the world over.  It is not something that we can change, and we need to be honest and realistic about that.  In Austria, Denmark or any other country, large multinational companies tend to locate their large facilities in major population centres.  They want to know that there are 1 million or 1.5 million people within commuting distance.  They want to know how many universities there are and how many international airports there are.  That is the kind of thing they want to know.  If we judge the south east only by IDA jobs, the south east and other regions will always be behind.  However, there is more to the economy than IDA jobs.  There are Enterprise Ireland jobs.  One of the biggest investments I am seeing at the moment on that front is the Glanbia-Royal A-Ware investment in Waterford Port for the new plant, which I had the honour to turn the sod on.  It is not all about the IDA.  Enterprise Ireland jobs are important too, as are tourism, agriculture and the small business sector.  It is wrong to judge a region just based on FDI, which will always gravitate to the very large cities.<\/p> <p>  We would be interested in exploring the idea of having a south-east development commission.  I think the jury is out on whether such initiatives are hugely successful.  The Western Development Commission does some really useful work.  It is doing really good stuff around remote working hubs at the moment.  We heard Senator Crowe, earlier in this discussion, pointing out that the western region has actually fallen behind, and is ranked lower by the EU than the south-east region under the metric that he referenced.  We had a body like that for the mid-west, Shannon Development, but a decision was made to go in a different direction.  I think the jury is out on whether having a regional body of that nature is hugely successful.  I would like to see that weighed up independently before making a call on it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#H00500","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":290,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste says \"potato\" and I say \"potahto\".  It depends on what is being measured when he is saying that the west has fallen behind.  Looking at where the west is in comparison to the south east, there is a far greater degree of wealth in the west at this time.  That was not the position 25 years ago.  I would contend that the Western Development Commission has done an excellent job, to be honest, in terms of framing strategic policy for that region.  On infrastructural investment in the south east, the T&aacute;naiste pointed out that IDA companies look for up to 1.5 million people to be within a commuting distance.  I can tell the T&aacute;naiste that Waterford has that metric already.  We are not lacking that.  However, the number of visits that are done by IDA Ireland, particularly to Waterford, is low.  In actual fact, the IDA office has only recently been added to in number.  A new executive director was appointed, which is welcome, but it is only starting to recognise the deficiencies that have been there.  On the T&aacute;naiste's comments on infrastructural investments that the south east region has seen, I would point out that we are not seeing investment in roads.  Nothing is being done on the N24 and N25 beyond a couple of million euro being spent on taking out bad bends.  There are no plans to upgrade either of those roads in the climate action plan or the Minister for Transport's directives on roads.

In essence, workers cannot access the industrial relations machinery of the State.  That is not just my view but that of the European Commission.  The Commission is very clear on this: \"The Commission has identified a number of shortcomings in Irish legislation, which fails to guarantee the right of workers' representatives\".  What puzzles me is that, in contrast with the Minister's positive comments on collective bargaining, which I very much welcome, his Department appears to have set its face entirely against allowing members of European work councils to access the industrial relations machinery of the State.  I genuinely cannot understand why that is the case, particularly because the European Commission has stated so clearly that there are problems with how the EU directive has been transposed and that we need to see amending legislation.  Essentially, this is a matter of fairness.<\/p> <p>  Seven trade unions across Europe, representing 45 million workers, have written to the Minister to highlight their concerns over the failure of the Government to act on this issue.  It is doing huge reputational damage to us across Europe.  My colleagues in SIPTU have raised this on several occasions.  Interestingly, the employer group Brussels European Employee Relations Group, BEERG, has also raised this and has been asking the Government to respond positively on it.

My second question relates to a commitment given by the Minister of State, Deputy English, earlier this year to deal with the fact that fishers cannot currently take cases under Part 2 of the Organisation of Working Time Act.  There have been some chilling cases on the exploitation of fishers.  One of them, put up yesterday on the Workplace Relations Commission's website, concerns a fisher called Jose Pame Salandron.  He was awarded just under &euro;14,000 because he was made work 80 or 90 hours per week on a boat.  This is all documented, but, because of the gap in legislation, most of the award from the Labour Court was actually taken off.  The good news is that, as far back as 2019, the Government made an agreement with the International Transport Workers' Federation, ITF, that it would introduce simple amending legislation to allow fishers to take cases.  However, nothing has been done since.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, said earlier this year that we would have legislation by springtime, but it still has not been seen.  I would like a clear commitment and timeline for the legislation.<\/p> <p>  On two occasions at meetings of this committee, we have had powerful presentations by representatives of the ITF detailing the shocking, exploitative abuse of fishers &ndash; the most horrendous kind of abuse.  The case I have cited is a case in point.  I am referring to working weeks of 70, 80 or 90 hours.  I understand there may well be a case taken against this State seeking Francovich damages in regard to that, but I cannot understand why, three and half years after an agreement with the ITF, simple legislation has still not been brought forward by the Department.  I would welcome a positive response from the Minister and a timeline as to when this issue will be dealt with to protect some of the most vulnerable migrant workers in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#J00900","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I have no doubt that there is very serious exploitation in the fishing industry.

At the risk of raising the ire of my colleague Deputy Shanahan, I have to say that not long after TalkTalk closed in the south east, one of the initiatives we took involved the creation of regional enterprise plans.  This was because we recognised every region had different competitive advantages and that you had to play to their strengths.  Regions are making progress as a result of that initiative.  I am delighted to hear &euro;180 million is being devoted to this.<\/p> <p>  I would like to raise a few issues of concern to me.  I will comment on the low take-up of the 2020 energy efficiency schemes.  It is incumbent on the Government to have a national import energy resilience initiative that examines much more seriously our excessive dependence on energy imports.  Our ambition is to halve our dependence on fossil fuels by 2030 and eliminate them altogether by 2050.  However, we have a lot of low-hanging fruit that neither businesses nor households are taking advantage of, for example, smart controls, smart meters, shallow first retrofits, sharing platforms, switching platforms, storage opportunities, solar opportunities, switching modes to electric vehicles, and charging points.  I could list dozens of measures that could be put in place by local authorities, the Government and businesses if they had a strategic approach, in addition to supports for householders so they can do the same.  We really need to take it seriously because the Ukraine crisis is not going to end quickly, nor are the energy and climate crises that underpin it.  That is the first strong call.  We need to see businesses taking the lead, with sectoral strategies to achieve that.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to my second point, which is that we are overlooking and downgrading the opportunity of the so-called circular economy approach to transforming how we see our sectors and build their competitive strengths for the future.  The idea associated with the circular economy is to examine the entire supply chain and seek to take out the damage that is done.<\/p><p>That includes climate damage but also pollution, excessive use of plastic and excessive damage to biodiversity.<\/p><p> One big advantage of this approach is it is non-confrontational and problem-solving, whereas much of the debate about climate is a finger-pointing exercise that involves complaining about people not pulling their weight, when we need to approach this in a collective way.  About 80% of environmental damage is baked in at the design stage, so if we start to get businesses rethinking the way they approach their sector, whether that is construction, food, fast fashion or whatever, and thinking about how the sector and the markets are structured, we can get transformative change that is not very expensive.  It absolutely makes sense for Ireland to take a lead in this area.  It has been downgraded and is not included as a platform in the climate plan, and has instead been put into a siding where just the Environmental Protection Agency is supposed to be developing programmes, but that agency does not have the leverage to drive the sectoral changes that are necessary.<\/p><p> I have congratulated the T&aacute;naiste on the national minimum wage, the living wage, the auto-enrolment scheme, the sick pay scheme, the protection of tips, the remote working Bill and so on.  Is there an issue for SMEs and the pressure it may put on some of those more vulnerable companies as we seek to draw lessons from the underprotection of people in the past?  How can we strike that balance and ensure we phase this in a way whereby smaller businesses can manage that transition?  What thinking is going into that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#J01500","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for mentioning the regional enterprise plans, which I neglected to mention in response to Deputy Shanahan.  The south-east local authorities, in particular, really embraced the most recent regional enterprise plan.  They appointed a programme manager and helped to make it happen.  A new plan has been agreed and they are going to be funded.  We have &euro;180 million in European funding to fund them.  The Ministers of State, Deputies English and Calleary, and I hope to open the first call of funding before the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  On energy conservation and energy efficiency, the Deputy is absolutely correct.  This is a big opportunity to change our ways and embrace energy conservation and efficiency.  The question we are asking ourselves is whether what we are experiencing is a shock or a shift.  It is generally a shock in terms of the sharp increase in energy prices, but it could also be a shift.  We may see that energy prices are going to be higher permanently.  I am really impressed at the way the Dutch responded to the oil crisis in the 1970s.  In pictures of Amsterdam, Leiden and Utrecht from the 1970s and 1980s, the cities look like ours.  It is all cars, with perhaps a few bus lanes.  If you visit those cities now, you see how they changed their ways in the 1970s and embraced cycling, pedestrianisation and permeability.  Although this is a different crisis, there is a great opportunity for us to embrace energy efficiency and use energy much better.  We need to do that and drive it from a Government level.<\/p> <p>  I am a big fan of the circular economy, the legislation for which is now complete, as the Deputy will be aware.  It is a big legislative change, brought through by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  I think it is very good legislation, although I hear the Deputy's criticism that it might need to be mainstreamed rather than sidelined, and I will think on that.<\/p> <p>  I have been trying to embrace it myself a bit.  I had my runners refitted and redone a couple of months ago.  It did not work so well for my leather shoes but I had two sets of runners renovated instead of buying a new pair.  It cost about &euro;40 or &euro;50 and they came back as good as new.  Anyone would think they were new.  I would have always thrown them out previously.  There are many opportunities to reuse materials and create jobs in doing so.  I visited the Milk Market in Limerick a couple of weeks ago and a lady who runs a vintage shop was telling me it is now quite common for girls who are looking for their communion dresses not to want fast fashion but instead to want a vintage dress.  There are many opportunities to reuse materials and create jobs that we need to embrace fully.<\/p> <p>  Finally, on the point about stronger workers' rights and higher wages, this is something that worries me because we are putting a great deal of pressure on small employers, through increases in the minimum wage, the move to the living wage, stronger workers' rights and auto-enrolment.  History tells us this does not affect employment.  We have never had higher wages or so many workers' rights, yet so many people have never been at work.  I do not buy this argument, therefore, that low wages and poor workers' rights result in high employment and economic growth.  That is clearly not the case and it is not the experience of our nation.<\/p> <p>  Even so, I am clouded into the fact that if we go too far too fast, we might end up doing things that are perverse.  I am concerned that if we go too fast, employers might have to reduce people's hours or lay people off to cover the cost of the increased wages and rights we are imposing on them.  That is something we have to keep a close eye on.  I still think, as do the Central Bank, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Department of Finance, that notwithstanding all we are doing, total employment will increase again next year.  If it does not, we will have to think about this, and one of the good aspects of the Low Pay Commission's report on the living wage is that, although it has set a four-year target to introduce it, it is clear it can go faster or more slowly, depending on economic circumstances, and we have to have regard to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#K00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Sick pay is to be introduced in January.

Will the Minister outline how the Department will ensure the systems are in place to ensure that only businesses that qualify under the terms of the scheme will be able to benefit under its terms?  The net needs to be cast wide but there is a concern.  People were extremely angry that businesses benefited from support during Covid and those same businesses subsequently paid out dividends to their shareholders.  That angered people because they felt those businesses maybe did not need that support.  Is there going to be a system in place to ensure against this or is it a case of bringing everyone in?

I offer my particular thanks to all of the staff in the section.  We had to increase the staffing levels pretty dramatically - we have trebled them - and we had to do a certain amount of automation, which will help into the future as well.  It is actually a money-generating area of the Department.  It is one of those ironies in that we did not have enough staff, but all of the staff bring in a lot of money because employers have to pay for the permits.  The fact we got sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the extra staff made all the difference.  I want to maintain them in that area so we continue to have efficient turnaround for businesses on work permits.<\/p> <p>  What happened was similar to what happened with the passports.  There was a huge fall in demand during the pandemic and then it bounced back to a record level.  The Senator will know that in the passport section, over 1 million passports issued this year, and it really was one of those post-pandemic effects where there was a massive snapback in demand.  We were not as prepared for it as maybe we should have been, but we are on top of it now and we plan to stay on top of it.

It is probably one of the best sites in the country.  Mr. Martin Shanahan, who appeared before the committee recently, also said that.  It is a fully serviced site on 56 ha with water, sewerage and electricity utilities.  There is a rail link at one end of the site and a dual carriageway at the other end.  It has been lying idle for the best part of 20 years and it cannot be developed because the road infrastructure is not up to standard.  Cork County Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, had plans to upgrade the road outside the site but they were abandoned last year or put on hold.  I have spoken about this with the T&aacute;naiste in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere to try to get the road infrastructure up to standard again because the site is just sitting there.  IDA Ireland cannot get companies to locate in it because the road infrastructure is not up to standard.  They cannot get access to the motorway nearby.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage was in Midleton recently where he kick-started at long last the commencement of 2,500 houses, which will also have access to the road infrastructure, as will 3,000 houses in Carrigtwohill.  The road is highly dangerous as matters stand and without an upgrade.  Those are three extremely good reasons for upgrading it.  The point I emphasise, however, is the fact that the IDA Ireland site is lying idle and many companies could use it.  There is a shortage of these kinds of sites in the southern region.  Perhaps the Minister could use his good offices to kick-start this again.<\/p> <p>  More than &euro;1.2 million has already been spent on the design and plans for the road, if not more, and there are people who cannot sell their houses there because they do not know what the future will hold.  Everything is frozen until the Government decides to move this project again.  There are many good reasons for getting it moving and I ask the T&aacute;naiste to act on this.<\/p> <p>  I asked about CETA earlier when we spoke about trade.  I am interested in hearing what the up-to-date thinking on that is.  I know there are some political differences but perhaps our engagement with Canada might help to throw some light on that.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister comment on Balance for Better Business, which I set up when I was in the Department of Justice?  It is now under the remit of his Department.  I understand the group is still active and I would like a report on how it is going.<\/p> <p>  The Ukraine credit guarantee scheme and the growth and sustainability loan scheme both provide low-cost loans.  What interest rates are we talking about for those schemes and for how long will they be in place?  The growth and sustainability loan scheme provides low-cost loans to farmers, fishers and SMEs.  The Minister probably knows that if farmers get grant aid under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, to install solar panels and so on, they cannot get paid for exporting electricity to the grid.  That is a barrier to farmers using solar energy to power their enterprises.  It does not make any sense to me.  I think it is a European issue.  We should be encouraging and supporting farmers and businesspeople to install solar panels as well as batteries so that they can store electricity.  Farmers often use electricity at peak times for milking during mornings and evenings.  Energy storage in batteries would take pressure off the grid.  The grant aid for that is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#M00400","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I know from my trips to Midleton that the former Amgen site is a great site, and I am sure we will get an investor into it at some point in the not-too-distant future.  I agree with the Deputy on the road issue, which we are working on.  My Department and IDA Ireland are engaging with the Department of Transport and I hope funding will be available in 2023 to bring it to the next stage.  I hear what the Deputy is saying about people whose homes and properties are affected.  There is nothing worse than to have one's land or home sterilised.  Not knowing whether the project will go ahead is unfair on people.<\/p> <p>  On CETA, there is still an active court case on that.  We will wait until the conclusion of that before proceeding to ratification.  We expect a judgment in the coming weeks.  We will not press ratification until that judgment is handed down from the courts.  There was an issue in Germany that has now resulted in a further clarification instrument from the European Commission and needs to be signed off by Canada.  It is designed to reassure some of the people who had concerns about aspects of the agreement.<\/p> <p>  Balance for Better Business is going really well.  When the Deputy established the group, women constituted only about 13% of executive company board members.  That has now increased to about 34% or 40%.  We are getting there without any quotas.  It was done through persuasion and soft engagement, with hard engagement sometimes.  It really was business talking to business.  We are making good progress there.  However, I am conscious that there are only a small number of ISEQ companies.  Legislation is on the way from Deputy Higgins and the European Union that could bring in quotas for corporate boards, which is the direction of travel.  Would it not be great if we achieved it anyway and quotas became unnecessary because we had already achieved gender equality or parity.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to the Deputy in writing on the interest rates.  The rates are different for the different products as well as for different businesses because banks have to factor risk into the price.  Therefore, I cannot provide a straightforward answer and will get back to the Deputy in writing.<\/p> <p>  On  microgeneration, I will take up that issue with the Ministers, Deputy McConalogue and Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Any time I inquire about it I am told it is sorted, or almost sorted, and that farmers and businesspeople will be able to sell into the grid.  There are issues about how much can be sold and issues with grid connections.  I thought that was almost sorted through the microgeneration scheme but, obviously, it is not.

I am certainly an optimist.  If I was not, I would not have stood for election in national politics in the hope that I might influence Government policy.  I also remind the Minister that I have only been a public servant for the past three years.  In my previous career, I was self-employed and worked in the private sector.  Yes, I am an optimist but in being an optimist, we cannot wish our problems away either.<\/p> <p>  On Senator Ahearn's comments about the N24, I would include the N25 in that.  I would also like to understand the status of those projects in terms of the national development plan.  I am around long enough to remember the promise made to Waterford Institute of Technology, as it was then, in 2009 for an engineering building.  That has yet to be delivered and was supposed to be part of the national plan.<\/p> <p>  I raise the concerns in the SME space, a few of which I will highlight.  One concern is the indebtedness of companies that have availed of the warehousing debt scheme.  Some of them have started making payments again since last February or March.  They may have been slow in getting back on the programme and, if so, they are not tax compliant now and are, therefore, outside the supports the Department is proposing to support SMEs.  This issue needs to be looked at.  There are valuable and viable businesses involved but they have to be properly supported.<\/p> <p>  The 40% energy support will not be adequate to cover some businesses.  It should be looked at in a more sector-specific way rather than being applied across the board at 40%, and that needs to be done immediately.  I ask the Minister to immediately convene an emergency task force to address the challenges facing the SME sector.  In the next three to four months, as the Minister will be aware from the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, businesses will get into significant financial distress very quickly.<\/p> <p>  I will outline a number of measures that could be introduced.  SMEs should be able to access business management consultancy through local enterprise offices to help them with productivity, renewable efficiencies and changing their product suite, portfolio and manufacturing practices.  Unfortunately, when people have a small or even a medium-sized business, they are so involved in what is going on that sometimes outside eyes are far better in that regard.<\/p> <p>  We must look at State procurement again.  A large amount of State procurement in this country does not do anything.  I know one might say we cannot favour indigenous companies but actually we can.  When one looks at what happens in Germany and France compared with our procurement process and the level of participation of our indigenous businesses, there is a gulf between them.  That needs to be looked at.<\/p> <p>  In the agrifood sector, in particular, there are major challenges in food manufacturing.  These companies use heating and cooling to manufacture products and are massive energy consumers.  They have to be treated in a special way.<\/p><p>We need to look at the dominance of the supermarket sector in this country.  It is killing small suppliers.  There is market dominance almost bordering on anti-competitive practices.  We have to find a way to start breaking these cartels.  In Dungarvan in my county there is another application by a major multinational supermarket to locate in a town of 10,000 people which is already serviced by four large supermarket chains.  This makes no sense.  I am not saying we should obstruct planning but we have to have a policy on this because we are killing indigenous small business in market towns.  This is why we see towns in the middle of the country with shops and houses boarded up.  We are trying to regenerate the rural economy.<\/p><p> I have asked the T&aacute;naiste a number of times if a representative of ISME can be appointed to the LEEF.  Deputy Stanton spoke about the family business network.  ISME did significant work with the Department, particularly in the area of insurance reform.

The EU rules state 30% so we will have to get state aid approval for 40%.  That is as far as we can go under the current rules.  Those EU rules are there for a reason, namely, to protect taxpayers' money, make sure we do not over-subsidise business and ensure we do not create competitive distortions whereby one government in Spain subsidises its business to a certain amount and the government in Portugal does not.  That does not arise so much for us, given our geographical position, but those EU rules are there for good reasons.  They may be a little strict.

It has had an injunction placed on the Department preventing it from signing the wage agreement for security workers into law.  These are low-wage workers.  This happened at the end of August.  The State did not enter a defence or did not try to contest the injunction.  As of ten days ago, the State has effectively sat on its hands and done nothing.  We have asked the Minister of State, Deputy English, what is happening on this.  He tells us he cannot say anything.  Frankly, it is not good enough that the State would not contest an injunction-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#N01300","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":354,"content":"<p>We agreed that the committee would not discuss this matter for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#N01400","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":355,"content":"<p>We need to hear some assurance that the Department is doing something because there are low-wage workers who are hearing nothing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022100500002#N01500","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I must cut the Senator off there.

I have worked in the film industry for almost 29 years as a stagehand, supervising stagehand and standby stagehand since 1994.  Since 1998 I have worked with the largest group of film producer companies in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Central to my employment is section 481.  Employment and training form one of only two key fundamental objectives of the Act.  The current film regulations are covered by SI 119 of 2019.  The objective of section 481, as amended, are set out in Part 2 of the regulations as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> \t(3) A certificate shall not be issued by the Minister under section 481(2)(a) of the Act of 1997 in relation to a film unless &mdash;  \t <blockquote> \t(a) the film is eligible for certification under Part 3, and<br \/><br \/>(b) the Minister is satisfied that the film will either or both - <blockquote> \t(i) be of importance to the promotion, development and enhancement of the national culture including, where applicable, the Irish language (referred to as &lsquo;the Culture test&rsquo;), and<br \/><br \/>(ii) act as an effective stimulus to film making in the State through, among other things, the provision of quality employment, and training and skills development opportunities (referred to as &lsquo;the Industry development test&rsquo;). <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>The objectives as set out at subparagraph (i) are no longer met, as we understand it, despite the recent success of Irish language films.  The objectives as set out in subparagraph (ii) are not capable of being met according to the employers and their representative body.  It should be noted that film workers were fully aware that the objectives at this subparagraph of the regulations were not being met.<br\/><br\/>However, the fact that these objectives cannot be met only came to my attention by way of statements submitted to both the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and Labour Court of which I have direct knowledge.<\/p><p>The employer and the employer's representative body - Screen Producers Ireland - submitted to those statutory agencies that section 418 prevented the production sector from having an ongoing employment relationship with the crews.  This they attributed to the structure of section 481 and the uncertainty associated with the production sector globally.  They provided no rationale for this contention.  If the facts submitted by the employers and their representative body are correct, then it begs the question as to why they and others consistently and aggressively lobby for the section's retention in its current form.  Despite the forerunners of section 481 dating back to 1984, given the statements referred to above, the industry appears not to have benefited to any great extent from the legislation.<\/p><p> Until 2015, section 481 was a tax relief available to investors who had a corporation tax liability.  It is now directly payable to film producer companies regardless of whether they have a corporation tax liability.  Clearly, section 481 has become a handout, and a significant one, amounting to 32% of the budget up to a maximum of &euro;70 million, plus a 5% regional uplift in many cases.<\/p><p> Given the employers' assertions and the fact that there are no companies of scale, no employees and no owned infrastructure despite almost &euro;4 billion of taxpayer investment to date, it is clear that there are fundamental structural reforms relating to the relief that need to be debated and implemented.  Film producer companies are the only beneficiaries of section 481, yet they are never directly heard.  A number of outlier organisations run interference for them, which serves to muddy the waters and stifle debate.  Given the requirement of the legislation that the relief be predicated on meeting the culture test and the industry development test, the only relevant voices are those of the producer company executives and the taxpayer.  If those tests are not being met or are, for some inexplicable reason, incapable of being met by the beneficiaries, then the Minister is not doing her job and there are fundamental governance issues to be addressed.<\/p><p> One way to address the issues is by amending the order in which the relief is paid.  Currently, 90% of section 481 is payable up front on certification of the film by the Minister.  A fairer system for the taxpayer, and one that would afford significant protections for the workers, would see only 10% being paid up front.  It should be noted that section 481 was not designed to be an operating subsidy or an investment buy-in for the producers.  The remaining 90% would then be payable after six months when compliance had been determined by the relevant Departments.  Compliance cannot be determined in advance.  Although I am no expert, it would appear that corporation tax is a cumulative liability that cannot be determined in advance either.<\/p><p> What we are suggesting is not in any way an unreasonable request.  Therefore, we urge Deputies of all parties to take the opportunity presented by the extension of section 481 and the impending amending film regulations to ensure that a fairer and more transparent system of stimulating film production is brought about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022100500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Arkins","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I am an advocate for the Irish Film Workers Association and I work in employment law.  Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended and currently structured, does not work.  It does not work for our cultural aspirations, the crews or the taxpayer.  Committee members will have received submissions from a wide range of vested interest individuals and organisations, none of whom is a recipient of section 481.  Many of the submissions will say that section 481 is crucial to the ongoing development of the film industry.  While section 481 has been crucial to the development of the Irish film industry since 1984, there has been no significant development.  If one cares to drill down, one will see that there is no indigenous industry because we lack the essential characteristics of an industry.  We do not have large employment numbers - 2,158 was the Department of Finance's estimated figure in 2019 - and the producers do not appear to have a business model, buildings, infrastructure, machines, vehicles, etc.  Since the producers do not own content, they have no ownership of the product either.<\/p> <p>  Content is crucial to the taxpayer as well.  Creative Capital, a Department-commissioned report to plan for the industry from 2011 through 2015, recognised the issues relating to owning content in the films being made.  One of its key recommendations highlighted the difficulties for the indigenous industry when the producer companies concentrated on simply servicing \"Hollywood\" productions.  The report's committee recognised ownership of content as crucial to development.  This is what it said was needed: \"Rights ownership to vest in production companies and content creators to drive export growth.\"<\/p> <p>  I will outline a few facts about section 481 that are not generally understood or may be ignored because they do not fit the narrative of the vested interests.  The objective of section 481 and its predecessors was to stimulate the development of an indigenous Irish film industry, meeting two key criteria - a culture test and an industry development test.  My colleague, Mr. Arkins, has referred the committee to the relevant film regulations.  Section 481 is payable to an Irish producer company that has a track record in film production, is based in the State and gives a solemn undertaking to the Minister that it will adhere to all employment, social and Community laws.  Section 481 is not payable to foreign directive investment, FDI, companies and is not intended as a mechanism to attract FDI, according to the legislation.  If filming here, FDI companies must take on an Irish producer company and crew.<\/p> <p>  Section 481 is part of a significant suite of State aid available to Irish producer companies to meet the criteria of the regulations.  Be that money loans or grants from Screen Ireland or investment by RT&Eacute;, TG4, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, or any other State-funded agency, the criteria are the same.  The sole objective of section 481 is to develop an indigenous industry turning out Irish product.  It is not payable so that the producers can invest it in \"Hollywood\" for no return on the investment to anyone other than themselves.  Section 481 is not payable so that the producer can service American multinational and streaming platforms so that, when they complete their film or TV projects, fold up their tents and strike for home shores, the Irish producer lays off the crews and sits back until another service opportunity arrives.  This is not the way to develop an indigenous industry, yet that is the reality in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  State aid to film productions is mandated by EU law.  The obligations are the same - produce films that express European culture and train and maintain a permanent pool of experienced employees.  It is unclear how the EU will view Ireland's film industry if we are only servicing Hollywood productions and not developing an indigenous industry or maintaining a permanent pool of experienced crew.<\/p> <p>  Using the Government's own commissioned report as a benchmark, there are approximately 500 production companies in Ireland.  Based on Department of Finance figures, there are 2,158 employees, 900 of whom are PAYE workers, the remainder being freelance grades.  This translates to an average of 2.5 employees in each of those companies or, in other words, the principals of the companies.  This is wholly consistent with what our association has known for many years through union membership figures.  It is a far cry from the 17,000 being touted by vested interest groups.  Crucially, the 2,158 have as-and-when jobs, not full-time ones.<\/p> <p>  To recap, there are no jobs other than casual as-an-when jobs, no buildings, no infrastructure, no camera equipment, post-production or other paraphernalia associated with a production process, and we do not own any content of note.  In other words, there is no industry.  Is that a fair return for the taxpayer on an investment of close to &euro;4 billion since the reliefs were introduced?  Not by a long shot.<\/p><p>We hope the committee can see there is something fundamentally wrong with this picture and urge reforms, and that the key stakeholders, that is, the taxpayer, the employers and the employees, can be brought to the table to debate what are serious and fundamental structural problems.  With amending film regulations imminent to reflect the extension of section 481, the time for debate is now.  Kicking cans down long roads does not work and will not work anymore.  The taxpayer simply cannot afford this playacting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022100500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Liz Murray","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.

I cannot see how that is the case, because how else can the industry development test be met?<\/p> <p>  As for production companies, nobody has a crew until somebody starts a film.  There are no crews in any of the production companies in Ireland until somebody makes a film.  They then go into the marketplace and hire a crew through, say, props heads of department and construction heads of department.  Our people are on the construction end in set craft.  A construction manager is hired and he or she rings the crew members and asks whether they are available and can come in.  That is how it goes.  The production companies pay the crew and when the film is finished, they are laid off.  If the crew members are lucky enough to be able to claim from the Department of Social Protection, that is what they do until somebody else looks for them, notwithstanding the fact they have might worked extensively with one employer.

I am a man of 58 years of age.  I lost my job because I appeared here in Leinster House in 2018 to talk about what it is like to work in the film industry, as did 40 other men.  I cannot get a job because I have no references from my 28 years of work.  The people I have worked for refuse to give me a reference because they say I do not work for them.  That is the impact on me, as a 58-year-old man in Ireland today, after working in a film industry where my employer has &euro;4 billion to create quality employment.  I have to hand copies of agreements that have governed my working life going back to 1994.  I was promised a pension in 1994 but not one penny has been put into a pension scheme for any worker in the film industry.<\/p> <p>  I am one of the men involved in the WRC case.  I was told to go to the WRC by Deputies in this building and I went and put in my case.  The people I identified as my employers have said they are not my employer.  They do not turn up.  One employer has made &euro;250 million within six years but he did not turn up.  Even when he was subpoenaed by the Labour Court, he did not turn up.

I could bring before the committee a gentleman who worked in the industry for 44 years.  The &euro;4 billion has to be spent in his lifetime.

Nobody should be punished or blacklisted or lose his or her employment for advocating for better working rights for themselves and their fellow workers, and I hope this hearing can get to the nub of some of this.  Given the testimony we have heard, it is clear, as he said, that a signed statement that screen producers submitted to the Labour Court claimed that their members cannot have an employment relationship with workers because of the operation of section 481, and as we know, employees are employed through DACs.  It appears, however, that that is in conflict with section 481, given that section requires the applicant to give an undertaking to provide quality employment and to comply with all the relevant employment legislation.  How can a company, therefore, benefit from section 481 and the tax reliefs that flow from it and give that undertaking if it does not employ anybody?

It is an accounting tool to keep the money for each film within the confines of that single film so it cannot be spread about to other films.  In the context of section 481, therefore, the DAC is muddying the waters in that the employers are telling us or trying to imply the DAC is perhaps the employer.  However, in the undertaking the Department of Finance made in 2019, the Department specifically mentioned certain legislation.  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act and adherence to that is mentioned specifically.  A person must be employed on two contracts over a four-year period to qualify for that.  The producer company then has to be the one with the responsibility to ensure adherence to that particular legislation, and from that flows all other legislation, but because that has a qualifying criteria of two contracts over four years, it is the one that is easiest to relate to.

In fairness, they have not gone into the individual adjudications, if you like.  What they are saying is incredibly relevant because it underlines the point that the sole purpose of this tax relief is to create quality employment and training and to contribute to Irish culture.  If it does not do those things, then it should not be paid out.  More to the point, the recipients of that must sign a solemn declaration saying they are doing that.  Ms Murray and Mr. Arkins have spelled this out, but if they feel there is anything more they can say to do so, then they should, because as I look on, there is an incredible, gross contradiction.  On the one hand, film producers last year could get &euro;100 million for this by signing a solemn undertaking they are creating quality employment and training, and then the very same people can walk into the WRC and say they can have no employment relationship with the people who worked on the film production.  It is not just that they do not have an employment relationship with Mr. Arkins or a particular individual but that they say they cannot have an employment relationship with them.  They are blaming section 481, which is dubious, to put it mildly, but it is an incredible contradiction.  I do not know if Ms Murray and Mr. Arkins want to spell that out.  In that regard, I ask them to elaborate the point about the EU directives on state aid and industry development, because from my reading of this, the only reason the EU allows particular forms of state aid is to create a permanent pool of talent.  How do you create a permanent pool if the people who get the state aid say they cannot under any circumstances have any employees?  It is hard for me to understand how that can be sustained and whether it has to be investigated.  Ms Murray and Mr. Arkins may have some comments on that.<\/p> <p>  Another question I am interested in relates to something our guests often say.  Maybe it is worth underlining the figures for how much has gone into section 481 over the past decade.  Our guests always put it fairly starkly by asking what we have got for all that public money.  Can anybody think of any other area of expenditure where the State would have forked out &euro;4 billion and have nothing, literally nothing, for it, namely, no employees, no ownership of content, no studios, no equipment and no props?  We have literally nothing.  Maybe they could say a little about where that money is going or where they think it is going because, at the end of it, the State does not seem to have anything for the investment.

Then when the same producer would be doing a job, and I worked with the same construction managers and producers for 20 years, they would hire back at below the market rate the same stuff the taxpayer paid for on the previous production.  That puts pressure on the hire companies outside that hire stuff out.  That is where the stuff would go and that is the same for all departments.  I know that because I have witnessed it.  I have been in the warehouses where the stuff is that was bought by the taxpayer for the productions and for the production company that is supposed to be building a company of scale.

In his opening statement, Mr. Arkins pointed out that the real value of the film and TV industry is not at the point of production but is in the copyright and intellectual property created by all the parties.  According to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, enforcement of intellectual property protection is essential to preserve the legal validity of intellectual property rights, prevent infringement in order to avoid wholesale damage to a person and his or her goods and services, including loss of goodwill and reputation, and seek compensation for actual damage caused.  Does Mr. Arkins think the State is failing in its obligation to protect the intellectual property of all parties involved in bringing a film or TV show to the screen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022100500002#E00700","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":421,"content":"<p>The whole thing about intellectual property is best left to Equity.

Regarding the three people, of whom I am aware, scope found against the employer in those cases but those three people were not listed.  The contracts that were issued to them called them something else other than the grade in which they were actually employed.  This was done to suit the document.  In 2019, the document was withdrawn but a new version is under negotiation.  I have seen the draft of the new version and the people negotiating it are a commercial semi-State company, Screen Ireland.  I do not know what its involvement is but it has a huge involvement in employment matters that should not have anything to do with it.  The new document is being negotiated and they are looking to include actors as employees.  The irony is that we, the crew who have worked for all of these years, are not employees when it comes to prosecuting legal rights of entitlement.  Actors are truly freelance because they have unique qualities and Screen Ireland now wants them to be employees.  My suspicion is that someone who is an employee of a company does not have any intellectual property rights.

After three months, the Departments responsible for culture, finance and jobs should check the position and only give the remaining 90% when all of the boxes have been ticked.

The Minister stated that a new collective agreement had been agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, regarding construction crew.  Part of that collective agreement deals with pensions, but there is a significant issue with pensions, one that also has to do with state aid and Europe in general.  The agreement is an industry agreement that the Department says should make things equal, but it does not stand approved by the Labour Court.  Industry collective agreements were shot down by the Supreme Court as being unconstitutional.  The Deputy will recall the construction industry registered employment agreement, REA, and the catering agreement.  For example, National Electrical Contractors Ireland had a case.  Those bodies won their cases and the legislation was amended in 2012.  Now, we can have sectoral employment orders, but they must be approved by the Labour Court.  The Labour Court must take a great deal into consideration, for example, the amount and ratio of representation in an industry.  If there are 2,158 people, it will not take much to work out the ratio, but we must also take into account the added dimension of other member states.  If someone from another member state comes to Ireland, his or her terms and conditions of employment cannot be driven down because we have an agreement that is at the minimum rates of pay.  I believe our colleagues in Equity will speak to the committee about the UK agreements and how Irish actors fare worse here than equivalent actors who come from outside.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry for forgetting my train of thought, but I wished to say something to the Deputy relating to Mr. Arkins's point.

It has played a key role in the growth of the sector and in the creation of contract jobs for our crews, a whole new generation of animators and our members, the professional performers who populate the film and television productions that are produced in Ireland every year.<\/p> <p>  It is vital that we remember the most important stakeholder in section 481, namely, the taxpayer.  Section 481 is the investment of taxpayers and it must be protected and the return on that investment optimised.  With these stakeholders in mind, it is vital that the reputational, legal, and financial risks associated with the operation of section 481 are fully considered and effectively managed, and our full submission is chiefly concerned with these risks and how they can be managed.<\/p> <p>  For the purposes of this introduction, let us consider one of those risks.  In the same way that contracted crews are protected by a range of employment legislation, all performers and creatives are protected by that legislation, as well as by the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and the European copyright directive.  However, although productions must sign a statement to the effect that they will comply with relevant employment legislation to secure section 481 investment, the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and the EU copyright directive are not specifically listed in the statement.  This legislation must be listed and applied in full and the rights of the performer must not be contractually overridden.<\/p> <p>  Why is this important?  The real value of the film and television industry does not exist at the point of production.  Rather, it is contained in the copyright and intellectual property of all the parties contributing to the final product.  All performers own property rights under the copyright legislation.  These property rights have a financial value to those who own them, namely, the performers, and those who want them, namely, the producers.  The most important of these rights is the right to proportionate remuneration for the ongoing financial exploitation of the performance, as enshrined in Article 18 of the EU copyright directive.  In order to manage this legislative risk, adherence to copyright regulation must become an eligibility requirement for section 481 applicants, if section 481 is to be consistent with Irish and European legislation.  For the record, the protections provided by Articles 18 to 22, inclusive, of the European copyright directive state that the protection of authors and performers is the core principle that should inform the interpretation and implementation of said articles and that this principle implies that the articles have a binding nature and cannot be contractually overridden, except insofar as expressly permitted by the directive.  Article 18 vests the performer with the right to an appropriate and proportionate remuneration for the ongoing financial exploitation of his or her work.  What this means is that a small percentage of the worldwide revenue streams created by the ongoing sale of the production will find their way back to the performer.  The European Copyright Society, ECS, states that these provisions have to be interpreted in a strict manner and should not serve as ways to exclude some contracts or situations from the protective provisions, to the detriment of authors and performers.<\/p> <p>  It is a concern to us, and a growing legal and reputational risk to the audiovisual sector, that Irish actors are being contracted on lesser terms and conditions than their international colleagues, as well as being denied their copyright, even though both Irish and international performers are being part-funded by section 481 taxpayer investment.  To this end, section 481 must ensure that the Copyright and Related Rights Act and the EU copyright directive are implemented in full, that all agreements and contracts comply with the legislation protecting the rights of the artist, that there is greater transparency with regard to the assignment of performers&rsquo; property rights and their value to the end user as required by the Article 19 of the EU directive, and that indigenous Irish performers are engaged on terms and conditions equal to and not less than any other performer who qualifies under section 481.  These steps will ensure the performer will have some protection within the negotiating process.<\/p> <p>  One of the motivations behind section 481 is the creation of quality employment.<\/p><p>The Olsberg report on the film industry states: \"Economic net benefit is a more comprehensive measurement than fiscal net benefit as it recognises that governments do not invest to benefit their treasuries, but rather on behalf of all citizens as a means to raise standards of living.\"  Section 481 must respect the rights of citizens protected under the copyright legislation and ensure that all performers share in the success of the industry in order that their incomes are increased and more of them enter the tax net.  Section 481 must ensure that all creatives thereby benefit from a rise in their standard of living and the creation of sustainable careers in an otherwise precarious environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022100500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Thank you for that contribution, Mr. O'Brien.

We have a system that has been honed over, say, the past 25 years, and I am around long enough to have seen and to describe how the change has occurred.  There are about five or six major players and they are safe hands, as far as you are concerned, and you ensure that people have to give their rights to those players, but the question is how those rights are assigned.  If those players have all the power, they have the ability to make sure that the assignment of rights is not necessarily fair.  We have that problem and that imbalance, which was part of what the European copyright directive deliberately set out to change.  That directive was designed to recognise that individual performers and individual writers, when going to major production houses, do not have the leverage to create a fair environment for themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022100500002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien.

Where the Government does something to try to increase the standard of living of its people, as the Olsberg report states, rather than necessarily adding to its coffers, there are people who will be in a position to control how those revenues go.  In the arts, in particular, because the most important asset to an artist is his or her copyright and intellectual property, there will always be that imbalance.  Then there is the ability of people in power to believe that they are doing right whereas they could actually be damaging the reputation and the government support.  We want to try to make sure that that is worked out.  Yes, there is a possibility.

I started my career 50 years ago.  I saw an Ireland where if I met somebody from the crew boasting that there was one film in Ardmore last year and that he or she worked on it, that was a bonus year, a bumper year, for people.  The growth in the past 25 or 30 years is down to the stimulus the Government has given.  I have not seen an increase in the quality of life of the performers or the crew to a great degree, and that is down to negotiations and a lot of other factors.  We work extraordinarily hard.  People see the red carpet.  They do not see the hard work, the 5 a.m. calls, the long hours and the 11-hour days.  They do not see all the work that goes into creating those 90 minutes on the screen.  Everybody should benefit.<\/p> <p>  Now, when I say the real wealth does not exist at the point of production, that is where the hard work exists.  The real wealth exists in the distribution globally.  You can have a &euro;1 million, &euro;10 million or &euro;100 million financial bomb in a certain location, but the real wealth then lies in the &euro;800 million, &euro;900 million or &euro;1 billion in revenue that is generated from that.  If we had, as our colleagues in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England and in the US and Canada have, a proportionate remuneration, as stated in the EU directive, from those revenue streams making their way back to us, we would all benefit from the success of the industry.  We need to have two sectors here.  We have the point of production, where we need fair play, fair hours and the working time Act.  Then we have the copyright Act.  That is the part where actors make their living, and that has been denied to Irish actors.  I cannot say, therefore, that everybody is benefiting equally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022100500002#L01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":537,"content":"<p>Does Ms Quinn wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022100500002#L01500","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":538,"content":"<p>First, I wish to acknowledge that section 481 provides significant investment in the audiovisual sector and, of course, we welcome that.

Within that comes a requirement to make the industry sustainable for all stakeholders, including those workers who participate within it.<\/p><p>Currently, that is not always the case, which is regrettable.  It is about sustainability of the industry and sustainability for all.  We need to have due regard to the maximisation of taxpayers' investment.  We are all taxpayers and we all have a vested interest in ensuring we maximise that investment, for obvious reasons.<\/p><p> The third point, from my perspective, is we need to ensure there are quality jobs within the industry.  There are a number of hallmarks of quality jobs but, sadly, at present some of those hallmarks are not visible to us and certainly not enjoyed by our members.  It is a dynamic industry and section 481 plays a significant part in attracting interest on the island of Ireland, but we see absolutely no reason that our members should have to work for lesser terms and conditions than our colleagues in the Six Counties.  If performers and crew are performing to the same standard, then we believe the rate of pay should reflect that.  We welcome further scrutiny of section 481, its criteria and compliance with it because in order for the industry to benefit in its totality from that section it has to ensure that all stakeholders benefit.<\/p><p> I am not suggesting for a moment that every stakeholder would benefit equally but they should benefit proportionally.  If we can do that, then our members will believe that our industry will be the richer for that and sustainability will automatically be achieved because it will continue to be a vibrant industry where we can hold our head up and say it is sustainable, and we see the benefit of section 481 and of taxpayers' money.

There is a problem here with legal compliance, which is then seriously disadvantaging - I could probably use stronger words - performers from getting the value of the work they have done.  One question I have in that regard is to ask the Irish Equity representatives to spell out the buy-out contract business and the pressure its members are put under to get work that means they have to, in many cases, in effect sign away their rights to their intellectual property, and the value of their performances as tied up in copyright and intellectual property.

I have worked in Los Angeles, other parts of America, London and all over England.  When I mention the type of contracts we sign here, there is an audible gasp from my acting colleagues in those countries.  They are genuinely concerned that the sort of buy-out contract that exists here is allowed to exist.  In the US, the industry is the success it is because there was a tough union that fought for the exploitation rights of its performers, and went on strike for those rights through the years, when those things were easier to do.  They went on strike and they fought for those rights.  It was the same in the UK.  Up to a point in Ireland, we were mimicking what was going in the UK because I also worked under that regime as regards film contracts.  People there are actually shocked.  I will reference one sentence in an agreement without identifying anyone because it appears across a tranche of contracts for actors.  It states that it is an agreement that is not subject to the jurisdiction of any guild, labour or collective bargaining unit agreement, and covers the engagement of the artist by the producer of the film for the compensation set forth with said compensation being inclusive of all buy-outs in all media now known or hereafter devised in all territories in perpetuity.<\/p> <p>  For an agreed figure, an actor will get a fee that is broken down into two sections.  One section is the performance fee, which is what the actor gets for turning up, creating the performance and doing the job at God knows what hour and in what location.  It is done, made and recorded.  There is then what is called a usage fee, which is made up of various percentages for the different platforms that exist.  It sounds complicated but it is not.  It involves taking 280% and adding that.  If an actor's performance fee is &euro;100, then another &euro;280 is added and that fee becomes &euro;380.  People think an actor is making that for a day's work but the trick is to divide it by 50 because that is the number of years actors own that property.  It is vested in the performer for 50 years.  It then begins to break down quite a lot.  That fee is for all the platforms.  If we then take every single DVD sale for a year, and everything right down, including all the downloads, all the sales to television, all the programmes on American and UK television and all the European television stations, etc., that contract has bought all those rights for &euro;380, or &euro;600, &euro;500 or &euro;700.  Once it is a buy-out, it does not matter what other calculations are put on it.  There is a ten year buy-out and a buy-out in perpetuity.  Once there is a buy-out, there is no variability allowed in what actors get for the exploitation of their work, and where no variability exists there can be no proportionality.  It used to be equitable remuneration but none of that can exist for actors.<\/p> <p>  I will leave the details vague, but I looked at a very large production that received quite a large amount of money from the taxpayer and broke it down in that way.  The performance fee broke down to &euro;394.73 for a week.  That was a 55-hour week, however, so it worked out at approximately &euro;7.17 per hour for those performers.  The usage fee was &euro;1,105 for a buy-out in perpetuity.  When we start to break it down over 50 years, etc., it ends up at 42 cent a week for everything globally, including all the DVD sales, all the television transmissions, all the streaming platforms and everything else.  It does not matter where it is sold; that is what the actor gets.  It is contained within that &euro;1,000 so it can never get better but can only get smaller.  A ruling was made a long time ago that I read on a lawyer's website - unfortunately, I read these things instead of scripts now - which stated that any contract that does not have a variable component to it cannot therefore allow equitable remuneration to take place.  That is the phrasing from the copyright Act.  There is a section that actually covers performance rights within the legislation.<\/p> <p>  What an actor is given is a document that says the actor agrees that is what is in this contract is proportionate and adequate.  An actor will sign that and sign away all his or her rights without fully understanding what they are and what value they have.<\/p><p>There is a whole generation of actors coming up in Ireland who have never seen a residual payment of a structured nature in their contract.  That is a loss to our community.  From that point of view, the Olsberg report is failing because it is not raising the standard of living within the cultural community.  This is the biggest investment by the State in our industry and in the lives of actors.<\/p><p> I know actors who say they will not work on a film because they cannot afford it.  It used to be that we would not do theatre work because we could not afford it and film was our saviour, but now we cannot afford it.  That is the situation we are in.  I hope that helps to explain it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022100500002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":545,"content":"<p>It does.

I understood from hearing what was said earlier that one contrast is that if someone is working on a film in Ireland just for a few days, they might then be laid off and they would have to go back on social welfare, and they might then come in for another few days and go back on social welfare again, whereas in the UK, people actually get paid throughout the period.  That seems like a big contrast and perhaps Mr. O'Brien can spell out that.<\/p> <p>  Second, what happens to an actor who says, &ldquo;I do not want to sign the buy-out contract&rdquo;?  When they do sign it, who ends up with the value of their intellectual property?  Who walks off with it?  The DAC ceases to exist after a year, so who actually goes off with all the money?  As well as the actors getting back some of the money they should be getting, should the State be getting back some of that money because of its investment through section 481?

The Deputy referred to signing on and signing off.  The UK film industry has what is called a guaranteed period of work, which is an actor's first core period of work.  If actors have a six-week job on a film, they may be booked from 1 January right through to the middle of February, where the first week is a full week and they get paid for that, and in the second week they might do three days and they get paid for that.  In the third week, they might just do one day.  It has been worked out that someone might not survive with what he or she is going to get for one day, so there is a negotiated supplemental payment that applies to the week where the person works only one day, because he or she is losing out on potential signing-on days.  There may also be a week where the person does not work, and there is a supplemental payment for that.<\/p> <p>  What the film company is doing is engaging and employing someone for the full length, from week one of the actor&rsquo;s first call until the last week of the first call.  It is divided into seven-day periods and, for example, the first seven-day period could start on Wednesday and finish on a Wednesday, and they work it that way.  With good scheduling, it works for the producer and if the scheduling is loose but they still need you for the film, it works for you.  What that does is it prevents the producer&rsquo;s scheduling needs being subsidised again by social welfare, and it also means the actor will be engaged and employed for a longer period.  The supplemental payments are not much more than, say, whatever the actor&rsquo;s negotiated minimum performance rate would be.  That is sometimes capped, so it is not a huge amount but is enough to be a bit more than the social welfare.  That means the actor will have six weeks of contributions rather than broken contributions of maybe one day a week, or whatever.  That benefits the State because the State is not subsidising the scheduling needs of the production or the television series and it is taking people away from that, so that is a good thing.  It benefits the performer later on because he or she will have those credits.<\/p> <p>  As to who owns the rights, that is the $64 million question.  When I sign my rights into the DAC, there is no written information for me as to where they go, and they could go anywhere because rights can be assigned anywhere.  It is just a line on a page that all rights are assigned to this company, and the company can assign it on and on.  It is generally an end-user who will get it.  In the case of the big streaming companies, they want all of the rights, even from the producers, so that is a difficult area.  We are both suffering there.  It is just that we are suffering a bit more when the producers are doing it to us.<\/p> <p>  As to what happens to the rights, they have a value, as I said, and whoever owns them, that is where the revenue stream will go.  It says in the copyright Act that the benefit of those rights goes to whoever they are assigned to, so how they are assigned is important.  Therefore, at the contract level, it has to be stated, &ldquo;If this much is made, a percentage is coming back here, and there will be so many transmissions on television&rdquo; and so on.  All of those are worked into the document that should be the basis of the film agreement or television agreement and the industry agreement.  As to what happens to the rights, as I said, I do not know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022100500002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I am sorry to cut across Mr. O'Brien.

It pointed out that the risks with section 481 include potential abuse of the tax credit through a range of practices, including internal pricing and artificially depressed income strategies.

It is very important to all our crews, animators and actors who get work.  That is the strength.  It also has a very significant soft diplomatic benefit to Ireland because foreign producers and actors like to come here.  It spreads the name of Ireland all around.  As I said in my opening statement, there is a reputational risk.  We have a great reputation for caring about our artists, writers etc.  However, when issues are mentioned about the engagement of artists and the protection of their rights, people abroad may say, \"Now we have a problem.\"  Our reputation is tarnished by not allowing our actors to be treated equally on the open market, as every other performer is.  That is one of the weaknesses.<\/p> <p>  The strength is that it provides employment.  We just need to make sure that it is, as the legislation states, quality employment, that it is sustainable and that it raises everybody's standard of living.  That is what we need to strengthen.  We do that by applying the legislation rigorously.  As stated in the EU directive, there must be no deviation from the protection for performers in office.  Those are the weaknesses.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what we need to do from a budgetary point of view.  We have suggested it.  The legislation is there and it needs to be applied.<\/p><p>I want to say this.  I am speaking as president of a union, Equity, but this does not only apply to members of the union.  It is not about that because it does not say that proportionate remuneration must go to members of Irish Equity.  This is about the rights of Irish citizens.  They are the people who are investing in the film industry and their return must be the quality employment.  They must ensure that we will not lose our talent by going abroad constantly.  We are told we have to look to Los Angeles and we have to look to London.  We can look to here.  We have a beating heart of creativity and we must protect that within this industry.  If one sucks it dry, there is no industry; there is just a shell.  We have to put that dignity of fair employment back into the heart of that industry.  That is what I would suggest.

It is attached to the film itself and to those revenue streams.  One has to make sure that even where producers would have such revenue streams, any copyright they have which is raised through the investment of section 481 must come back to this jurisdiction and has to be registered here.

Clearly, if a person is not able to survive within the industry in terms of earnings, in reality, it is not sustainable for him or her.  That is a real concern for me.<\/p> <p>  In relation to what we can do on the budgetary front, greater scrutiny of compliance with the criteria of section 481 would help considerably to ensure a more level playing field in the first instance.  It would also reduce the risk of reputational damage.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the taxpayer, if the directive on copyright and buy-out was being used as the exception rather than the rule, as, we believe, was intended by the directive, that would also maximise investment for the taxpayer because it would bring somewhere in the region of 500 to 1,000 people into the tax net who are not currently within it because they do not have earnings to justify their inclusion.  It would also reduce or remove the need for reliance on additional social welfare payments for people within the industry.

Ms Quinn backed him up in the sense that if one does not sign, one does not get working.  That is hardly fair.  Obviously, legislation seems to be the only means of dealing with a proper protection from the point of view that the directive is not sufficiently strong to cut the mustard.<\/p> <p>  If we could deal with section 481, something Mr. O'Brien said that we dealt with to an extent previously is the possibility of, for the want of a better term, fraud and the need to curtail this.  Mr. O'Brien might give a general outline in that regard.  Also, a good point made was that we are talking about securing the taxpayers' investment where people understand that to provide a return.  It is not only a working sustainable industry and we are talking about intellectual property and a net result in some cases which will have a valuable stream of revenue.  It would make sense, if the State invested, that it also got moneys back.  These could be moneys that are used to make the overall industry more sustainable and to ensure we have an adequate supply of actors and crew who are looked after properly.

I am not saying anybody is doing anything criminal, illegal or anything like that, but there is a stretch on how one costs things, how one values them and how they give a return.  There is a phrase in the accounting world where there is accountancy and then there is Hollywood accounting.  The joke goes - I forget which writer said it - that the most creative aspect of the film industry is, in fact, the accounting.  One has to be very careful in anything that one supports with other people's money.  I believe I am speaking not only on behalf of actors but on behalf of the taxpayers because, as I said, it is their investment.  It does not belong to the producers or to the actors; it belongs to us, the taxpayers.  We have to be satisfied that all legislation is spot on and everything is valued correctly.  If one has a multiplicity of DAC companies springing up and then ending, one does not know where any of those assets are going and that is where one gets the possible suppression of value.<\/p> <p>  The big suppression of value is in the value of the performers and that has gone on for 30 years.  For example, I worked on an American contract in 2006 and I am still adding $3,000 a year to my tax return here in Ireland because the revenue comes in to this jurisdiction to me.  The Olsberg report does not state we want to measure fiscal improvements.  It wants to look at the net benefit.  If one has actors earning those residual payments and they are protected, they are taxed here in this jurisdiction.  If you protect all creators of copyright, and copyright goes across everybody, not only performers but also our writers, the screenwriters should be getting this.  The cinematographers, producers and directors all have an intellectual investment in the industry.  We also have to make sure of it for our own cultural sector, the Irish film industry itself, not the service industry to the big global streaming networks and the big US studios.  It is a great benefit to them and that is a great boon to us.  We have to make sure that we get our share of the global revenue streams of that.  That is how it works.<\/p><p>It means there is a raising of standards of living and the actor is not constantly dependent on handouts.  I mentioned the excellent basic income scheme.  There is more dignity to an actor getting a cheque through the door as validation for his work than having to depend on something given to him because he is so poor.  It gives dignity back to the actor and that is lacking at the moment.  There is a huge lack of dignity at the core of this industry.

The Irish contribution to the conference over the course of its year-long proceedings was significant and influential and I would like to thank this committee for all of its work, the Oireachtas Members who took part in the conference plenary sessions, including Deputies Richmond and &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, and the members of the public, civil society and political parties in Ireland who engaged.  <br\/><br\/>The final conference report sets out 49 proposals for consideration based on over 320 interesting and innovative measures and recommendations debated during the conference and spanning virtually the entire spectrum of EU activity.  EU leaders briefly discussed the results of the conference at the June European Council, noting the proposals and recommendations and requesting each institution to follow up in accordance with its own competences.  Since the final report was published, both the European Council and the Commission have published assessments on the proposals and have expressed the view that the vast majority of the proposals can be implemented, if agreed, through existing policies without the need to reopen the European treaties. <br\/><br\/>Arising from its assessment, the European Commission intends to implement some of the recommendations within the framework of the Commission work programme for 2023 and President von der Leyen outlined the Commission&rsquo;s intentions in her State of the Union address to the European Parliament last month.  A number of Commission proposals for the year ahead stem directly from conference recommendations including, for example, a new initiative on mental health, revision of animal welfare legislation, a legislative proposal for a European disability card and a raw materials Act, among others.  President von der Leyen also outlined Commission plans to make greater use of citizens&rsquo; panels in the legislative process, primarily as a sounding board for future proposals. <br\/><br\/>The European Parliament, for its part, also adopted a resolution last June calling for the convening of a convention in order to follow up on conference recommendations and proposing a number of treaty amendments, primarily in relation to providing for greater use of qualified majority voting, QMV, in decision making.  On the basis of advice provided by the Council's legal services, a further resolution will require to be adopted by the European Parliament formally setting out any precise amendments being proposed to the treaties and which have been formally adopted and approved by the Parliament&rsquo;s constitutional affairs committee. <br\/><br\/>The Council, for its own part, has now begun its assessment of the conference proposals and recommendations, with an initial discussion at the informal General Affairs Council in Prague in July and again at last month&rsquo;s General Affairs Council in Brussels.  For the moment, most Council members concur with our analysis that the EU&rsquo;s immediate focus should centre on progressing those proposals, constituting approximately 95% of the conference recommendations, which can be realised within the parameters of the existing treaty framework.  Discussion has also begun within the Council on some of the more difficult recommendations arising from the conference process, including in the area of voting and decision-making, while the Czech Presidency has also been canvassing views on whether there is support within the Council for the convening of a convention to initiate a process of treaty change. <br\/><br\/>Addressing this latter issue first, committee members will be aware that President von der Leyen, in her State of the Union address, lent the Commission&rsquo;s support to the calls for a convention.  Nationally, the Taoiseach, when addressing the European Parliament in June, said that the Government remains open to the possibility of treaty change if this proves necessary but for the moment believes, like most others in the Council, that the initial emphasis should be on implementing the vast majority of conference recommendations which can be done so within the existing treaty framework. <br\/><br\/>On the call for greater use of QMV, this is an issue which already commanded much attention during conference proceedings as it is clearly highly relevant in terms of any consideration of how to improve both the effectiveness of EU decision making and its standing as an international actor.  Some member states have already indicated that they are open to the possibility of making greater use of QMV, particularly in relation to areas such as Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP.  From discussions to date within the Council, the majority of member states, and particularly smaller member states, would be more cautious about any proposal to make greater use of QMV. <br\/><br\/>Nationally, a cross-government exercise overseen by the Department of Foreign Affairs is now under way in which Departments are submitting their views on the numerous conference proposals and recommendations relevant to their area.  While our overall position on this issue still remains to be formalised, it is fair to say that there would be some considerable hesitancy about any greater use of QMV, particularly in areas such as the CFSP or in relation to taxation issues.  The possibility for greater use of QMV is one which already exists within the treaties in the form of a quite extensive series of <i>passerelle<\/i>or bridge clauses already provided for.  It is likely that much of the focus in Council discussions in the coming months will centre on these <i>passerelle<\/i>clauses and whether there might be a willingness to make greater use of these provisions, which could be done within the existing treaty framework. <br\/><br\/>Turning to the work of the General Affairs Council, in which I know Members take an interest, I represented Ireland at its last meeting on 20 September in Brussels.  Our main item of discussion was preparation for the European Council meeting on 20 and 21 October where the focus will be very much on the immediate challenges of Ukraine, energy and the overall economic situation.  We also received updates from the Czech Presidency on its priorities for its presidency and from Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efovi on the current state of EU-UK relations, which I will be happy to address separately at this meeting.  We also discussed the 2022 strategic foresight report and the Commission&rsquo;s letter of intent which will help in the preparation of the 2023 Commission work programme.  Finally, the Council held its annual and important horizontal discussion on rule of law focusing on judicial independence and media pluralism.  <br\/><br\/>T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta, m&aacute;s mian leis na comhalta&iacute;, ceisteanna a th&oacute;g&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#B00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":586,"content":"<p>Thank you for that.

I am sure he will join me in expressing sympathy to the family of Mr. Rory Mason from Dunboyne who was tragically killed while fighting for Ukraine last month.  I listened to the tribute paid by his father this morning.  He said that Rory had a deep sense of right and wrong and an inability to turn the other way.  He was obviously a very admirable young man.  We should pay tribute to him and extend our sincere sympathy to his family.<\/p> <p>  On the Conference on the Future of Europe, the Minister has moved the debate on as regards the convention on treaty change with his comments this morning.  There are calls to look at switching from unanimity to QMV, strengthening EU competencies in health and energy, incorporating the pillar of social rights into the treaties and providing the European Parliament with a right of legislative initiative.  I also note the Minister of State's comments that the General Affairs Council considered that 95% of the conference proposals can be implemented without treaty change.  What the Minister of State has outlined here is a cautious approach to treaty change.  While Ireland is certainly open to such change, it needs to be proven that it is necessary.  We need to consider it carefully because it may require a referendum if there is to be treaty change.  I recall listening to a discussion recently at a European Movement Ireland event, where the Taoiseach gave an address to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Ireland's referendum on accession to the European Union.  He was asked a question about treaty change and he said that if member states are objecting, they are doing so for very valid national reasons on many occasions.  He said it would be far preferable to get a consensus on these issues and generally speaking, consensus can be arrived at.  The way the European Union does its business is a bit cumbersome and it is not pretty but eventually, consensus is arrived at.  I agree with the Minister of State's comments here this morning.  Am I right in saying that the Irish would be open to treaty change but quite cautious and that it is not an immediate priority?  <\/p> <p>  Citizens' panels were another issue that arose from the Conference on the Future of Europe.  What is Ireland's position on citizens' panels?  Are we open to that concept of participatory democracy and so on?  Is that something we will be pushing at EU level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#C00300","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I join Deputy Haughey in expressing my deepest sympathy to the parents and siblings of Rory Mason from Dunboyne.<\/p><p>He was a constituent of mine.  I read what his dad said - it was lovely.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is providing consular assistance.  The family has asked for privacy, so I had better leave it at that.  They are going through a difficult period and they have my deepest sympathies.  May he rest in peace.<br\/><br\/>Regarding treaty change, the Deputy has essentially set out our position, but I do not sense much appetite for it around the table at European meetings.  It is not on colleagues' immediate agenda overall.  The Taoiseach has stated that he is open to it, particularly in terms of a health competence, but everyone who is open to it has a different reason.  Most would probably agree with expanding health competence provided it was suitable, but others have different priorities.  There is much more discussion of the <i>passerelle<\/i>clauses in the treaties, so I urge the committee to examine those.  We are examining them and I believe it is on them that there will be discussion.  People feel that treaty change would require a great deal of work.  For example, we would not be the only country that would need to hold a referendum.  Most people are framing the difficulties and administrative issues in reaching consensus at the European table in terms of enlargement.  They are not saying that it is something that needs to be done urgently to stop a current problem.<br\/><br\/>To those who find this position difficult or believe that we should be getting rid of vetoes or using more qualified majority voting, unanimity is important.  It protects national interests, but it also protects European interests.  When dealing with important issues that we need consensus on, the EU can speak with a greater voice when all of its members come together.  Look at what we have already achieved with unanimity.  We achieved a massive recovery fund post Brexit and we have had to work via consensus on the issue of vaccines.  We have achieved a significant amount.  Take the sanctions package as an example.  A point I make repeatedly is that it is always difficult to negotiate a sanctions package.  Through unanimity, though, we have achieved a great deal in that regard.  Ireland has always been at the forefront of trying to get the maximum possible sanctions.  There was speculation last week about the EU being divided and breaking up because of the package of sanctions on Russia.  As we have seen from yesterday and today, the negotiations are still ongoing, but it certainly looks like ambassadors will be able to agree another package of sanctions on Russia unanimously.<br\/><br\/>Unanimity has achieved a great deal for us and we should not dismiss it.  We protect our national interests.  It is not just Ireland that has specific national interests.  Every member state of the EU has particular interests that are important to it - quirks in terms of its membership or something that other people do not understand or do not face as issues themselves.  We must ensure that the democratic legitimacy of the EU is to the fore.  We have done that successfully so far.<br\/><br\/>Citizens' panels can be a good idea.  It is fair to say that other member states view the Irish citizens' assembly as the way to go.  The two main reasons for this are that our assemblies are usually on specific topics and they are informed by experts.  A general citizens' panel would be a waste, but if we had panels on specific topics that we might otherwise struggle for consensus on, they would work well.  They would have to be informed by experts.  We are open to the idea of panels.  The Irish example is one that the other member states want to follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#C00400","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":590,"content":"<p>Next is Deputy Richmond, followed by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#D00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":591,"content":"<p>The conference was a good exercise in democracy.  The Minister of State was very engaged, and not just from an Irish point of view.  He attended many of the meetings.  We shared flights and the odd coffee during the process.<\/p> <p>  I am taken by how 95% of the recommendations can already be implemented without even considering treaty change.  Something that struck me was that, be it through the work of the working groups or committees within the conference or through plenary, so many of the issues that were cited were ones that the EU was already working on more broadly.  This pointed out the communications deficit and was nothing new.  As I have said a million times, the EU has been great for quite some time in paying people who give out about it, such as Mr. Nigel Farage, but perhaps not so great in focusing on what it is doing and how people can engage with the process.  I was taken by the citizens' panels and the number of people who travelled to various parts of the EU, including Strasbourg.  People gave up their weekends to go to Strasbourg for four days and engage with the panels.  They deserve a great deal of respect because their contributions were valid.<\/p> <p>  Despite the difficulties that Covid presented, the exercise that was the Conference on the Future of Europe was the real lesson.  How can we have more of these conferences and how do we use this exercise to feed into the European decision-making process?  We are unique.  We are right on the westerly edge of the EU and, generally, our MEPs come home every week.  Our Commissioner has been home a great deal in recent months, as have other Irish figures at European level.  There has been engagement by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  That is not necessarily the case in member states with list systems where MEPs only return to their homes for green weeks.  How do we communicate that these exercises are happening?  Perhaps the lesson is that these exercises are not happening quickly enough or that people are not feeling their impact.<\/p> <p>  This brings me to the debate on treaty change and, more specifically, QMV.  The Minister of State mentioned that we would not be the only member state that would require a referendum if there was treaty change.  Is there any other member state that has an automatic requirement?  The Danes have usually reached back to that.  QMV is discussed at the level of high politics.  It is the major topic of debate in the institutional discussion, particularly at Council level, but are we explaining to people how this issue makes a difference to their lives?  My take-away from the conference is that many issues that are important at European level get taken away into the world of acronyms and so on and information about how they make people's lives better and why it is important that we are part of the EU get lost on the journey.  We might discuss whether we need to consider QMV or how important QMV would be in agreeing sanctions, but is it the greatest issue for European citizens?<\/p> <p>  I will conclude with a question on the European Council, as the Minister of State and I could speak for hours on the Conference on the Future of Europe if we were given latitude to do so.  That would even be before we involved Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; - that would be another ten hours.  Given what was put together for Brexit and Covid, what preliminary discussions have there been on European-level financial packages to support member states, including Ireland but most likely those in the east of the EU, in dealing with the challenges that the looming winter will bring due to the impact of Russia's war in Ukraine?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#D00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":592,"content":"<p>Regarding the conference, the Commission and the Council have published a list of conclusions and how they can be implemented.  I assume that their documents are publicly available.  They go issue by issue and set out how the recommendations can be implemented.<\/p> <p>  For some people, it is always someone else's responsibility, but it is all of our responsibility to highlight the good things that the EU does.  There are certain things that can immediately be attached to the EU, for example, vaccines.  We need to do more of that with climate change.  I know some young people who have the Interrail card.  Aside from everything else that the EU does, that card is good and tangible.  If we do not speak about democracy and the benefits of that democracy, including the democracy that is the EU, then we will allow other people to say otherwise.<\/p> <p>  The Commission is examining this matter.  It had been handling some of the issues that were raised, so it was astonished that people did not know that.  That has been a major lesson for the Commission.  It will have to get better at communicating some of what it is doing.  That requires an educated citizenry.  Thank God, we have that here in Ireland.  More and more kids are learning about European issues in school.<\/p><p>We have our Blue Star programme in schools.  We also have civic, social and political education, CSPE, as part of the general curriculum for children.  That is also important and we all have a responsibility in this area.  <\/p><p> On qualified majority voting, it is hard to tell people what the real difference would be in their lives if this were to come about.  We spent a lot of time dealing with this and my impression is that most countries do not wish to spend a lot of time dealing with it and navel-gazing.  As I said, we have achieved many practical outcomes through consensus in recent years.  Where concerns have been expressed to me, they have been in the context of enlargement.  We are keen on enlargement.  Other countries have expressed a concern that perhaps decision-making could become unwieldy.  Again, we have a great deal of work to do on enlargement and our objective as a Government is to get these countries into the Union when they are ready and to help them to get ready to do so.  We can consider having an institutional debate during that process, but that is not our number one priority.<\/p><p> There is a lot going on in energy.  It is important to remember what has happened already.  With all these rows, such as why we are not bringing in a windfall tax, etc., which was going on for weeks, we brought in that windfall tax last Friday and hardly a word was said about it.  It is worth recalling what the Government did at EU level in conjunction with other European governments last Friday.  Where large financial gains have been made by energy companies on what are called inframarginal rents, which are, essentially, non-gas electricity supplies, there will be a solidarity contribution on those profits.  A solidarity levy will be placed on the fossil fuel sector as well.  Work will also be done in the area of electricity demand reduction.  People laugh when it is said that we need to reduce demand, but this is just a fact.  We need to do this and there are ways of doing it, especially at peak times.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities will be working on this also to help us get through this winter.  We achieved a significant amount last Friday in introducing a windfall tax.  Shell has now asked the British Government to do something similar.  The European Union has done this and we have done it together.<\/p><p> It is worth recalling when we have done these very positive things as governments working together.  In this case, it just involved the governments working together under this particular provision of the treaty and not the European Parliament, but generally the Parliament would also be involved.  This is a good development.  It is like everything else in that when there is a problem, we never hear the end of it, and then little is said when there is a solution.  Perhaps it is only us who do not talk enough about these kinds of developments.  This is not the entire solution but it is certainly a large part of it.<\/p><p> The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has estimated that between &euro;1 billion and &euro;2 billion will accrue to the Government.  This will be redirected into ensuring that we are energy secure and that energy is affordable in the coming months.  A great deal of other work is also ongoing.  I can talk about that as well if the committee wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#D00400","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I add my voice in expressing sympathy to the family of Rory Mason.  Everyone was very taken with his father's tribute this morning.  In fairness, he involved himself in a fight that was not his and he paid the ultimate price.<\/p> <p>  We discussed some of these points in the context of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  That was definitely a process that improved as it went.  It started with many flaws.  As with politics in general, some people are still on the periphery and well removed from politics at a European level.  Work needs to be done on this.  As I said, that is the case across the board.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, the Minister of State has answered some of the questions I was going to ask.  Regarding citizens' involvement, there was probably a need for a greater level of conversation on what Europe as a whole and the individual institutions were doing and to get into the ins and outs of issues.  The issue of qualified majority voting versus unanimity seemed to come up in the sense that people saw everything very simply as Hungary being the problem and that we could not have it holding things up.  Even where there is not a Union-level competence, such as in health, it was still able to organise the buying of vaccines as a bloc.  That showed that the opt-in system has been working.  The Minister of State said several times that the problem with democracy is that it can take a long time to come up with deals but that is the reality.  We have all seen the alternative, and it is not a place we want to go.  This needs to be considered.  It is understandable that the focus of citizens has sometimes gone in this direction, based on almost every issue being dealt with as if it were a silo.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the issue of energy security, the Minister of State is obviously involved in conversations at a higher level than any of us.  I accept what he said regarding the EU having begun actions in this regard, including the solidarity tax, etc., but it is necessary to go further.  Where does the Minister of State believe these endeavours can go in respect of dealing with the entire energy market?  I accept there are difficulties in bringing about change and there can be unintended consequences.  We have all seen the idea put into action where Europe can act as a collective in buying as a bloc.  Everyone sees the sense in doing that.  On another aspect now in the public domain in the context of security issues, I refer to our protection of critical infrastructure and the conversations under way in this regard in Europe.  We are in the age of hybrid warfare.  The concept of security and what that looks like has changed.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to hear the Minister of State's view concerning the age-old question of our relationship with our nearest neighbour.  The British Government now has its own economic issues.  The language it is using has improved regarding possible deals and perhaps we will be able to get movement on the protocol.  The protocol Bill is still in play, however, and we need to deal with that issue in and of itself.  A conversation needs to be had with unionism from the perspective of the protocol being the only show in town and of streamlining what needs to be done in this regard.  Succour must not be provided, though, to those at the extreme end who may be looking for something that is not a possibility.  Will we get a decent level of movement not only on the protocol but also on the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 and the amnesty legislation?  I think that is enough questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#E00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I have said a good deal on the Conference on the Future of Europe.  People do talk about Hungary, but we have achieved a lot with which Hungary has agreed.  It vetoed the taxation proposal that came up at OECD level, for example, but the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has said he is confident we will be able to resolve that issue.  Even with unanimity being a requirement, we can achieve a great deal.  We speak more strongly to the world when we speak together.  In some cases, the idea of having a vote and that there would even be a qualified majority in favour and a minority against a proposal could weaken our position.  We are not rushing out the door on QMV for that reason, and I do not think we ever have, especially on foreign policy matters.  Even though Ireland is very much in the mainstream of European foreign policy, it has never occurred to us to use our veto on any proposal put before the European Council or Foreign Affairs Council on foreign policy matters.  We are in the mainstream and our foreign policy is based on democracy, respect for human rights and on the principles of the UN Charter.  These are pretty normal foreign policy principles for democratic countries.  This is the way the EU works.  Nothing at the EU level has ever threatened our foreign policy.  In fact, it has only added to it.  Equally, I think we have added to foreign policy at EU level as well.

Our interconnection with Britain and then on to Norway is very important and the proposed interconnector to France, which is effectively under way, is also very important.  What is also important is that we continue with our renewable energy ambitions so we can become more energy self-sufficient and possibly become an energy exporter.<\/p><p> In terms of what might be happening at European level on block purchasing, we would be very happy to leave that to the Commission and it is best if it is done from that level.  Different letters were circulated last week among member states on this issue but it is much more complicated than signing letters.  We have to make sure we have security of supply.  As I said, there is Ireland, Britain and Norway and the issue of ending dependence on Russia.  We have to make sure we can keep that energy coming.  Ireland is not part of the main European grid and that further complicates matters for us.  We are keeping an eye on this and we are very happy for the Commission to take the lead on this, which it has done very successfully in other contexts.  However, even the Commission would say that the issue is extremely complex, although it is working very hard on it.<\/p><p> On the protection of critical infrastructure, I would have to defer to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Department of Defence on that.  I am not sure I can really add to that.  However, in terms of our neutrality, I would say there is no pressure from anybody at the European table in terms of our non-membership of military alliances.  Again, this is who we are, and every country has something that shows who they are.  People can have different views and I have no problem with that but, as a nation, this is not something we are proposing to change.  The Taoiseach has spoken about a possible citizens&rsquo; assembly to discuss it but we do not have detailed proposals on that or any Government decision.  It is certainly not something one would find at European level, particularly among the member states, in terms of asking why we are not a member of NATO.  Nobody has ever said that.<\/p><p> As to our nearest neighbour, the mood music is excellent at the moment.  We have had really good engagement between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Liz Truss, and it was noted that we were the only country where both the Head of State and the Prime Minister were invited to the funeral.  The Irish people and the Irish State showed incredible deference at the time of the funeral of Her Majesty and I think that really helped.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has had very good engagement with both the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Cleverly, and the Secretary of State, Mr. Heaton-Harris.  By the way, we all know our counterparts very well from before, which is very useful.  I will be speaking to my counterpart, who is the Minister, Mr. Leo Docherty, tomorrow, and we are all in regular touch with Vice-President &Scaron;efovi.  The mood music is really good.  We appreciate what Steve Baker said at the weekend and he seemed to appreciate what I said on BBC the day before yesterday, judging by his comments.<\/p><p> That is very good but the challenge now is to move the discussions on at a technical level.  The political atmosphere is very good but the technical people, the officials who look at all of these highly detailed issues about customs, checks, state aid and VAT, have to be given a mandate by the politicians to move the thing on.  That is where things fell down before in that there had at times been a very good atmosphere between the politicians, but then we find that when the officials get to talk, not very much happens.  Nonetheless, there are things happening and there are technical talks starting this week.  The Commission and the British authorities have been in regular discussion this week about scheduling them.  We think the focus needs to be to ensure that those officials are empowered to have real discussions that can bring the outcome that people and businesses in Northern Ireland will overwhelmingly support, that is, what we see as a jointly agreed outcome that provides the certainty they need to maximise the opportunities offered by the protocol.  I am a confident that we can come to an arrangement that will satisfy everybody but we need to come to that arrangement as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#E00300","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":597,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  First, I want to associate myself with the remarks made by other members in regard to the sad death of Rory Mason.<\/p><p>I will be covering some ground that has already been touched upon.  I want to ask three questions of the Minister.  First, there has been a lot of focus and debate on QMV.  I would be interested in coming at it from a different angle by asking the Minister of State, from his own experience in Council, whether an issue ever arose where something that was really desirable was not attainable because of a veto.  The way we work in Ireland, with multi-party Governments being the norm nowadays, is that technically there is a vote at Cabinet but, in my experience, there is never a vote at Cabinet because, by necessity, you have to bring everybody with you.  I think that is the way the European Council works as well.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's take on that because the one thing we do not want is, by some majoritarianism, to leave somebody feeling wounded or excluded.  For that reason, I would be supportive of the <i>status quo<\/i>.<\/p><p>My second question is in regard to the positive actions that the European Union takes.  The Minister of State is right that there is often a focus on the things that are not being done, and the very positive things that are being done are not always focused upon.  For example, the acquisition of vaccines during the Covid crisis was a successful undertaking, as well as the support by means of the provision of PPE and other equipment.  In the energy crisis we are facing, there are two elements for Ireland.  One is obviously the cost element to be borne by our citizens and by industry, and the Government has done a good lot to address that insofar as it can.  I would be interested in the other side of it, from a European perspective, and that is Ireland's sustainability in acquiring energy.  As I indicated, I understand that the Commission, certainly the Commission President, is anxious for a common purchasing arrangement so there is not the perverse and disruptive bidding between member states for energy, particularly after the winter, given that storage for this winter is reasonably adequate.  What happens next year to ensure we do not have individual member states bidding up the price and literally freezing other member states out of energy?  Where are we in terms of that common approach?<\/p><p>From an Irish perspective, the Minister of State rightly said that we are on the periphery.  We have about a quarter of our gas from the Corrib field and three quarters comes through Britain.  Ofgem said yesterday that there may be a critical balance this winter in gas supplies in Britain.  How does that impact on us since they supply us?  Have we had reassurances in regard to our supply if their own supply becomes critical?  It has been very clearly indicated by EirGrid and others that our energy supply this winter is on a knife edge.<\/p><p>My related question concerns the push to renewables.  The Minister of State referenced the notion that we need to be a net exporter of energy.  Obviously, the big investment and the enormous focus in the immediate horizon, that is, in the next 15 to 20 years, will be on offshore wind, but there really is very slow progress in Ireland in regard to getting that off the ground, if the Minister of State will pardon the phrase.  We have not designated a port to service it yet and the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, will not be taking applications until at least March of next year.  There just does not seem to be the urgency about it that would be in sync with the Minister of State's determination that we will be energy self-sufficient within a reasonable horizon.<\/p><p> My last question is about the coverage of Europe and European affairs.  We complain in this House that there is diminution of the coverage of the business of this House.  Certainly the detailed work of committees of the House is not covered very much.  There is talk of a second Chamber, which would dissipate coverage even more.  There is a perversity.  The more product, productivity and effort, the less coverage of it that is communicated.  I know from talking to Irish colleagues in the European Parliament that there is significant concern that there is virtually no coverage of the activities of the European Parliament, although it may generate 70% of what ultimately is Irish law.  A big part of advancing the principles of democracy and so on is to ensure they are communicated effectively because, quite frankly, they are not at the moment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#F00200","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":599,"content":"<p>On the question about something really desirable that was not achieved because of a veto, it does sometimes happen that at the Foreign Affairs Council, there might be a statement on human rights violations in particular countries that is vetoed by one country.  What happens is that they do not hold a vote; they merely withdraw the proposal.  It just does not happen because one country has said \"No\".  That is its right.  With the vast majority of items that go through the Council of Ministers routinely, there would not necessarily be anything other than unanimity even with a range of ordinary directives and regulations.  What can happen during the negotiations is there might be a bloc or minority that might try to work for its particular agenda.  It might not stop it but it might try to change a law.  That can happen based on the numbers and we have seen it happen on a number of occasions.  At every Council meeting, they put the next item of legislation that needs to be passed on the agenda.  They have gone through all the discussions at departmental and Council level and the committee of permanent representatives to the EU, COREPER.  There is a technical vote at our Council.  They are all unanimous.  They would not necessarily require that.  It may be that countries that may have been opposed to them have got some changes to them.  Again, it is a process of negotiation.  It does happen at the Foreign Affairs Council.  In my experience over the past couple of years, the European Council has always tried to get a result and to bring people together.  If you look at the conditionality regulation, that was effectively on rule of law.  That was essentially decided at the European Council.  That required unanimity.  The deal done there was that we will hold off on implementation until Hungary and Poland take a challenge to the European Court of Justice so that was a bit of compromise.  They took the challenge.  We supported the Council and the decision against Hungary and Poland in that case.  The court ruled against them and now that is in place.  Again, unanimity achieved a lot in there even though it was messy and complex and did not satisfy everybody at the time.  It has definitely achieved a lot in my opinion.<\/p> <p>  Regarding some of the energy questions, I have to say that they would really be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  They are all European issues.  Some agreements between the EU and various entities such as Azerbaijan have been reached.  There is also an agreement with Israel.  Not all of them are to provide immediate relief.  The Commission is working on the overall package and we would be quite happy for it to do that once it takes everybody's circumstances into account.  It is something that needs the Commission to lead on.  Ultimately, that will be to our benefit.  <\/p> <p>  Having much more offshore wind is certainly our ambition and is very much part of our European obligations.  Listening to what Deputy Howlin said about the delays, I will make the point that when this Government came into office, there was no planning structure there.  The Maritime Area Planning Act was passed.  It was incredibly complex legislation.  It is now through and the other stuff is following on from that.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding coverage of politics, sometimes we have to make our own coverage but it is important that we have as many outlets as possible.  I know part of the Government is providing support to make sure outlets can provide the type of public service coverage they are required to, including through the licence fee, which has been there for decades.  That then imposes an obligation to the broadcaster that receives that, RT&Eacute;, and the general terms of licensing of broadcasting in this country require broadcast outlets to provide news coverage.  Some do it well, which I welcome.  I accept what the Deputy says but ironically, there are now more avenues to see what we are doing.  Anyone around the country can tune into this today.  They could not do that 20 years ago so there are more avenues.  Again, we all have to take responsibility but if we do not have information and knowledge out there about what is happening in the democracy, the democracy will die and we see that starting to happen in America in terms of local and state coverage.  It is very worrying and we definitely cannot allow that to happen here.  One of the important objectives of the European Commission and the European Union and one thing we discuss regularly at the Council is media freedom and plurality.  Making sure that is there is one of the things we are very concerned about because it is part of democracy and something we keep a very close eye on in all member states, particularly where it has been identified as an issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#G00200","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late for the Minister of State's presentation this morning.  Following on from Deputy Howlin's comments on how we engage better with communities and the public, I put down a question to the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, about a European affairs officer in each local authority and setting up a strategic policy committee, SPC, at local authority level so that people on the ground would be more in touch with what is actually happening at European level.  That does not seem to be his Department.  What sort of budget does the Minister of State get in the Department of Foreign Affairs for something like that?  Does he get anything?  What is the budget for European affairs in the Department of Foreign Affairs?  Is this something the Department could look into?<\/p> <p>  How should European governing bodies deal with a Eurosceptic leader in another EU country?  I know that before the Italian general election, Ursula von der Leyen made a comment that they had tools to deal with Italy if it went in a difficult direction.  What is the Minister of State's opinion on that top-down approach?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#G00300","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":601,"content":"<p>On a European affairs officer, I believe it should be a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and individual local authorities.  Some local authorities already have a European affairs officer and I think such a post would be very useful because there are funding opportunities available through various sources.  One of the things we are very keen is that at every level in this State, we would obtain as much European funding as we can.  Universities and third-level institutes are very good at getting research funding so it is undoubtedly the case that local authorities should have more expertise and some of them have while others are really pushing the European links.  Limerick is one example.  There are European-orientated funding programmes such as the PEACEPLUS programme, which is partly funded by the EU but also by ourselves and the UK Government.  Border counties can benefit from that.  I am certainly more than happy to work to ensure we can spread this out around the country.<\/p> <p>  We had a very small budget for publicising or promoting the EU.  We received a substantial increase for next year in the budget.  I will get Senator Keogan the exact figure in due course but it has been substantially increased.  This was very important for us in terms of the EU50 programme.  I even saw one Deputy criticising advertisements - I do not know who was putting up the advertisements as I do not think it was us - because they were talking about Europe, so we will do that and be criticised for it.  I launched an advertising campaign recently at relatively low cost to promote the idea of Irish people working in European institutions because over the next three years, we are going to have a 35% reduction in the number of Irish people working in European institutions.<\/p><p>Therefore, I encourage the committee to join us in encouraging our excellent young graduates to work in the European institutions.  That is another facet of our promotion.  <\/p><p> On dealing with elected people and President von der Leyen&rsquo;s comments about the Italian election, quite frankly, the European Commission has tools to deal with all of us if we fall below basic principles of rule of law and democracy.  At the Council meeting that I attend, we regularly have discussions on what is called the Commission&rsquo;s annual rule of law report - in fact, we had one only last month.  We take turns answering questions from colleagues about the rule of law in our country.  In the past, I have answered questions about some issues, particularly around judicial appointments, for example, and what we are doing with the judicial appointments Bill and reforms to the Defamation Act etc.  Colleagues will ask questions about that and I ask questions of other colleagues.  We sort of hold one another to account as to what we are all doing.  It is not about particular countries, rather, it is about what we are all doing.  Though it is, in some cases, about particular countries because there are certainly concerns and procedures in place in relation particularly to the system of judicial appointments in Poland and basic issues of democracy in Hungary as well.  There are Article 7 proceedings, as they are known, that have been going on for some time.  They would require many member states to support them to move them on and they have not moved on.  We generally just take stock of where things are.  We try to discuss these issues publicly and directly with our colleagues.  I had a meeting with my Hungarian colleague on the margins of the last Council meeting in Brussels, where I expressed concerns, but also said that we want Hungary to get European funding once it complies with the conditions attached to it.  <\/p><p> Regarding the Italian elections, that is a matter for the Italian people.  They will have a prime minister and I am certainly not going to prejudge what she does.  It is ultimately the coalition.  It is always important to remember that in Italy, they generally have coalitions and never one party that dominates everything.  They are elected by the people and we will deal with them.  If there are any issues with regard to rule of law in any member state, the Commission certainly has the tools to deal with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#G00400","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I again offer my words of sympathy to the family of Rory Mason.  We were all very taken with the sentiments that his dad expressed in the tribute we heard earlier today.<\/p> <p>  As I said, the world has changed considerably over the last period and we are all having very different conversations and worries that we would have a number of years ago.  I refer to interaction with other European countries and their views at this point in time.  I know that every second commentator believes they are a serious military strategist at this stage, but it does not look like it is going particularly well for Vladimir Putin in the field.  That is why we have to get that energy piece correct, because it is one of the things that he has in the sense of the possibility of economic carnage throughout the western world and particularly Europe.  However, obviously, there are fears related to some of the threats that have been made, for example, even relating to the annexation of those areas that, from Putin&rsquo;s point of view, he can determine as being part of Russian territory.  In addition, there is that wider threat of tactical nuclear weapons being put in the field.  Some commentators said that could be a considerable number of steps away, even if he was to consider it, however, there might be the possibility of testing nuclear of weapons or something from a point of view of upping the game.  This is all very frightening and I accept that there are limits to what the Minister of State can comment on.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the rule of law question.  I ask about those particular interactions and where the conversation is between the European Commission and Hungary.  Where are relationships at the minute, particularly with Poland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#H00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":604,"content":"<p>On Russia, I will not give a running commentary on military matters; that is not within my expertise.  On this so-called annexation of Ukrainian territory, we categorically condemn what Putin announced - that Russia could in any way annex part of the territory of Ukraine.  This has no basis whatsoever in law and it does not actually even reflect what the people of those regions want for themselves.  The sham referendums that were conducted in occupied Ukrainian territory by Russia and its proxies were illegal and illegitimate.  They were not even referendums at all, if one looks at what happened on the ground.  It is a further ploy to undermine Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity and to try to justify Russia&rsquo;s totally unjustified and illegal war.  It was an escalation.  Ireland will never recognise the claims over the regions.  We remain steadfast in our support of the people of Ukraine.  Why are we fully in support of Ukraine?  Because the annexation of Ukraine&rsquo;s territory was a total violation of the principles of the UN Charter and of all basic international law.  Russia has to end its aggression immediately and withdraw all forces from the territory of Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  We condemn the use of nuclear weapons.  Any nuclear weapons would result in devastating consequences for everybody.  Nuclear threats should not happen.  Russia previously agreed with other nuclear powers that nuclear war can never be won and should never be fought.  We have consistently condemned Russia&rsquo;s action at the Security Council and we called for that council to continue its responsibilities of the maintenance of international peace and security.  What we do at the UN and what we do in terms of nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation is the continuum of a long tradition of Irish foreign policy.  Frank Aiken, former Minister for Foreign Affairs, was central to efforts to reduce nuclear proliferation around the world and eliminate it.  This is part of our proud tradition.  <\/p> <p>  I was very pleased to meet the Ukrainian MP, Kira Rudik, on Friday.  We have had a lot of contacts with counterparts.  She expressed her extreme gratitude to the Irish people, which I think she did in the media as well, for everything that we have done.  She told me of a Ukrainian refugee who took her aside when she was here and said, &ldquo;Kira, you would not believe how good they are&rdquo;.  I thought that was such a lovely thing for someone to say and how it was true.  She also thanked teachers as well.  There are more than 10,000 Ukrainian children now in Irish schools.  They have been doing incredible work.  We will continue to engage with Ukraine to help it in whatever way we can.<\/p> <p>  On budget conditionality, particularly in respect of Hungary, the Commission made a proposal on 18 September for implementing a budget that would be basically a suspension of cohesion funding to Hungary under our budget conditionality regulation.  Essentially, there would be conditions that Hungary will have to comply with to receive funding.  In the period ahead, we are engaging with our fellow EU member states to get a consensus on this.  We have met the Hungarian Government.  I met its representatives last month and they told me they are committed to complying with the conditions.  We welcome what they are saying but obviously we have to see this and make sure that Hungary complies with conditions.  We have continued concerns regarding rule of law in Hungary.  We were fully engaged in all of the Council discussions that will ultimately determine whether EU funding is withdrawn pursuant to the mechanism, in light of what they actually do.  Hungary essentially was given one month to comply with the Commission decision.  It was looking for an extension, which would mean two months, and, quite frankly, I did not have a huge difficulty with that.  That is on cohesion funding.<\/p> <p>  On the recovery and resilience programme, the Commission has not agreed anything with Hungary yet.  We hope that it will.  We believe in this recovery funding across Europe.  We also know that Irish companies probably disproportionately benefit from European funding, even if it spent it on the member states because we are an exporting country that works abroad.  However, if funding is agreed with Hungary, we have to make sure that there are effective anti-corruption safeguards to guarantee the sound management of what is European money and our money as well, as we are a net contributor.<\/p><p> We welcome the recent agreement between Poland and the Commission on milestones around the rule of law.  Poland has taken steps on its judicial disciplinary regime in the context of the Commission approving its recovery and resilience fund.  We definitely want ongoing dialogue between Poland and the European Commission on the implementation of those milestones as well as wider issues.  The whole issue of judicial independence and respect for the European Court of Justice is not just important for us.  In my opinion, it is very important for any business that is operating in Poland, which is a country that is very committed to our European Single Market.  That market is very important to Poland and it wants to make sure there are no question marks whatsoever over that.  It has been working quite well with the Commission on this.  We welcome and support that.  We also recognise the amount that Poland is doing for Ukrainian refugees, in particular, which is very good, and the pressure that its Government is under.  We are working very closely with Poland on issues surrounding Ukraine on a number of fronts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#H00300","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I will ask one brief supplementary question.

Is attention to eastern bloc countries something Ms Collins believes was missing prior to the war?  I know that she was quite proactive in her previous role as ambassador to Finland.  I met her there and much good work is going on in Finland.  It is not right to collectively build a fence around all eastern bloc countries but the sense we got from Romania - Deputy Howlin was there as well and Deputies &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Haughey were on a recent trip to Georgia - was that because of the war it is now getting attention.  Is that something Europe is conscious of?  Did we miss a beat up to that?  Do we concentrate too much on the western side?<\/p> <p>  I have spoken to the Spanish ambassador in the recent past and there is a sense we are not doing enough for the southern Mediterranean.  Is there a periphery-core issue?  We all live through it in this country, where because we on the periphery we sometimes feel we do not get the same attention as others.  Is that a thing?  I wanted to send back that message.  That is why we will continue as a committee to focus on Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and the Balkan states.  A representative appeared before this committee, Mrs. Eli Bojadjieska Ristovski, on behalf of North Macedonia.  As a committee, we will continue to use our influence, presence and industry to try to build on those connections because at present Europe is very driven and very anxious to ensure accession for the Balkan states, in addition to looking at a roadmap for the likes of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia.  It would be interesting to hear both the Minister of State and Ms Collins's opinions on that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022100500002#J01500","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I will answer.

The Minister was in Romania and Moldova and we have engaged very heavily with them.  For example, my predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, did a tour of the western Balkans, as I did.  Next week, I will sit down with the Albanian Prime Minister, Edi Rama.  We have different formats at European level.  For example, the Taoiseach sits at the Nordic-Baltic round table so there is a very close connection there.  We also have a Nordic strategy and work very closely with the Baltic countries, in particular.  We work with different countries on different issues.  There are countries in the rule of law group and the Single Market group, and there is a Hanseatic group of finance ministers as well.  It depends on different countries.<\/p> <p>  There are some countries where we could do a lot more.

I strongly encourage Oireachtas committees to continue those visits that this committee has been doing post Covid.  That is very welcome.  These countries love to see us coming and have a great fondness for Ireland.  Many of those countries look to us and look to our success in the EU.  We are one of the few EU countries with an embassy in every single member state.  That really gives us significant heft because if something happens in Bulgaria, for example, we have somebody on the ground who can tell us what is happening.  Not every member state has that.  In Slovakia, quite a few European member states do not have embassies.  That became apparent when I was there.  We are always trying to engage with other countries.<\/p> <p>  I will say that on Brexit, every single one of the EU member states, east and west, gave us extraordinary solidarity and continue to do so.

I thank the committee for its invitation.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Brendan McVeigh and Ms Sin&eacute;ad Reynolds from the Department of Finance.<br\/><br\/>International standards in respect of anti-money laundering are set and monitored by the Financial Action Task Force, FATF.  FATF is an intergovernmental body with 39 members, including Ireland, and a large number of observers and associate members.  Over 200 countries commit to implementing its standards.<br\/><br\/>EU standards generally reflect those of FATF and are currently set out in the fourth anti-money laundering directive of 2015, as updated by the fifth directive in 2018.  Ireland is bound by these directives and implements them through the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  That Act has been amended several times, most recently in 2021.<br\/><br\/>A politically exposed person, PEP, is defined by FATF as &quot;an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function&quot;.  FATF states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDue to their position and influence, it is recognised that many PEPs are in positions that potentially can be abused for the purpose of committing money laundering (ML) offences and related predicate offences, including corruption and bribery, as well as conducting activity related to terrorist financing. <\/blockquote> <p>FATF emphasises that PEP status is intended to apply higher vigilance rather than suggesting that individuals are involved in suspicious activity.<br\/><br\/>FATF first issued requirements covering foreign PEPs and their family members and close associates in 2003.  In 2012 FATF expanded these requirements to domestic PEPs in line with the United Nations Convention against Corruption.<br\/><br\/>EU requirements for PEPs are now set out in Articles 20 to 23 of the fourth directive, which broadened the application of the EU regime to include domestic PEPs.  It came into force in Ireland in 2018.  The definition of &quot;politically exposed person&quot; in the directive specifies several categories of PEP, including, for example, Heads of State, members of parliament, members of the governing bodies of political parties, supreme court judges, ambassadors and others.  This definition is open: while the categories stated must be included, other persons may also be included on the basis of their holding a prominent public function.<br\/><br\/>Relevant entities - for example, financial institutions - are then obliged, first, to have in place appropriate procedures to determine whether a customer or the beneficial owner of the customer is a PEP and, second, to apply enhanced due diligence to business relationships with PEPs, including obtaining senior management approval for establishing or continuing business relationships; taking adequate measures to establish the source of wealth and source of funds involved in relationships or transactions; and conducting enhanced ongoing monitoring of those business relationships.  These measures also apply to family members or persons known to be close associates of politically exposed persons.<br\/><br\/>The Central Bank of Ireland publishes guidance on PEPs for financial institutions.  This guidance is available on the Central Bank's website.  Notably, it provides:<\/p> <blockquote> \tFirms should take adequate measures to establish the source of wealth and source of funds which are to be used in the business relationship in order to satisfy themselves that they do not handle the proceeds of corruption or other criminal activity.<br \/><br \/>The measures which Firms should take to establish a PEP's source of wealth and source of funds will depend on the degree of risk associated with the business relationship.  Firms should verify the source of wealth and the source of funds based on reliable and independent data, documents or information.<br \/><br \/>When determining the source of wealth and source of funds, Firms should, at least consider:<br \/><br \/>- The activities that have generated the total net worth of the customer ...; and<br \/><br \/>- The origin and the means of transfer for funds that are involved in the transaction. <\/blockquote> <p>In July 2021 the European Commission published a detailed legislative proposal to replace the fourth directive.  That proposal includes replacing the existing directive-based system with a combination of directives and regulations, with a &quot;single rulebook&quot; implemented via a regulation which would be directly applicable across the European Union.  That rulebook would largely supersede the national provisions I have set out, which are likely to be repealed as part of the transposition.  A new European Union authority, the anti-money laundering authority, AMLA, would lead AML regulation across the bloc.  The package remains under negotiation and is handled at ECOFIN.  Colleagues in the Department of Finance lead on those negotiations and can address questions the committee may have about the broader package.  While the package itself is very substantial and will significantly affect how AML regulation is implemented, the specific requirements set out on PEPs in Articles 32 to 36 of the proposed regulation, as published, are broadly similar to those currently in place.  AMLA is tasked with issuing guidelines on assessing the levels of risk associated with particular categories of politically exposed persons, their family members or persons known to be close associates.<br\/><br\/>The regulation also reaffirms that the requirements relating to PEPs and their family members and close associates are of a preventative, not criminal, nature and should not be interpreted as stigmatising PEPs as being involved in criminal activity.  Refusing a business relationship with a person simply on the basis of his or her being identified as a PEP would clearly be contrary to the spirit of the regime.<br\/><br\/>I am conscious that, with the time available, I have only scratched the surface.

It is rather a case that if a person is holding a position which is, by its nature, high risk, then there is an obligation on a bank to take appropriate and proportionate steps in response to that.  We can become very focused on whether someone falls into a PEP bracket or not.  It is more that, for each client relationship across all of money laundering, not just in respect of PEPs, a risk-based approach should be taken.  The risk associated with the person should then be identified and further due diligence measures taken, if necessary.<\/p> <p>  On the guidance on this, provision 37(12) was actually added in the 2021 legislation.

Just this morning, in an experts group meeting, the Commission let us all know that the 27 member states have now come back with their own lists, guidelines and views on what a PEP is.  The Commission had hoped to do that job earlier as part of the new package and rule book.  They had hoped to consolidate lists across member states to provide pan-European guidance on what a PEP is, but it has not done it yet.  The Commission told us this morning that it is now in the process of doing that.  It has admitted that it has been a very difficult process.  Different member states have different views about what a PEP is and what an associate of a PEP is, but it is there now.  The next step will be for the Commission to analyse that and then, under the directives, namely Article 28, I think, endorse it and give its view on what a PEP is, based on the feedback from member states.  The Commission hopes to issue a consolidated list - in the context of guidelines - about what a PEP will be by the end of the year.

There is going to be that when it comes to transposition.  The only time transposition comes into play anyway is with a directive and the PEPs will be in a regulation, actually, so there will be no discretion with it.  There is flexibility with the transposition of a directive, as I am sure the Chairman knows.  There might be something that sets out why a given member state, including Ireland, would transpose in a certain way but as I said, that is a negotiation itself in the development of the directive itself.  I can only speak from Ireland's point of view and from my time being involved in this, but there may be something particularly controversial we think Ireland is going to have to get into a big compromise on, like for instance when we were pushing very hard back with the Commission in development of the trusts beneficial ownership framework.  We pushed extremely hard at the highest levels of the Commission to get something in place there that would suit Ireland.

In a small country like this, this is going to be something that affects absolutely everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022100500002#F03400","nonspeaker":"Ms Brenda McVeigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":825,"content":"<p>That is what I am coming to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022100500002#F03500","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":826,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022100500002#F03600","nonspeaker":"Ms Brenda McVeigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":827,"content":"<p>The question then that is put to me as a member of this committee, by colleagues in the Houses, is whether it is right that the sons, daughters and family members are all treated as having equal status as a PEP.  I have had Members of the Houses come to me to say their staff, their children have gone for loans and mortgages in the normal practice of day-to-day life and once it is discovered they are a PEP, they are then put through a different approval process.<\/p><p>They feel that is highly invasive to their children's lives and I can understand that.  Other Members have come to me to say that in transferring money from a regular account into a current account, the transaction is often held up because the financial institution is trying to get in touch with the PEP.  There is a clear question as to where they got the money but it might be part of their salary being transferred to their current account.  While they are waiting for that to happen, particularly in these times of financial pressures, their direct debits may be stopped and all sorts of things may happen.<\/p><p> The consequences of the actions taken by civil servants and politicians in regard to the politically exposed person issue trickle down to family members and people who do not even consider themselves associates of a PEP.  It is causing an awful lot of difficulty for families.  It may be a civil servant whose son or daughter applies for a mortgage and suddenly has to fill out another 20 pages.  There is also the grey area, which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan referred to, whereby there is not enough definition of what a PEP is, what the Central Bank should do or how it should be interpreted down the line at the coalface.  There are consequences of this for Ireland and, as Ms McVeigh rightly said, this is a small country and we all will be PEPs.  It is strangling the ability of ordinary family members going about their lives in a normal, standard way, without feeling they are some sort of criminal or that there is some doubt about their character.<\/p><p> I accept why Ms McVeigh made the point she did - it was made for perfectly legitimate reasons - but we should not drag all those people into this, where they do not want to be.  They do not want to be near politics.  They have a regular life, and it has been irregularised by virtue of the fact they are impacted on by this type of legislation.  It is my concern that, in some way, they should be separate.  I am talking about people who have absolutely no worries.  They are not concerned about anything and they just want to get on with their life.  They probably despise the fact a member of their family is a politician and would like to distance themselves a little bit from it.  That is a fact in Irish life.  Those family members will then say, \"Look at what you got me into here; I have another 20 pages to fill out.\"  Surely at ministerial level or high Civil Service level, there has to be an injection of common sense into the thought process on this before we all get strangled in something unintentionally, but that is what is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022100500002#F03700","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":829,"content":"<p>Originally, this was a directive but it will become a regulation.

I would prefer if the EU directive stated that everyone is in this and outlined how we are going to proceed.  I do not wish to be categorised - I say this to our guest from the Department of Justice - under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) (Amendment) Act 2010.

This is a further indication to those who cynically look at politicians and say they must be up to something because they are being dealt with under the money laundering and terrorist financing Act.  The Department official said earlier that it is not meant to do that.  This, however, is the consequence and this is what happens.<\/p><p> I have been a practising politician for a long time.  I am annoyed with the EU and the way it is doing this.  I am annoyed with our own MEPs because when I put it to them they said that they did not vote for it, when actually they did.  They did not even know that they did.  The sad thing about it is how all of these different EU directives find their way into Irish legislation without the due diligence of public representatives.  I not blaming the officials but I am just interested in this whole position.  I recall a very senior politician taking me to task in this House over what I had said about how politically exposed persons were being treated.  He told me I was wrong.  In fact, not only was I right, but it has since been compounded by other missiles that come in our direction from the European Union on this issue.  As I said, I will take it up politically.  These are the reasons the departmental officials are here - not to hold them to account, but simply for me to get to where this began, how it is all coming into operation and why it is like this.<\/p><p> I saw an article recently from a particular part of the financial sector that was giving its interpretation of what a politically exposed person is and what should be done.  If I were to boil it down, I would say that the article said to be careful, to treat all of them with suspicion and, if they are politically exposed persons, to examine them at every quarter and make sure they are okay.  When one goes into one's local credit union for a loan, it is not dealt with by the credit committee - it is dealt with by the board.  One does not have to fill out one sheet; one must fill out 20 sheets.  This is the consequence of the decisions that are being made over there.  I want to catch the baddies just as much as the officials who are present do.  I want to take the risk out of the financial institutions just as much as they do.  I want to see those institutions scrutinised, perhaps a lot more than the officials do.  I want to see them put in their place.  At the same time, I do not believe that those of us who represent the public should be treated like this.  I do not believe that family members should have to bear the consequences of their family member being a politically exposed person, a civil servant or whatever it might be.  We have to be careful about these things.

I was one of the first people in this House to take issue with this directive.  Other colleagues at the time said they did not know about this directive.  They did not know about it, but it is there.  I find it unfair because those who fall into this category, such as politicians and their families and associates, are treated more stringently and aggressively than a person who is not deemed to be politically exposed although he or she may be interested in politics as well.  What kind of politics can one be associated with without being accused of being politically exposed?  Are there any such politics?  I assume the answer is \"No\".<\/p> <p>  I presume that the financial institutions, as the Chairman has said, have a lot of control now and by comparison the political institutions do not have as much.  As time follows, the political institutions are on a losing game and the financial institutions are gaining.  I do not accept that and I will always fight against it, as the Chairman has done.  I opposed it from the beginning.  There are people who did not know they were voting in favour of it.  It is a weakness of the European Union that legislation can be introduced in this fashion without some discussion beforehand and without some way of seeing if it complies with our Constitution.  The basis of our Constitution is that everybody is innocent until proven guilty.  In this particular case, however, all of those who are politically exposed are potentially guilty and must prove their innocence.  This is in stark variation with our Constitution.  I believe this must be dealt with at a much higher level.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that the officials have said that the European courts can deal with this and have dealt with this, and that they have dealt with a lot of other extreme cases also.  It would appear that a citizen of this State who happens to be a public representative will be under suspicion no matter what happens - the Chairman has referred to this, quite correctly - and a person who is a relative, a friend or an associate of a public representative is on to something as well.  That kind of allegation has often been made around the House, as we know, when one party or another wants to land a slur on somebody else.  The matter under discussion today, however, is in the real world.  To presume that we are potentially guilty of something is, to my mind, a violation of our rights and a handing over of citizens' rights to financial institutions.  I do not need to be encouraged to talk about financial institutions because, like the Chairman, I have engaged with and opposed many of them.  Some of them are good to deal with and some of them are not.  Some of them are secretive.  Some of them ignore public representatives, some of them challenge public representatives, and some of them clearly indicate that they do not give a damn about public representatives.  They are their own bosses, and they are quite happy in that position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022100500002#H00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":849,"content":"<p>Is there a question, Deputy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022100500002#H00300","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":850,"content":"<p>I will be happy to hear a response to my outburst.

If anyone wants to accuse me of that, let them come forward or leave it.<\/p> <p>  On the question, I accept what the officials are saying with regard to the reasons for it.  There are reasons for everything and there are ways and means of dealing with issues.  Like the Chairman, I do not happen to agree with the application of this particular rule as it is, just as I did not agree with the GDPR.  I opposed that from the beginning on the basis that I was an elected public representative, elected by the people in a way that does not apply in most other EU countries, which is the single transferable vote.  This does not require me getting permission from anybody to rise on their behalf or against them.  There is a distinct difference in the way governments and people look at this in other countries.  In other countries there are people who hold public office who are never elected anywhere.  They could be associates of anything.  They were never elected anywhere by anybody.  They now have the same powers that we have.  By \"we\", I mean elected public representatives.  They do not have to admit anything, they do not have to do anything, and they just serve their time.  Some of them get into some funny scrapes from time to time.

The Deputy has inferred several times maybe that directives are reached in a somewhat obscure way but they are not.  I have said repeatedly, and I have also said it in relation to FATF.  We get mandates from the elected Minister regarding any controversial measures that are going into directives, and we are open to scrutiny by the Parliament here to come in and discuss anything in a draft directive or draft package of any nature.  Ultimately, it is elected representatives in the European Parliament who sign off on these directives, who signed off on the previous five AML directives, and who will be involved in the sign-off for the new package and new rule book, which is both directives and regulations. We deal with parliamentarians in Europe who are constantly asking what is this or that.  Commissioner McGuinness is very hands-on because with the Commission seat she holds she has a very strong interest in what is being developed in this package.

That is something that myself and others have referred to in the past.  They are strict and ruthless in the way they handle the powers and information they have over individuals.  That would be justified on the basis that they need to know what people are doing but nobody knows what the banks are doing.  When the financial crash came, nobody knew what they were doing until it dawned on us all and fell on our doorsteps all at the one time.  The very fact that they do not seem to be in need of any kind of scrutiny other than to be able to say that politicians are dangerous and could do all kinds of things, so they want to make sure that does not happen.  If anybody else does it, the lending institutions have been economic with the application of the rules that are there to protect customers.  The conclusion that I come to in that regard is a serious one, which is the fact that customers do not matter anymore.  Anything is justified in achieving their results.  I am increasingly concerned about the extent to which they are open and willing to discuss matters with public representatives acting on behalf of the public.  While some are happy to do so, a minority of institutions refuse to engage.  They give no information, have no address, and will facilitate no meetings.  They say, \"Send us the proposal and we will have a look at it\".  That is very old fashioned law and it does not apply here yet.  The EU should be cautious about allowing those kinds of things to happen because, ultimately, it can turn people against the EU, rightly or wrongly.  I have said my piece on this many times before.

Our statement was provided to the secretariat.  I do not propose to read it but I would like to draw the committee's attention to a number of key points.  I thank the committee members who visited the construction site in July and got a full tour.  It is an important opportunity to reconnect to the vision of what we are all trying to create together, namely, a child-centred world-class facility that will support excellence in paediatric healthcare.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director, has been with the project since 2009 and therefore through the detailed design phase of that.  Mr. Phelim Devine, project director, has been with the project since 2014.<\/p> <p>  I remind members we have already opened the Connolly and Tallaght outpatient and emergency care centres.<\/p> <p>  Even since members were on-site in July, we have made significant progress.  We have provided a set of images that show developments since then, including the biome that connects the two sides of the doughnut on top.  The rugby ball on top is now glazed.  We are working with the intensive care areas.  We are kitting out the operating theatres.  Work on the emergency department, imaging, critical care and therapy areas is progressing at pace.<\/p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, is also responsible for the equipping of the hospital.  I am glad to report we have made excellent progress in this area.  For example, we have now acquired all the imaging equipment - X-ray, CT and MRI.  All the equipment to be built into the fabric of the building has been procured.  Some purchase orders have been placed and some are being placed.  I am glad to report to the committee that the work on the integration of this equipment into the building is well advanced.<\/p> <p>  The first rooms in the hospital will be deemed to be fully completed by October of this year, according to the plan.  Some 4,600 spaces will be completed on a phased basis.<\/p><p>In terms of expenditure, the Government approved the investment of &euro;1.433 billion.  Let me bring that figure up to the end of August of this year.  The expenditure in the report here is &euro;1.13 billion.  That is the current situation. <\/p><p> Again, I would like to remind members of the committee that there were certain elements within the original Government approval and there were items outside it.  The biggest item that is currently on the table is inflation, but there were also items that had been excluded, such as regulatory change and the implications of the sectoral employment order.  However, as the contract has evolved, we have also increased significant costs, such as in defending the claims and in terms of the implementation of the recommendations of the PwC report from April 2019.  There are also ongoing costs related to Covid-19 and some costs related to Brexit.  We are fully engaged with all stakeholders in these particular matters and that dialogue continues.  <\/p><p> I will not spend much time on the wider construction sector challenges.  I am sure that committee members are well aware of the disruptions and the market shortages.  I guess that the main word is &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo;, referring to that caused by these particular issues.  We are seeking to engage with the contractor to manage those.  On the issue of claims, we have provided a table and we certainly can go through that, depending on what the committee would like to do.  We provided that to the committee in advance of the meeting, and I think that was yesterday.<\/p><p> In terms of the construction project timeline, the contractor is now reporting to us that substantial completion will be at the end of March 2024.  We are engaged in a constant ongoing review with the contractor on the programme, on the potential mitigation and on securing that date. <\/p><p> In conclusion, there are agreed and established governance structures around this programme and this project.  We are heavily engaged with both the HSE and the Department of Health, with the lead director of the HSE and with the national oversight group on all aspects of the project.  All parties remain committed to delivering substantial completion of the children's hospital within the shortest possible timeframe.  I would like to end this short contribution by saying that I again thank members of the committee for attending the hospital.  I extend an open invitation to them to come back and see the further progress.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022100500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gunning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":912,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gunning and I call Mr. Tierney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022100500002#B00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":913,"content":"<p>Like Mr. Gunning, we have submitted a statement.  I will not go through it all, and I will just draw on some key point just referencing back to the PwC report. I would like to also thank the committee for extending the invitation to the HSE.  In this regard, I welcome my colleague Mr. Martin McKeith, who is the assistant lead director for the children's hospital project and programme.<\/p> <p>  The HSE plays a vital role in the NCHI project.  This is reaffirmed by the role of the lead director emanating from the PwC report of 2019.  The new children's hospital on the shared campus at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital is a key enabler of a major reform programme and acute paediatric services, bringing together three children&rsquo;s&rsquo; hospitals into one and consolidating expertise, research and excellence to ensure the best outcomes for the sickest children of Ireland for generations to come.  It remains the most significant capital investment programme undertaken in the healthcare system in Ireland.  It is unlike anything that we have ever constructed before, providing 39 clinical specialties in one location, under one roof.  This will facilitate the provision of services on a national basis.<\/p> <p>  Within my statement, I set out some characteristics, as well as the scale of the project, and I do not intend to go through that.  I will just say that while 2021 saw significant progress on the exterior, the major focus now in 2022 is on continuing the internal fit-out, with the installation of joinery, such as the nursing stations and the plumbing of the en-suite bathrooms.  Those members who were on site, or who intend to visit in the coming weeks, or even indeed members of the public who have recently passed the site, will have noticed that the exterior scaffolding is coming down, the completion of glazing and that the external facade has been completed. <\/p> <p>  Earlier in the year, the building was connected to a permanent power supply.  The main glazed biome structure that encases the feature stairway and lifts is due to be completed in a matter of weeks.  It is truly incredible to see what has been delivered in terms of vision, scale, quality and enormity of effort by all the contractors involved under the stewardship of the development board.<\/p> <p>  Of course, as many of the members will be aware, the construction project is only one part of the three interrelated elements of the national children&rsquo;s programme for delivery of a new paediatric model of care.  The others are the ICT and electronic health record, on which I will give a brief update, and the operational integration of the three existing children's hospitals.  Earlier this year, the Government approved the business case for the new electronic health record system.  Contracts were signed with the vendor in August of 2022.  This represents the most extensive electronic health record, EHR, deployment in Ireland and it builds upon successful EHR programmes at our largest maternity hospitals in St. James's Hospital, which, by the end of 2022 will have reached 70% coverage of our maternity in newborns.  Recruitment of the project team to deploy the electronic health record project is under way, with 106 full-time equivalents being recruited as I speak.<\/p> <p>  While today's focus is on construction of the NCHI, I am also happy to confirm that the wider children's hospital programme is already delivering terms of the two new constructed satellite centres at Connolly and Tallaght.  These are open and they are delivering the new model of ambulatory care for children in the greater Dublin area. <\/p> <p>  Again, as Mr. Gunning outlined in his opening statement, in any project of this scale and ambition, there remain challenges to be mitigated and managed until completion.  The Department understands that of the 6,000 spaces that are currently under construction, the first of these will be completed in the coming weeks, ready for system commissioning.  The remaining 4,500 clinical rooms will fall on the detailed and planned sequence in the following months.  Later on, Mr. Devine will give an overview in terms of the intensity and detail within the commissioning programme.  While we are all focused on the capital project works and delivery, we are also focused on the outcomes that these will deliver as part of the wider programme.  That is that the children's hospital will deliver world-class facilities and a paediatric model of care that will improve and prioritise medical outcomes for the nation&rsquo;s sickest children, while bringing around transformational change to the delivery of healthcare for the children of Ireland for generations to come.  In other words, this is not a building for 20 or 50 years but, rather, one whose design and construction are being as future-proofed as possible.  It is a hospital for the next 100 years and it is one that can adapt as models of care and clinical practice evolve. <\/p> <p>  Again, I reiterate Mr. Gunning&rsquo;s invitation to any members of the committee who wish to visit or revisit the site to see its progress first hand.  I know that the development board would be happy to facilitate them with this.  It is only when you see the facility in person that you get a full appreciation of the vision, scale and difference that this new hospital will make for generations to come. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022100500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Tierney"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":914,"content":"<p>I again thank Mr. Tierney for the invitation to visit the hospital.

There is a range of cost elements.  We have already signalled that the costs will increase, which is predominantly due to the fact that this is a prolonged programme.  We are looking at a 17-month extension of the programme beyond the contractual completion date.  It was due to complete in August 2022.  It was then extended to October 2022 because of Covid-19.  We are looking at an extension of that period and that will bring additional costs.

Colleagues within the HSE and CHI are engaged in a commissioning programme.  There are probably two commissioning stages - a technical commissioning stage around bringing equipment online and services into use and then a period to integrate the services across the existing three hospitals on one site.  Those discussions are ongoing and will be largely informed by the progress of the construction programme.  I understand completely the desire for certainty but we are in uncertain times.

I accept there will be some overruns but for what it is worth, the theory abroad is the project has already gone three or four times over its original estimate, which is not the case.  Last night, the Minister for Finance gave the D&aacute;il a very strong report on the extent to which the resources are still in place that were in place to meet the original plan.  However, there is still a need to launch a major programme to ensure that the public knows that this is a massive project that is going beyond what we had thought of previously and has still not exhausted its budget and that any attempt by anybody to strip it down, cut it back or discontinue it is not in anybody's interest and certainly not in the interest of children throughout the country, their parents or paediatric medicine in Ireland.  I ask that such a programme be put in place.  Incidentally, I visited the site last Sunday and was most impressed with it.  If a single position can be adopted to dispel the myth that this is something that can be dissected, stripped down and rendered useless, it would be good because that would be an appalling thing to happen.  There are still people throughout this country running around on the basis that this project has exceeded its usefulness.  Are the witnesses aware of that?

We will work again with CHI to amplify the outcomes we expect the programme to deliver, as well the construction progress update.  If we look at progress to date through the two satellite centres, very clearly the opening of CHI Connolly outpatient and urgent care centre in July 2019 is already delivering on that vision.  I can give the Deputy some facts and I believe this is the level of detail he is looking to uncover.  Up to the end of August 2022, over 14,000 children had presented to CHI Connolly urgent care centre, which is an increase from 6,795 in 2020.  The current full year projected activity for 2022 is around 27,500 cases.  Up to the end of August 2022, 7,500 children attended their outpatient appointment at CHI Connolly and projected outpatient activity for 2022 is just 11,500.  CHI Connolly commenced opening at weekends in March 2022, further improving paediatric urgent care services for the greater Dublin area.  Currently 75% of children attending are seen and treated within three hours.  We can also confirm that additional X-ray and ultrasound activity is being undertaken by radiographers in CHI Connolly, which has the additional benefit of freeing up some capacity within CHI Crumlin and CHI Temple as we head into the winter season.  CHI Connolly has provided invaluable physical capacity for several waiting list drives positively impacting on waiting times in the specialties of allergy, gastrointestinal and ultrasound diagnostics.  I draw out these points to reaffirm the Deputy's comments that the paediatric model of care is currently delivering, notwithstanding that we are progressing completion of the site at St. James's.  I agree with the Deputy that it is important to communicate more with the public and our stakeholders to show we are already starting to derive benefits even though we are 80% complete on the campus at St. James's.  I can also give an update on Tallaght, given that it has been open just over a year.  I can provide the committee with a note after the meeting.

We are seeing an impact on supply chains and trade chains through increased energy costs and increased disruption.  We are just under 80% through the construction programme and those risks are mitigating but there is still volatility in our construction sector and global markets on which we rely.

I met some of them when we visited the site.  I was very struck by it and had long and interesting conversations with Mr. Gunning and the project manager.  I get the uniqueness of the site.  For members of the public who might be watching, I was very struck by the fact that, if I interpreted it correctly, if this was a house-building project, normally a contractor has all the space around the house in which to work and the rest of it.  However, this project has the footprint of the hospital and everything has to take place within it because everything else is built around it.  That imposes additional costs.  I understand that it is a pretty unique project.  I am aware that it is a cutting edge project, not just from a medical and children's health perspective, but from an architectural perspective.  I am also aware that it is so unique and cutting edge that it is being visited and international inquiries are coming in about the development of it.  These are all very positive things.  We await the completion of the hospital.<\/p> <p>  In layman's terms, and I am not trying to belittle this, I could not help thinking of Dermot Bannon who presents \"Room to Improve\".  Every time he revisits a site there is an additional expense and the quantity surveyor is tearing his or her hair out.  We are trying to account for taxpayers' money to some degree.  What is the difference between this process and a much more minor process in trying to quantify how much this project will cost in the end?  What kind of processes are there to determine that and to determine the impact of things like inflation on it?  These are the kind of normal things that come into any building project.  Someone sits down and says that inflation will severely impact this.  At some stage, we will know what the final bill is.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses must have some sense of what the final bill will be, with some of the things coming in.  If they were to quantify it, and let us get it out now, can they give us even a ballpark figure?  I ask for this is in part because, like many infrastructural projects that get to a certain stage, the public resigns itself to some degree to overrun costs when it begins to see a project materialise.  It happened with the Luas, the Dublin Port tunnel and terminal 2 at Dublin Airport.  People then say, \"This is almost here.  We just have to get on with it.\"  Do we have a ballpark or some kind of figure that we can land on regarding the overall cost?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022100500002#F01200","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>I will respond to that.

There has been much engagement with the residents through the residents' project monitoring committee, which was set up by the development board in co-operation with the local residents.  It is also a good opportunity to point out the community benefit fund that was put in place by BAM.  Contributions go to local charities and activities from the project to try to ensure there is a value-add in the local area from the fact the project is continuing.  There are also the efforts to ensure and try to drive employment within the project and ultimately the hospital for the local community in this new hospital which is quite significant on the skyline.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to do that.<\/p> <p>  On the compound, there is an appendix to the contract that has it.

When the healthcare planning happened, it took into account current service provision and unmet need, that is, the limitations of current infrastructure and what you might optimally have in a new environment.  It also looked at Central Statistics Office, CSO, population data up to 2041.  It also looked at developments in paediatric care and what it was felt was coming down the line.  The other piece that was useful was the HSE had commissioned a review of intensive care services.  That was carried out by an intensivist from SickKids in Toronto.  That was also useful and informative because that had been a review of paediatric intensive care services and where they needed to go.  Given all that, the decision was made that 60 intensive care beds were likely to meet future need.  Obviously however, medicine progresses and a new initiative in the new hospital is a neonatal intensive care department that is separate to paediatric intensive care.  We currently look after sick neonates but they are looked after within paediatric intensive care.<\/p><p>The future hospital, however, will have an 18-bed neonatal ICU unit.  One thing that is evident is that year-on-year there is an increase, and a very welcome one, in the survival of very premature infants.  These children are vulnerable, however, and often have medical and surgical comorbidities.  Therefore, the plan was that 60% should meet our needs.  This would not be with full occupancy.  The projected occupancy of ICU is 75%, whereas that of standard bed units is 85%.  Obviously, we do plan for some spare capacity, but we planned a greater spare capacity in the ICU because it is a limited resource.  The plan is that this would be sufficient.  In the design of the hospital, though, the ICU occupies two-thirds of the large hot block.  I may not be exactly precise about that two-thirds estimation, but at the other side of the building there is an extensive piece of soft area, which is currently designated for workspaces.  Therefore, there is an obvious expansion capacity within the current building design, should that be required in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022100500002#J02400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emma Curtis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":1110,"content":"<p>In a post-pandemic context, we all realise the importance of ICU beds.  It is good to know we have this type of flexibility, because who knows what we may be facing in future?  Another small aspect in the overall context, but a major one for the patients going into the facility, is that I am conscious it is an all-Ireland facility.  In this context, accommodation for nurses was mentioned.  There are also facilities to allow parents to stay in situations where children may be seriously ill.  There is a major challenge, however, with hotel beds.  I have come across people looking after loved ones in hospital who were sleeping in their cars.  I refer to the cost of parking as well.  This is not just an issue in the context of parents going to the hospital but also for the staff coming from other hospitals.  Has this aspect been explored?<\/p> <p>  On the additional footfall that will be going into the hospital, and the associated requirement for additional buses and extra Luas trams, in the overall context of how people will be able to get to and from the site, have discussions in this regard been ongoing?

On the accommodation aspect, a 52-bed family accommodation unit is to be built outside the hospital.  It will be adjacent and linked through the basement.  This is a separate procurement and we are working closely with the HSE in this regard.  This contract will go to tender by the end of this year or early next year.  It will then take approximately 18 months to build.<\/p> <p>  Turning to mobility management, CHI and St. James's Hospital are working closely on this element.  There are other stakeholders on the campus, including the Blood Transfusion Board and Trinity College Dublin research facilities.  These are all part of a campus-wide mobility management plan.  This examines optimising public transportation, vehicular transportation, pedestrian and cycling routes into the campus.  We have taken the opportunity in the design of the hospital to provide 500 bicycle parking spaces, most of which are in a car park underground.  We also have optimised parking for patients and their families.  The 675 spaces we are providing are for patients and their families, which is about one and a half times the number of spaces available on the adult campus.  Therefore, as part of the EIS, we did a great deal of detailed work to ensure we have the right numbers of parking spaces.  This provision does not exist in the three hospitals now.  The committee will be aware that Temple Street hospital has no parking, while that at Crumlin hospital is limited.  We have now addressed this issue.<\/p> <p>  Equally, the NTA's roll-out of BusConnects, which will occur shortly, perhaps by next year, will mean many new buses will be coming onto the campus.  While from a vehicular perspective we have looked after all the patients and their families, we must also think about all the staff who will be working in St. James's Hospital and in the CHI when it opens.  We will be talking about 7,000 people at that stage.  Taking students into account as well, the overall total could be close to 9,000 people on campus.  Most of those will use public transport, cycle or walk, and some will drive.  Therefore, there is a joined-up, campus-wide approach to mobility management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022100500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Devine"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":1112,"content":"<p>One of the positive developments is the development of an electronic patient indicator.

I refer again to the idea of moving away from a paper-based system and this meaning it would be possible for people outside Dublin and in rural areas to have instant access to files.

This ultimately means the delivery of a paediatric model of care in a paperless environment.  The deployment of EHR on the campus is not a first.  We have reached somewhere between 50% and 70% of deployment of electronic health records for national newborn and maternity systems.  We have also deployed electronic health records for the National Rehabilitation Hospital and the National Forensic Mental Health Service facility in Portrane.  We are also now considering how best to deploy electronic health records as we start to mobilise regional health areas.<\/p> <p>  How can we truly deliver integrated services from a community and an acute perspective?  How can we integrate these elements?  What will this mean for patients as they journey through the healthcare continuum?  There are issues and challenges, of course.  These have been well noted, and include legacy systems and fragmentation of systems.  The real challenge, however, concerns how we can integrate systems from a technical perspective.  We are now starting to turn our minds to consideration of what this level of capability means for our regional health areas.  Obviously, institutional and cultural issues will be encountered as we move from paper to electronic records.  The Government has approved the heads of a health information Bill to allow the Department to progress this process.  For the first time, this will provide absolute clarity around two purposes of information sharing.  The first would be deemed the primary purpose, and this refers to ensuring patients' data follow them.  This would be the case whether the healthcare setting concerned is private, public or community practice.  The proposed Bill will clarify patients' entitlement to their data and how they can receive them.  The second purpose, which is important from a health planning perspective, is to allow the use of patient data at an aggregate level to plan for future needs.  It will mean that as we are planning for our future health capacity and needs we will have data and evidence to give us insights regarding what we need to do, when and where.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of the parking charge, the Minister has decided to cap the daily parking charge at &euro;10.  We are working with the HSE to see how we can best institute this charge in the context of a procurement process to engage a provider to run and manage this contract on behalf of the State.<\/p> <p>  I turn now to the last element of the question and I will add to Mr. Devine's commentary on transport planning.  Regarding how staff and patients access the existing campus, there are already strong links between St. James's Hospital and the NTA, through engagement with Dublin Bus and the operator of the Luas, concerning how to best match transport capacity to the needs of the campus.  CHI is also active in this discussion in the context of understanding what it means in terms of being able to rely on public transport to access the site.  Extensive parking is also being provided underground to facilitate parents as they arrive with children for treatment.  This is all part of a wider transport planning consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022100500002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Tierney"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":1114,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tierney.

The reason I ask is that I was a public representative, a councillor, in the years after 1999 when motorway projects began.  Companies drove a coach and four through local authorities and the State and there were incredible cost overruns.  These companies were experts at making claims.  The Government got caught out until 2002 or 2003 when it brought in fixed terms and penalties if projects were not delivered on time.<\/p><p>What we had then was a plethora of contracts that were delivered ahead of time and below the original contracted price.  What has been learned from this?  I get the bespoke nature of it.  We cannot underestimate Covid and the materials cost inflation - maybe someone will be able to account for that - but it appears from the headlines that the cost will exceed expectations.  If I understood the CEO correctly, the excess cost right now is &euro;9 million in claims.  That is a big sum but it seems that a tight game is being played in the overall cost of it if some of that has been due to court decisions and if those decisions land your way, as was said.

In my response to Deputy Shortall, I said that the public spending code has been adapted to take on board the journey and the learnings.  In the case of any project over &euro;100 million, as it goes through a gated process from outline through to post-market engagement, there is now an obligation to layer in an external insurance review at two of the gates.  Every project over &euro;100 million is now subject to a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform process, which it calls a major projects advisory group.  That seeks to remove as much uncertainty as possible as a project travels through the public spending code to the point of contract award.  Full and 100% certainty will never be achieved because that is the nature of the market we engage with and of construction projects over &euro;100 million, but the key learning and what it seeks to do is get as much certainty as possible before we commit to contract.  We are tied to public works contracts and they are on a fixed price, lump sum and time-bound basis.  That is under review by the Office of Government Procurement under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

I thank all our guests.  The national children's hospital is an important subject.  Construction of this hospital has been an ongoing issue in recent decades and it will finally take place.  I visited the site a number of months ago along with a number of other Deputies and Senators and it is extremely impressive.  When it is finished it will be a major asset to our public health system.  Notwithstanding that, there is one big cloud over the whole construction and there is no getting away from the question of cost.  I know all our guests have mentioned cost but it staggers the mind how this has spiralled out of control.  In 2014 the original cost of the construction of the national children's hospital was &euro;800 million, in 2018 that was quantified to &euro;1.4 billion, in 2022 it is &euro;1.7 billion and I am guessing that the cost will definitely go over &euro;2 billion.  All the indications are that it will go over that &euro;2 billion mark, which is an extraordinary amount of money for a hospital.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if the witnesses can answer the following question definitively: how did people get this so wrong?  How did they get the cost so wrong for the construction?  We all know construction prices can go over budget over time.  We all understand that and Covid was thrown into the environment as well but how could a company get it so wrong?  Was it self-inflicted or were the players in the ongoing construction of this project completely unprofessional?  How did it go so wrong in the cost?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022100500002#O01600","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1232,"content":"<p>I want to reset and make sure we are all dealing with the same set of facts.  The approved investment by Government from the end of 2018 for this project is &euro;1.433 billion.  That includes the construction contract, which is the BAM works and it includes the additional costs of the development board, the design team and other related charges which come in.  Of that &euro;1.433 billion, as of right now &euro;1.13 billion has been spent.  We are still below the Government approval, therefore, but there are cost pressures on that.  I do not mean to be reminding the Deputy of the following point but outside of that approval there were already a number of items that were not given definitive quanta within that &euro;1.433 billion approval.  We had items outside of that, such as inflation, which we have talked about already and which we can go through again.  There was the cost of defending the claims, which was significant, and there were additional costs due to Covid and Brexit.  There would have been some change in cost due to regulatory change of the design but not much.  That is the position and the major contributor to the cost increase as we look forward is delay.  The contract is in delay and a lot of discussion can be had on that.<\/p><p>Certainly, there is no doubt that the current construction environment and current set of uncertainties with regard to what Brexit, Covid-19 and other aspects have inflicted on the contract are significant.

Where we are responsible and the contractor has an entitlement, we have paid that money, as we are required to do.

A lot of figures are being used so I just want to bring clarity to the relationship between the &euro;1.433 billion, which is for the works only and as my colleague said, within that Government-approved budget of &euro;1.433 billion, there are items to which the contractor is entitled and external factors are now adding pressure to that.

The matter of exemptions from the study of Irish, t&aacute; s&eacute; complex agus multifaceted.  Irish has long been a core subject of the primary school curriculum and forms an integral part of the new integrated primary language curriculum.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin t&aacute;bhachtach fosta mar n&iacute;l B&eacute;arla agus Gaeilge mar &aacute;bhair ann a thuilleadh.  T&aacute; &aacute;bhar amh&aacute;in ann, is &eacute; sin an integrated primary language curriculum.  T&aacute; s&eacute; iontach t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh an d&aacute; &aacute;bhar sin snaidhmthe le ch&eacute;ile sa scoil.  This gives an opportunity for language learning and gives the advantages of bilingualism a particular status on the primary curriculum for students learning language in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the TUI submission in that developments in the understanding of language acquisition of special educational needs and neuroscience in education generally has led to a review of the policy of exemptions by the Department of Education.  That was very much welcomed by our union at the time.  We have new circulars in place now.  Obviously, the Department intended to give greater clarity, simplicity and transparency in the process involved in granting of exceptions.  The main focus now, for a child who has ongoing and persistent special educational needs and those who are entitled to a place in special schools and classes, in particular, go mbeidh an d&iacute;ol&uacute;ine sin acu.  &Aacute;fach, nuair a rinne siad an t-athbhreithni&uacute; ar an gciorcl&aacute;n, n&iacute; d&oacute;igh linne go ndearna siad athbhreithni&uacute; ceart and in fact we would submit that the consultation did not take place at all.  Fuaireamar briefing &oacute; thaobh an chiorcl&aacute;in nua ach n&iacute; raibh siad s&aacute;sta &eacute;isteacht linn.<\/p> <p>  It is a positive feature of primary education in Ireland that children experience language learning in at least two languages.  Engagement with Gaeilge throughout their primary education has many benefits for children as it extends their overall linguistic experience and enhances language acquisition skills and awareness.<\/p><p>Exposure to and engagement with the Irish language in school on a daily basis, formally and informally, serves to deepen the pupils&rsquo; cultural awareness and contributes to their sense of national identity.  This also promotes increased opportunities for social engagement, consistent with the key principles underpinning the effective teaching, learning and assessment of language and literacy as set out in our national curricula and reinforced by the National Council for Curriculum Assessment sa dr&eacute;acht nua at&aacute; ag teacht amach &oacute; thaobh an churaclaim nua don bhunscoil.<\/p><p> The benefits of bilingualism and studying a language from a young age are now better understood and studies show that a second language helps mental agility, makes it easier to learn a third or more languages and can help support a child&rsquo;s academic achievement in other curricular areas.  The 2019 primary language curriculum is for children of all abilities in all school contexts and is based on an integrated approach.  The primary language curriculum provides a framework for teachers to identify the pupils&rsquo; stage of language development and accordingly to plan interventions that will support the development of language skills and competencies in Gaeilge agus B&eacute;arla and in an integrated manner.  It also emphasises the transferability of language skills across languages.<\/p><p> It is an anomaly of the system for exemptions that a student can avail of an exemption from the study of Irish due to learning difficulties, yet t&aacute; cead ag an dalta c&eacute;anna teanga eile a fhoghlaim ansin n&iacute;os moille agus &eacute; n&oacute; &iacute; ag dul tr&iacute;d an scoil.  There is an anomaly in the fact there is an exemption from one of the two language in the integrated primary language curriculum and yet you can still go on to study a modern foreign language.  We may even be faced with a situation in a number of years, although we hope not, where the modern foreign languages are becoming part of the revised curriculum and you could be doing Spanish, Italian or French with English and have an exemption from Irish.  N&iacute; bheadh ciall ar bith leis sin.  There is evidence from the Department of Education&rsquo;s review to support this view, as 67% of junior certificate students in 2016 with an exemption from Irish sat an examination in a foreign language.  Sin beirt as tri&uacute;r.<\/p><p> The special education teaching allocation model is also important because the model that is in place for primary education allows mainstream schools to provide additional teaching support do na p&aacute;ist&iacute; uilig who need that support for their identified learning needs in school as opposed to being based primarily upon a diagnosis.  Sin a d&oacute;igh a bh&iacute; s&eacute;.  It was only about the diagnosis but now the idea is that the teachers are front-loaded, as the special needs assistants, SNAs, are on occasion as well.  It is important the policy of granting exemptions would be congruent with the overall policy for students with special educational needs, which is no longer based on a point-in-time diagnosis of a disability but seeks to respond to pupils&rsquo; emerging, or in some cases diminishing, needs as they develop and progress through the curriculum and school.<\/p><p> As with most curricular areas, t&aacute; s&eacute; iontach t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh continuum of strong to weak language learners but no unique disability in language learning.  Sparks stated in 2016 that \"empirical evidence has shown that students classified as ... [learning disabled] do not regularly fail ... [foreign language] courses and that, in fact, most secondary and postsecondary students classified as ... [learning disabled] pass ... [foreign language] courses.  Sin an rud a d&uacute;irt Declan c&uacute;pla bomaite &oacute; shin.  Difficulty in reading and writing a language does not necessarily inhibit an individual in learning to speak and understand the language.  For some children with significant learning difficulties, learning Irish may not be suitable, but research evidence confirms that, given an taca&iacute;ocht ceart, the right supports, children with additional learning needs can benefit from learning Irish.  Bh&iacute; mise istigh in ollmhargadh sa Ghaeltacht le linn an tsamhraidh agus bh&iacute; fear &oacute;g le Down's syndrome ag caint liom ag an checkout.  Thug m&eacute; faoi deara l&aacute;ithreach go raibh s&eacute; chomh chumasach sa Bh&eacute;arla is a bh&iacute; s&eacute; sa Ghaeilge.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag smaoineamh ina dhiaidh sin gur sin an c&oacute;ras oideachais.  Bh&iacute; an leaid sin s&aacute;ite sa phobal agus t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach don duine sin agus do dhaoine le riachtanais speisialta, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sa Ghaeltacht ach ar fud na t&iacute;re, go mbeadh siad &aacute;balta cumars&aacute;id a dh&eacute;anamh sa d&aacute; teanga.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin t&aacute;bhachtach.  There is no evidence internationally for the concept of a second language learning disability, and the notion that bilingualism is damaging for children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, is not supported by the limited research available.  Furthermore, it is possible that bilingualism could improve communication and social skills in children with ASD.<\/p><p> I refer to d&iacute;ol&uacute;int&iacute;.  The decision to grant an exemption from the study of Irish should arise only when it is evident a child is not benefiting from second language learning and when alternative interventions, such as suitable differentiation, have been exhausted over a prolonged period.  Tarla&iacute;onn s&eacute; go r&oacute;mhinic go mb&iacute;onn br&uacute; ar ph&aacute;ist&iacute; dul go dt&iacute; an me&aacute;nscoil trasna &oacute;n bhunscoil agus ag an phointe sin b&iacute;onn na tuismitheoir&iacute; ag iarraidh go mbeadh an d&iacute;ol&uacute;ine seo curtha i gcr&iacute;ch ag an am sin.  Bheadh s&eacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr an taca&iacute;ocht ceart a thabhairt do na p&aacute;ist&iacute; i rith na scola&iacute;ochta agus sa ch&aacute;s sin n&iacute; bheadh g&aacute; ar bith le d&iacute;ol&uacute;int&iacute;.  In 1999, 2.5% of pupils were granted exemptions, but in subsequent years, nuair a th&aacute;inig an ciorcl&aacute;n nua amach, we saw a considerable increase in the percentage of pupils with exemptions.  Sa bhliain 2010, bh&iacute; thart f&eacute; duine amh&aacute;in amach as naon&uacute;r, n&oacute; 11%, agus bh&iacute; s&eacute; sin i bhfad r&oacute;-ard.  Since 2019, principals can authorise exemptions.  Under Circular 12\/96, there were 5,385 pupils enrolled in primary schools with an Irish exemption and the most common reason mentioned was a learning difficulty.  T&aacute; anail&iacute;s d&eacute;anta maidir le l&iacute;on na nd&iacute;ol&uacute;int&iacute; ag an bhunleibh&eacute;al agus ar na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; de dhalta&iacute; a fuair d&iacute;ol&uacute;ine de bharr m&iacute;chumas foghlama &oacute; 2016.  T&aacute; an t-eolas sin &oacute; anail&iacute;s a rinne an tOllamh &Oacute; Duibhir i gCol&aacute;iste Ph&aacute;draig in Ollscoil Chathair Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath i mbliana.  Feictear go raibh titim ar an bhunleibh&eacute;al in 2019 ach go bhfuil an treocht ag dul in airde ar&iacute;s.  Meastar go raibh baint ag an chiorcl&aacute;n nua agus bh&iacute; scoileanna druidte ar feadh tamall fosta le Covid.  B'fh&eacute;idir go raibh baint ag na ruda&iacute; sin leis.<\/p><p> In anticipation of a review of the circular, the INTO engaged with our principal teachers, principal seminars and principals&rsquo; information sessions between September 2021 and May 2022.  Some of the findings were quite startling when we engaged with those principals throughout the country.  We asked them what their experience as principals was in granting exemptions, we asked what their view of the criteria for granting exemptions was, we asked what concerns, if any, they had about the granting of exemptions, and we asked if exemptions should be granted at all at primary level.  The following trends emerged as an chaint sin.  Principals felt they are being asked to grant more exemptions and felt under pressure from both parents and post-primary schools to do so.  The pressure from parents stemmed from anxiety around access to supports at post-primary level and performance in State examinations.  Principals felt that in many cases they were doing the job of some post-primary schools and asked for a review of how support is allocated in areas.  B'fh&eacute;idir nach bhfuil an ceangal ceart ann idir an taca&iacute;ocht at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il sa bhunscoil do ph&aacute;ist&iacute; le riachtanais speisialta agus iad si&uacute;d ag dul ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; an me&aacute;nscoil.  Cuireann s&eacute; sin br&uacute; ar thuismitheoir&iacute;, ar phr&iacute;omhoid&iacute; agus ar mh&uacute;inteoir&iacute; bunscoile.  D&aacute; mbeadh a fhios acu, mar shampla, go mbeadh ranganna speisialta ann agus go mbeadh taca&iacute;ocht speisialta ar f&aacute;il sa mhe&aacute;nscoil do na p&aacute;ist&iacute; seo, b'fh&eacute;idir nach mbeadh g&aacute; ar bith leis an d&iacute;ol&uacute;ine sa ch&aacute;s sin.<\/p><p> When informed that the Department of Education figures show a decrease in exemptions granted since the commencement of the 2019 circular, several principals indicated that all exemptions granted may not be in the Department's database mar chaithfear iad a chur ar an primary database agus uaireanta b&iacute;onn na pr&iacute;omhoid&iacute; r&oacute;ghn&oacute;thach i rith na bliana leis sin a dh&eacute;anamh go gasta.  Sa ch&aacute;s sin, when the statistics are being gathered, sometimes the exemptions have not been uploaded.<\/p><p>There is definitely a question about some of the statistics that are available from the Department at present.  Principals also felt that the criteria were clear and that a pupil either qualified for an exception or did not.  Chuir siad f&aacute;ilte roimhe sin because it was not always the case that the criteria were clear.<\/p><p> However, it was also felt there was a high level of dissatisfaction among parents, who felt that a child should be granted an exemption when the principal was not in a position to do so, or that the child did not receive a low enough score on the discrete test, but the test score is the score.  There appears to be a relatively high level of requests for pupils to be retested.  This development is very worrying because there is no place for retesting on standardised tests.<\/p><p> Principals also reported that they felt many parents may not fully understand the longer term implications.  Nuair a bh&iacute; mise i mo phr&iacute;omhoide ar feadh tamall fada, bh&iacute; m&eacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag m&iacute;ni&uacute; do na tuismitheoir&iacute; go mb'fh&eacute;idir go mbeadh deacrachta&iacute; ag na dalta&iacute; n&iacute;os d&eacute;ana&iacute; nuair a bh&iacute; an scoil cr&iacute;ochnaithe acu - fi&uacute; amh&aacute;in agus iad ag dul ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; an leaving certificate - because there are conditions on the leaving certificate applied course with regard to a second language.  Ba &eacute; an meon a bh&iacute;odh agamsa i gc&oacute;na&iacute; n&aacute; go mbeadh s&eacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr don dalta a bheith ag staid&eacute;ar na Gaeilge ar feadh 11 bhliain n&aacute; &aacute;bhar &eacute;igin nua a thos&uacute; i ndiaidh an junior certificate.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh Gaeilge ag daoine do certain public service jobs and other jobs fosta. <\/p><p> Principals also reported that privately commissioned psychologists were often not aware of the terms of the new circular.  T&aacute; a fhios ag an gcoiste go bhfuil an National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, ann.  Ba cheart go mbeadh a fhios ag NEPS faoin gciorcl&aacute;n ach, &oacute; am go ch&eacute;ile, n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn NEPS ag feidhmi&uacute;.  Sa ch&aacute;s sin, when one gets a private assessment done, the psychologists may not be aware of the new criteria in the circular.  There was a strong feeling that the concept of granting of exemptions should be re-examined in the light of the integrated language curriculum sa bhunscoil, the ongoing consultation on the draft primary curriculum framework and the possibility of the inclusion of a modern foreign language in the primary curriculum in the future.<\/p><p> Principals also requested evidence-based research to support the argument that there may be a benefit to be derived from the granting of exemptions from elements of the curriculum.  There is not too much evidence available worldwide at present.  There was also a strong feeling among principals at the seminars that exemptions should not be granted at primary level and that pupils at primary level should experience all aspects of an integrated curriculum, albeit with appropriate differentiation.  The granting of any exemptions, if necessary, should take place later in a pupil&rsquo;s school life.  We also note - nuair at&aacute; 400 pr&iacute;omhoide ag teacht le ch&eacute;ile, n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn siad ag aont&uacute; lena ch&eacute;ile i gc&oacute;na&iacute; - that there were dissenting voices at the seminars but it was a small but vocal minority.  We are giving the majority findings here today.<\/p><p> It is also noteworthy that since we engaged with principals on this matter, a significant number of children who were not born in Ireland, including children fleeing from the unjust war in Ukraine, have enrolled in Irish primary and secondary schools, including Gaeltacht schools, and that the majority of these children do not speak English on arrival here.  Consideration should be given to providing additional teaching supports sa Bh&eacute;arla agus sa Ghaeilge do na p&aacute;ist&iacute; seo, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sa Ghaeltacht agus i nGaelscoileanna ach i ngach scoil.<\/p><p> The INTO supports the view that students with additional and special educational needs are entitled to opportunities to experience and benefit from learning a second language at a level appropriate to their needs and abilities.  That should be eminently possible.  We are calling for a full consultation on and review of the circulars on exemptions because we were not properly consulted on the most recent one.  We are calling for an examination of the concept of granting exemptions in the light of the integrated language curriculum and the potential introduction of a modern foreign language in the forthcoming framework.<\/p><p> We are also calling for evidence-based research to support the suggestion that there is a benefit to be derived from granting exemptions from any element of the curriculum; a full range of resources to allow primary schools to provide support to pupils experiencing difficulties with language learning and high-quality professional development.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin t&aacute;bhachtach fosta mar t&aacute; siad ag r&aacute; anois sa Roinn nach mbeidh an continuing professional development, CPD, ceart ar f&aacute;il, is &eacute; sin, an CPD a fuaireamar leis an tseanchuraclaim in 1999 which involved proper face-to-face, school-based training.  That will be very important going forward.<\/p><p> We firmly believe go bhfuil an teanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta l&aacute;rnach san oideachas, as set out in the Education Act 1998.  The principle of inclusivity must underpin policy for the Irish language and therefore exemptions should be exceptional and granted only in specific circumstances.  The review of the primary school curriculum and the development of policy advice on supporting students with special educational needs marks a critical juncture and provides an ideal opportunity to engage in meaningful consultation and robust research on the concept of exemptions.

It will be interesting to see what it finds with regard to the positives and negatives and how the logistical issues can be overcome because that will be very important in the context of any changes at senior cycle.  As a corollary of that, it is also important that we value the Irish language as a spoken language.  In the examinations system, the percentage of marks we attach to a component of a subject is a measure of the value that we attach to it.  It is therefore very important that we truly value the oral component of the language through the marks we attach to it.  It is deeply unfortunate that the marks previously attached to the oral component of junior cycle Irish are no longer there.  That says a lot.  The other corollary that is very important relates to foundation level at junior cycle and concerns about the future of foundation level in the leaving certificate.

The second thing is to truly enshrine the importance of Irish as a subject and as a cultural entity.  That is has a societal aspect as well as within the education system.

As acknowledged by other witnesses, the Charities Regulator is a relatively young organisation.  However, since our establishment in October 2014, we have gained extensive experience of implementing the Charities Acts.  Through our work, we have identified a number of areas where statutory amendments would enable the Charities Regulator to carry out its functions more effectively.  The amendments proposed in the scheme will facilitate greater accountability and transparency, which are vital for public trust and confidence in the charity sector.  They will also further support a balanced and proportionate approach to regulation by expanding what is currently a relatively limited range of regulatory tools.<\/p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s charity sector of almost 11,500 registered charities plays a pivotal role across every facet of society.  The public and the State rely on registered charities and the tireless work of hundreds of thousands of volunteers across Ireland, over 75,000 of whom take on considerable legal responsibilities as charity trustees.<\/p> <p>  We are cognisant of the profile of the sector we regulate and its importance in communities.  As our 2021 annual report highlights, the sector comprises a diverse range of organisations, from the simple to the complex and from those with little income and limited operations to those with substantial resources and extensive operations.<\/p> <p>  The majority of charities and charity trustees work hard towards achieving their charitable purpose in compliance with the Charities Act 2009.  Our regulatory approach reflects this and is balanced and proportionate.  This is evidenced by the fact that a substantial part of our work is focused on promoting compliance and supporting charities in achieving it.<\/p><p>Our work includes daily engagement with individual applicants for registration to guide them through the registration process and with registered charities to ensure they understand the statutory reporting requirements and standards of governance as set out in the charities governance code.<br\/><br\/>While the public is the single biggest source of the concerns we receive regarding charities, only a small proportion of the engagement we undertake with charities and charity trustees is visible to the wider public due to the small number of cases where we have had to appoint inspectors or take other formal action.  The majority of our compliance engagement is directed towards assisting individual charities to come into compliance and meet their regulatory obligations.  It is only when we are not assured by that engagement that, for example, inspectors are appointed. <br\/><br\/>The Charities Regulator has been seeking amendments to the Charities Acts for a number of years to address certain fundamental and practical issues regarding the application of those Acts.  There are a few key provisions in the general scheme that I would like to highlight today.  Fairness is essential for effective regulation.  We are seeking amendments that are intended to ensure all registered charities, regardless of their legal form, are subject to the same regulatory framework, particularly in relation to the preparation and filing of financial statements.  Clarity on legal obligations is also essential.  Given our experience to date in the area of compliance and the work we continue to carry out to support and encourage better governance standards in the sector overall, we view the proposed amendment clarifying the fundamental responsibilities of charity trustees as essential.  As previous witnesses have acknowledged, there is nothing new here and the amendment merely codifies what is already the case and provided for in law.<br\/><br\/>While we are committed to a balanced and proportionate regulatory approach, we are limited by the type of powers currently provided for under the 2009 Act.  Sometimes the only option open to us is more far reaching and heavy handed than a breach merits.  Therefore, we are also seeking the expansion of the circumstances in which the regulator can impose intermediate sanctions as an alternative to prosecution.  This is not an extension of our powers <i>per se <\/i>but more a modification of the range of powers already available to us under the 2009 Act.  An important point to highlight here is the significant role of the independent Charity Appeals Tribunal, the statutory body established under the 2009 Act to hear and adjudicate on appeals against certain decisions of the Charities Regulator.  A charity&rsquo;s right to natural justice, including the right to appeal a decision of the Charities Regulator, should be fully respected in the proposed amendments. <br\/><br\/>We would also like to briefly mention the proposed amendment set out in head 5(a) which has been referenced by previous witnesses.  The amendment is intended to clarify that where a suspected offence under the Charities Act is subject to investigation and potential prosecution by the Charities Regulator, we are not obliged to notify those offences to other investigative authorities.  However, the Charities Regulator will still be required to notify the appropriate authorities when we suspect that an offence under their legislation has been committed.  The amendment, if enacted, will not affect other obligations under the Act governing our relationships with investigating authorities and other regulators.<br\/><br\/>Finally, there are amendments intended to address practical difficulties encountered in day-to-day operations.  These amendments relate particularly to the withdrawal of applications for registration and the obligation on charities to notify the Charities Regulator if they are seeking to amend key provisions in their governing document, such as their main object and income and property clauses.  This provides an important safeguard for charities themselves.  It ensures that changes are not made to their governing documents that could unintentionally negatively impact their status as registered charities.  Ensuring that key information crucial to an organisation&rsquo;s charitable status is known to the regulator and is kept up-to-date on the register of charities is vital.  The public needs to know that when they donate money, goods or time to a charity, those valuable resources will only be used for their intended purpose.  <br\/><br\/>Our core function is to work to increase public trust and confidence which are the bedrock of the charity sector.  We are committed to achieving this, working with all of our stakeholders.  The amendments we are seeking are designed to assist with this work and, if enacted, will further strengthen and enhance our ability to deliver a balanced and proportionate approach to the regulation of Ireland&rsquo;s valuable charity sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Martin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":1349,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Martin very much, particularly for persisting despite the feedback and the echo, which are making things difficult for everyone.

I thank Ms Martin for her submission.  Unfortunately, I was late as I had to be in the D&aacute;il but I have read the report and I thank Ms Martin for taking the time to be here today.<\/p> <p>  Representatives of the charity sector appeared before this committee two weeks ago.  I have a number of questions for her on issues that of concern to them that were raised at this committee.  One concern is around the extension of significant additional powers, which is seen as a disproportionate or overly strong.  It could be described as using a hammer to crack a nut.  The legislation is seen as overpowering in that regard.  The charities also felt that the appeals process is insufficient and that reputational damage could be caused to charities prior to any findings.  As someone who works as a volunteer with a charity, I understand that the reputational damage that could be caused by something that may have happened but has not been proven is potentially fatal.  That must be thought about carefully.<\/p> <p>  We also discussed the question of significant events and what exactly is meant by \"significant event\" in the context of members of the board of a charity.  When one sits of the board of any organisation, one is always very conscious of the importance of doing one's best.  Pretty much everyone who takes on such a role wants to do the best they possibly can but there is also a concern that because of issues that happened previously with various charities, people will be overly cautious in what they will report and what is meant by a \"significant event\".  This could lead to a lot of additional work for the Charities Regulator and could overburden the charity sector, with people being overly cautious.  The overall sense is that although a lot of the legislation is good, some tweaking is needed so that the members of boards are not going to spend all of their time worrying about what is a significant event and what they need to report.<\/p> <p>  The final issue relates to charities that are changing something in their constitution relating to their aims and objectives.  Will Ms Martin clarify what that means, in real terms, for board members?  What if something comes up that board members think is minor but the regulator does not?  Clarification is needed.  Everyone who sits on a board is concerned with the services that are provided by that board and with making sure that all work is being done to the best of the staff's ability.  What board members do not want to do is to sit for hours on end worrying about what is significant, what needs to be reported, or whether they will get into trouble if they change something in a charity's constitution.  We are asking people to volunteer, to come forward and sit on a board but if a charity is suspended or there is an investigation into it because of something that the board members did not think was significant, that causes reputational damage for the board members.  How do we get people onto boards and involved in the community and voluntary sector if there is a fear in the back of their minds that they could get into serious trouble and suffer reputational damage, possibly for something they were not even involved in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#C00300","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1351,"content":"<p>I think I have got everything but if not I will defer to my colleagues who have joined me today.<\/p> <p>  The first question was on the extension of powers and the perception that a hammer is being used to crack a nut.  That phrase has been used a lot.  Funnily enough, the phrase we would use internally is &ldquo;a sledge-hammer to crack a nut&rdquo;, because that is often what we are facing.  As I said in my opening statement, our first step when dealing with non-compliance is always to endeavour to engage with the charity and its trustees.  That is our regulatory approach.  The approach, in the first instance, is to try to bring a charity in difficulty and that may not be complying into compliance.  There would never be a case, or there would be very few cases, where we would go straight in with a statutory sanction.  Our regulatory approach is very much to bring charities into compliance.  The regulatory tools we have available to us are available to us when we cannot get people to engage with us.<\/p> <p>  There are often cases where people are not in compliance.  Those cases can be really hard because the individuals might not be willingly non-compliant.  In many cases, the charity trustees are ill-informed.  They are just not informed enough about their role as charity trustees and what they need to know to oversee a charity.  As a result, one ends up with poor governance and charities finding themselves in difficult situations.  Reputational damage, which was mentioned, can occur when people do not understand the obligations that apply to them.  In most of these cases, all that is available to us is the prosecution of the individual concerned.  We believe that is an absolute no-no in many cases because it is using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.  It is not going to achieve what we need to achieve.  It is not that the trustees are badly intentioned; it is just that they are ill-informed.  In those circumstances, we need to have available to us other powers that are more proportionate and balanced.<\/p> <p>  Let me give the example of the intermediate sanctions provision.  That has been focused on a lot by many witnesses who have appeared before the committee.  Intermediate sanctions can be imposed on a charity only with its agreement.  An intermediate sanction is not one that we can impose unilaterally.  The charity has to agree.  The reason it would be advised to agree is that the only other option available to us in the circumstances is the prosecution of the offence.  What we are looking for is the introduction of provisions in the Act that would be linked to those intermediate sanctions, because the intermediate sanctions provide the charity with an opportunity to fix whatever issues arise.  They provide transparency to the public, indicating that the charity is working with us to remedy any difficulties.  That is a really big thing for charities.  We are better able to assist and bring into compliance those charities that, on being contacted by us, are willing to work with us, engage with us and help us understand the difficulties.  That is very much our regulatory approach and starting point.  That is the issue with the intermediate sanctions.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy said there were concerns that people could suddenly be taken off the register.  I believe this is what he was getting at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Martin"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":1352,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#D00200","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1353,"content":"<p>That has not happened to date.  We have hundreds of charities that have failed to submit their annual reports on time, which is a criminal offence under the Charities Act, but to date nobody has been taken off the register.  The reason is that we appreciate and understand who we are regulating and our sector.  We deal with hundreds or thousands of charities every year directly on the phone, at face-to-face meetings and through emails and other forms of correspondence.  We are very much alive to the issue.<\/p> <p>  We view taking charities off the register and appointing inspectors and so on as being similar to the nuclear option.  There will be cases where that will be an appropriate response on the part of the Charities Regulator but there is no question that there would not be a full process before that.  The charities concerned would be given every opportunity to engage with us and remedy the compliance issue.  It will never be the case that charities will find themselves taken off the register suddenly.  That is not the approach of the Charities Regulator.  Our record proves that we have not done that.<\/p> <p>  The only charities taken off the register to date were those taken off by operation of the Act because they lost their charitable tax status.  It is provided for in the Act that once that status is lost, they must automatically be taken off the register.  It applies only to a particular cohort of charities, namely those that never had to apply to the Charities Regulator.  They got on the register of charities because they already existed and had a charitable tax number at the time the regulator was established.  A charity registered by us will not necessarily be taken off the register, because the Act does not operate in that way.<\/p> <p>  The next point concerns the appeals process.  As I said in the opening statement, we very much support and absolutely understand, particularly since we are a regulator subject to administrative law, that where we are making these kinds of decisions, there has to be an avenue of appeal.  In our proposal, and as I see has been done in the general scheme, we have tried to make the appeals process more accessible.  At the moment, many decisions can be appealed only to the High Court.  We would like to see more decisions appealable to the Charity Appeals Tribunal because the latter is far more cost-effective for the Charities Regulator in terms of its public funds and how it spends them.  Also, we are acutely aware of the stress and strain on charities owing to their finances.  Someone said recently that the cost of High Court proceedings per day is in the region of &euro;40,000, if not more.  Therefore, this is really important to us.  We fully support an accessible appeals process.  When the Minister was here talking to the members, he said these were exactly the kinds of reasons the legislative scrutiny process is so important.  It is so we can identify the issues.  Ultimately, we are discussing a general scheme, but the actual legislation will be drafted by parliamentary counsel in the Office of the Attorney General, who will be absolutely up to speed with the kinds of administrative law requirements that any regulator should have in legislation.<\/p> <p>  The next point concerns significant events.  I am conscious that many queries have been raised in this regard.  What we are talking about when we talk about significant events are really those that have a catastrophic effect on a charity, whether that effect is financial or reputational, because of something that happens in the provision of services, or whether its beneficiaries or employees are suddenly at risk, for whatever reason.  There is no question that this area in the general scheme needs to be refined.  The Minister acknowledged that when he was with the members.  We absolutely support that.  Ultimately, we do not want charities to be in any doubt about what they need to do.  In our view, the amending legislation is about clarifying and enhancing what is already in place.  The last thing we want to do is introduce provisions that in themselves are not clear.<\/p> <p>  We have spent a huge amount of time over the years on the supportive element of our approach to regulation.  We have extensive guidance.  We are reviewing it at present with plain English in mind.  We review it constantly.  In addition, we have direct day-to-day engagement with charities.  From our perspective, with regard to any obligation that comes in, regardless of how clear it is, we will likely have some guidance to assist charities around it to make sure that what we expect is absolutely clear.  I would not expect charities to be left in any doubt about that or in any way feel inhibited in terms of their discussions at board meetings, which I believe was suggested by a witness on a previous occasion.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the constitutional changes, we absolutely appreciate the position.  The general scheme is very broad.  To echo what the Minister said, the main things we need to know about as the Charities Regulator are any changes to a charity&rsquo;s main object.  That is what the charity has been set up to do.  I will come back to why it is essential that charities do not change their main object without getting the approval of the regulator.<\/p> <p>  The other issue concerns the income and property clauses, in addition to any changes to the winding-up clause.  The income and property clauses concern how a charity spends its money.  Members will appreciate that this is of relevance to the Charities Regulator but also to every member of the public.<\/p> <p>  Our position on the winding-up process is similar.  It is a matter of what happens to the charity&rsquo;s assets when it winds up.  Any assets that are left over should be going to another charity with a similar charitable purpose.  It is important that this be made very clear.<\/p><p>I will come back to the main object.  It is important because we have had situations where charities were aware of their company law obligations and submitted the change in their constitution to the Companies Office but did not tell the Charities Regulator.  There is a charity test provided for in the Charities Act.  It has several elements, one of which is that a charity may have a charitable purpose only.  If a charity has a charitable purpose and other purposes that are not charitable purposes under the Charities Act, it is not entitled to be registered as a charitable organisation under the 2009 Act.  I hope members can see what I am getting at there.  There could be people who do not understand that the change they have made has taken them outside the Charities Act.  That is very serious because, if it were to happen, what would happen to the assets up to that point?  The public would have donated to a charity that was registered but suddenly the charity unwittingly made what it thought was a minor change to its main object.  We have experience of that and have dealt with those situations in a pragmatic way.  We have not taken any bodies off the register.  We will work with charities to try to get the issue rectified but, to be honest, it is not good enough for that to happen when the main object is so important to what a body does as a charity.  That is why one of the main principles of the governance code is that charities must only advance their charitable purpose.  Every activity they do relates to their charitable purpose.  In addition, it is not open to any charity trustee, having collected money from the public for a particular charitable purpose, such as helping those with disabilities, to unilaterally and suddenly decide, without giving notice to anybody and certainly not to the Charities Regulator or the public, that the charity is going to spend those donated funds on something else.  Charities are entrusted with funds.  When people donate, they do so for a particular purpose and the money must go to that purpose.  The charity trustees cannot suddenly decide they are going to spend it on a completely different area of charitable work, no matter how well intentioned that might be.  That is a fundamental principle.<\/p><p> My final point relates to investigations and the reputational aspect thereof.  The reputational aspect goes across all statutory sanctions because where we impose statutory sanctions, there will be a publication element to that in many cases.  For example, if we impose an intermediate sanction, the nature of the sanction is that the non-compliance becomes public knowledge and the public is made aware of it.  The benefit of the intermediate sanction is that we get the body to work with the Charities Regulator and we publicise how proactive the charity has been in addressing any issues that have arisen.  We are always heartened when a charity comes to us after a concern has been raised, for example by a member of the public, to tell us they knew about the issue and took certain steps, and to set out exactly what they did and how they have already addressed it.  In such case, we are delighted because we can see that governance is working well and they understand their obligations, and we can close the concern.  Similarly, if we go to a charity and find that it was not aware of a breach and does not understand what it has done wrong, we are always happy if we can work with it to come up with a plan.<\/p><p> A big aspect of the investigations piece that members will have seen in the general scheme is the ability for the Charities Regulator, having gone to the expense of using public moneys to appoint inspectors in those challenging cases where we have significant concerns - we only appoint inspectors when we have considerable concerns and the charity has been given an opportunity to engage with us but has not been able to assure us - to have a statutory tool available to it to follow up when the inspectors deliver those reports.  That is important.  At the moment, when we publish an inspector's report, we are often asked what comes next.  We are asked what we are going to do about the issue, given that the inspector has said all of these things that should not have been happening were happening.  In such cases, the Charities Regulator currently has to try to engage with the charity voluntarily.  We are reliant on the charity voluntarily fixing the things that have been identified.  That should not be the case.  The public would expect that the regulator would be able to follow up on the issue on foot of the inspector's report.  Without these additional powers of direction, we could end up in a situation where an issue is not rectified and the only way we can try to combat it and address the non-compliance is to appoint inspectors again.  We do not want that.  It would be a waste of the public's money, our resources and the resources of the charity if that were the case.  The voluntary approach that we adopt to the situations where we have inspectors' reports generally involves people having come to us with a plan.  They will have engaged with the inspector and seen what the issues are.  It will not come as a surprise to them.  Due process is followed.  The charities and charity trustees and anybody who is concerned and is mentioned in the report will be given an opportunity to see the report in advance of its publication and to provide comments on it to us.  That is an important part of the process.  It should not come as a surprise to anybody and we would not want it to.  In most cases, the charities volunteer a plan.  We have been lucky in that regard, although it is also because of the positivity in the sector we are regulating and its willingness to engage with us.  If a charity has not already addressed things, by the time an inspector's report has gone through the whole process it is generally happy to provide a plan.  It is a missing piece and it is certainly something we have scrutinised.  We have been left in positions where a charity may not have engaged with us on foot of an inspector's report and we have been left scratching our heads and wondering what to do and whether to start again.  The measures proposed in the general scheme are based on our extensive experience of regulating the sector and wanting to continue to apply the proportionate and balanced approach that we believe it requires.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Martin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1355,"content":"<p>I will add context that might help to allay any sense of fear or concern that a sledgehammer is being provided to crack a nut.  The Vice Chairman referred to reputational damage where a matter has not yet been proved.  This is an area for which Mr. Mulholland is responsible, so my apologies to him for stepping in.  Last year, 569 concerns were closed and there were only three instances in which inspectors were appointed.  This shows that the vast majority of concerns are dealt with on the basis of that engagement and nobody except the charity and us know anything about it.  In terms of the engagement, obviously when we start we do not know where a matter might end, so we adopt high standards of procedure and fairness from the outset.  Even though we are not a court of law and we might not be prosecuting, we adopt those standards and we do not take action that is not based on fact or is not applied in accordance with the law.  That is some context in that regard.  We take a balanced approach and we intend to continue with that.  As a regulator, however, if one does not have the tools to ultimately do something, there will always be a small cohort who will not engage.  Unfortunately, that is the reality of life.  It is not necessarily that the powers are there to be used but, rather, that people know they are there and we can use them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Madeleine Delaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":1356,"content":"<p>Very good.  I remind members taking part on Microsoft Teams who wish to ask questions to indicate using the \"raise hand\" function.<\/p> <p>  There seems to be broad acceptance from across the sector and the Charities Regulator that the legislation is necessary.  I know that a courts and civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill covered some of this ground but was not progressed.  In addition, unfortunately, the change of situation with the UK in terms of its political affiliations with the rest of the EU necessitates some of what is in the Bill.  As outlined in one of the notes provided to the committee, just under 42% of all registered charities are incorporated generally as companies limited by guarantee and the 2009 legislation is not really fit for purpose in that instance.  It strikes me that people who might be characterised as being on opposite sides of this debate are not on opposite sides in reality.  What the charities sector and groups such as The Wheel are calling for and what the Charities Regulator is calling for are very similar and aligned.  The lack of detail in terms of progressive sanctions puts the regulator in a difficult position when it is trying to engage with charities.  One of the characterisations the committee has heard relates to a tension between policeman and pal.<\/p><p>If the sledgehammer remains a sledgehammer rather than a more nuanced tool, the Charities Regulator is going to be increasingly viewed as a policeman.  That will mean charities will not engage in order to remediate problems at an earlier stage when they are more easily fixed.  We need some better direction in terms of the intermediate sanctions that are available, rather than going straight to charities being taken off the charities list.  It is one of the things that the charity sector is very concerned about.  We need to understand the appeals mechanism a little better as well.<\/p><p> I want to give the Charities Regulator the opportunity to flesh out the proposed two additional amendments to the existing draft heads and the three consequential amendments that come from that.  They have been supplied to the committee in an information note circulated to all members.  I ask Ms Martin to talk in a little more detail on these useful amendments, which meet much of the need for nuance that has been discussed.  As her opening statement was quite truncated, she did not necessarily get to delve into the type of detail these amendments deserve.  I want to give her an opportunity to do that now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#E00300","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1358,"content":"<p>I will start with the Chair's final point, on the two new heads mentioned in our submission to the committee.  The first of those relates to the charitable purpose of a charitable organisation.  The proposal is for a new section, section 42A.  The reason for this proposal comes out of other observations we have seen and comments people have made around what they see as the obligation for charities to notify us of every little change.  That was never intended.  This particular new section aims to address the point I mentioned previously about changing an organisation's charitable purpose.  Given the importance of that, we have suggested a discrete section to deal with that.  As seen in the explanatory notes, there is already a provision in relation to charities that change their names and a requirement that charities notify the Charities Regulator in advance of doing that.  I noticed there was a kind of incredulity from some other witnesses that were before the committee about that provision.  This section is really important.  I want to give a practical explanation for that.  It relates to what we see every day.  If a charity changes its name without telling the Charities Regulator, it is possible that it may change its name to a charity name that already exists on the register.  It is also possible that it may change its name to something that does not indicate what it does as a charity.  That is not something we would approve.  Again, it is about transparency and the public knowing what a charity does.  There are really good reasons behind that.  Having said that, the only thing we can do in that situation is take a prosecution against a charity.  When people have come to us after making a change without letting the Charities Regulator know, it has been because they did not realise.  It has been a genuine mistake.  In such circumstances, we have worked with them and highlighted to them the reason it is so important.  The new section we have proposed is around that.  It involves putting a similar provision in place for something that is equally if not even more important, particularly to the public; namely, changes to the charitable purpose of a charity as reflected in a charity's main object.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Martin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1359,"content":"<p>The Charities Regulator already has the power to remove a charity that is not meeting the charity test and is therefore not a charitable organisation.  A change in the main object or a change of purpose, or even changes to those elements of the constitution which deal with what a charity does with its income and property, might all result in a charity falling outside of the test and having to be removed.  These provisions allow us to prevent that.  If it is clear that a charity needs to come to the Charities Regulator for this, hopefully we can head it off at the pass and it will not happen.  As Ms Martin said, it is a way of clarifying the matter and making sure we get it at the outset but it is all going to the same issue.  As I have said, the power is already there and it is the same across all the jurisdictions.  If an organisation is not continuing to meet that charity test, it can be removed from the register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Madeleine Delaney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1360,"content":"<p>There is a consequential amendment to the general scheme.  What is in the proposed new section 40 has already been provided for, but to a much more limited extent.  It is not as clear as it is in the new section that we have proposed and we hope will be considered.  We think it is a better laid-out section and we hope it will better address some of the concerns people have around needing to notify us about minor changes.  They absolutely will not have to do so.  We need to be clear on what people are required to do if something is an obligation.  We are interested in the main object, income and property clauses, and charities winding up.  The consequential amendments relate to those elements as they relate to the general scheme.<\/p> <p>  The final head we mentioned relates to the Charities Act 1961.  There are older charities Acts that we operate under as well because we took over some functions from the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.  A particular provision has been posing a real problem for charities and for the charity services committee of the Charities Regulator.  These are highly qualified people who consider quite complex applications from charities, particularly charitable trusts, relating to trust deeds, sale of property and that kind of thing.  We are looking for a technical amendment here.  There is a requirement at the moment and it is not clear whether charities have to go to the High Court to get something done.  Much of what the commissioners did was to ensure charities did not have to bear the cost of going to the High Court.  This is in a similar vein - we are trying to make sure that we are clear on this and that we can save charities money where possible.  Charities can then spend that money towards their charitable purpose.  This second amendment is quite technical, but it is something that should be welcomed by everybody.  Certainly our charity services committee will welcome it, as will the charities that have made these applications.<\/p> <p>  The Vice Chairman mentioned the \"tension between policeman and pal\".  We certainly think we have the balance right.  We would not refer to it in those terms.  As a regulator, the last thing we want is to be the subject of regulatory capture, which is what being a \"pal\" of the sector denotes, unfortunately.  The way we look at it is by considering how we can bring charities into compliance and address the small minority of charities mentioned by Ms Delaney earlier that are unwilling to engage for whatever reason, perhaps because they are ill-informed or badly intentioned.  That is where our enforcement and compliance piece comes into play.  As evidenced by our work to date and by our engagement charities, we have a supportive role to play.  Even our own mission encapsulates that we have a supportive element while also ensuring compliance and enforcement.  We are extremely conscious of the supportive element, which is why we spend such a significant part of our non-pay budget on it.  We spend a lot more on it than on compliance and enforcement.  In terms of facts to back up what I am saying, I hope that provides some assurance to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The companies point is a crucial thing.  The Vice Chairman mentioned a courts and civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill that was introduced.  We proposed some amendments to that legislation, but unfortunately it did not go anywhere.  They were crucial amendments that are needed.  There is a considerable flaw that has to be addressed.  Out of everything in the general scheme, it is the most important.  The framework as it was set up for charities exempted charities that are companies from a number of key provisions, and not just the financial ones.  There are implications around that.  For example, the obligation to keep proper books of account applies to all charities under the Charities Act.  If the charity is a company, however, the provisions under the Charities Act does not apply - what applies is the similar requirement under the Companies Act.  If we are faced with a situation where a charity is a company and has not complied with the duty to keep proper books of account, as the Act currently stands we cannot look to impose intermediate sanctions on that charity.<\/p><p>It is not bound by that particular provision, so it is not technically in breach of the Charities Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Martin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":1362,"content":"<p>It will not be, in terms of the Companies Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#G00200","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1363,"content":"<p>It would.  In that situation, we would notify the corporate enforcement authority of that.  We mentioned earlier that we are in touch with many different regulators.  We have memorandums of understanding, MOUs, and different things in place for that reason, but also because we are required under our Act to let other regulators and bodies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue, know where there are breaches of their legislation.  From our perspective as the Charities Regulator, that is completely unfair.  The chances are that the Corporate Enforcement Authority potentially will not follow up on what it might see in the great scope of what it does as not being a significant issue, whereas we view that as a significant issue.  Albeit that the charity might be very small, it is important that charities manage their finances.  They are entrusted with money by the public or State and they have to be able to manage it.<\/p> <p>  It seems unfair that a charity that is an association, for example, will be subject to sanctions by the Charities Regulator.  The sanctions that we have available to us are not necessarily the same ones as there are under the Companies Act.  If there is a framework to regulate charities, it should regulate all charities, regardless of their legal form.  That is why this is essential.  <\/p> <p>  Where that really bites is regarding the preparation of financial statements, the publication of them on the register and also the requirement to audit.  If we were at the moment to introduce regulations around audit, for example, and when charities have to get their accounts audited, they would only apply to charities that were not companies.  The charities that are companies would be able to avail of an exemption under the Companies Act, which would not be available to any of the other charities.  That is an inherent unfairness in the framework as it is currently presented in the Charities Act 2009.  It is why we tried to get it back in 2017 and why we have been talking about this for so long.  It is having an impact on the level of transparency in the sector.  We cannot introduce those rules around how a charity prepares its financial statements and also when they have to get those statements audited.  Charities will be required to get those financial statements audited at a lower level than would be the case under the Companies Act.  As the Deputy is probably aware, under the Companies Act, they can be making millions &ndash; Mr. Mulholland can correct me if I am wrong &ndash; before they have to get their accounts audited because they have an exemption under the companies legislation. <\/p> <p>  I just wanted to raise that point.  It is very important, not just for the Charities Regulator, but to the sector.  When we did our surveys back in 2020 with the public, which were published in 2021, one of the big things that came back, unsurprisingly, was what the public wanted to see and what it felt impacted its level and confidence in the sector was how transparent charities were around their finances and what they were doing with the money that they receive.  It is crucial to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Martin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1364,"content":"<p>Another important point on that is that we are not asking the charities that are companies to do any more work; they have to produce these accounts anyway.

Out of fairness, we need to be able to say to those charities and charity trustees that put in so much work to be compliant with their obligations onto the Act that we will look at those who are not and ask them to be compliant as well.  It has to be a level playing field.  They are all the considerations that we have to take into account.

However, what the Act intended was that charities would produce accounts in a uniform format so that they could be easily compared.  At the moment, it is very difficult for anybody doing research in this area or a member of public who wants to compare one charity with another because charities will produce things in very different ways.<\/p> <p>  Another issue that we have &ndash; the Deputy may have heard this as well from other people who spoke with him &ndash; is around abridged accounts.  We have charities that are companies that have prepared the full accounts in order and then have submitted, or somebody has submitted on their behalf, abridged accounts to the companies office.  That is then what appears on the register.  Our view is that it may be legally okay and permissible for a charity that is a company to do that, but abridged accounts provide virtually no detail and certainly do not provide the level of transparency.  The provision is already there, but the Minister has not been able to make the regulations under it because they would only apply to a part of the overall register of charities in Ireland today.  It is the regulations that would set out the detail of what people have to do when they are preparing accounts.  <\/p> <p>  Also, we have sought to increase the threshold at which people have to produce accounts and at which people will have to get their accounts audited.  It was &euro;100,000 and we are looking to increase it again up to &euro;250,000.  That would be the point at which they would have to produce what would be the most detailed set of accounts.  We call them statement of recommended practice, SORP, accounts.  It specifically relates to charity accounts and what someone reading charity accounts should see.  There are very particular things that, as one would imagine, are specific charities and that is what those rules entail.<\/p> <p>  This was something that we consulted on back in 2016-2017.  We know that at that time, increasing the thresholds was supported, so that is another amendment that is in there.  It comes back to being proportionate, balanced and fair.  If and when these rules come in and the amendments are made, if they come in as planned, a small charity may not actually have to submit its accounts to us as part of its annual report each year and it will not have to get its accounts audited.  It will still be required and bound by the separate obligation to keep proper books of account.  However, it will not be required to file anything with us.  That is important as well.  We are looking to increase that threshold too so that more charities would fall into that.

In the case of a failure to respond to a direction from the Charities Regulator for information, for example, our approach is very much to bring charities into compliance.  Therefore, when we seek information, we normally do so on a voluntary basis first.  We will ask the charity to provide us with the information.  If it does not do so, or if it provides us with information that is incomplete, at that point we will consider whether we need a statutory direction.  If that does not work, we are into the area of potentially having to appoint inspectors.  Within that provision, there is a more serious provision again on getting information from charities, and charities have to comply with that.  However, with a lot of those provisions there is no recourse if they are breached other than to take the charity off the register or prosecute those involved.  All we are trying to do, therefore, is to link more things into the intermediate sanctions, which, as I explained earlier, requires the consent of the charity.  I do not really see that as giving us more powers.  It was very clear when Members, as lawmakers, made the original legislation that they believed, rightly so, that certain things, such as failing to respond to the Charities Regulator when it issues a statutory direction for information, are very serious.  However, there is the missing link that we hope to convince people to put into this legislation.  That will feed in and give us the ability to formalise the bit in the middle that we have at the moment, whereby we have brought the voluntary piece as far as we can and the only thing we have left is prosecution, for example.  We know that it is a serious breach but we do not want to see an individual prosecuted.  He or she will then have a criminal record.  That should be kept for the very serious cases, and that is what we are trying to do.  We are trying to bridge that gap.  To the extent that there are concerns out there, I hope that today we have assured the committee and explained the thinking behind this.<\/p> <p>  That leads quite neatly to the Vice Chairman's next question, which was how many times we have had recourse to the High Court.  We have been involved in two such cases.  One is ongoing and the other the committee will have heard about.  Sorry - there have been three such cases.  I had forgotten one a number of years ago.  Last year we were involved in a case when the Charities Regulator had to go in and seek a winding up of a charity because its own trustees were not in a position to do that.  The reason the Vice Chairman has not seen a lot of recourse to the High Court is not that there have not been cases in which we thought we were being left with no option but to bring those involved to the High Court, but rather that we have been in a situation whereby we have thought that would be too extreme from a cost or resourcing perspective.  The Charities Regulator is a relatively small organisation and we do not have a huge budget.  We cannot be going to the High Court to have resolved what are important compliance issues but ones that are not that significant.  If a compliance issue were that significant, we would appoint inspectors.  It is a matter of proportionality.  We talk about this all the time, but that is proportionality in practice.  Therefore, the fact that the Vice Chairman has not seen High Court proceedings does not mean they have not been considered in hundreds of cases, but we have found other means to bring the charities into compliance.  Sometimes, however, those other means of bringing charities into compliance are very resource-intensive.  When we are looking at value for money, we have to say to ourselves that if there were some easier way for charities to bring appeals - by going to the Circuit Court, for example, or for charities going to the Charity Appeals Tribunal - it would be more cost-effective for all parties involved.<\/p> <p>  Anything in this general scheme is there because we have had to try to implement it.  As we said earlier, we get hundreds and hundreds of concerns every year.  Members will not know to whom those concerns relate.  We do not publish that information for the very reason we talked about earlier, that is, reputational damage and so on.  There is, however, a lot of work that goes on under the hood, particularly when we are dealing one-to-one with hundreds and thousands of charities every day of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Martin"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":1371,"content":"<p>Could the witnesses flesh out the role of the Charity Appeals Tribunal?

We have done that in only a few cases, and none of those cases have been appealed to the tribunal.  Obviously, we provide reasons.  There is a whole process and numerous levels of processes around registering a charity.  When we write to applicants, we do so in advance and tell them we will be recommending that their application be refused.  We give them the reasons and an opportunity to come back to us.  That is something we have done ourselves.  It is not provided for in the Act but it is an additional level of fairness and procedural fairness that we think is required.  We have the option to remove charitable status if, for example, someone were to do something that moved an organisation from being a charity to being an excluded body.  There are excluded bodies under our legislation.  They are entities that cannot be registered as charities.  For example, a political party or anything that advances a political cause is not a charity under the Act and will be excluded.  Similarly, sporting bodies are excluded.  Therefore, there could be decisions whereby, as I said, people might inadvertently do something or carry out an activity or start carrying out activities that are not charitable.  They may be good and well worth doing but they are not strictly within the four corners of the Act, and in that case we may have to remove charitable status.  We have not done that yet, but that is potentially something that would come up.  That would go to the Charity Appeals Tribunal, which is entirely separate to the Charities Regulator.  The former is an independent statutory body.  Although it was established by the 2009 Act, it is completely separate to the regulator.  It has its own members, who are appointed by the Minister.  I think the committee was advised at an early committee meeting on the general scheme of the Bill that the Department provides the secretariat for the Charity Appeals Tribunal.<\/p> <p>  We are in favour of it being possible for any decision taken that is of a similar effect, such as an organisation being taken off the register for a particular reason, to be appealed to the Charity Appeals Tribunal.  I anticipate that this will be worked through by the drafters of the legislation, who will be very familiar with this, and by the Department itself.  We are always happy to provide input to that.  We absolutely recognise the importance of this, and what we see in the general scheme is an extension of the kinds of decisions that could be appealed to the Charity Appeals Tribunal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Martin"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":1373,"content":"<p>Very good.

The ICCL warmly welcomes this important legislation and we congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, for bringing forward essential reforms in this area.<\/p> <p>  The ICCL approaches this question not just as a matter of regulating the charity sector.  We see this as an essential measure in the context of Ireland's obligation to create an enabling environment for civil society and for ordinary people and communities to take part in the democratic life of the State.  We see this question from the perspective of Ireland's international human rights obligations to vindicate the right to freedom of expression and freedom of association.  We also approach the question in the context of our commitment to fair procedures and the rule of law.  It is essential that the regulatory powers of the Charities Regulator are, as the regulator has said, proportionate and balanced.<\/p> <p>  We wish to address two specific questions today.  The first is the proposal contained in the draft Bill that concerns the amendment of section 3 of the Charities Act 2009 and inserts \"the advancement of human rights\" into the Act as a new valid charitable purpose for organisations.  This we strongly welcome.  This amendment will address an anomaly that has existed in the original Act since 2009 and will provide for greater oversight and transparency in the sector, which we have long called for.  The advancement of human rights was originally listed as one of the charitable purposes in the original heads of the Charities Bill in 2006 but it was omitted from the final Act in 2009.  In neighbouring common law jurisdictions, the Charities Trustee and Investment (Scotland) Act 2005, the Charities Act 2006 in effect in England and Wales, and the Charities Act (Northern Ireland) 2008 all expressly provide for the advancement of human rights as a charitable purpose.  Consequently, Irish law has been out of step with norms of our neighbours.  As the advancement of human rights is a recognised charitable objective in the UK, including Northern Ireland, this has created and important gap of equivalency in the protection of human rights between both parts of this island.<\/p> <p>  The rationale, or one aspect of it, originally used by Government for the exclusion of human rights from the list of valid charitable purposes under the Act was that it is not a category used by the Revenue Commissioners in their determination of charitable status.  However, the Charities Act 2009 is the primary statutory instrument governing this area and in our view it should be the primary reference point for legislative authority on what constitutes a charity or charitable purpose and not the interpretations of the Revenue Commissioners.  In our view it would be prudent that, following the enactment of this important amending Bill, the Charities Regulator and the Revenue Commissioners agree a memorandum of understanding or other instrument of that type, as recommended by the joint committee in 2015, to ensure consistency between decisions and approaches taken by the Charities Regulator and the Revenue Commissioners when evaluating the status of bodies in the is category.<\/p> <p>  The second point will, we feel, be an important aspect of how this change will be operationalised with regard to charities and bodies that might be deemed charities in future.  It relates to Guidance on Charities and the Promotion of Political Causes, a document issued by the Charities Regulator in 2021.  We heard in the previous session from the Charities Regulator about the importance the body attaches to guidance documents it issues to support and assist charities.  We note the language in that document on the nature of political engagement deemed to be permissible under the Charities Act has changed from an earlier guidance document issued in February 2018.  The earlier document made reference to the fact that organisations established \"exclusively to promote a political cause\" would be considered ineligible for charitable status.  I think we can all appreciate why it would be inappropriate for a body established for an exclusively political cause to be deemed a charity, for example, if it was set up to support a particular political party or candidate.  However, in the updated document from December of last year, the language used is that organisations \"set up primarily to promote a political cause\" would be so excluded.  This creates a potential difficulty about how the regulator or other bodies might interpret what is political and when an organisation crosses the threshold into being \"primarily\" concerned with political activity.  In our view, it is difficult to envisage how, under the amended legislation, a human rights organisation could advance human rights without falling foul of the updated guidance from the regulator, given the prominent and vital role political advocacy and campaigning plays - properly - in the day-to-day work of human rights organisations.<\/p> <p>  It is our recommendation that in order for the addition of the advancement of human rights to have a meaningful impact in Irish charities law, it will be necessary for the regulator to revert to the original 2018 wording on political advocacy to provide certainty and clarity to the law.  This would mean organisations established to exclusively promote a political cause should not, and cannot, be considered charities, as is correct.  However, organisations should be allowed to conduct legitimate political advocacy as part of their charitable work in pursuit of their charitable aims.  We very much understand there is a need to protect and distinguish electoral politics from the work of civil society but there is nothing wrong with charities or other civil society bodies engaging in political advocacy.  Indeed, it is an essential and healthy feature of any democracy that ordinary members of the public can seek to influence the public life of the State.  We do not want to enter an area where the Charities Regulator, or any regulator, is making subjective analyses of whether bodies should be allowed to choose political aims to advance their charitable objectives.<\/p> <p>  We are eager to engage with the committee on this question.  We noted with great interest the contribution of The Wheel and Charities Institute Ireland at a recent meeting of the committee.  They raised very important concerns about fair procedures and the risks associated with expanding the powers of the regulator.  We fully endorse and support their views.  While we understand a regulator or indeed the State may wish to expand the powers available to a regulator to give it greater discretion, this also creates certain dangers and risks that those powers might be used at some point in the future to suppress charities or other civil society organisations with which the State does not agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":1378,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Herrick for his initial contribution.

It is funny because I was trying to figure out the definition of what is \"political\" and what is not.  I am of the view that pretty much everything we do is political.  How then do we come to a definition of what will be excluded as an organisation for charitable purposes?  I looked at the document and there was reference to a youth group set up for migrants.  The group was advocating for extra funding, organised a march and used its resources to march to the D&aacute;il.  That would be permissible.  We are getting into subjective opinions on what would be deemed permissible and what would not be.<\/p><p>From the perspective of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, how do we manage to do this?  If a group is set up exclusively for political purposes, this would be quite clear.  The other set-up is very nuanced.  Where a body is trying to change legislation or is seeking funding, it would be a bit dangerous if an organisation linked to the State had the power to tell that body it is not a charity or could not use particular charitable funding.

The first thing to say is we can approach this question of political engagement by charities or community organisations by asking how much of charities engaging with the political process we are willing to tolerate.  We could also approach it from the perspective that was spelled out by the Charities Regulator in its 2018 documents, which is as something we should encourage.  We should encourage our charities, community organisations and youth groups to take part in the political process.  Ireland has a number of international obligations under human rights law to create an enabling environment to maximise the extent to which ordinary people can take part in protests and demonstrations and write to Members of the Oireachtas.  We should start from the perspective of it being a positive.<\/p> <p>  It is possible to distinguish activity that is clearly linked to parties, candidates or a side in a referendum campaign.  It is possible that we do this through Electoral Acts regulations and lobbying regulations.  There are mechanisms for doing this.  Outside of this we should encourage and facilitate to the greatest extent possible groups engaging in activity, as long as it is in furtherance of their charitable aims.  There are a number of examples where this can become a problem.  Deputy Donnelly very astutely pointed to the fact that in Ireland a large proportion of our charities receive some or the majority of their funding from State bodies, such as health bodies or housing bodies.  It might often be the case that a youth group is concerned about the provision of resources in its community and might want to protest or express its view on this.  We can all envisage a situation where the relevant public or State bodies or Departments might wish to limit its ability to do so.  In our view this is an inappropriate restriction on the freedom of expression or freedom of association of these groups.  We should not try through charities law to limit their ability to do so.<\/p> <p>  We also have the example of national advocacy organisations that campaign on very important social questions, such as the position of children in society.  Do we want to create a situation where a large organisation working in the area of children's rights would be allowed to raise charitable funds to feed children but would not be allowed to raise charitable funds to raise its public concern about the extent to which children are bound to be in poverty because of the policies of the State?  I do not think anybody would like to see this either.<\/p> <p>  On the international stage Ireland has, and we should be very proud of this, a very strong record of defending civil society, charities and non-governmental organisations in countries where they have been suppressed for political action.  Recently, for example, the Irish Government played a very strong role in defending civil society in Israel where the Israeli Government sought to shut down organisations, some of which are partly funded by Irish Aid and the Irish Government.  We had an instance recently when one of the largest Irish aid organisations had a fundraising campaign in this jurisdiction because it was concerned about the human rights of people living in the territory of Israel.  Complaints were raised that it was an overtly political campaign and not a charitable campaign.  We would say that if Irish aid agencies that deliver services on the ground in Gaza feel that, to advance protection of the human rights of the people with whom they work, they need to provide not just food and medicine but to raise political concerns, then they are best placed to make that judgment and not a regulatory body here and certainly not individual political opponents in this jurisdiction who might wish to use the Charities Regulator and the complaints mechanism to cause harm and embarrassment to the aid agencies of which we are so proud.<\/p> <p>  Our view is we should focus on the very narrow range of activity that is electoral and not limit charities.  For example, if the regulator very clearly stated that, if I am raising money for children's rights, I should use that money only for children's rights, and if I were not allowed to engage in political advocacy on behalf of children and was only allowed to provide books and food to children, this would be a very Victorian and limited understanding of what charity means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":1382,"content":"<p>I want to continue to play devil's advocate.

Is there a danger that people who give &euro;500 to my charity could state it was only to feed children and that they did not see that advocacy was included in the charity's constitution?  Perhaps a better example is my charity deciding to spend the entire &euro;500 on advocacy and not on food and books for the children.  Is it entirely up to an organisation itself to decide where the &euro;500 goes once its constitution covers advocacy and feeding children and providing books?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#L00300","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1383,"content":"<p>The regulator was very strong on this.

There cannot be a gap between what an organisation promises its donors it does and what it does in reality.  There can be no question of this.  If a charity were to fundraise and state every euro given is for purpose A, it should use the money for purpose A.  This is the territory in which the Charities Regulator is properly concerned.  It is to make sure there is good practice, transparency and accountability.  We do not feel it should be properly concerned with deciding who can engage in campaigning and who cannot.

Mr. Herrick spoke about the difference in wording between a body being exclusively to promote a political cause versus being primarily to promote a political cause.  The vast majority of members of the Green Party progressed from a background of environmental activism and they do not leave this at the door when they enter the party.  The vast majority of members of the party, and the vast majority of the elected members of the party, are still involved in environmental activism to some extent.

We are certainly primarily to promote a political cause but I do not know whether all of our actions are exclusively directed towards a political end point in terms of electoral results.

I think everybody understands this point and that elected representatives, who hold the power that people in these Houses do, have different obligations and considerations than those of us outside of that who have no power in making laws, except in the context of trying to engage and to provide information to elected representatives.  I think that is a clear distinction.<\/p> <p>  If we try to get into a subjective analysis of what are the goals of Friends of the Earth or the Green Party, for example, we will find that all the parties represented in these Houses have goals and objectives that are matters of principle and public good, whether those involve the protection of the environment and-or workers' rights, achieving a greater sense of reconciliation between people in both parts of the island or to build stronger communities.  There will, of course, be strong overlaps between the goals of political parties and those of charities and community organisations.  If we put a regulatory body in the business of evaluating those various goals, I think we will have significant difficulties.  The political system should be regulated in a political way.  The Charities Regulator should be concerned with ensuring, in the context that the law says what is a charitable objective, whether people are keeping themselves within those parameters.  The regulator was very helpful in saying that if the law defines what is a charitable objective, whether it involves poverty, human rights, religion, sport or whatever it might be, the task of the office is to ensure that bodies are staying within that remit.  This would be the only concern of the office.  It would not be concerned with whether a choice is made to campaign or to write a letter to a Deputy because this would not be the proper remit of the Charities Regulator. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022100500002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":1387,"content":"<p>Very good, that makes sense.

If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to any person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are also reminded of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit them to take part where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Given the technical difficulties we are having today, we have to ask committee members to attend this meeting in person today.  I am sorry for any inconvenience caused.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any members participating via MS Teams to confirm that they are on the grounds of Leinster House campus prior to making a contribution.  Obviously that does not apply currently because MS Teams has been disabled to enable the meeting to proceed but if the remote system comes back, members must confirm that they are within the precincts of Leinster House.  If attending in the committee room, members are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  As you can see Ms Embleton, we have had our own IT failures today but hopefully they are temporary in nature.  In that spirit, I ask you to make your opening statement on behalf of Aer Lingus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022100500002#B00100","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1398,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting to give the committee an update on what happened on 10 September when we had a systems outage that significantly impacted Aer Lingus operational and customer systems.  It is important to state that major IT issues causing significant disruption to our customers have not been typical in Aer Lingus.  This case was truly exceptional.  We have had very few customer-facing IT outages over the last five years, and nothing on the scale or with the impact that was experienced on Saturday, 10 September 2022, but we did face significant issues on that date.  For almost ten hours, we had no access to our core operational and customer systems.  We could not check in or board customers, access mandatory flight information, access data on customer bookings or access customer contact information.  This meant we had very limited ability to communicate with our customers and provide the service and information we know they needed.<\/p> <p>  What caused the issue that weekend?  Aer Lingus has a contract with a leading cloud services provider to host the network and infrastructure behind our core operational and customer system.  Its Internet services provider in the UK had a major failure in its network on that day.  Early that Saturday morning, unrelated construction works damaged one of the fibre optic cables which provided connection to our systems.  The cable was not repaired until 5.30 p.m. that day.  The damage occurred just after 8 a.m. but it was not until 5.30 p.m. that our systems began to come back online.  The key question we asked our supplier was what happened to the backup, which should have kicked in and supported our systems and avoided the impact that we saw.  The answer to that question was that, unfortunately, a component in the backup system also failed that day.  This should not have happened and was exceptional in nature.  The two issues were unrelated.  Our supplier has apologised for both the break in the main connection and for the failure in the backup.  Both have now been fixed and measures have been put in place which should prevent an outage of this type ever happening again.<\/p> <p>  We are very conscious of the impact that this disruption had on our customers.  Our people at Aer Lingus made huge efforts on the day to look after customers in what were very difficult circumstances.  I apologise again to our customers and thank our staff as their efforts made a real difference in helping to reduce the impact of the outage on our customers.  We increased the number of call centre agents available to support our customers.  However, due to the scale of the disruption, call wait times were inevitably longer in the immediate aftermath of the outage.  Hotel accommodation was offered to our customers at most airports and those who secured their own accommodation are being reimbursed accordingly.  We added extra resources to rebook customers and reunite them with their bags and we have been processing applications for refunds, expenses and compensation. <\/p> <p>  Aer Lingus has sincerely apologised for the severe disruption caused.  We have written directly to our customers about the system outage and its impacts and also thanked them for their patience and understanding over the course of the disruption.  I hope this statement gives members of the committee context and I am happy to take questions from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022100500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lynne Embleton"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":1399,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Embleton.

Obviously when an event of this magnitude happens, questions are asked as to why and how it happened, whether it could have been avoided and what needs to be done to avoid a recurrence.  What stands out about this incident is that Aer Lingus, as with all other airlines, is so reliant on technology.  It needs IT for booking, boarding cards and baggage.  Everything relies on technology.  When I read the company's explanation, the first question that sprang to mind was why an Irish-based company is reliant on a UK company for the provision of Internet and cloud technology.  Do we not have the capability here in Ireland in this area?  It seems to me that the Aer Lingus supplier was doubly at fault.  One can excuse a system going down but for the backup system to fail at the same time is just not acceptable.  One would expect that a company the size of Aer Lingus with such a reliance on technology would be insisting on a multilayered backup system to ensure this does not happen.<\/p> <p>  As it happens, I came through Dublin Airport on the afternoon of 10 September.  The first thing that struck me was that the terminal was absolutely jam packed but when I went outside, I was absolutely gobsmacked to see the mass of people everywhere.  They were all across the concourse and there was a queue that stretched almost as far as the Radisson Blu Hotel.<\/p><p>The trail of people reaching all over the perimeter of the concourse was an incredible sight.  People called me and asked me what was happening.  I did not know what had happened but it was obvious to me that nobody seemed to know what happened and there were stewards but they did not have any information.  People had no clue what was going on.  They had no idea what had gone wrong, when issues would be fixed or whether people were going to get through the airport on that day.  At that stage, because of the lack of communication, people were angry and frustrated.  Some people were hungry because they had been at the airport since early morning and could not get into the terminal.<\/p><p> In general, from what I gathered having listened to people, communications at first were at zero, then there was limited engagement and eventually Aer Lingus customers got the disturbing news through national media that all flights had been cancelled.  It would nothing short of a PR disaster for Aer Lingus and costly in terms of the reputational damage that has been at home and abroad.  My concern today is for the people who have been affected.  The disruption of people's travel plans had enormous consequences with deadlines being missed, reunions and family occasions being spoiled, baggage going missing, and when people tried to get hotel accommodation, the city was very busy and, therefore, it was nearly impossible to get accommodation.  Finally, when people went to rebook it took many days and even weeks for rebookings to be organised.  The response by Aer Lingus to bookings was sluggish to say the least.<\/p><p> Overall, for the people involved that day, they had a nightmarish experience and it was a shambles from the perspective of Aer Lingus.  How many people were affected?  How many people were impacted?  Why did it take so long to react to the problem?  What is the estimated cost of compensatory payments?  Has compensation been concluded or are there still outstanding issues to be dealt with from the perspective of the consumer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022100500002#B00400","speaker":"1609","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1402,"content":"<p>Let me start with the questions.  Mr. Moriarty will comment on the hosting of the IT services and Ms Carberry will comment on refunds.<\/p> <p>  The experience described by the Deputy about what it was like on that Saturday I recognise.  There were thousands of customers impacted where we simply could not process them, we could not move them, we could not depart flights and there were thousands of customers caught up in that both outside the terminal, inside the terminal and airside as well so people who had gone through the system but then we could not depart them.  The scale of disruption was phenomenal and this is why we are saying that this was a really exceptional event.<\/p> <p>  What I also recognise in what the Deputy said is the information about when the problem would be fixed and when could flights depart.  We felt the same.  We did not know when it was fixed.  We were in constant contact with our IT provider to understand what the issue was and how quickly it could be resolved.  Throughout the day we had moving updates as to when we may get the systems back up and running but until we had the systems back, we were unable to give any real certainty.  What did become clear is we needed to cancel flights in the afternoon because we physically would not have been able, even if the systems came back, to get all of the day's flights up in the air in that time.  It was, undoubtedly, a really difficult day for customers and, again, for our staff.  It was an uncomfortable day all round.<\/p> <p>  On the questions about why this happened from an IT perspective and whether should this have happened, it should not have happened.  Indeed, the contract that we have with our supplier was for this not to happen and for there to be a robust backup solution.  We have two incidences of our system and two pathways to those to give us resilience so it should not have happened.  As the Deputy alluded to, one was damage to a cable by a company that was operating in the area and the other was a card failure in the backup system, which was a failure that they had not seen in 4,000 instances of using that card.  The two things coming together was just highly unusual. <\/p> <p>  Mr. Moriarty will comment on the IT set-up and the supply stream.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022100500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lynne Embleton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1403,"content":"<p>On the location of the services in the UK, we locate our cloud data centres in accordance with best practice for the particular IT system in question so the particular IT system that supported.  The recognised best practice across the industry, and it is Aer Lingus's strategy, is to migrate systems hosting to cloud data centres to improve performance, stability, security and sustainability.  They are the four things that are generally improved by that.<\/p> <p>  The best practice location for the hosting of the Aer Lingus reservation system is in the UK.  The expertise to cloud host this system is not currently available in Ireland so the UK is the best location.  Having said that, we host many other applications and systems in cloud data centres in multiple locations, including in Ireland but just not this not this particular system.  That is the rational from a best practice perspective as to why it is located in the UK.  To give a greater context of industry best practice, management and protection of what are increasingly complex IT infrastructure systems and estates, they are increasingly being met by providers who have particular expertise in supporting and the maintenance of those systems.  We have selected a top-tier provider to provide that service and that expertise happens to be currently located in the UK.<\/p> <p>  As the CEO mentioned, the outage was a truly exceptional set of circumstances.  What happened, obviously in terms of the first line, was the fibre optic cable was broken due to construction work at a particular site in the UK and that took down the primary line.  The secondary line, which is the fail-over or the backup line, also failed due to an entirely unrelated issue, which was a failure of a backup card.  As the CEO mentioned, that was a truly extraordinary event for that coincidence to happen.  In terms of addressing that issue, the backup card has been replaced.  There is a new monitoring system in place to ensure that what happened on 10 September cannot happen again.  It is extremely unlikely that an event or sequence of events as happened on 10 September can happen again.  Further than that, we are now looking at introducing additional redundancy in order to protect our systems by having a tertiary system so a second fail-over or backup to provide additional security.  We expect that that would never be required because we do not believe that a set of circumstances will arise again where both the primary and secondary lines would fail but we are looking to put that in place to provide that additional assurance to prevent an outage of this type every happening again. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022100500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Moriarty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1404,"content":"<p>Ms Carberry will comment on refunds and rebookings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022100500002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Lynne Embleton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1405,"content":"<p>From a refunds and rebookings perspective, at about 9 o'clock on Saturday night, once our systems were again available, we communicated to all passengers that they had the ability to rebook their flight or apply for a refund.

The decision was for the company to determine, but I examined a number of contracts, particularly those of people who joined Aer Lingus in the late 1980s and 1990s.

In terms of the Shannon cabin crew base specifically, the approximately 90 cabin crew who were located there were offered three choices, namely, to relocate to Dublin or to Cork or to take voluntary severance.  All of their individual choices were accommodated.  No one was forced to make a particular choice.  There was no compulsory redundancy in Aer Lingus throughout Covid.

In most work environments, however, if there are jobs to be shed, it is last in, first out.  It is a real bugbear for people who work for Aer Lingus that some staff who had joined the workforce of Aer Lingus in winter of 2019 held their jobs whereas other employees at Shannon who had 25 or 30 years of service, or more, and were among the most senior in the organisation, were given the three choices outlined by Mr. Moriarty.  Yes, they had a choice and there was no compulsion but there was an inherent compulsion, certainly during the Covid pandemic when people were trying to put bread on the table and pay their mortgage.

In that context, if one looks more broadly, Aer Lingus has actually fared really well this summer.  At the peak of our cancellations, which was when we most recently appeared before the committee, we were cancelling almost 2% of our schedule.

Beyond that period, our cancellation rate is significantly ahead of most European carriers and our punctuality has been ahead of most European carriers and, indeed, ahead of Ryanair here in Dublin.

All industry participants - airlines - participate in that process.  The process leads to a reasonably robust exchange between the regulator, the airport and the airlines, which is to be expected and is probably appropriate.  In that context, we have discussions and views on the development of infrastructure at Dublin Airport.  The opening of the new northern runway in August was very welcome in that it is a key piece of infrastructure for the airport and the country but more infrastructure is required.  As Mr. O'Neill mentioned, a new pier, stands and airport infrastructure are required to service that new runway.  Aer Lingus is concerned that such infrastructure is not planned to be delivered quickly enough.  The current capital expenditure programme of Dublin Airport sees that infrastructure primarily coming on stream in 2029-2030, which we believe is too late.  Inevitably, that difference of opinion creates some challenges and tensions but, as Mr. O'Neill has said, on an operational level we work very well with Dublin Airport.  The DAA supported us hugely in the context of 10 September.

There is what we call the point-to-point demand, which is local demand from city to city, and away from a hub, it is the size of that point-to-point demand that determines whether a route is going to be viable.  It needs to be viable on a year-round basis generally if we are going to invest in an aeroplane.  What is different in hub economics is there is the point-to-point market, which might be smaller than the whole aircraft.  As I said, we have just announced Cleveland as a new route.  Dublin to Cleveland traffic itself would not justify a whole aircraft, but we are the only carrier flying between Cleveland and Europe, and therefore what the hub gives is that breadth of destinations to take a few passengers from all the different cities, and if they are gathered up and all channelled onto the long-haul aircraft, a service can be sustained.  Hub dynamics are very different and it can be seen across global aviation.  Hubs play a very powerful role in the development of aviation, but that said, there is still a role for point-to-point direct traffic when the local market justifies it.  We look at both but certainly it is easier to justify expansion from a hub because of this effect of connecting traffic on top of the point-to-point traffic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022100500002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Lynne Embleton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1657,"content":"<p>To add to that, we will fully participate in the national aviation policy review and reformulation, but on the point we made earlier about Dublin Airport and the development of infrastructure there, the hub Ms Embleton was referring to is dependent upon that full suite of infrastructure being put in place; not just the runway but the pier and the stands.  That is what enables the traffic growth and what delivers that new route network, not just in Aer Lingus but through other airlines.  We are certainly reliant upon that for the development of our growth strategy across the north Atlantic.  We have shown before that this will deliver very strongly from a national economic perspective in terms of the value that is driven to the Irish economy through foreign direct investment and others, but it is critical that the infrastructure is put in place to support that development and growth.

We have not met in person so I wish her well in her role as CEO.<\/p> <p>  I flew Aer Lingus at the weekend and it was very good, as per usual.  I want to continue on a couple of issues that were teased out in the last few rounds of questioning.  This is the potential future disruption to services in and out of Dublin Airport, disruption which already has done catastrophic damage to the reputation of the DAA in terms of what happened earlier this year with the rapid return to air travel three years ahead of what had been forecasted, and where that leaves Aer Lingus.  Mr. Moriarty made many references to the development of that hub infrastructure, and while I have a relative understanding of it, what concerns me is, looking at Dublin Airport as it stands, at its 2019 passenger levels, the airport was close to its maximum operating capacity.  Terminal 1, as far as I am concerned, is a kip in comparison with many airport terminals I have used this summer throughout Europe and farther afield.  It is extremely uncomfortable from a passenger point of view, and what is even more uncomfortable is the fact there is no plan by the Dublin Airport Authority to put any investment of note into it for it to be a positive passenger experience once a passenger goes over to the airside operations.  I know Terminal 2 is more of a concern for Aer Lingus.<\/p> <p>  Without referring to the aviation policy review that is going on at the moment, because that is one of those many instruments of delaying investment, I want to get an idea - brass tacks - from Aer Lingus of what it wants to ensure the business can grow in the next five to ten years.  That is what we need to hear.  Is it a case of relocating?  One example is if the maintenance hangars in Dublin Airport were relocated to Shannon.  That could provide huge numbers jobs for the west and free up all that space on the northern runway for new terminal infrastructure.  Would the witnesses relocate to the south of the airfield in Dublin Airport the An Post services that are currently taking up a lot of potential expansion space for Terminal 2?  Will the Aer Lingus representatives give committee members some square answers as to what they think could be done there?  That would be very helpful from our point of view when we are discussing these issues with Government and with the Minister of State with responsibility for aviation.  Some direct answers would be very helpful.  I say that because we are in an interesting space where we are replacing the head of the DAA, which will have significant consequences for aviation in this country.  Now is the time to be making the position of the airline clear in terms of what it wants before the new incumbent DAA CEO is appointed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022100500002#K01300","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1661,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Moriarty to comment on some of the specifics we feel we need around the airport.  First, however, I echo what the Deputy has said.  We want to grow, and that requires a functioning airport.  A runway is one step, but adding movements to the airport without adding the subsequent infrastructure is just going to make the operational challenges more difficult, not easier.  For the airport to be functioning, we need appropriate screening, stands and space for the ground equipment to be stored and moved around.  It is a multifaceted requirement to get an airport that truly functions and enables the growth at a level of operational performance we want to give to our customers.  We share the concern that if we grow the headline number of movements - take off and landing at Dublin - without providing the infrastructure in a timely manner, there is a risk that the customer experience at the airport deteriorates rather than gets better.  That is why we are engaging with the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, on that process but we see it at almost every pinch point across the airport, where we believe more is needed in terms of infrastructure, readiness and an airworthiness review certificate, ARC, and a list of requirements is being worked on across operations and our network planning team.<\/p><p>Does Mr. Moriarty wish to add something?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022100500002#K01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Lynne Embleton","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":1663,"content":"<p>To be specific, Dublin Airport's capital investment programme contains the infrastructure that Aer Lingus requires.

I appreciate and congratulate Aer Lingus on the Manchester and Cleveland routes but I do not see any evidence of growth or a willingness to grow.  The witnesses have admitted that the short-haul fleet has reduced greatly.  Aer Lingus's footprint has been hugely diminished.  We can compare it to Ryanair.

As we have mentioned, we had 37 directly operated or owned aircraft and it reduced to 31.  Recently this was increased to 33 with the arrival of two A320neo in the past two weeks.  The scale of our fleet has reduced significantly and, therefore, what we have to do as a commercial business is to deploy this fleet most efficiently and most effectively.  Earlier we touched on how Dublin Airport is very important to Aer Lingus because of the connecting flow of traffic and it being a hub.  Many of our short-haul services into Dublin are not just point-to-point but provide connecting traffic onto our long-haul service.  As Ms Embleton outlined earlier, we are growing our long-haul services.  We announced a new route last week and there will be more to come in this regard.

I thank the Aer Lingus officials.  I made them repeat themselves but now I at least have it clear in my head, at the same time as I should be in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  I have one last point.  When people talk about regional airports, it is thrown back on the airline.  A number of witnesses who have appeared before us have said that until such time as what people term \"national strategy\" or \"State strategy\" changes, there will not be any major change.  I mean that in the sense that if Dublin Airport loses slots, it loses them to Munich or wherever else.  The regional airports will not be players until the Government changes the nature of how the system operates.  Is that fair to say?  We can talk forever about Shannon Airport and Cork Airport, etc., but they are never going to be employed as part of a wider solution alongside Dublin Airport until a determination is made at governmental level.  I am just asking for the Aer Lingus officials' view.

The role of a hub is different.  It is a big home market bringing connecting traffic to enable more routes.  It is kind of an exponential effect.  We should be proud of the Dublin hub and should be doing everything we can to grow it and its infrastructure.  I do not see that as competing directly with the regional airports.  It is about the regional airports having the demand to justify point-to-point services, and then you have to find aircraft year-round and not just for the three months of the summer peak, which is something else we discussed earlier.  As we discussed earlier, it is about whether that is something that Emerald Airlines would want to operate in its own right with a small aircraft, or if the point-to-point demand is large enough for the jets to operate.
