I thank the committee for its invitation.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Brendan McVeigh and Ms Sin&eacute;ad Reynolds from the Department of Finance.<br\/><br\/>International standards in respect of anti-money laundering are set and monitored by the Financial Action Task Force, FATF.  FATF is an intergovernmental body with 39 members, including Ireland, and a large number of observers and associate members.  Over 200 countries commit to implementing its standards.<br\/><br\/>EU standards generally reflect those of FATF and are currently set out in the fourth anti-money laundering directive of 2015, as updated by the fifth directive in 2018.  Ireland is bound by these directives and implements them through the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  That Act has been amended several times, most recently in 2021.<br\/><br\/>A politically exposed person, PEP, is defined by FATF as &quot;an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function&quot;.  FATF states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDue to their position and influence, it is recognised that many PEPs are in positions that potentially can be abused for the purpose of committing money laundering (ML) offences and related predicate offences, including corruption and bribery, as well as conducting activity related to terrorist financing. <\/blockquote> <p>FATF emphasises that PEP status is intended to apply higher vigilance rather than suggesting that individuals are involved in suspicious activity.<br\/><br\/>FATF first issued requirements covering foreign PEPs and their family members and close associates in 2003.  In 2012 FATF expanded these requirements to domestic PEPs in line with the United Nations Convention against Corruption.<br\/><br\/>EU requirements for PEPs are now set out in Articles 20 to 23 of the fourth directive, which broadened the application of the EU regime to include domestic PEPs.  It came into force in Ireland in 2018.  The definition of &quot;politically exposed person&quot; in the directive specifies several categories of PEP, including, for example, Heads of State, members of parliament, members of the governing bodies of political parties, supreme court judges, ambassadors and others.  This definition is open: while the categories stated must be included, other persons may also be included on the basis of their holding a prominent public function.<br\/><br\/>Relevant entities - for example, financial institutions - are then obliged, first, to have in place appropriate procedures to determine whether a customer or the beneficial owner of the customer is a PEP and, second, to apply enhanced due diligence to business relationships with PEPs, including obtaining senior management approval for establishing or continuing business relationships; taking adequate measures to establish the source of wealth and source of funds involved in relationships or transactions; and conducting enhanced ongoing monitoring of those business relationships.  These measures also apply to family members or persons known to be close associates of politically exposed persons.<br\/><br\/>The Central Bank of Ireland publishes guidance on PEPs for financial institutions.  This guidance is available on the Central Bank's website.  Notably, it provides:<\/p> <blockquote> \tFirms should take adequate measures to establish the source of wealth and source of funds which are to be used in the business relationship in order to satisfy themselves that they do not handle the proceeds of corruption or other criminal activity.<br \/><br \/>The measures which Firms should take to establish a PEP's source of wealth and source of funds will depend on the degree of risk associated with the business relationship.  Firms should verify the source of wealth and the source of funds based on reliable and independent data, documents or information.<br \/><br \/>When determining the source of wealth and source of funds, Firms should, at least consider:<br \/><br \/>- The activities that have generated the total net worth of the customer ...; and<br \/><br \/>- The origin and the means of transfer for funds that are involved in the transaction. <\/blockquote> <p>In July 2021 the European Commission published a detailed legislative proposal to replace the fourth directive.  That proposal includes replacing the existing directive-based system with a combination of directives and regulations, with a &quot;single rulebook&quot; implemented via a regulation which would be directly applicable across the European Union.  That rulebook would largely supersede the national provisions I have set out, which are likely to be repealed as part of the transposition.  A new European Union authority, the anti-money laundering authority, AMLA, would lead AML regulation across the bloc.  The package remains under negotiation and is handled at ECOFIN.  Colleagues in the Department of Finance lead on those negotiations and can address questions the committee may have about the broader package.  While the package itself is very substantial and will significantly affect how AML regulation is implemented, the specific requirements set out on PEPs in Articles 32 to 36 of the proposed regulation, as published, are broadly similar to those currently in place.  AMLA is tasked with issuing guidelines on assessing the levels of risk associated with particular categories of politically exposed persons, their family members or persons known to be close associates.<br\/><br\/>The regulation also reaffirms that the requirements relating to PEPs and their family members and close associates are of a preventative, not criminal, nature and should not be interpreted as stigmatising PEPs as being involved in criminal activity.  Refusing a business relationship with a person simply on the basis of his or her being identified as a PEP would clearly be contrary to the spirit of the regime.<br\/><br\/>I am conscious that, with the time available, I have only scratched the surface.  I am, of course, happy to answer members' queries in more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022100500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Bruen"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for coming before the committee.

We can become very focused on whether someone falls into a PEP bracket or not.

The risk associated with the person should then be identified and further due diligence measures taken, if necessary.<\/p> <p>  On the guidance on this, provision 37(12) was actually added in the 2021 legislation.

Just this morning, in an experts group meeting, the Commission let us all know that the 27 member states have now come back with their own lists, guidelines and views on what a PEP is.  The Commission had hoped to do that job earlier as part of the new package and rule book.  They had hoped to consolidate lists across member states to provide pan-European guidance on what a PEP is, but it has not done it yet.  The Commission told us this morning that it is now in the process of doing that.  It has admitted that it has been a very difficult process.  Different member states have different views about what a PEP is and what an associate of a PEP is, but it is there now.  The next step will be for the Commission to analyse that and then, under the directives, namely Article 28, I think, endorse it and give its view on what a PEP is, based on the feedback from member states.

There is no question about it - we have raised this repeatedly at EU level and we have regular discussions with the bank about it - but it is virtually impossible to screen adequately for crypto transfers.  By its very nature crytpo is not supposed to indicate that anything is particularly secretive, but it is meant to indicate that it is confidential.  That is the distinction that those who trade in crypto try to make.  That means that by its nature it is difficult to regulate.

Never mind shell companies; it is something as simple at that.  To try to understand who is the beneficial owner of that trust is difficult.  Anyone who benefits from that tea club is a beneficial owner.  Many trusts are established in Ireland, and in common law countries in particular, unknown to the trustees at that, it is a significant fly in the ointment of the BO framework.

There is going to be that when it comes to transposition.  The only time transposition comes into play anyway is with a directive and the PEPs will be in a regulation, actually, so there will be no discretion with it.  There is flexibility with the transposition of a directive, as I am sure the Chairman knows.  There might be something that sets out why a given member state, including Ireland, would transpose in a certain way but as I said, that is a negotiation itself in the development of the directive itself.  I can only speak from Ireland's point of view and from my time being involved in this, but there may be something particularly controversial we think Ireland is going to have to get into a big compromise on, like for instance when we were pushing very hard back with the Commission in development of the trusts beneficial ownership framework.  We pushed extremely hard at the highest levels of the Commission to get something in place there that would suit Ireland.

I have had Members of the Houses come to me to say their staff, their children have gone for loans and mortgages in the normal practice of day-to-day life and once it is discovered they are a PEP, they are then put through a different approval process.<\/p><p>They feel that is highly invasive to their children's lives and I can understand that.  Other Members have come to me to say that in transferring money from a regular account into a current account, the transaction is often held up because the financial institution is trying to get in touch with the PEP.  There is a clear question as to where they got the money but it might be part of their salary being transferred to their current account.  While they are waiting for that to happen, particularly in these times of financial pressures, their direct debits may be stopped and all sorts of things may happen.<\/p><p> The consequences of the actions taken by civil servants and politicians in regard to the politically exposed person issue trickle down to family members and people who do not even consider themselves associates of a PEP.  It is causing an awful lot of difficulty for families.  It may be a civil servant whose son or daughter applies for a mortgage and suddenly has to fill out another 20 pages.  There is also the grey area, which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan referred to, whereby there is not enough definition of what a PEP is, what the Central Bank should do or how it should be interpreted down the line at the coalface.  There are consequences of this for Ireland and, as Ms McVeigh rightly said, this is a small country and we all will be PEPs.  It is strangling the ability of ordinary family members going about their lives in a normal, standard way, without feeling they are some sort of criminal or that there is some doubt about their character.<\/p><p> I accept why Ms McVeigh made the point she did - it was made for perfectly legitimate reasons - but we should not drag all those people into this, where they do not want to be.  They do not want to be near politics.  They have a regular life, and it has been irregularised by virtue of the fact they are impacted on by this type of legislation.  It is my concern that, in some way, they should be separate.  I am talking about people who have absolutely no worries.  They are not concerned about anything and they just want to get on with their life.  They probably despise the fact a member of their family is a politician and would like to distance themselves a little bit from it.  That is a fact in Irish life.  Those family members will then say, \"Look at what you got me into here; I have another 20 pages to fill out.\"  Surely at ministerial level or high Civil Service level, there has to be an injection of common sense into the thought process on this before we all get strangled in something unintentionally, but that is what is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022100500002#F03700","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664924400,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Originally, this was a directive but it will become a regulation.

I accept all that - in fact, I would want it - but I do not believe it should extend to my family members, and there are others who feel the same.<\/p> <p>  Is a drug dealer a politically exposed person?

Officials know my son and daughter but they do not know the drug dealer.  It is weighted in such a way that makes it very strange for those who come under the legislation or the EU directive to accept it.  I do not accept it.  I accept the principle of what our guests are trying to do but I do not accept the way this is being addressed.<\/p><p>I am asking you as the officials who are central to this within the EU - and I am taking it up politically with the Minister - to look at this or give voice to the concern of honest individuals who are in parliaments everywhere.  This is a further indication to those who cynically look at politicians and say they must be up to something because they are being dealt with under the money laundering and terrorist financing Act.  The Department official said earlier that it is not meant to do that.  This, however, is the consequence and this is what happens.<\/p><p> I have been a practising politician for a long time.  I am annoyed with the EU and the way it is doing this.  I am annoyed with our own MEPs because when I put it to them they said that they did not vote for it, when actually they did.  They did not even know that they did.  The sad thing about it is how all of these different EU directives find their way into Irish legislation without the due diligence of public representatives.  I not blaming the officials but I am just interested in this whole position.  I recall a very senior politician taking me to task in this House over what I had said about how politically exposed persons were being treated.  He told me I was wrong.  In fact, not only was I right, but it has since been compounded by other missiles that come in our direction from the European Union on this issue.  As I said, I will take it up politically.  These are the reasons the departmental officials are here - not to hold them to account, but simply for me to get to where this began, how it is all coming into operation and why it is like this.<\/p><p> I saw an article recently from a particular part of the financial sector that was giving its interpretation of what a politically exposed person is and what should be done.  If I were to boil it down, I would say that the article said to be careful, to treat all of them with suspicion and, if they are politically exposed persons, to examine them at every quarter and make sure they are okay.  When one goes into one's local credit union for a loan, it is not dealt with by the credit committee - it is dealt with by the board.  One does not have to fill out one sheet; one must fill out 20 sheets.  This is the consequence of the decisions that are being made over there.  I want to catch the baddies just as much as the officials who are present do.  I want to take the risk out of the financial institutions just as much as they do.  I want to see those institutions scrutinised, perhaps a lot more than the officials do.  I want to see them put in their place.  At the same time, I do not believe that those of us who represent the public should be treated like this.  I do not believe that family members should have to bear the consequences of their family member being a politically exposed person, a civil servant or whatever it might be.  We have to be careful about these things.  I am delighted that the officials are here before the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022100500002#G01900","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I agree entirely with the Chairman.  I was one of the first people in this House to take issue with this directive.  Other colleagues at the time said they did not know about this directive.  They did not know about it, but it is there.  I find it unfair because those who fall into this category, such as politicians and their families and associates, are treated more stringently and aggressively than a person who is not deemed to be politically exposed although he or she may be interested in politics as well.  What kind of politics can one be associated with without being accused of being politically exposed?  Are there any such politics?  I assume the answer is \"No\".<\/p> <p>  I presume that the financial institutions, as the Chairman has said, have a lot of control now and by comparison the political institutions do not have as much.  As time follows, the political institutions are on a losing game and the financial institutions are gaining.  I do not accept that and I will always fight against it, as the Chairman has done.  I opposed it from the beginning.  There are people who did not know they were voting in favour of it.  It is a weakness of the European Union that legislation can be introduced in this fashion without some discussion beforehand and without some way of seeing if it complies with our Constitution.  The basis of our Constitution is that everybody is innocent until proven guilty.  In this particular case, however, all of those who are politically exposed are potentially guilty and must prove their innocence.  This is in stark variation with our Constitution.  I believe this must be dealt with at a much higher level.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that the officials have said that the European courts can deal with this and have dealt with this, and that they have dealt with a lot of other extreme cases also.  It would appear that a citizen of this State who happens to be a public representative will be under suspicion no matter what happens - the Chairman has referred to this, quite correctly - and a person who is a relative, a friend or an associate of a public representative is on to something as well.  That kind of allegation has often been made around the House, as we know, when one party or another wants to land a slur on somebody else.  The matter under discussion today, however, is in the real world.  To presume that we are potentially guilty of something is, to my mind, a violation of our rights and a handing over of citizens' rights to financial institutions.  I do not need to be encouraged to talk about financial institutions because, like the Chairman, I have engaged with and opposed many of them.  Some of them are good to deal with and some of them are not.  Some of them are secretive.  Some of them ignore public representatives, some of them challenge public representatives, and some of them clearly indicate that they do not give a damn about public representatives.  They are their own bosses, and they are quite happy in that position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022100500002#H00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Is there a question, Deputy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022100500002#H00300","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I will be happy to hear a response to my outburst.  It is not something I oppose lightly.  I opposed it from the beginning.  Family members opposed it too.  They feel that they should not be accused because somebody in a high vaulted tower accuses me, for example.  I do not encourage and I do not involve myself in any kind of financial manipulation.  If anyone wants to accuse me of that, let them come forward or leave it.<\/p> <p>  On the question, I accept what the officials are saying with regard to the reasons for it.  There are reasons for everything and there are ways and means of dealing with issues.  Like the Chairman, I do not happen to agree with the application of this particular rule as it is, just as I did not agree with the GDPR.  I opposed that from the beginning on the basis that I was an elected public representative, elected by the people in a way that does not apply in most other EU countries, which is the single transferable vote.  This does not require me getting permission from anybody to rise on their behalf or against them.  There is a distinct difference in the way governments and people look at this in other countries.  In other countries there are people who hold public office who are never elected anywhere.  They could be associates of anything.  They were never elected anywhere by anybody.  They now have the same powers that we have.  By \"we\", I mean elected public representatives.  They do not have to admit anything, they do not have to do anything, and they just serve their time.  Some of them get into some funny scrapes from time to time.  Do not forget, however, that they were never elected.<\/p><p>In the heel of the hunt I would like more of an explanation as to why it is thought that politicians have to be treated in a different way as politically exposed.  Lots of other people are politically exposed by virtue of whom they associate with one way or another.

I have been lucky that I have not had to experience it yet.  I have not had to do anything with my bank in quite a while other than day-to-day business, but I do hear from colleagues who are experiencing this pain so I do get it.  I also hear from EU colleagues that this is a pain felt everywhere.  There has been consensus across the EU that this is necessary to protect the integrity of the financial system and, indeed, the broader economies of member states.  The Deputy has inferred several times maybe that directives are reached in a somewhat obscure way but they are not.  I have said repeatedly, and I have also said it in relation to FATF.  We get mandates from the elected Minister regarding any controversial measures that are going into directives, and we are open to scrutiny by the Parliament here to come in and discuss anything in a draft directive or draft package of any nature.  Ultimately, it is elected representatives in the European Parliament who sign off on these directives, who signed off on the previous five AML directives, and who will be involved in the sign-off for the new package and new rule book, which is both directives and regulations. We deal with parliamentarians in Europe who are constantly asking what is this or that.  Commissioner McGuinness is very hands-on because with the Commission seat she holds she has a very strong interest in what is being developed in this package.

That is something that myself and others have referred to in the past.  They are strict and ruthless in the way they handle the powers and information they have over individuals.  That would be justified on the basis that they need to know what people are doing but nobody knows what the banks are doing.  When the financial crash came, nobody knew what they were doing until it dawned on us all and fell on our doorsteps all at the one time.  The very fact that they do not seem to be in need of any kind of scrutiny other than to be able to say that politicians are dangerous and could do all kinds of things, so they want to make sure that does not happen.  If anybody else does it, the lending institutions have been economic with the application of the rules that are there to protect customers.  The conclusion that I come to in that regard is a serious one, which is the fact that customers do not matter anymore.  Anything is justified in achieving their results.  I am increasingly concerned about the extent to which they are open and willing to discuss matters with public representatives acting on behalf of the public.  While some are happy to do so, a minority of institutions refuse to engage.  They give no information, have no address, and will facilitate no meetings.  They say, \"Send us the proposal and we will have a look at it\".  That is very old fashioned law and it does not apply here yet.  The EU should be cautious about allowing those kinds of things to happen because, ultimately, it can turn people against the EU, rightly or wrongly.  I have said my piece on this many times before.  I do not like secrecy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022100500002#K01500","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1664924400,"counter":275,"content":"<p>We have come to the end of our exchanges on this.
