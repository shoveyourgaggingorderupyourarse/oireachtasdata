However, I would like the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, to make an effort to come to the House in future.  In the previous Seanad, the attendance record of Ministers with particular briefs was very poor and we will be pushing for them to attend the House.  That is not a reflection on the Minister of State who is welcome.<\/p><p>My Commencement matter relates to the HPV vaccine.  The reason I raise this issue today is that for some years, there has been contention surrounding the vaccine, including misinformation and campaigns that have caused huge concern about it.  This has negatively impacted on uptake rates and the impact on disadvantaged communities has been much more significant than on other communities.  This could be for a number of reasons, including inadequate access to information and peer reviewed research and to professionals who could be asked appropriate questions on the safety of the HPV vaccine.  <\/p><p>I was surprised to learn in recent weeks that although we have a brilliant campaign and brilliant efforts and public messaging around the safety of the HPV vaccine, there is no scope for parents and children who change their minds and respond positively to that campaign to access the vaccine.  Children who do not get the vaccine in their first year at school are excluded from the vaccination process unless the fee of &euro;700 can be paid.  Disadvantaged communities have had the biggest drop in uptake of the HPV vaccine.  Should families respond positively to the public messaging and campaigns around the vaccine, they are basically excluded from a whole area of health and health equity, affecting their future health prospects.<\/p><p>In the 2019-20 academic year, the programme was extended to boys, which is a positive development.  However, I believe the length of time that boys receive the vaccine is much longer than in the case of girls.  A 2014 study in the <i>Irish Medical Journal<\/i>found that disadvantaged schools had a 6% lower mean uptake rate of the HPV vaccine than other schools and were twice as likely to have an uptake rate of below 50%.  The 2019 annual report of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre states that the national uptake of stage two of the HPV vaccination programme, which involves the completion of a two-dose course, was 64.1%, which is a slight increase on the 50% figure in the 2014 study.  <\/p><p>On receiving adequate information, some parents in my community, including some of my friends, approached the HSE and asked that their daughters receive the HPV vaccine along with first-year students.  These girls could be in third or fourth year, but the requests were refused.  The parents then approached their general practitioners and were told that because GPs do not stock the HPV vaccine, a &euro;700 fee would be payable in order to access the vaccine.  As Senators can imagine, not many families have &euro;700 to spare, particularly those in disadvantaged communities.  I would like the Minister to reassess this policy and create avenues that will allow parents who positively engage with the HPV programme to access the HPV vaccine for their children, free of charge, while they are still in second level education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#C00100","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.

The immunisation programme is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, NIAC.  The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to the Department of Health.  <\/p> <p>The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the pattern of disease.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frankie Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to he amended over time.  In 2009, the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, recommended HPV, or human papillomavirus, vaccination for all 12 to 13-year-old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  In 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in the first year of secondary school.  The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should be given to boys.  On foot of these recommendations, the Department of Health asked the Health Information and Quality Authority to undertake a health technology assessment to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school. <\/p><p>HIQA completed the health technology assessment in December 2018, which recommended the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.  A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  However, the HIQA reports published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for the following reason: vaccinating boys in first year of school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection and boys already benefit from indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.<\/p><p>The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases.  As the HPV vaccine is preventative, it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.  It is important to note that HPV vaccine has not been shown to have a therapeutic effect on existing infection or cervical lesions.  <\/p><p>The gender-neutral vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in the first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.  It should be noted that all vaccines administered through the school immunisation programme are provided free of charge.  The Department of Heath will continue to be guided by the NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence in the future.  <\/p><p>I have listened to what Senator Ruane has said about the brilliant safety campaign and to the fact that if people change their mind, they can be charged up to &euro;700 and what she says makes sense.

It would be great for that issue to be brought back to the Department.  The idea that the vaccine is most effective at the age of 12 or 13 is based, and I am open to correction on that, solely on the idea that any person after that age may become sexually active and would reduce the levels of impact.  That is based on assumption.  It seems that giving access beyond first year was more about cost-effectiveness rather than that the giving of the HPV vaccine at any age will have some effect.  This may be based on the inaccurate assumption that anyone who is looking for the vaccine beyond first year has become sexually active.<\/p> <p>I will be happy to further engage with the Ministers and the Department to remove the barriers so that when the campaigns do succeed in helping people to receive the proper information, it is not only those who are privileged enough who protect themselves against cervical cancer but that health equity should be for all.

It is fitting that we are here today to talk about access to contraception given that tomorrow, 26 September, is World Contraception Day.<\/p> <p>As the Minister is aware, a working group on access to contraception was established in April 2019 by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to consider the policy, regulatory and legislative issues relating to enhancing access to contraception following the recommendation of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  That working group produced a report almost 12 months ago.  The report identified various barriers to accessing contraception.  In particular, there are significant barriers relating to choice of contraception and accessing the most effective form of contraception.<\/p> <p>While the cost of delivering this universal free contraception was estimated by the group to be in the region of &euro;80 million to &euro;100 million a year, it emphasised that considerations which go beyond purely economic considerations needed to be taken into account when accessing this scheme.<\/p> <p>Provision of universal free contraception in particular negates the harmful consequences of crisis pregnancies.  Those harmful consequences would be avoided if universal free access to contraception was introduced in Ireland.  However, the working group outlined three alternatives to full universal access if that was the concern of the Government of the day.  First, a universal State-funded contraception scheme based on the GMS scheme but including the copper coil; second, the expansion of the GMS scheme as it relates to long-acting, reversible contraception, to be available to all women; and, third, a phased approach to the introduction of free contraception beginning with younger women in the 17 to 24 year age group.  The group estimated that that would cost in the region of &euro;18 million to &euro;22 million a year.<\/p> <p>The then Minister, Deputy Harris, told the D&aacute;il in October 2019 that free contraception would be available at the beginning of 2021.  The programme for Government commits to providing free contraception over a phased period starting with women in the 17 to 25 year age category.  Can the Minister of State outline the work that has been undertaken to establish this State-funded contraception scheme to date?  Can he give a clear timeline for the implementation of the programme in its entirety because it is urgently needed, although I am aware legislation will be required to introduce this contraception scheme?<\/p> <p>Detail is also needed on how and when free contraception will be available to all women, not only those in the 17 to 25 year age category.  Women's contraceptive needs do not stop in their mid-20s.  Barriers to accessing contraception are not only experienced by younger women.  We know from the UK abortion statistics relating to 2018 that 69% of Irish women who accessed abortion care in England and Wales that year were over the age of 25.<\/p> <p>Choice of contraceptive methods is empowering for women and it will be critical to the success of any scheme.  I hope the Minister of State will confirm that the State-funded contraception scheme will provide access to all methods of contraception.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2461\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is crucial that long-acting contraception methods, such as coils and implants, be accessible to all.

The Government understands the need to promote women's health and equality and, as such, the new programme for Government includes a commitment to expand access to free contraception for women aged between 17 and 25, as outlined by the Senator.<\/p> <p>The Senator has made me aware of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  The working group was established in April 2019.  This group was charged with examining the range of policy, regulatory and legislative issues in respect of improving access to contraception.  The group's high-level report, published last October, identified the complexities associated with this issue and highlighted the need for any State-funded contraception scheme to provide women with the opportunity to choose the most effective and suitable types of contraception for them, based on their health and lifestyle needs and preferences.<\/p> <p>Following the report, it was clear that a sizeable body of work would need to be addressed in order to develop and finalise the policy approach, bring forward the necessary legislative proposals and ensure the implementation of service-delivery arrangements.  Unfortunately, work on this matter has been disrupted significantly by the need to prioritise the response to the COVID pandemic, although it will be considered further in the context of the Estimates process.<\/p> <p>There are already several supports in place to facilitate individuals' access to contraception.  For example, the national condom distribution scheme, which was established to promote condom use among individuals and groups who may be at increased risk of negative sexual health outcomes, distributed over 730,000 condoms and almost 450,000 lubricant sachets in 2019.  This scheme has been expanded further, with the rolling out of condom dispensary services in November 2019 to over 23 third-level colleges.<\/p> <p>The Senator may also be interested to know that, in partnership with the Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, the HSE last month launched Play it Safe, a major new information campaign encouraging young adults to consider their sexual health and well-being during the current pandemic.  This campaign involves making sexual health protection packs available in pharmacies nationwide, offering valuable information and supports to young adults, whom we know from public health data are most affected by crisis pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections.<\/p> <p>In addition, it is important to remember that approximately 125,000 people accessed contraceptive services through the general medical services scheme in 2019.  These individuals received their contraception free of charge.  Those with a GP visit card are also supported in accessing contraception as they do not have to pay costs arising from GP visits.<\/p> <p>The success of these initiatives is reflected in the fact that the European Contraception Atlas for 2019 ranked Ireland 12th of 46 countries, with a rating of 65% for Government policies on access to contraceptive supplies, family planning counselling and the provision of online information on contraception.  There is, of course, scope for improvement, and it is clear that there are barriers to accessing contraception that must be addressed.  At the same time, it is important to recognise the progress made and the measures already taken to address this complex issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#F00200","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I am very disappointed with the Minister of State's response.

It had been accepted and I have been submitting it since.  Luckily enough, it was accepted today.  The reason I tabled it in the first place is because those aged over 70 now have a legitimate expectation that they will receive medical cards.  In the budget last October, there was a commitment that there would be a change in the criteria for those aged over 70 with regard to qualification for medical cards and that it would come into operation on 1 July.  Many old people were waiting to apply for their medical cards on 1 July.  What happened subsequently was that the D&aacute;il was dissolved but apparently legislation was required for this to happen.  In July, in the last week of the first term of the new D&aacute;il, the Seanad passed the necessary legislation to facilitate the Minister signing the regulations to change the criteria.  My question is very simple.  When will it be done?  Why have we had this delay?  The legislation was passed on 31 July.  It is now 25 September and, as of yet, there is no indication whatsoever for the thousands of people aged over 70 who are waiting patiently to apply for their medical cards.  The primary care reimbursement service is telling people it is not aware of this change and has not been given any indication.

Unfortunately, my experience is the opposite.  My office deals with a large number of renewals each week.  Will the Minister of State confirm why we asked medical card holders to renew their cards during this pandemic?  Should we not allow those with medical cards the comfort blanket having a card gives to so many during these unprecedented times?<\/p><p>I had the pleasure yesterday to speak to Mr. John Wall.  I am sure The Minister of State is fully aware of his campaign to extend medical cards to terminally ill patients.  On his behalf and on behalf of those he campaigns for, what is the update on the provision of cards for those who are terminally ill at this time?  The campaign seeks to extend these cards by 12 months for those at this stage of their life to take away the worry of filling in another form or worrying their family will be left with large medical bills.  I am informed that extending this card by another year would have little financial consequences to the State.  To those who are seeking them, however, it would be that comfort blanket which, I am sure, the Minister of State will agree is the least they deserve at this difficult time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#G00400","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway for his kind remarks.  It is great to be back here in the Seanad.  I am delighted to see Senator Wall here.  I serve with his dad in the Oireachtas so it is great to see him back here as well.<\/p> <p>Before addressing the medical card limits for the over-70s, which both Senators have raised today, it is important to acknowledge the difficult year that older persons in our society have experienced as a result of Covid-19.  In particular, social distancing and cocooning were and remain challenging for many older persons.  They continue, however, to show tremendous strength and resilience in helping to fight the spread of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>Budget 2020 provided for an increase in the medical card thresholds for persons aged 70 and over.  Although it was intended that this measure would be implemented from July, as Senator Conway stated, it was not possible to legislate for the necessary amendments to provide for this measure until there was a fully constituted D&aacute;il and Seanad.  It is welcome, therefore, that the Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020, which provides for the increase of the income thresholds, was passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and subsequently enacted on 2 August 2020.  However, relevant sections in this Act which provide for the increased income limits have not yet commenced, and this has undoubtedly been a source of frustration to those people aged 70 and over who may be eligible under the new thresholds.<\/p> <p>While the delay is regrettable, it is important to understand that this budget 2020 commitment was contingent on the realisation of certain savings within the health budget.  Those savings, however, could not be achieved this year due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and a substantial allocation of additional funding to the health service to deal with this pandemic.  It is in this context that decisions on the associated funding and implementation of the measures are being actively considered by Government.  I will bring to the Minister the Senator's issue of the thousands of over-70s who have raised their concerns.<\/p> <p>Turning to Senator Wall's query regarding reviews of eligibility, the HSE temporarily suspended all reviews of eligibility at the outset of the pandemic in March until last month.  All cards that were due to expire during that period had their eligibility extended for up to one year and will be reassessed on a planning basis.  This step demonstrates the practical and compassionate approach taken by the HSE during unprecedented times.<\/p> <p>While periodic eligibility reviews have since resumed, it is important to recognise that the HSE operates a sensitive assessment process and may also exercise discretion and grant a medical card where individuals exceed the income guidelines but face other difficult circumstances such as extra costs arising from an illness.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frankie Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the case of terminally-ill people, the HSE has a compassionate system in place for the provision of medical cards when it is informed a patient is receiving end-of-life treatment.  This is where patients unfortunately have a prognosis of less than 12 months.  These applications do not require a means assessment nor are they reassessed.  However, not all terminally-ill patients may qualify for a medical card and this understandably causes upset and concern.  To that end, the HSE clinical advisory group, CAG, was established in December 2019 to review this issue.  The work of the CAG has now concluded.  A report was submitted to the Department and is currently under investigation and consideration.  Senator Wall outlined what a comfort blanket the card can be for terminally-ill people with 12 months or less to live and their families, which I fully accept.  I will bring the issue to the Minister's attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#H00200","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply but it clearly states that the commitment was contingent on savings being achieved at the Department of Health.

More importantly, it is about keeping people at home and being treated in the community.  We all recognise that in the context of Covid-19 there must be a GP-led approach.

I agree with Senator Buttimer that this is, effectively, the line of last resort and that keeping people adequately treated and cared for in their homes is the optimal strategy.  We must have a clear view of what has been achieved and what is intended to be achieved.  I do not wish to be unfair to anybody, but I have heard senior administrators and Ministers being asked about what was done between March and now in respect of ICU capacity and they have all ended up talking about washing one's hands and wearing masks.  There is something wrong.  People are not being frank with the public about these matters.<\/p> <p>I have a second comment on this.  With regard to the regulations made under the Health Act 1947, the Government should be in a position to make those regulations on an emergency basis, but the regulations should be required to be given a positive consideration by each House of the Oireachtas for them to last a considerable period.

Without going into the complexities of the case, and trying to put it as succinctly as I can, Emma DeSouza was brought to court by the British Home Office for asserting her right under the Good Friday Agreement to identify and be accepted as an Irish citizen for the purposes of ensuring that her husband Jake, a US citizen, could reside with her in their home in Belfast.<\/p> <p>We, across this House, have expressed political support for Ms DeSouza.  The previous Irish Government, and this one, have been engaged on the case and offered support to Ms DeSouza.  We have met the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and a range of representatives of other political parties in the past few months.  We did not debate it, but there was cross-party support during the previous Seanad for a motion supporting Emma and Jake DeSouza and, crucially, their campaign.  As I have often said, the stand they have taken was for us all.  It was a stand for our rights and entitlements as citizens but at its core was the protection of the rights and entitlements afforded to us under the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>Emma DeSouza's case is crucial, particularly in the context of the debate we have been having over the past while and the assault on elements of the Good Friday Agreement by the British Government.  It was a stark example of the British Government knowingly failing to implement domestic law and codify in domestic law the rights of citizens in the North to identify and be accepted as Irish citizens.<\/p> <p>As a result of Ms DeSouza's court case and her campaign, she is now faced with an initial legal bill of &pound;36,000 for the hearing at the Upper Tribunal.  The British Government appealed the Upper Tribunal result, rather cynically, and Emma was burdened with an additional legal cost of &pound;45,000.

Section 35 already stipulates that it can be taken into account people who have refused to comply with previous planning permission.  However, in a report into a new development in Ballyboden in Dublin, compiled by an inspector from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it states that a developer, who is notorious for building defective units, alleged track record in complying with building regulations is not something that could be considered as part of this planning application.  In order to avoid building defective apartments into the future and to create a disincentive for builders who know they can away with doing so, we should consider widening section 35 of the Act so that a history of building defective buildings can be taken into account when applying for new planning permission.

There are also useful graphs and diagrams that we distribute to schoolchildren.  Of all the ten Stages of the legislative process, let us see what has happened with the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020.  First, pre-legislative scrutiny was dispensed with.  Then Committee and Report Stages were combined together rather than having them dealt with separately.  Yesterday, I was told that no amendments could be submitted on Report Stage, so it is not simply being combined with Committee Stage, Report Stage is being done away with altogether, in that there is no capacity to use it for any legislative purpose at all.<\/p> <p>The final insult, and something really extraordinary, which everyone should be concerned about, is that the deadline for Members of the D&aacute;il to submit their amendments to the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 was 11 a.m. this morning - before this Order of Business, before Committee Stage and before Report Stage.  The Government has simply jumped straight from Second Stage of the legislative process to Stage seven.  It is an extraordinary disrespect to Members of both Houses and to the legislative process.  I urge the Leader to investigate this issue and to encourage the Minister to show it is not the intention or message of the Government, as it would seem to be, that it has absolutely no intention of listening to or even considering anything it hears in this House.  The way the Government can show that is by accepting some of the very reasonable amendments that are being put forward on Committee and Report Stages today.  There are 103 amendments to choose from.<\/p> <p>This is not about the Government or Opposition.  This is not about whether one likes the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020.  There is a mix of views.  This is a matter of whether we take our work seriously in this House and whether we take the legislative process seriously.  I ask Members to vote with me on the amendment to the Order of Business, and if they cannot do so, I urge each Member to raise this issue at their parliamentary party, because if we allow this pattern to be set now at the beginning of a three, four or five-year Government process - if it is fortunate - we are really setting a dangerous precedent.  It is absolutely unacceptable.  I also ask that amendments to Standing Orders to reaffirm the normal due process and proper order of legislative practice is affirmed in this House and in the other House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#R00100","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I also wish to be associated with your comments on the UN, a Chathaoirligh, and those of Senator Chambers, regarding the 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.

That is despite the amazing efforts of the community and individuals who fight fearlessly on a day-to-day basis for their community.  I would like to see a follow-on from the commitments given by An Taoiseach yesterday so that a task force would be set up for the south-west inner city like that introduced by former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, for the north inner city.  In 2019, a total of &euro;6.5 million was spent on the north inner city task force.  We need a similar investment, but more than that, we need a housing regeneration programme, in particular in the Oliver Bond complex.  We also need sports facilities for young people and, ultimately, we need a long-term and short-term economic rejuvenation plan for the area.  We need that to start immediately.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Ardagh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2473\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I intend to keep the pressure on the Government, through the Leader, to proceed with this and to keep the momentum going in order that it happens.<\/p><p>Finally, I wish to thank the Department of Finance.

This will be particularly hard for those who are self-employed and those in the hospitality sector.  Donegal is entering a level 3 lockdown.  Restaurants in Dublin are having real difficulty.  They faced difficulty at the weekend, with huge amounts of stock going to waste, which was absolutely scandalous, especially when there is such a shortage of food in the community.

As we know, especially those of us who are former councillors, local authorities are invariably under financial pressure, but this year the pressure has increased exponentially.  The councils will be under pressure in a number of areas, not just for the remainder of this year but also for 2021, including housing rental income reviews; planning fee drops; fewer parking fines and charges, resulting in lesser income; fewer recreation and amenity facility charges; reduced use of council facilities, resulting in fewer charges being available; a drop in non-principal private residence, NPPR, income; a predicted drop in fire charges; a likely increase in uncollectable rates; an increase in bad debt provisioning; and an increase in Covid-related expenditure.  Without Government intervention, quarter 4 cuts across our local authorities are inevitable.  For 2021, the County and City Management Association projects that the average cut in non-payroll expenditure to achieve a balanced budget could be in the order of 30%.  This will impact on the core responsibilities and services local authorities provide.  Councils will be unable to make provision for capital projects from revenue budgets.  The impact could be on shovel-ready projects, and local authorities are seeking urgent help to meet the challenges they face.  The CCMA projects that the total negative impact on the current year of Covid will be &euro;168 million, and the total negative impact in 2021 is projected to be &euro;367 million.

We called them cowards and would not allow their names to be mentioned.  I want to mention John Gorman, the man who drove this for years on his own.  Leo Quinlan, the son of Pat Quinlan, also drove it.  If we are talking about the most loyal citizens of the State, we have to treat them as loyal citizens.  When they are nominated for an award for gallantry, we should think about what it took to be nominated for that award.

Their priorities include the Common Agricultural Programme, CAP, transition funding, and whether full funding will be maintained for existing farming schemes in the CAP-phase contribution to the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, the areas of natural constraint scheme, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme and other schemes.  There was also a query regarding the maximum level of national co-funding of 57% in the CAP rural development programme after 2020.  Will there be an exemption for agridiesel and agrifuels from carbon taxes, as there is no viable alternative to using those fuels in the farming industry?  Will there be a reduction in the rate of stamp duty on land to bring it in line with the residential rates of 1% and 2%?

I am concerned about the airports in the west, particularly Shannon Airport.  In fact, I have never been more concerned because, only yesterday, the Minister apparently ruled out any option of bringing Shannon Airport back under Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, management.  If that is the case, it will have catastrophic consequences for Shannon Airport.  The reason is simple.  The stand-alone airport policy was always fundamentally flawed and has been failing for years.  It was failing long before the Covid crisis.  We could see that in comparison with how Cork Airport was performing under the DAA umbrella.  It was failing because it makes no sense to set up Shannon Airport to compete against Cork Airport or Dublin Airport.  When an airport is set up in that fashion, it has no leverage in negotiating with airlines.  In fact, that model allows airlines to pick off airports.<\/p> <p>What we need is joined-up thinking.  We need a joined-up network of airports and a progressive Minister who insists on rebalancing flights.  I call on the rest of the mid-west representatives, some of whom I see here today and with whom I have worked on this issue, to come out clearly on this matter now because it will be no good in six or 12 months.  This is not about local party political advantage because we will all be losers if we do not save Shannon Airport.  The model is fundamentally wrong.  We need a change in thinking and it can happen.  I am genuinely concerned about this.  I did not believe we could have a worse Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport than the previous one.  I had hoped we would see new thinking under Deputy Eamon Ryan, but coming out yesterday and effectively taking a civil servant's advice to rule out bringing Shannon Airport back under the umbrella of a properly thought-out network of airports was just disgraceful.  I call on all of us to act together in unison to save the mid west, Shannon Airport, and the 55,000 jobs and &euro;3.5 billion in income that depend on it.

In recent weeks we have heard how the successful application of carbon tax is being used, under the just transition fund, to pump money into areas of the midlands that have suffered and will suffer significant economic losses as a result of the ending of the burning of peat in that region and its impact on jobs.  For a long time now, I have believed that a similar extension is required to include the Moneypoint region of west Clare.  With more and more wind energy being brought onto the electricity grid, the demand for electricity from the Moneypoint facility is reducing and there are already plans in place for it to close by 2025.  Well in advance of that closing date, employment is being lost.  The ESB is restructuring there and many of the contractors that found gainful employment in that facility are no longer required.  There has been a very significant negative economic impact on the west Clare region and I believe it meets all the criteria necessary to be included in that just transition funding model.<\/p> <p>I appeal to the Leader to bring the Minister before the House in order that we can put our case yet again.

The United Nations has warned that the Covid-19 pandemic risks sparking a major global mental health crisis.  The World Health Organization has stated that the associated isolation, fear, uncertainty and economic turmoil could cause psychological distress.  We can expect an upsurge in the severity of mental illness, including among children, young people and health workers.  I have been contacted by many mental health support groups who have expressed their concern that as this crisis continues more and more people are suffering from stress and anxiety.  Mental health services must be properly resourced to cope with the expected surge in demand for their services.  Research shows that job losses are associated with increased depression, anxiety, distress and low self-esteem and may lead to higher rates of substance misuse and suicide.  Loneliness is a condition that we normally associate with the elderly, but strong evidence now indicates that in Ireland young adults are experiencing the highest levels of loneliness during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Evidence indicates that in April loneliness had decreased among those aged 70 and older while it increased among all other age groups, especially those aged between 18 and 34.  Prevalence in this group has more than doubled compared with two years ago.<\/p> <p>These issues must be addressed when the Government issues funding for mental health supports in the next budget.

Some in the events industry are so good at what they do that they operate on the international scene, but the problem now is, because of Covid-19, the industry has been wiped out, virtually.<\/p> <p>Events Industry Ireland is holding a virtual budget briefing next week and it would be worthwhile if Members of this House were able to tune into it.  It is making some reasonable proposals.  It is looking for &euro;15 million, which is not a lot of money, to create a digital transformation fund to help its members upskill and move into the digital world.  The organisation also wants the temporary wage subsidy scheme extended until 31 March next for its particular industry because it will not be up and running until the middle of next year.  The organisation also wants assistance in negotiating with banks on spreading borrowings, etc.<\/p> <p>When we get out of this pandemic and go to the post-Covid phase, we will rely on such industries to help us kick-start the economy.  This industry is promoting its cause this week.  It has done it well.  A debate on this particular industry and the role it has to play would be welcome at some stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#X00300","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I echo the Cathaoirleach's views and Senator Craughwell's with regard to &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann and the Cathaoirleach's commendation of them.

They are trying to get rents of up to &euro;1,300 per month for living spaces measuring between 12 sq. m and 16 sq. m.

We have 292,000 people employed in the hospitality sector and 250,000 are involved in the retail sector.  Further stimulus measures are crucial if we are to help these vulnerable businesses to get through what is becoming the second wave of Covid and into the new year.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has estimated that &euro;120 billion was sitting unspent in Irish bank accounts in July.  By introducing a gift card system like this one, we would encourage people to go out and spend.  It has worked well in Malta, where the Maltese Government introduced five gift card schemes - one for retail and four for hospitality.  Although each voucher was worth &euro;20, the average spend was &euro;36.40, representing an 82% increase on the voucher's value.  It proves that, when people use gift cards, they actually spend more money in shops.  The evidence in Ireland is similarly strong.  Of Irish consumers, 83% spend above the value of their gift cards.<\/p><p>In the current context, the crucial advantage of introducing this type of scheme in budget 2021 would be to encourage people to spend in shops in our local economies and communities, thereby helping SMEs to survive and get going.  If the Government introduced this meaningful scheme, it would give our retail and hospitality sectors the extra level of confidence and spending they need in their hour of need as Covid restrictions increase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#Y01300","speaker":"1670","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>\"You matter because you are you, and you matter to the end of your life.\"  These are the important words of Dame Cicely Saunders, who founded the hospice movement, which has given great dignity, respect and comfort to many at the end of their lives as well as to the family members around them.<\/p> <p>In 2001, the national advisory committee on palliative care stressed the importance of every region having a hospice.

In 2013, a joint study conducted by the HSE midlands region and the national hospice movement recommended that this badly needed hospice be placed on the campus of the Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore.  Since then, a great deal of fundraising has been done by local committees.  In 2019, the HSE Dublin mid-Leinster region offered a site to the hospital in Tullamore.

Let these impressive people with compelling personal stories be heard but there are other impressive people, who are perhaps less activist publicly, who have real fears about what change in this area would mean and whose life experience has shown that much can be accomplished when palliative care services are developed and strengthened.  I prepared a report on this matter for the Council of Europe in 2018.  Palliative care is not just about the management of pain.  It is about psychological, spiritual, social and emotional support not only for the persons who are unwell or at the end of their lives but for their families.  So much can be achieved.

I echo the sentiments of Senator Gavan on regional airports.  My local airport, Ireland West Airport Knock, is in a similar position.  If it were to go, it would be devastating for the region.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell raised also raised the winter plan, which I have dealt with.  The Senator also made an interesting suggestion to amend the Health Act 1947.  The pandemic has thrown up many new issues for the country that we have never dealt with before.  We should be concerned with regulations that are imposed on the country without proper debate on their long-term effect.  Obviously, we have to be able to respond in an emergency and deal with matters as they arise.  The Government has to have such flexibility.  The Senator's suggestion is certainly wise and I will pass it on to the Minister for Health.<\/p> <p>Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the issue of Emma DeSouza.  As others, including Senator Higgins, have said, Ms DeSouza has performed a significant public service to all of us in highlighting the issue.  The previous and current Governments completely agree with her position.  She absolutely has the right to identify as an Irish and British citizen.  That should be respected under the Good Friday Agreement.  I was glad and heartened to see that crowdfunding has assisted in the significant legal bill she and her partner are facing.  That shows the goodwill of the people in backing up what is a worthwhile and worthy cause she has taken up.<\/p> <p>Senator Moynihan raised the issue of defective apartments.  The Minister with responsibility for housing was to conduct a review of these homes.  I do not have an updated position on that review.  Senator Moynihan told the House that the review group has not met and I will take her at her word on that.  Certainly, these concerns will be passed to the Minister to try to address the matter.  Senator Moynihan also asked that the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House to discuss the Planning and Development Act.  That is a worthwhile proposal which I will pass on to the Minister.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> On the issue of Covid assessment hubs raised by Senator Martin, it is a very sensible solution and recommendation, given that the hubs currently deal with those over the age of 16.  With the return of children to school, it is fortunate that they are broadly unaffected by Covid because it would be a very different pandemic if our children were getting very sick, so we thank God for that small mercy from this deadly virus.  It is certainly a sensible suggestion that perhaps there should be a separate location for children in such circumstances so that we can keep our GP practices clear and free as best we can.<\/p><p>I note very clearly the points that Senator Higgins made.  She has raised them consistently at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges with all the group leaders.  I share her concerns on that front, as does the Leader of the House.  This is no way for us to be doing our business.  We should be seeking to return to taking all Stages of Bills, as is appropriate, with sufficient spacing between each Stage to allow for amendments, proper scrutiny and debate.  I want to see that happen and will relay those concerns up the line.  The Senator received agreement throughout the House on that point and there has been widespread praise for her ability and passion in regard to the legislative process, which we are all grateful for.  It is very important for all our work as Senators.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh raised the importance of looking after the south inner city of Dublin.  An Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, visited the constituency with her to meet local residents and examine the issues in that area.  There is no doubt that parts of the city are very disadvantaged and are suffering because of that.  There was considerable success with the north inner city task force established by the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, and there is no doubt that something similar could be very effective for the south inner city too.<\/p><p>Senator Kyne raised the issue of local government funding.  I have had the same representations, from not just elected members of local authorities but also council staff.  There will be a considerable shortfall this year and again next year, and potentially beyond that point.  The Senator rightly pointed out that all the areas of income for local authorities have been severely hampered by coronavirus, such as people applying for planning permission, using council facilities, rates and so on.  The suggestion there could be a 30% cut to non-payroll expenditure is very worrying for every local authority and it is incumbent on us to do something about that.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of the Defence Forces' conditions and pay and the specific issue of the Jadotville soldiers, something on which he has my support.  I raised the issue during the previous Oireachtas and cannot understand why it has not been addressed.  The Senator and I have discussed the matter on numerous occasions and he has my full support on it.  I acknowledge he supports Senator Higgins's motion.  As for the issue of ministerial advisers, my view is that it is good that Ministers or Ministers of State seek the advice of those who have expertise in areas where they do not.  I would like to know that if Ministers of State at various Departments do not have a particular expertise, they will seek it out and not just go on the hoof and make it up as they go along.  Expertise is good, but I take the Senator's point and his views on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#CC00600","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I would like a debate on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#DD00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Several debates have been requested and those requests will be passed on to the various Ministers with responsibility.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher made a poignant point about the sacrifice of the people in dealing with Covid.  We are at a difficult point in the pandemic six months in.  There is Covid fatigue.  People are frustrated and have had enough.  I think there was an expectation when this began that it would be finished by now, but we are probably not even halfway at this point.  We had a little respite for the summer months of July and August, when there was an easing of the restrictions and society opened up a little bit.  Psychologically, people and communities needed that but now, as we head towards the winter months and the annual flu season, the impending pressure on our health service and on the front-line workers who are dealing with that is very worrying for all of us.  There is now a real need to knuckle down and do the basics right, such as hand-washing, personal responsibility and mask-wearing, all of which are very important.  All of us here are community leaders.  It is important that we use our media and social media platforms and interactions we have in our communities to drive that message home for the next few months.  Winter will be difficult, more so for some than for others.  For those living alone or in isolation or those who are less able to get out and about, it will be a difficult couple of months and we all need to play our part to help people through that.<\/p> <p>Senator Carrigy raised the prospect of holding a pre-budget debate on agriculture.  I will do my best to request a date from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, although I cannot guarantee that will be forthcoming.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The agriculture sector is heading into a very difficult number of months as we approach the next Brexit deadline.  We have had a number of those deadlines but the 1 January deadline for the end of the transition period poses a very real and serious threat to the agriculture sector in particular.  The people involved are extremely worried about that and Senator Carrigy has raised a number of matters that I am sure representatives of the Irish Farmers Association have raised with many of us and which are worthy of consideration.<\/p><p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of Shannon Airport and I have dealt with this through the Private Members' debate.  I hope it will give Members an opportunity to raise the matter.  I agree with the Senator's suggestion of a joined-up approach for all our airports and we should not allow a position where airlines dictate how things are run in this country.  It is very worthy of a conversation in this House as to how we might approach that matter because of Shannon being brought out of the remit of the Dublin Airport Authority and the complexities that come with that.<\/p><p>Senator Dooley raised the matter of climate action and the need for a Minister to come before the House to speak on it.  I completely agree with that.  Climate will be the major issue, along with Covid-19 and Brexit, in political discourse for the next four to five years if we get that far, as Senator Higgins has said.  I hope we can.  It is an important debate to have and we should be to the fore in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in debating the issue.  The just transition fund has been a major success in the midlands and I see no reason it cannot be extended if a particular area meets the criteria.  I agree the Moneypoint region of west Clare is one of the areas that could certainly benefit from coming under that fund.<\/p><p>Senator Ahearn raised the matter of sport and the very important role it plays in helping people in communities to deal with the pandemic.  Sport is a really important part of our lives, whether we play it or go to watch others play, or even whether we have families involved.  Sport is at the heart of most rural communities, in particular.  Pressure on local sports clubs will increase and they have not had the same access to fundraising that they would have normally.  In normal times, fundraising would kick back into action now after the summer so certain supports will need to be put in place to ensure that at the local and grassroots level, small sporting organisations will not be left behind.<\/p><p>Senator Black raised the question of mental health and the very real impact that Covid-19 is having on it.  We know it is a major problem and this will only get worse if we do not take action now.  It is very welcome that the United Nations and World Health Organization have indicated that countries should be very aware of this and take positive action to try to address the matter.  It can very often be an unspoken result of Covid-19.  Physical ailments can be very easy to see or address but mental health can be much more difficult to deal with.  There is isolation, loneliness and an impact on younger people.  The Senator hit the nail on the head by saying young people have suffered terribly through the pandemic because so much has been taken from them, including access to friends, the potential for new relationships and a college experience.  So much has changed in a short period and we are asking much of our young people.  Their mental health must be cared for by the Government.<\/p><p>Senator Cassells raised the matter of vaping and e-cigarettes.  It is a real issue and the Senator mentioned the obnoxious vapours that are emitted by users of e-cigarettes.  I agree with the Senator and there is not really enough expertise around e-cigarettes just yet as they are still quite new.  It is worrying to see so many younger people in the schoolyard and outside secondary schools vaping at lunch or before and after school as if it is a game.  Maybe it is slightly better than having a cigarette but I do not really know - because we do not really know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#DD00300","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>One could have a joint.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#EE00200","speaker":"1675"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>No, thanks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#EE00300","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>It is very relaxing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#EE00400","speaker":"1675"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Is it?  Good for the Senator.  To get back to vaping and e-cigarettes, which are legal but which still pose a threat to public health, we should debate the matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly raised the matter of issues facing dialysis patients.  There are so many vulnerable and at-risk groups in this pandemic and she has highlighted particularly vulnerable patients who are awaiting transplants.  Many parts of our health service have suffered because of a slowing down and people not having access to services because all the focus is on the immediate threat of Covid-19.  There will be a knock-on effect on other parts of our health service and this must be raised with the Minister for Health.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan backed up Senator Higgins and I have addressed the question of the legislative process.  The Senator is correct that we must have a debate on local government funding.  Senators Kyne and Boyhan made those points today.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway raised the question of the events industry.  Dublin was busy and bustling this time last year, when it was difficult to get a hotel room and restaurants and caf&eacute;s were full.  It is a very different city today than it was before the pandemic.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If our capital city is not doing well, our country is not doing well.  It is a real concern for the local economy here in the city, for people who run businesses and for their livelihoods.  The suggestion from Senator Conway that we would engage with the events industry, which employs a lot of people and has been particularly hit because its business has come to a complete halt, is certainly a good point to raise.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne raised the issue of having a better strategy with France as it is now our nearest European neighbour.  I absolutely agree with that.  On the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, I share the Senator's sentiments.  What we have witnessed is absolutely appalling and it is good to see world leaders step up to the mark and call it out for what it is.  It is disappointing that not all Members would share those views but we are a diverse Seanad, as has been pointed out, which is good for robust debate.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield raised the issue of co-living.  In the last Seanad and the last D&aacute;il, Fianna F&aacute;il raised serious concerns over co-living.  Those concerns are even more serious now that things have changed because of Covid.  It simply is not a suitable way to live, in my view.  Certainly, the review needs to happen and I will raise the issue directly with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to get an update.  I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.<\/p><p>Senator McGahon raised the issue of the retail and hospitality sectors.  Like the business and events industry, retail and hospitality have been massively hit.  There are stark figures with 292,000 employed in hospitality and a further 250,000 in retail.  It is a huge number of jobs.  As Senator Black also identified, there are a lot of younger people working in those sectors and a lot of people on lower pay.  They have been disproportionately hit in terms of the loss of jobs and opportunity.  The retail and hospitality sectors are in a most difficult period.  Somebody said to me that it would actually be easier to go back and deal with the financial crash than what we are dealing with now.  At least there was more certainty, remarkably, around the financial crash.  We knew what we were dealing with and there was an end and a way to move forward.  With Covid, it is changing every week and month.  We do not know what we are dealing with.  We do not know when it is going to end.  That prolonged uncertainty is crippling the retail and hospitality sectors.  They are areas that need specific and targeted support.<\/p><p>Senator O'Loughlin raise the issue of the hospice movement.  I join her in saying that without the hospice movement and the local hospices, I wonder where many families would be today.  Certainly the areas of Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath need to have a hospice service.  My own local hospice, Mayo-Roscommon hospice, does fantastic work helping families at the most vulnerable and stressful time.  It is a really important service.  I am certain that the Minister of State with responsibility for older people would be happy to come before the House.  I will request that debate for Members.  <\/p><p>I thank Senator Ruane for raising medical detox and the addiction services.  It very much hit home for Members here today that if we remove these services, people lose their lives.  It is a stark reminder of what some people are going through and the services that are needed.  I will raise the matter directly with the Minister for Health.  A lot of services have been put on hold, delayed or slowed down right across the health service.  It is having a deeply negative impact on people.  We have not really felt the full effects of it yet.  Senator Ruane has presented the House with clear evidence of the impact of removing that particular service.<\/p><p>Senator Seery Kearney referenced Make Way Day.  I thank her for doing so.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has a campaign out today to get people to make way for those with disabilities.  It is really important that we do our best to move towards not just a more accessible society but a more inclusive one.  They are distinct and different things.  We take for granted the ability to walk down the path and step off if we need to get around a parked car or broken pavement.  That is not possible for every member of our society.  Every local authority should be doing its part to improve local services and access to public spaces.  <\/p><p>Senator Keogan raised the issue of adult day services.  She probably saw that I was nodding along while she was speaking.  This is the harm that has been caused to so many people.  We are leaving people in absolute isolation.  I refer to services for families where an older son or daughter is still living with at home and the parents are in their 70s or 80s.  It is a most difficult position for elderly people who are still caring.  Lots of Alzheimer's day services have ended and are not back operating.  A lot of families are in highly pressurised environments, six months in with no day services, respite or break from full-time caring.  They are doing the work that the State should be doing.  We owe it to them to at least provide a break every now and again from that.  I will request that the Minister with responsibility for disabilities come before the House to debate that issue.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen might be surprised to hear that I agree completely with everything he said about the debate on the right to assisted suicide.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a very important debate for both Houses to have.  It should not be rushed and it should be properly considered and thought out.  There are many aspects to it.  I do not yet know where I stand on the issue, and how we can be compassionate and assist with the difficult cases of which we are all aware, and also protect those who may be vulnerable if it does not work in the way we want it to work.  There are many issues to be debated on the subject and I agree with the need for a full and proper debate.  We should not rush this particular issue, and every aspect of it should be properly and carefully considered.<\/p><p>I agree that the extra resourcing of palliative care services is needed, regardless of the end-of-life debate.  Palliative care is important at all stages of life, whether it concerns a young baby, a child, an adult or an elderly person.  Everyone needs that sort of care towards the end of his or her life.<\/p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick raised the issue of mortgage holders during Covid-19.  It is an issue that needs to be looked at by the Minister for Finance, because we have come to the realisation that we are in this situation for the long haul, and for the next number of months at least.  People will need a break from paying their mortgages, and they should not be penalised for it.  Given the recent findings of the Central Bank against KBC Bank and what we have seen some of our pillar banks do to Irish citizens and people living in this country, and the real harm and hurt they have caused, it is time for the pillar banks to step up and show leadership.  They must give back to the Irish people in a time of need because the same was done in reverse when the banks needed help.  We need to see the reciprocation of that now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#EE00500","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins proposed an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That Report and Final Stages of the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 not be taken today.\"  Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#GG00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy Leader for her remarks and hope we can work on these issues into the future.

For example, what will happen if we find that a very large or anomalous number of licences are issued within a short period or, indeed, appeals processed?<\/p> <p>Interestingly, there is talk that there will be a report on the activities every six months but we should bear in mind that the political climate will be very different in six months time due to Brexit.

We are looking at a situation where 80% of the current market for forestry goods and wood will be gone.  There has also been a lot of talk about jobs.  I tabled the amendment because next January to March we will again face crises in respect of jobs and all of those parts of the forestry industry, which will not have been solved by this Bill.  This Bill will allow a very large amount of licences to proceed thus resulting in the felling of a large amount of trees; afford investors an opportunity to cash out of the industry; allow replanting where required; and, as planting licences will move speedily through the new process a lot of planting will take place under the previous regime.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> What happens in the next six months may shape the reality of hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest and forest ground in Ireland for the next ten years because the decisions will stand for up to ten years.

I am also conscious of the fact that the crisis that has taken place in the forestry business and forestry sector, with the destruction of saplings and so on, is a sign of weak administration, unfortunately.<\/p> <p>I support the principle of the Minister's Bill.  We have to balance the rights of the Irish community as a whole to pursue its afforestation targets with the rights of some people who assert the right to object to or to obstruct the implementation of this.  In November last year a much-missed former Member of this House, Marie-Louise O'Donnell, queried what the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, was fixing as afforestation targets.  He said 250 million trees would be planted in Ireland by 2030.  He made this commitment in 2018.  Now we are amending that slightly.

However, and this is the fundamental point and the reason I support the Bill, this country, if it is to engage in major afforestation, needs to get serious about it.  We need to make it possible to comply with the targets we are setting.  There is no point in wandering off to Paris conferences or UN conferences saying we have a plan and then saying, \"Hold on a second, though.

It creates jobs.  We live in a world where the consumption of meat from sheep and cattle is in decline and there are constraints on that form of agriculture.  Afforestation is hugely important, and in supporting this amendment, I ask that we remember full transparency regarding the reports being received is a good idea to bring the people with us in this process.<\/p><p>I want to be clear that is not to assist those minorities who want to hold up the process of afforestation.  I believe in afforestation, and if we are telling people the truth about the 400 million trees over 20 years or 250 million trees over ten years, we must get serious about this and stop the codology and stop the capacity of people, including people who do not even have to pay a fee, to get involved in afforestation plans and proposals which have very little to do with them.

I am in favour of the withdrawal of amendment No. 2, as is the proposer, Senator Higgins, with the consent of the House, in favour of amendment No. 1, which was drawn up by my Independent friends and colleagues, Senators Norris and Craughwell.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That makes common sense.

We should accept his bona fides and those of Senator McDowell.  In the time I have got to know her, I have found the Minister of State to be one of the most honourable people in politics.  The backdrop to this Bill relates to what she said about having the right tree in the right place.  If we are serious about afforestation, let us listen to what the different groups and sectors are saying.  Let us listen to what F&oacute;rsa said about representing the workers in the forestry sector.  Some 12,000 jobs will be affected.  The sector contributes &euro;2.3 billion to our economy.  Senator McDowell was right about former Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's contributions in the previous Seanad.  During my time as Leader, I was the victim of those contributions on the Order of Business on a number of occasions, and there was confusion over the number of trees and the programme.  The Minister of State has, to paraphrase herself, inherited this Bill and been handed it.<\/p> <p>I was struck by the contributions of IBEC - although I would not necessarily follow everything it says - and Imelda Hurley, who spoke about the need for a properly resourced forestry appeals committee.  If we are to meet our obligations under European directives and acknowledge where we are meant to be, this Bill needs to be progressed, notwithstanding the genuineness of the contributions and the amendments.  Some of the Members shedding crocodile tears about taking all Stages of the Bill will come in here on their own Private Members' time and demand that all Stages of their legislation be taken or they will write to all Senators and state that theirs is the only way.  One would swear that some of them are on the Via Dolorosa from the way they behave, but we will come back to that.  I understand the sincerity of Members in this regard.<\/p> <p>The Leas-Chathaoirleach will remember a previous Government - I am not sure whether Senator McDowell was part of it but I do not think he was - which gave money to farmers to plant trees on their farmland.  The Minister of State's comment is pertinent because this is about planting the right tree in the right place.  Senator Boyhan is also right about balancing these measures with the Greens and environmentalists.  We must get that right.  This is good legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#UU00200","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, I note that we allowed some initial latitude as propositions were made and so on.

This is my first opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment.  I wish him the very best.<\/p> <p>Like Senator McDowell and others, I am supportive of the amendment and I am also supportive of this Bill.  The need for an annual report speaks to the lack of transparency in terms of what has gone on.  Many people have experienced considerable frustration, including: those who have invested money in forestry and made investments over a period of years who then find they are unable to get a return on their investment; people working in forestry who are now going on three-day weeks; and people in construction who cannot access six-by-three pieces of timber, to which Senator Lombard referred on Second Stage.  It is very important, in the context of this Bill, that the Minister of State takes the opportunity to give people a precise idea of how long it will take for normal service to resume.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister of State spoke eloquently on Second Stage about the new arrangements for the hearing of appeals, the subdivision of the commissions and the addition of new forestry staff at the Department, including ecologists, administrators and so on.  That is very good, but we need to know how long it will take for normality to return.  In recent days I spoke to somebody who had committed a very small holding of perhaps 10 ha to forestry some decades ago.  The application went to the Department in April 2019.  This person had spoken to somebody who was to manage the felling process.  Apart from a letter from the Department acknowledging the application for a felling licence and warning about all the things that were not allowed now it had been lodged, nothing has been heard since.  The person concerned contacted me and I made some initial inquiries with people in the Department.  I was basically told that nothing would happen quickly on this case because the Department would deal with the bigger players first.  People deserve more reassurance than that about how long it will take for this problem to be solved.  I realise that the massive number of outstanding appeals is impacting the system as a whole.  The Minister of State has spoken about her hope that these appeals can be dealt with more expeditiously and in greater numbers, but we need targets.  Just as Senator McDowell spoke earlier about targets for afforestation, we need a target for the time it will take to return to normal. <\/p><p>I mentioned Scotland on the last day.  The Minister of State noted that Ireland is one of the few countries that allow appeals while Scotland does not.  Senator Lombard noted that firms are importing wood from Scotland because native timber is not available.  Scotland has multiples of the forested acreage Ireland has.  We seem to be afforestation laggards, if I may use a term that might recommend itself to some in this House.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#UU00400","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator to speak to the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#VV00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":172,"content":"<p>In trying to please everybody we are in danger of doing our economy and our social fabric serious damage.

Foresters have spoken to me about needing to thin their forests but being unable to do so.  This has an environmental impact.  Biodiversity on the forest floor is impacted because there is less light.  There is a greater risk of trees falling due to wind.  It may seem laudable to lodge objections based on environmental concerns or the quality of people's social lives if trees are growing near them, but these issues have had unforeseen consequences.  I will conclude by saying that I support the need for annual reports.  That is part of the transparency which is necessary in this whole area.

The fostering of public debate and transparent communication is very important.  The forestry appeals committee currently publicises the results of appeals on its website shortly after a decision is made.  That said, I think the suggestions and statements proposed in amendment No. 1 would add to the transparent communication which is vitally important, especially when it comes to environmental issues and people participating in that process, having all the information and understanding why and how decisions are made.  With that in mind, I am happy to accept amendment No. 1.<\/p> <p>I will briefly address some of the queries and comments that were made.  I cannot give a precise timeline for how quick the licensing system will be, but I am hopeful that if the Bill is passed, it will bring about a significant improvement in the efficiency of appeals.  Ultimately, the forestry appeals committee is there for appellants.  It was put in place for people who were unhappy with decisions made.  That is the purpose it serves.  It is important to remember that it is there for people who wish to appeal.  It has always been open to any person to appeal a decision and that will continue to be the case, which is important.<\/p> <p>On the concern relating to Brexit, that is a matter that also was of concern to me, but the timber sector is one of the most protected industries in terms of Brexit because the tariff rate, particularly to the UK, is approximately 5%.  I do not have the exact figure to hand but I know it is a low rate compared with the rate on beef, for example, which is far higher at approximately 70%.  Timber will potentially be a strong sector if there is a bad Brexit.  It is good to know that that sector, which secures many thousands of rural-based jobs might be quite secure in the case of a bad Brexit.  That is an issue which Senator Higgins raised on Second Stage of the Bill and I checked it out in the meantime.  I was pleased to find out that the timber sector is among the most protected industries.  <\/p> <p>I am happy to accept amendment No. 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#WW00300","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly has indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#WW00400","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to speak and I thank the Minister of State for returning to the Chamber.

I have spoken to people on this.  We accept that it is contentious and there were many submissions received by the Department on foot of the public consultation.  Some of the more contentious issues have been resolved, but forestry is something that will dominate the discourse in many local communities for a time to come.  Some of the reservations that local people might have that could be an issue for the appeals committee are ones that I dealt with when I served on a local authority.  They include issues of access to and from an area where a forest is being harvested and the structure of roads.  Local people feel very aggrieved when trucks and lorries use access points, do not make proper repairs and leave the place in a terrible state when they eventually leave.  Locals are not informed when it will happen or for how long.  It would be right and proper for local authorities to have a greater role in this, where companies should inform the local authority when they intend deforesting and harvesting, the roads they intend to use, and that they would be obliged to make proper provision to repair the inevitable damage afterwards.<\/p> <p>People have noted to me that when people use land for forestry, it is difficult to revert its use to agricultural.  That is a big commitment for a farmer and it is something that worries a lot of people and puts them off making such a commitment.

An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the national planning regulator, yet there is no mention of it in this legislation.  It has a State remit.  The national planning regulator is a very powerful office that gives guidance and regulation.  That is important.  What people do not want to see is a load of people from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine being given the jobs.  We need people who are exceptionally qualified in ecology, forestry, biology and the diverse sciences involved.  There should be representation from all communities.  There is forestry up the road from where I live.  It is a forestry partnership of South Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown county councils.  This is not a rural versus urban issue.  We have wonderful forests ten minutes in the car from here.  The Minister of State should invite people to submit nominations.<\/p><p>This must be an open and transparent appeals process.

I do not have a difficulty with this, and neither should the Minister of State.  According to the amendment, such panels would consider input from \"the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, An Taisce: the National Trust for Ireland, the Environmental Pillar [the Minister of State's party is strongly aligned to it and has given it endless political support to date, which I hope continues] and the Heritage Council.\"  Surely the Minister of State would support this amendment.  I hope she does.  I would not like to think that a Minister of State would oppose it in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, given how much logic there is in it.  Notwithstanding that, it is important that, as Senator Boylan stated, people with expertise in biodiversity, water quality, climate change and environmental sciences be involved.<\/p><p>I will leave it at that.

I hope that, throughout the debate, she will be able to accept other amendments that progress the Bill.  The amendments tabled on this section are such amendments.  Members spoke about being serious about afforestation.  It would be disingenuous to suggest that there are those of us who are in favour forestation and those who are not.  Every Senator who is present, contributing to the debate and tabling amendments is serious about afforestation.  Being serious about afforestation means treating it as a serious issue with serious nuances.  For example, a figure of 440 million trees has been mentioned.  I want to see 440 million trees, but it was acknowledged at the Joint Committee on Climate Action that, while a tree might be used for building, burning as fuel, sequestering carbon or serving a biodiversity process, the same tree is not going to do all of those things.  This is about taking seriously the balance, the purposes involved and the question of how to ensure that our afforestation process and policy genuinely serve us.<\/p> <p>As part of that, it is vital that ministerial appointments to the forestry appeals committee and, if amendments Nos. 95 and 97 are accepted, the future review of existing appointments to it should ensure that there are persons with the expertise to deal with the serious and complex issues of forestry.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For example, we should take account of the fact that we have a twin crisis in terms of climate change and biodiversity and that our strategies in respect of one should also address the other.

It is really important to set the record straight here, as was said by Senator Chambers earlier.  It is to be hoped that if we get things right within the system, there will be fewer appeals.  That is really important.  I hope the Minister of State will apply the principles that are in these amendments not only to the forestry appeals committee but also to the licensing process.  We should be really clear about why we are in this situation and why we are here today.  The reason is that Ireland was not serious about its afforestation policy.

One of the expertises sought in this group of amendments is expertise in environmental legislation.  Both European and national courts have found that Ireland was not compatible in its licensing processes.  That was admitted in the Oireachtas by the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Calleary.  He said that the EU had required Ireland to put new, appropriate assessment procedures in place for forestry licensing.  In July this year the Minister said that Ireland had been told that it did not have proper processes in place in respect of appropriate assessments in forestry licensing.  He said that in the D&aacute;il.  It is clear and it is on the record.<\/p> <p>Last Tuesday the Minister of State told us that the crisis we have been hearing about was not so bad before July.  Until July about 30% of applications were being appealed but that has now risen to 100%.  I would respectfully suggest that we have seen a massive increase in appeals in the last couple of months because Ireland is acknowledged as not having a proper process in place.  There are measures and amendments to be discussed later which might allow us to have a better process.  Nobody is saying that we must stop forestry.  What people are saying is that we must do it right.  This amendment and the idea of having people with real expertise in environmental legislation and in biodiversity would move us forward substantially.  <\/p> <p>It should be noted there have been no amendments from this side of the House on subdivisions.  Nobody has objected to the subdivisions or to fewer numbers being involved.  There are no amendments in respect of the key efficiency measures proposed in the Bill which will speed up the process, including multiple hearings happening at the same time, deputy chairs and chairs both functioning, lower numbers and so on.

Again, we must remember that this Bill is not about afforestation or licensing but about the appeals process.  We must keep coming back to what this legislation is about.<\/p> <p>All members of the forestry appeals committee are required to operate in an independent and impartial manner and agriculture appeals officers appointed to the committee are so bound by the Agriculture Appeals Act.

In making determinations on licences, the forestry appeals committee is determining that no errors were made in the issuing of the licence.  That is its role.  In circumstances where the forestry appeals committee decides to undertake a screening for, or conduct, an appropriate assessment or an EIA, it will need to have regard to the definitions of \"screening for environmental impact assessment\", \"environmental impact assessment\", \"screening for appropriate assessment\" and \"appropriate assessment\", which are provided for in section 14B(10)(b) to be inserted in the Act by section 4 of the Bill. <\/p><p>While I acknowledge and can understand the concerns of the Senators in regard to the independence of the forestry appeals committee and the people on that committee, I can assure them the forestry appeals committee operates independently of the Department and it has currently and will continue to have the required skillset to discharge its functions.

If the other Senators do not wish to speak to their amendments, I will address them as a group.<\/p> <p>All of the amendments in the group relate to the time limit for appeals.  A number of suggestions have been made to me on the side to the effect that the length of time is too long and should be shorter.  However, I consider that 28 days is a sufficient time to allow for the lodgment of an appeal.  It must be remembered that a time period of 30 days is given in the first instance for interested parties to make a submission regarding the application.  From the point at which a licence application is submitted, there is a two-month period within which a submission can be made.  If people are very concerned about an issue at the point the licence application is made, they have up to two months to collect data and information and determine their view in respect of the licence.  They can potentially appeal after that.  Extending the time period for lodging an appeal beyond 28 days is not appropriate or in line with objective, timely decision-making, which is important.  We have to consider the applicants also.  The criticisms of the Bill are from one side but we also have to take a balanced approach.<\/p> <p>Decisions on licences are published promptly on the Department's website to afford the public the opportunity to appeal.

All of them relate to timing. With regard to access to justice and people's rights, under the Aarhus Convention and other instruments, it is important that nothing effectively obstruct participation in an appeals process.  The proposal of 60 days is reasonable.  Forty-two days at least goes beyond a single month in terms of applications, which is good.  The question of notification, which is covered in amendments Nos. 14 and 13, is important.  A decision may have been made but the question is whether a person will have received notification of it.  The proposal simply suggests a period within 28 days of a person who previously engaged in the process being notified of the decision.  There are many cases where people assume and hope the licensing authorities will make a responsible decision that will reflect all the various environmental factors and that they are not, in fact, planning at an early stage.  It is expected that an application will be rejected if it proves to be out of line with our biodiversity or environmental criteria and it may be only at the point at which one is notified of a decision of the licensing authority that one seeks to launch an appeal and take on the considerable burden, as a concerned individual or member of a group, of challenging a decision.  In the majority of cases, most individuals would like to believe the State would do that work.  Therefore, it is not the case that individuals appeal from the very beginning.  People will expect the best of standards and sometimes find they have to step in by way of an appeal.<\/p> <p>On amendment No. 15, the Minister of State said 28 days is enough.  A major concern is that the amendment provides that it might be only 14 days.  The provision is that the Minister of State may narrow the period in which somebody may make an appeal to 14 days after a decision.  With the greatest of respect, a period 14 days is too short.  If people ever have a holiday again, a period of 14 days will be regarded as longer than that.  Realistically, especially when the period is not combined with the requirement on notification, somebody might receive notification only a week before the deadline for lodging an application or concern.  Irrespective of whether the Minister of State wishes to accept the amendments that expand the period from 28 days, amendment No. 16, in my name and that of Senator Boyhan and others, simply suggests that the Minister might allow for the expansion of the period.  At the most basic level, the Minister of State could choose to delete the provision that narrows the period but, ideally, she should accept amendment No. 16, which states that she may prescribe a longer period in certain circumstances.  The current lockdown is such a circumstance in that there are entire counties people cannot enter or exit.  What might that mean for persons who might be interested or who may have to check, connect or work with others in making an appeal?  Many rural counties with many afforestation plans will be affected by such measures.  In those circumstances, the Minister of State should be able to extend the period.  I hope she will ensure it is not narrowed.  I do not believe there is a proviso in the Bill for extending the period and that in may only be narrowed.  Could the Minister of State clarify whether she has the power to extend it in certain circumstances?<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 17 is possibly one of the most important in that the Minister of State talked about the importance of a portal.  We were asked to change the name of the Bill to the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which should mean it could be anything to do with forestry.  I am referring specifically to the portal and the need for persons to have access to appropriate information.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Amendment No. 17 suggests that the measures outlined here should not take place before there is an online portal in order that people can definitely see them.  The Minister of State has said measures are published on the website but this is not the same as an online portal.  The Minister of State has acknowledged, through seeking to add in the Bill measures regarding an online portal and seeking to change the name of the Bill to recognise this, the importance and need for a more appropriate information source and information portal.  Surely it would be appropriate that this would be in place because one of the key issues as to why 28 days is not enough for people is that many persons may be seeking through a freedom of information request access to crucial environmental information that may be with various public and State bodies and that would allow them to make their submissions.  We will have later amendments on which we will discuss this specific issue.<\/p><p>With the new requirement that all paperwork relating to an appeal be submitted at the exact beginning point of the appeal, the Minister of State is not simply requiring, unless she chooses to change provisions that appear later in the Bill, that people would express and lodge their appeal within 28 days, she is requiring them to have every piece of paperwork they might need in respect of it within 28 days, which is likely to be unduly burdensome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#LLL00300","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins has made a very good point on amendment No. 16, which intends to insert in the Bill that \"The Minister may, having regard to the public interest and fairness of procedures, prescribe a period which is longer than the period specified in paragraph (a), in order to ensure wide access to the appeal mechanism of the Forestry Appeals Committee, and in light of the cumulative effect of decisions of the Minister on the burden of the public in engaging with the review mechanism.\"<\/p> <p>This will be very difficult.

I have had many discussions at committee meetings with Senator Boyhan, who is in the Chamber, about An Bord Plean&aacute;la and its lack of a portal for making information available to the public.  I do not believe the legislation can wait until a portal is ready because I have my fears that it could be a good bit down the road.

I cannot see why these systems cannot be copied and pasted over to different Departments.<\/p><p>Senator Higgins mentioned an emergency.  Clear guidance was given during this emergency.  Extended periods for observations and submissions were allowed during the initial Covid-19 lockdown of three months.  As every planning application was more or less put on hold, the same timeframes were given plus that three-month period.  Even in the case of a pandemic, like we are going through now, there are mechanisms that allow the Minister to step in through emergency legislation to make sure everybody has a fair and equal opportunity to make an observation or to appeal a process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#MMM00800","speaker":"1640","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I wish to make two points.  If the Minister of State is saying that 28 days is an ample period of time, that is one thing.

Most people would say that 14 days is a short period of time, especially given that it can take up to six weeks to get access to information, as my colleagues have pointed out.  We are concerned that the combination of all of these points is putting in place a barrier to getting access to an appeal.<\/p><p>I wish to take up the point around the serial objector.  While the individual has not been named, it has been repeatedly suggested that one or two individuals are taking all of these cases and that this is somehow vexatious.  I would like to read something to the House:<\/p> <blockquote> \tYou must consider what the complaints are about.  If you de-legitimise them it will just infuriate a whole group of other people.  It's not literally just two or three people; I know they are the instigators of the complaints but they represent broader groups on the ground and communities on the ground.  <\/blockquote> <p>That is a quote from Minister of State.  It is unfair for somebody to be referred to as a serial objector when the Minister of State has identified that the people who are putting in the objections are doing so on behalf of communities frustrated by the current forestry planning system.  The Minister of State might address her colleague and disclose where the variance is around whether she supports the individuals taking these cases on behalf of communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#NNN00200","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank Senators again for the discussion on these amendments.  I accept the concerns behind the people making appeals.  I believe there is a genuine reason in the vast majority of cases.

One must consider and be aware that a certain percentage of appeals fall into this category.<\/p> <p>The information that will be available on the online portal will be invaluable in terms of public communication and transparency.  People will be afforded information that is currently more difficult to access and that will make things easier.  Therefore, when somebody sees a licence application go up in his or her local area, as per the planning authority, he or she can click on the link to see who is making the licence application and what it entails.  If such a person is concerned about certain issues, he or she can arm himself or herself from that point.  If his or her concern relates to the proximity to a waterway, for example, he or she is already armed at that stage.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pippa Hackett:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Licences are issued after 30 days and the results of licences from the Department are published three times per week on its website.

There is only a certain window of opportunity to do this in the year as this planting is a seasonal thing.  They are ringing me up and asking why they cannot plant and who is appealing their broadleaf plantations.  They are saying they are running out of time and that if they have to wait 28 days, it will push them into next year.  I have had many conversations with different farmers in my constituency and throughout the country who are frustrated by the delay when they are trying to do things the right way.  They are doing what we have been asking them to do, namely, to plant the right tree in the right place, and they are then subject to appeal or are being delayed in the granting of their licence because of the backlogs.<\/p><p>With that in mind, 28 days is sufficient.

It is the first time I have spoken on this legislation.  I echo all the concerns raised in the last few hours regarding the amendments and the process itself.  Regarding this proposed amendment to section 3 of the Bill, it is similar to amendments Nos. 19 and 20.  There is a proposal to delete an important part of the Agricultural Appeals Act 2001 which allows for decisions of the forestry appeals committee to be appealed to the High Court on a point of law, if required.  I am always wary of any attempts to remove the chance for higher legal recourse from Irish citizens engaged in any State planning process, but particularly in an area as important as forestry and the management of our shared land and resources.  Access to justice and legal recourse is a human right and one we should safeguard, promote and strengthen rather than remove.<\/p><p>If a point of law needs to be clarified in a decision of the appeals committee, especially when the express aim of this legislation is to increase the speed at which appeal decisions are arrived at, it would be important for an appellant to at least have the option to seek review of the decision reached by the appeals committee in the High Court.  I am concerned by the infringement of that option by the provision to delete this important access to justice and I would like to hear the Minister of State's rationale for its necessity.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#UUU00300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for an exemplary illustration of staying relevant.

There are concerns, however, about the deletion of those sections and that is why there are attempts to copper-fasten those in the Bill.  In addition, from engagement with the Department of the Minister of State, when I asked about duplication regarding ministerial regulations with the statutory instrument put forward in 2017 concerning judicial review, the indication was that once this Bill was in place it was expected that the statutory instrument would no longer be continuing because we cannot have duplication and many of its provisions are in this Bill.  If we do not, therefore, have a statutory instrument that refers to judicial review and certain sections are removed from this Bill, the Minister of State will recognise why we are asking her to address those concerns and clarify exactly how that will be done.

I agree that it is right that people should have access to justice.  This Bill, in its current format, does not prevent anyone from taking a judicial review based on the results of the forestry appeals committee.  It remains open to appellants, or indeed applicants, who are unhappy with the review or appeal of an application, to apply for leave to take a judicial review following the decision of the forestry appeals committee, and without insertion of this provision.  The whole point of the forestry appeals committee is to save people from having to go to court, which we all know is incredibly expensive and time consuming, but still an important process and it is available to people should they wish to continue to seek justice in that way.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pippa Hackett:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is the only route available to many people across Europe, particularly in Scotland, for example.  If people there are unhappy with forestry licences, that is it.  There are no grounds for appeal.  We have inserted this provision and brought this forestry appeals committee into our forestry system, through the Agriculture Appeals Acts, to do just that.  It saves people the hassle of having to bring their appeals to court, as would be the case in other jurisdictions.  Essentially, the forestry appeals committee provides that option to people who are unhappy with a decision without having to seek justice in a court at that stage.  However, anyone who is unhappy with the findings of the forestry appeals committee can seek judicial review.  If that review is accepted by the High Court he or she can then go to court.

I will go briefly through some of the categories of these amendments.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 22 concerns the fairness of procedure and the provision of wide access.  She has recognised that this should be one of the principles.  This emerges from the context, as do several of the amendments to this section, and certainly those on which I am leading, of the very real concern regarding the category of relevant persons, of which she will be aware.<\/p> <p>I commend her on one positive step contained within the Bill.  I refer to categories and exclusions and the narrow definition that had initially been proposed in the original draft heads regarding who might be persons, categories of persons or entities able to take appeals.  The proposed narrowing of that definition was one of the issues of primary concern.  That was a direct obstacle in the context of the question of who was eligible.  Indirect obstacles that we have discussed still remain, however, such as concerns regarding time and costs, an issue I will return to later.<\/p> <p>The most direct concern, however, would have been the category of relevant person and I am glad that the Minister of State has excluded it from the legislation.  I note, however, that there is provision in the Bill whereby the FAC may set its own rules as to the conduct of appeals, at a certain point.  There is also provision whereby the Minister of State may set direction.  My amendments, especially Nos. 26, 27, 28, 30 and 31, all concern the question of ensuring that any rules or directions, given either by the committee or by the Minister of State, shall \"not set limits to the rights of all persons or categories of persons to make an appeal nor create obstacles to the vindication of those rights\".<\/p> <p>While the inclusion of narrow categorisation has been excluded from the Bill, I am still hearing concerns expressed by citizens and organisations, who had initially been alarmed by the proposed narrow categorisation of relevant person, regarding a fear of the remaining openness in the setting of rules and directives.  I refer to the possibility that in the future the Minister could, through a direction, narrow or exclude a category of persons from making an appeal.  Similarly, there is the same fear that the FAC, in setting its own rules, could do so in a way that would effectively exclude a category of persons.<\/p> <p>My amendments are worded in several different ways.  I recognise, for example, that the Minister of State may need to insert a proviso in the legislation, for example, specifying that reference is being made to a person resident, or normally resident, on the island of Ireland.  Such provisions are normally contained in legislation.  I wonder, however, if she can give us assurances, or explain how we could be assured, that not just the current Minister of State but also any future holder of her office will set a direction excluding a category of persons from accessing appeals under the FAC mechanism, and, equally, that the committee will also not be mandated in its rules to be able exclude any category of persons from making an appeal.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those are two of the key issues.  The others relate to trying to embed a principle of access to participation as a positive objective.  I in other words, that wide access would be a goal of the work rather than an unfortunate consequence.<\/p><p>I am looking at my notes because this is quite a large grouping and we only received the list of groupings moments before the debate began.  I am looking at amendments Nos. 30, 31 and 29.  Amendment No. 29 relates to that same principle of ensuring fairness of procedures and providing wide access to the review mechanism.  Will the Minister comment on the principle of fairness and wide access and on how we can be assured, and assure others, that there is no danger of categories of person being excluded through an indirect mechanism?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#EEEE00500","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Looking through the amendments on which my colleague, Senator Higgins, has just been speaking, I note that she has gone into the minutiae of the detail, as is typical of her.  She understands that, while the Minister can give all the assurances she wants - and I know she gives them in the best of faith - there is still the question of those who come after her.  The Senator is trying to ensure that fairness runs the whole way through the system so that, when the Minister leaves her office - to move on to bigger and better things I hope - and someone else takes her position, that person or a chairman of the appeals committee will be bound by the fairness written into the legislation and there will be no wriggle room.  I will support this amendment and I hope a division is called on it.  This is typical of Senator Higgins.  She tends to look to the long term and at how people might interpret things.  I ask the Minister to take on board her amendments.  They do not change the legislation; they just build in safeguards which the Minister, as a member of the Green Party, must want to see in place.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#FFFF00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I will join in on this jingle-jangle of amendments.  I will specifically speak to amendments Nos. 26 to 28, inclusive.  When we were first spoke about removing the provision regarding the relevant person, I commended the Minister.  I echo Senator Higgins's concern that this measure may find its way back in through another mechanism.  The people who may seek to make an appeal in a given case include rural dwellers, environmentalists and others who have very real concerns about the environment, biodiversity, the sustainable development goals and a bazillion other things.  These people all have relevant and valid concerns.  They are ordinary individuals who have to live with the decisions the Department makes.  I hope this Bill will be able to deal with frivolous or vexatious appeals or appeals that are without substance or foundation.  I am led to believe that these are the correct legal terms for such things.  I do not believe, however, that fees, restrictions or limitations on those who may make appeals are effective ways in which to deal with them.  I know we will discuss fees at a later point.<\/p> <p>The amendments tabled by Senators Higgins and Boyhan - as I have said, I am primarily speaking to Nos. 26 to 28, inclusive - ensure that there will be no attacks on democracy, on people's right to environmental information, on their right to participate in environmental decision-making or on their right to environmental justice.  We must always uphold the right of local stakeholders to appeal Government decisions.  I urge the Minister to consider accepting these amendments because we cannot deny democratic participation in decision-making.  I would not like to see that happen in an accidental way.  I urge the Minister to consider accepting the amendments to which I am specifically speaking, namely, Nos. 26 to 28, inclusive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#FFFF00300","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I will respond to a few of the queries that have been raised.

The wording in the Bill is quite clear in that regard.  No one is restricted.  I am looking at the amendments but I cannot find the specific one I am seeking.

I cannot control what legislation happens after my time but I say, in good faith, that I am absolutely not going to restrict that access.

One concern is that while there may not be explicit exclusion of categories of person, and I am glad to hear the Minister of State's assurance that there will not be in the future and that the forestry appeals committee is not mandated to exclude certain categories of person, there are other obstacles.  It has been recognised substantially in European case law that there are many other ways in which an effective obstacle to access to justice or to participation in a process might occur.  We have discussed the issue of timing and we will shortly discuss the issue of fees, each of which have been acknowledged.  There is proof on record of where those issues have been acknowledged as effectively acting as obstacles.  There is another issue which I wish to highlight in this set of amendments.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> These are not simply obstacles to persons in terms of their participation in the appeals process.  They are also obstacles to due process in the forestry appeals committee and, potentially, obstacles to the quality of decision making of the committee.  It is not simply an issue regarding individuals' rights, but an issue for everyone in the State, including the Minister of State, and for the integrity of the process.  Specifically, I refer to the requirement in section 4(4) which states: \"An appellant shall, when making an appeal, state all of the grounds upon which the appeal is made and provide to the Forestry Appeals Committee all of the documents and evidence upon which he or she intends to rely to support those grounds.\"<\/p><p>There are two concerns here.  I have tabled an amendment which seeks to remove those lines.  This is a new requirement or obstacle that has been inserted.  I have also tabled amendments which seek to recognise that in many cases persons, especially given a 28-day or 14-day period in which to lodge an appeal as provided for in this Bill, may be awaiting information that they are entitled to under European directives giving access to environmental information.  Putting a requirement on them to provide information in respect of an appeal when they are still awaiting that information through, for example, a freedom of information request or an access to environmental information request, would be inappropriate and could be questioned in regard to the Aarhus Convention and, indeed, to the access of justice as an unnecessary intervention in the process.  This is yet another opportunity for the Minister of State to change the timing in exceptional circumstances, which, as we discussed earlier, she might need to do.  There are many other circumstances.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 34 proposes: \"Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing subsections, an appellant or party to an appeal or observer shall be allowed to furnish additional information to an appeal where the provision of that information has been compromised by delays in the processing of requests made under Directive 2003\/4\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information.\"  We have serious mechanisms, European directives, which require that people have access to environmental information which they can use to engage meaningfully in planning and decision processes.  That is their entitlement, yet there is a provision in this Bill which potentially does not allow them to exercise that right fully.  If the Minister of State accepts this amendment, she would go further towards ensuring that the Bill addresses the issues at hand, which are the issues of ensuring due process and that environmental factors are seen to be considered properly at every stage of the forestry process for licensing and appeals.  I urge the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 34.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 35 is quite similar.  Is amendment No. 36 in this group?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#HHHH02000","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":355,"content":"<p>The group consists of amendments Nos. 32 to 35, inclusive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#JJJJ00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I do not wish to stray to amendment No. 36 unnecessarily.

The Minister of State has the right to remove it and it would be a better Bill if she did so.  Amendment No. 32 deals with the same issues of directives.<\/p> <p>Those are the issues, and I ask the Minister of State to address them.  That part refers to the person's rights, but I wish to speak briefly about the second part.  It is normal in any administrative process and, indeed, in any legal or court process, that decisions would be made on the best information available.  It is the case, even in a court of law where there is a review, that where additional information that is particularly expedient and important becomes available, it is introduced.  If, for example, information is returned which shows there are only two or three remaining of certain species, and that environmental information is only provided a day or two after the person has lodged his or her appeal, it is extremely relevant for the forestry appeals committee to be aware of it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There may be serious biodiversity issues.  There may be other issues of considerable social or public concern.  Relevant information may arise in the course of an appeal.  It would behove an appeals committee that is functioning properly to consider this.  Such a committee should be entitled to the best available information when making decisions.  By setting this preclusion on the appellant, the Minister of State is effectively allowing or forcing the forestry appeals committee to make decisions on certain occasions without the information it needs to make good and proper decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#JJJJ00300","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":358,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins has laid out the key concerns and rationale behind amendments Nos. 34 and 35.

We pointed to how it may take up to six weeks for people to get the information they require.  Now, however, there is a barrier in their way.  If they wish to submit appeals, they must have all the information to hand.  As Senator Higgins pointed out, information may only come to light after that point.<\/p> <p>Earlier, the Minister of State made reference to the information being published.  When a decision is made, the only information that is actually published is that of a headline nature.  The Minister of State should be aware of this.

Again, we are asking the Minister of State to give this consideration.  If she will not do it today, then she should do it in the D&aacute;il.

I do not know how much it has influenced this legislation, but I will know and I will be delighted to remind the Minister of State when I get that information.  Neither the Minister of State nor her Department have seen fit to provide it despite all these excuses about giving.  This is about the information and the amendment.  It is about the importance of this information.  I do not know what investors put pressure on the Minister of State or the Department in respect of this legislation.  I simply do not know and cannot speculate.  I am not privy to what has been said.  However, the Minister of State told us on Second State that she was mindful of the submissions.

In making determinations on licences, the forestry appeals committee determines that no errors were made in issuing the licence in question.

Amendment No. 47 relates to the question of notifications and what information is included in decisions, and amendment No. 45 is similar.  Due to the ruling out of order of amendment No. 40, we did not get to tease out this question that is also addressed in amendment No. 45.  In amendment No. 45, I ask that a number of factors would be reflected and included in the information concerning a determination that is made by the forestry appeals committee.  I am only going to focus on the most important one, which is that when it notifies an appellant of a determination, the forestry appeals committee should indicate to that appellant how it has considered the need or otherwise for an environmental impact assessment, EIA, or appropriate assessment.  This goes to the heart of amendment No. 40, which, unfortunately, was ruled out of order.<\/p><p>There is a real concern that, in the Bill as it stands, there is no requirement on the forestry appeals committee to consider whether an environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment is needed.  Of course, it may decide, and it is its prerogative to say, that an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment is not necessary, but it should at least consider it.  At the moment, the Bill only requires that it may screen for an EIA or conduct an EIA, or may screen for an appropriate assessment or conduct an appropriate assessment.<\/p><p>I am not suggesting that there should be an EIA or an appropriate assessment in every case.  However, when we talk about why this Bill is happening, one of the reasons is that there has been a large increase in appeals.  One of the reasons for that is because, in July, the then Minister, Deputy Calleary, admitted in the Houses of the Oireachtas that the licensing decisions that had been made had been found not to be delivering properly in regard to the habitat of birds and all of the various environmental directives.  We had European courts telling us we were not doing the licensing process right.  That obviously spurred a spike in people putting in appeals, because they are concerned about licences, given it has been admitted they had not perhaps been conducted with due regard to environmental factors.<\/p><p>Now that we have an appeals mechanism, please let us not make the same mistake and let us not have this appeals mechanism challenged because it also does not give due consideration to the question of whether EIAs or appropriate assessments are needed.  At a minimum, the forestry appeals committee, whether it takes one minute or five minutes to do it, should consider whether we need an EIA or appropriate assessment.  That is the basic point: not to do those assessments, but to consider whether they are needed.  If an appellant has put in an appeal and may be deciding whether he or she wants to take a case to the High Court, for example, the appellant should know whether the forestry appeals committee has considered the question of EIA or appropriate assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#TTTT00600","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins has set out her concerns very well and I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#TTTT00700","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I agree on the absolute need to ensure that the licensing system is robust enough in the first instance.  If everything were right and fitted the bill at the start, there would not be any appeals.  I acknowledge and appreciate that but it is not the job of the forestry appeals committee to examine and reissue licences.  The role of the committee is to ensure that the licensing process has been conducted in an appropriate manner.  It has the ability to, and surely will, examine whether it needs to have an appropriate assessment or an environmental impact assessment, or screen for those.  That is part of the process currently.  I do not believe a direction in that regard needs to be inserted.  What is proposed is part of what the forestry appeals committee undertakes so I will not be accepting the amendment.  I concur, however, that we must ensure the licensing system is robust enough to meet the requirements.

I am not going to labour my point about the committee but I really urge the Minister of State to re-examine it before she brings the legislation to the D&aacute;il.  There is a risk.  The legislation currently states that where the committee considers it necessary and expedient in making a determination, the committee \"may\" screen for an assessment.  It may not do so, however, and that is why it is important that the Bill address this.  Given the concerns over the first part of the process, and that the challenge led to the major appeals backlog, as acknowledged by the Minister of State, it behoves us to make sure we get it right at this stage.  This is worth addressing and considering further in the D&aacute;il.  I recognise that the Minister of State cannot accept my amendment now.  As the former Minister, Deputy Calleary, said in July, one of the drivers is that the process needed to be changed and improved.  That is the nub of the problem.  It would be a pity, therefore, if we were to embed an ambiguity where we could have clarity.  I recognise that the Minister of State may not be able to accept my amendment now but I appeal to her to  consider this matter before the legislation goes to the D&aacute;il because it will strongly improve the legal robustness of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#UUUU00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601026200,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 46, in the names of Senators Boyhan, Higgins, Boylan, Gavan, McCallion, &Oacute; Domhnaill and Warfield, is ruled out of order because of a potential charge of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#UUUU00400","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601026200,"counter":464,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 46 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 47:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:  \t <blockquote> \t&quot;(15) The notification and publication of a decision of the Forestry Appeals Committee shall contain information on the entitlement to pursue a judicial review in the High Court of that decision.&quot;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#UUUU00600","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601026200,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 48:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:  \t <blockquote> \t&quot;(15) The notification and publication of a decision of the Forestry Appeals Committee shall contain information on the entitlement to pursue a judicial review in the High Court of that decision, and that such a review shall be subject to no lesser standard of protection against costs than envisaged for applicants for judicial review under section 3 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, in order to ensure wide access to justice.&quot;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#UUUU00800","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601026200,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 49:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:  \t <blockquote> \t&quot;(15) When notifying an appellant of a determination, the Forestry Appeals Committee will inform the appellant of their right to challenge the Committee&rsquo;s decision in the High Court.&quot;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#UUUU01000","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601026200,"counter":470,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 50:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, line 30, after &quot;appeal.&quot; to insert the following:  \t <blockquote> \t&quot;Where, after a vote of the sitting Committee, the majority of the Forestry Appeals Committee is of the opinion that an oral hearing should be heard in relation to an appeal the Chairperson shall, as soon as may be, fix a date and place for the oral hearing.

The applications, which are more than 500 in number, involve everything from roadways to smallholdings to large holdings.  The industry and the people I have been talking to, particularly in west Cork, need to have actual product.  They are going to start importing from Scotland in the next few weeks.  As such, unless we can get out of the way and ensure that we can get large licences approved whereby large amounts of product can be felled in a short period, the jobs I am talking about in west Cork will be lost.  These jobs are in Grainger Sawmills, where 500 people will be moving to a four-day week from 1 October.  That will then go to a three-day week and to a two-day week and we will have a decimated part of rural Ireland because we will not have an industry going.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a practical part of this Bill.

On amendment No. 54, my main concern does not relate primarily to the idea of the Minister giving policy directives.  That may be appropriate and it may allow for an evolving policy so I am not strictly against the Minister giving policy directives.  There may be call for it and that is why I supported that amendment.  My main concern is the removal of that section if section 14D(2) was still in play.  Section 14D(2) is my real concern.  Section 14D(1) indicates that the Minister may give general directives to policy.  Section 14D(2) narrows, however, and says what must be prioritised in that.  With respect to Senator Lombard and others, I agree that there are times when there will be economic priorities and particular issues and concerns around particular classes of appeals in relation to economic issues or a need for a larger turnover or volume of product, for example.  However, this Bill is not simply for one group of people in one month or in one six-month period.  It is for the setting out of how our forestry appeals mechanisms will work and it is for the Minister to set policy.  There are many policy priorities and there will and should be times when other policy priorities might be set.  It would be inappropriate if a single goal were specifically placed over others as it is at the moment.  I put in 17 variations of amendments to this section because of these two lines in section 14D(2).

I was simply saying we do not know where they came from.  As we know that 99% of those who made submissions in favour of the Bill did not mention any policy issue, we know that such a suggestion can only have come from 1% of the 81% of those who submitted in favour of the Bill.  That is less than 0.81% as a potential source for this recommendation.  However, that is by the by.  What really matters in this House is the legislation and the powers of the Minister going forward.  As has been said, for all of us who care about forestry and who want Ireland to become a country with more than 11% afforestation and with a target of 30% afforestation, what matters is that we have good forestry policy.  The proposed new section 14D(2), as it stands, suggests that when making any policy directive to the FAC on how it prioritises appeals, the Minister \"shall have regard to the need to ensure an economically and environmentally sustainable yield of forest goods and services in the State\".  Again, this places the idea of a productive yield, which points to felling trees and producing forest goods and services, as a single goal or the main goal.  This is extractive language that talks about sustaining the levels of commercial product as something that must be considered before anything else may be considered.  That is really dangerous.  Section 14D(1) gives the Minister the power to make policy directives.  There are times when there may be an economic imperative to give such policy directives but there will also be times when there will be a biodiversity imperative.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It may be a biodiversity imperative that does not give us an economic benefit, even an economically sustainable economic benefit, but that is about the fact that, for example, 63% of our bird species are on the red and amber list.  If we get to a point of having only five remaining hen harriers in Ireland, the Minister of State may wish to ask the FAC to prioritise such appeals as relate to the concerns about hen harriers.  That is an example.  Luckily, while there are concerns, we are not at that point with hen harriers.  At times the Minister must be able to talk about a social, biodiversity and environmental imperative that is not about an environmental product, service, commercial entity or commercial product.  At some time in the future, such considerations may be a priority for the Minister or another Minister.  I inquired about these two lines because I was concerned about the way they appeared in the Bill, as they were not in the heads of the Bill, and I was told that it was thought to be useful to set out principles.  <\/p><p>I have a number of amendments but I will only talk about three of them; I do not want to take the full day to do so.  Each of them took thought and reflected genuine, positive approaches to the giving of policy directives to the FAC and the kinds of principles that should or might be considered when deciding to issue those priorities.  I will read one example because I have lists, and they are variations, but I genuinely try to reflect even the priorities of the Government.  In amendment No. 57, I suggest that the Minister of State, when making a policy directive, might consider \"(a) the Sustainable Development Goals, (b) the climate change and biodiversity crisis, (c) Ireland&rsquo;s targets in respect of emissions reduction, (d) biodiversity, [which is part of the Minister's remit and part of her title as Minister]\" or any one of the EU directives, and I will not list the numbers, in respect of birds' habitats and wildlife.  The Minister might have regard to principles of the national pollinator plan and the idea of just transition.  I reiterate that what will be needed in the forestry industry is just transition to a different model of forestry industry as the old model will change with the change in markets internationally and the change in climate criteria.  In my amendment I suggest the promotion of broadleaf planting and continuous cover forestry, which are two stated goals that have been talked about and very slowly introduced into our forestry policy.  It refers also to social impact and public amenity.  Finally, and this is one of the crucial points, we have a forestry programme that will expire in four months.  When the Minister of State is considering giving policy to the FAC, she should look to this national forestry strategy that all of us will develop together.  A basic point should be that she should look to whatever those agreed principles in a national forestry programme are and that that will guide her in giving directives so that, for example, the FAC will consider appeals in a way that is complementary to our shared forestry strategy, which, I hope, will contain environmental, economic, biodiversity and social elements.<\/p><p>That is an example of some of the principles that could be brought into play.  The Minister of State may not be able to accept any of the variations of those principles so I outlined versions that took out some, left in others, changed directives, and took out anything that was not in the law and put in everything that was in the law.  I tried to keep to established policy; nothing that I wish for myself but issues that have been agreed as national policy.  Failing that, I ask that she would delete that section, bearing in mind that she still has the freedom to give directives, if required, in respect of large-scale felling, thinning licences and so forth.  She can give directives as she wishes under section 1.  She should not tie her hands, the hands of a future Minister or the hands or the credibility of a future forestry national programme by curtailing her capacity to give directives by placing one issue above another.  <\/p><p>The Mackinnon report pointed to the fact that there is a tension between some of the commercial purposes and the climate purposes we require from our forests.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The text in the Bill makes that call very clearly on one side of what has in the Mackinnon report been recognised as a very difficult balancing act.  If the Minister of State cannot accept these amendments, I ask a small thing: that she could consider either amendment No. 61 or amendment No. 71, which very mildly remove the most egregious language in the Bill, which is \"yield\".  This is the core of an extractive language.  We are talking not simply about economically and environmentally sustainable practices, industries or products but, with the world \"yield\", about the physical produce.  With that language, \"yield\", in the Bill, it would become difficult for the Minister of State to prioritise thinning over clearfell, for example, because thinning would result in less of a yield in very blunt terms when we talk about an economically continuous yield.  It would result in less of a yield or a more prolonged yield.  I would like the Minister of State to indicate if she might be able to support any of these 17 amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#ZZZZ00600","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I call Senator Ruane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#BBBBB00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins has covered it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#BBBBB00300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":496,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome to the House.  It is a pleasure to have a Minister of State appointed from the Seanad.  I have listened with great interest to the debate.  I do not wish to prolong matters this late in the evening, and my colleague, Senator Hoey, has admirably put forward the Labour position on the Bill.  Looking at this very substantive group of amendments, and in particular the amendments Senator Higgins debated, amendment No. 57 and related amendments, it illustrates how unfortunate it is that we have seen the Bill rushed through with such tight timing and without the adequate time we should be able to give to debate these very important principles.  I know that many others, like myself, were contacted late last week by the Irish Environmental Network and other non-governmental organisations.  In recent days these organisations have expressed real frustration at the lateness with which the Bill text was produced and expressed concerns about aspects of it.  These concerns and the very real issues that have been raised deserve far more time than we can give in this truncated, rushed debate on a Friday, with Committee and Report Stages taken together.  I know that that point has been made quite a number of times, but looking particularly at amendment No. 57 and the very important issues that have been set out by Senators Higgins and Boyhan in the amendment, which we in the Labour group support, we see the importance of specifying what issues the Minister should have regard to, such as a just transition, which is so crucial, the sustainable development goals and so on.  Senator Higgins has tabled variations of the amendment, and I urge the Minister of State to at least take on board one of the variations and the sentiments and very sincere reasoning behind them in light of the rushed nature of the debate.  We should at least have been able to put something in the Bill that would specify these priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#BBBBB00400","speaker":"1631"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I call Senator Boyhan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#BBBBB00500","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I will wait to hear the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#BBBBB00600","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators.

I should clarify the intention of this provision.  It is that the Minister may ask the FAC to prioritise in certain circumstances a certain class of appeal over others, not necessarily one individual appeal over another individual appeal.  All appeals will, of course, be processed, but there may be specific circumstances in which there are grounds for prioritising one type over another.  To be clear, there are only three classes of licensing: afforestation, felling and licence granted for roads.  They are the only three classes with which the appeals section can engage.  Thinning licences are covered under felling licences.  They are not a distinct class in the current model.  I believe this provision would be lightly used.  It is found in other examples, including in the planning Acts.  Furthermore, it would be a fully transparent process, which is essential.

The concern is that any new fees will be set at a level that will discourage the making of appeals.  Based on the Minister of State's own admission that the appeals system is overloaded, this is a concern for individual citizens who may be on low incomes or for groups with an interest in the environment or forestry who may make multiple appeals at the same time and who may struggle with the cumulative cost attached to such appeals.  Our concern, therefore, is that the cost of the appeals will not be set at a level that is appropriate or proportionate to the cost of actually processing the appeal, which is why we have tabled these amendments today.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State will be aware, under the Aarhus Convention, we have an obligation to facilitate and indeed encourage the access of citizens to environmental planning, and it is specifically stated in Article 9 of the convention that countries that are party to it shall provide \"adequate and effective remedies, including injunctive relief as appropriate, and be fair, equitable, timely and not prohibitively expensive\".  As the Minister of State will see from our amendments today, we have drawn directly some of the language from the text of the convention.  I hope that, purely on those grounds, she would consider accepting them.<\/p> <p>In the amendments in this group we have tried to provide the Minister of State with a number of options on how she might improve the fees section.  If she were to accept even one amendment, it would provide key reassurance to the stakeholders involved that she is listening to their concerns.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 83 would require the Minister to provide for a full refund of an appeal if the appeal was eventually successful.  I am not sure if amendment No. 83 was ruled out of order.  In amendment No. 84 I have drawn language straight from the Aarhus Convention to ensure that any fees that are set would be fair, equitable, not prohibitively expensive and would not discourage the making of an appeal in the first place.<\/p> <p>In amendment No. 85 I have set out a number of key points that the Minister should consider when setting the level of fees, including the importance of promoting public participation in the forestry sector, our international obligations, the importance of public involvement in environmental planning, the public good afforded by experts, and the public being able to make appeals.  This is a particularly important amendment due to the extraordinary lack of detail the Minister of State has provided on how she will set the level of those fees.  As she will be aware, it has been affirmed in multiple decisions in our courts that when the Oireachtas gives a Minister power to set key regulations, such as fees via secondary legislation, the Oireachtas must set out the principles and policies that underlie how the power is exercised.<\/p> <p>In this section 14F the Minister of State has not set out any factors that will influence how she will set these fees.  Without such detail, any fees she sets under the section could actually be struck out by the courts on such grounds.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would therefore be in the Minister of State's interest to accept an amendment in this vein and I urge her to do so.  If accepted, amendment No. 82 would give the Oireachtas a role in approving the proposed fees.  I should be clear that I do not want a circumstance where every single fee has to receive our approval in the House but where the Minister of State has set out no limits, principles, policies or oversight mechanisms for these fees, it may be one of the few options remaining.  Finally, amendment No. 86 provides that along with prescribing fees for appeals, the Minister of State would also prescribe a scheme that would allow for a waiver of the fee where the appellant was in circumstances of financial hardship and could not afford the fee as a result.  It seems a reasonable ask on behalf of those who are worried about their access to environmental justice on the grounds of cost, and would prevent inability to pay from being a barrier to participating in the forestry planning system.  We have given the Minister of State a number of options, along with the amendments tabled by other colleagues, for how to proceed on the fees issue and I urge her to accept even one of them to indicate that she is listening to the concerns and how they could create a barrier to participation in this important sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#GGGGG00900","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":531,"content":"<p>Senator Ruane has set out the concerns we have around fees and the requirement under the Aarhus Convention for them not to be prohibitively expensive.  We are not aware of what the fee will be.  If it is to be aligned with the planning process, starting at &euro;220, the cost would accumulate very quickly.  Appeals on forestry are very different from appeals on planning permission and the costs can quickly add up.  That point was made on Second Stage on Wednesday and I am reiterating it today.  We do not want any set of fees to be prohibitive of accessing justice.<\/p> <p>I would particularly like to make a point on amendment No. 81, which is around the role of environmental bodies and decision-making.  I think everyone would agree that the environmental NGO sector in this country has done incredible work carrying out the job the State should be doing in upholding our obligations under environmental law.  Given the situation with Covid, every charity, NGO and organisation is crippled in terms of finances and membership fees.  I ask that the Minister of State give due consideration to the exemption of environmental NGOs from the fees process.  I am sure nobody in this House would say that environmental NGOs are putting in appeals of a vexatious nature.  They are fulfilling a very important role and are hard pressed, especially at the time of Covid, and having to lay off staff.  I ask that the Minister of State as a Green Party Senator give due consideration to an exemption from fees for environmental NGOs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#HHHHH00200","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601026200,"counter":532,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I refer to amendment No. 79:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 10, line 7, to delete &quot;in specified circumstances&quot; and substitute &quot;where an appeal is upheld, or where it is consistent with justice and in the public interest to do so&quot;.   <\/blockquote> <p>I would be interested in hearing the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020092500002#HHHHH00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1601026200,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators.  While I appreciate the sentiment that fees should not be applied, there is a necessity to strike a balance between recouping some level of the cost while allowing access to the appeals system.  This is in line with other planning processes.  It is our intention to set reasonable fees that are not prohibitive and will represent only a fraction of the cost of conducting an appeal.  The initial submission fee will be set at a very low level so the public also has a chance to engage at that stage, before it even gets to the appeal.  People really should be getting involved with making a submission at the start of the process when the notification of the licence is made.  There is a month there for decisions to be made.
