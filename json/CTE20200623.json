Ms Kimberly Clarke is with us instead.  She is a member of our organisation who works in north county Dublin and currently has great difficulty in obtaining childcare in order to allow her to work as a front-line worker in addiction services.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly discuss our submission.  We will concentrate on the effect on our members, including front line nurses and midwives, of the restrictions on childcare.  Members will see from our submission that in the background we set out the problem we had, namely, that the HSE has implemented a moratorium on recruitment since last May.  Therefore, our staffing levels were particularly compromised.  We have a significant reliance on overseas recruitment, particularly from non-EU countries.  Statistics provided by the nursing registration board which demonstrate that last year 1,819 of the nurses who registered in Ireland were from non-EU countries, predominantly the Philippines and India, are listed on page 2 of our submission.  Given the travel restrictions imposed since Covid-19, they are obviously not in a position to travel and help us to maintain staffing in our health service.<\/p> <p>  The second major issue that has affected staffing levels has been the infection rate among healthcare workers.  At present, Ireland is top of the league and has the highest infection rate of healthcare workers globally.  That is an absolute scandal.  We have sought figures and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, instructed that figures be issued on a weekly basis when he met us two weeks ago.<\/p><p>We have now got the second set of figures, following on from that meeting with the Minister for Health.  These again confirm that 88% of those infected who work in the health service got the virus at work.  In other words, this is an occupationally acquired illness or injury and they, therefore, have to absent themselves for 14 days to self-isolate.  We know from the figures that we received last Friday that 4,823 healthcare workers remain out sick, and \"still ill\" is the category that is stated.  We know that 1,600 of those are categorised in the category of nurse or midwife.  We have asked the HSE for the workplace settings but it has not been able to supply them to us as yet. <\/p><p> This obviously puts enormous pressure on rosters.  As the committee will be aware, nursing and midwifery provide a service across the 24-hour cycle, so childcare has always been very difficult and requires a lot of juggling and preplanning.  Some 92% of nurses and midwives are women and in order for them to continue in the workplace, they need to have a very robust childcare service available to them.  That is often formal and informal, and it also relies heavily on partners and on the school system being open.  What we have found is that, since the restrictions began on 13 March, when schools, cr&egrave;ches and registered childminders were closed, this has become a huge issue for our members. <\/p><p> As to what we have done, page 4 of our submission notes that we surveyed our members to see exactly what arrangements they had in place pre-Covid-19.  We found, as I have just set out, that 27% of all of those who responded, and we had a very large response rate, were reliant on cr&egrave;che, childminder and childminder in the childminder&rsquo;s home.  If members look at the column that shows the position during Covid-19, they can see the drop in that figure, for obvious reasons.  Cr&egrave;che was completely removed from the equation, childminder in childminder&rsquo;s home dropped from 29.7% to 7.8% and childminder in the person's own home went from 11% to 13%, which is a slight increase.  Many of our members rely on grandparents to provide an out-of-hours service and pickup from school when the shift pattern has not concluded.  The figure for grandparents in the survey went from 32% to 10%.  Obviously, preschool, primary school and secondary school were no longer available.<\/p><p> This was a huge problem, therefore, for the nursing and midwifery workforce, many of whom had to rely on taking annual leave or extending and changing their pattern of taking parental leave, which is unpaid, to maintain the employment contract.  Ms Kimberly Clarke is here as one of those people who had to use eight weeks of her leave to ensure she could maintain the employment relationship. <\/p><p> The big issue, of course, is that a majority of our members are female, and 96% of those who responded to the survey stated they were female.  Many of our members are lone parents and the problem was particularly more problematic for them.  One of the lone parents responding to our survey said one-parent households cannot afford extra childcare since the schools closed, and another stated there is no thought for single parents who are front-line workers.  Some 60% of those who identified as lone parents responded that Covid-19 restrictions caused additional expenditure for them in order for them to be able to attend work on the front line, where they wanted to be. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#B01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I ask Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha to conclude.

To start, I wish to note that a worker who was nominated to appear before the committee today was not available due to staff shortages in the area of operation.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of my union SIPTU, I am honoured to meet the committee today to discuss childcare for healthcare workers during the pandemic.  At the outset, I will briefly introduce the SIPTU health division.  It is a multi-grade representative health division with more than 42,000 members.  Our membership covers a variety of settings, including nursing, midwifery, healthcare assistants, diagnostic and therapy health professionals, phlebotomists, the national ambulance service and support grades.  Our division covers all areas of the health service including acute care, mental health, care of the older person, community care and intellectual disability.<\/p> <p>  While we note childcare is not an issue solely related to the gender of the parent, it must be stated that the contacts SIPTU received were overwhelmingly from working mothers who were desperately trying to secure childcare so they could go to work as essential healthcare workers in all the grades SIPTU represents.  The following average applies to female gender balance within the relevant workforce: nursing and midwifery is 90.6%; health science and diagnostics is 78%; household is 80.2%; catering is 69.1%; healthcare assistants is 76%; home helps, who are also referred to as healthcare support assistants, is 96.4% and ambulance control is 50%.  It should also be noted that SIPTU membership was represented within the following family demographics: co-parenting where both are essential workers, co-parenting where both are essential health workers and lone parent healthcare workers.<\/p> <p>  In reference to the issue of childcare for healthcare workers during the pandemic, it is not an exaggeration to confirm that this has been a leading issue for our members since the lockdown was enforced in mid-March 2020.  The issue stands alongside several other key challenges which arose, such as lack of provision of personal protective equipment, PPE, lack of testing capacity, clusters in nursing homes and infection rates of healthcare workers who were becoming sick due to their work on the front line.  Publicly, the HSE announced a survey had been undertaken to ascertain the number of healthcare workers who required childcare support.  The HSE stated that the figure was 7,000.  It is important to advise the committee that SIPTU representatives are unaware of any survey being undertaken and, if it was, how it was advanced given the challenges arising during the lockdown.  To date, no member has advised SIPTU that he or she was offered or requested to participate, or participated, in the HSE survey to establish the childcare needs for essential healthcare workers.<\/p> <p>  SIPTU representatives suggest that the experience our members have had over the last number of months in seeking to secure childcare for their small children has been deeply frustrating, challenging and emotionally distressing as they have striven to meet the balance of ensuring the safety of their children while also ensuring that they were able to go to work and provide essential healthcare to their local community.  In order to afford appropriate consideration of the challenges arising for healthcare workers securing childcare we must remember the environment within which these needs were arising.  First, all childcare facilities were closed.  Second, grandparents were cocooning.  Third, childcare workers were reluctant to provide care in a healthcare worker's home due to concerns of infection risk given the role of the parent in the health service.  Fourth, where childcare was able to be sourced members frequently conveyed their frustration at the increase in costs and their inability to fund this.  Fifth, rosters within the health service are atypical and cover a 24-7 and 365 day service.<\/p><p>Given the combination of the deficit of childcare facilities and grandparents cocooning, the usual means of meeting roster challenges outside of Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. were not achievable.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, other factors also arose due to the rules which were put in place concerning general public health and the specific instructions which were given to public service employers which could not be departed from.  Throughout the pandemic, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued regular updates and instructions through documents on frequently asked questions.  These were designed to achieve uniformity across the public service in the instructions concerning application of Covid-19 leave and other matters.  SIPTU argues the focus of the Government Department was to achieve uniformity rather than to find a fit which would assist parties in developing suitable arrangements to meet workplace and home life needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Bell to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#E00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1592866800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>As the opening statement has been submitted for the record, I will just summarise.

This model was used in other countries to ensure essential healthcare workers could get to work in the safe knowledge their children were being cared for.  Instead, the focus was on uniformity with rigid options only being approved which resulted in the loss of essential healthcare workers to the service and loss of annual leave or financial loss to the healthcare worker.

We see from our own daily count of trolley figures that the numbers are already going the wrong way.  We are up to more than 130 people on trolleys today.  The health service will continue to be busy and healthcare workers, including the nurses and midwives we are representing today, are very clearly saying that a better plan must be arrived at to make sure they are not financially at a loss and having to pay for their ability to come to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha"},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Mr. Bell spoke about the lack of flexibility in regard to accommodating healthcare workers.

That is not something we are proud of.  We strongly believe that there were two policies that directly influenced the situation.  The first is that a shortage of PPE created a situation where supply was more important than protection.  In other words, we were having meetings with the HSE about decisions, for example, on the wearing of face masks.  We had to lobby and cajole the HSE.  I think I wrote six letters in all, seeking to introduce a policy whereby the wearing of face masks would be mandatory and they would be provided for all healthcare workers.  We had a situation where one of our members was sent off duty because she attended duty with a face mask.  She was advised by her management that it was against HSE policy and she was actually sent home.  That became an industrial relations matter which we then resolved.  On 22 April the HSE's policy for the mandatory wearing of face masks by all healthcare workers was introduced.  We saw a dramatic drop in the number of infections of healthcare workers from that date onwards.  When we raised that with the HSE it stated that at the same time there was a coincidental drop in the general infection rate of the population.  We do not accept that.  We believe that face masks should have been mandatory from the very beginning in every single healthcare setting because our testing and tracing was not, and still is not, sophisticated enough to determine who is infected and who is not.  We have also learnt that asymptomatic presentation, in other words, people with no symptoms, can still be infectious.  Therefore, waiting for somebody to develop a temperature before he or she started wearing PPE was a mistake.  That is particularly relevant in the community sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha"},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha very much for her reply.

Through freedom of information, we had to seek the dialogue that took place between five Departments.

I want to start with the 18 May deadline.  That was the deadline that was fixed in the minds of all of us here in terms of the expectation that childcare for healthcare workers would be provided at that point.  I am talking about the roadmap.  That deadline was missed.  What I find extraordinary, and this what I would like to get a view on from both SIPTU and the INMO, is the litany of correspondence between the INMO, in particular, and the various line Departments.  I have the dates here in the INMO's submission: 6 April; 16 April; freedom of information requests in respect of 8 April and 9 April; again two more on 9 April; on 27 April; and even on 6 May.  There seems to me to have been a very proactive and progressive attempt by the INMO to engage with the HSE and through the ambit of NPHET and the line Departments in respect of putting in place something to meet the deadline of 18 May.<\/p> <p>  If I look at the evidence base here, based on the litany of correspondence, I would have to conclude objectively that there was never going to be a serious attempt on the part of the HSE, NPHET or even any of the line Departments to provide any kind of childcare for healthcare workers.  I would like to get the reaction of the witnesses to that.  It seems to me that there was no concerted effort.  There was maybe a bit of pageantry being gone through, a bit of choreography, or a pretence that they were going to deal with that issue.  I would like to get the perspective of the witnesses on whether they felt they were taken seriously as healthcare workers in respect of whether the Government was actually going to come up with a scheme that was fit for purpose and to which everybody would subscribe.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the scheme up to 18 May, it was going to be devised along the lines of childcare professionals going into the homes of healthcare workers.  In my opinion, for what it is worth, and I would love to hear the witnesses' opinion, they had never fully worked through what the protocols around that would be.  It seems to me that what we are at here is the Government is going through a charade in respect of taking the issue seriously.  That is the first point.

We recruit from EU countries as well, but non-EU countries were our biggest single registration bloc last year.  We know that, due to travel restrictions, these nurses and midwives will not travel to Ireland to work here.  We also know that the UK has made specific travel arrangements that allow Irish workers to travel to the UK, and the UK is very aggressively recruiting our graduates.  We have promised our graduates in nursing and medicine posts on graduation, but they have had that promise for the past three years.

Again, we believe that was a mistake considering that we now know that asymptomatic people also could transmit.  Therefore, we believe those policies should obviously be removed - the face mask one is; the derogation one is still there.  We believe the HSE should very definitely issue a retraction of that policy.  It simply cannot say that a health worker who does not have a temperature, even though he or she has been a close contact, should not isolate for 14 days like everybody else.  Of course, they should.  Fourteen days should be mandatory for healthcare workers, as it is for ordinary members of the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha"},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Michael Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#Q00300","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1592866800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>A Chathaoirligh, I wish to make a contribution in response to the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bell"},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

This is a big question we will need to consider for all grades, including nursing, midwifery, the ambulance service, support service and healthcare assistants.  That is the complex conversation we will need to get into.  At the end of the day if Covid-19 still exists, health workers with underlying health issues must be facilitated and protected.

No matter how often the promise was publicly announced - in some cases the public were told it would be resolved in days - nothing happened.<\/p> <p>  Nurses and front-line staff were ringing me asking what they could do with their very young children.  This was highly frustrating, challenging and deeply stressful for each and every parent.  I sincerely sympathise with the front-line workers for the way they were treated.  They were putting their lives on the line for their country while also having the stress and worry of wondering how they could resolve their childcare crisis at home, bearing in mind most of these had grandparents who were often cocooning.<\/p><p>It is clear from talking to many of these front-line workers that they felt they were left on their own.  In many cases there were couples who were both front-line workers and the inability of the Government to resolve the childcare crisis for them meant that in a few situations one of them had to pull out of work and stay at home, which in itself was a huge loss for the front line.  Many others had to send their children to relatives and friends many miles away and went without seeing their children for weeks on end.

We have to examine how we view female workers, particularly those who have childcaring responsibilities.  On the one hand we are a State that says we completely embrace women who go to work, but we still have a gender pay gap and issues with real childcare provided by the State that would allow women to really participate in the workforce.  This is a reflection of our overall position in respect of the provision of childcare, because women want to work.  Our members wanted to contribute during the pandemic and they did.  Many of the sacrifices they made, particularly around childcare, have been set out in our submission.  They went above and beyond what would be expected and that has to be compensated in the first instance.  They cannot be at a loss.  In the next number of months to the end of this year we have to make sure that any annual leave they have spent is repaid to them.  The same should apply to parental leave and any costs over and above what they normally would have paid should be reimbursed.  That is very simple and the Government can do that immediately.  We also have to start treating women who go to work with respect.  That involves making sure that when they go to work they have absolutely secure childcare available to them that is appropriate for the hours they work.

I completely agree with every word she said on women's participation in the workforce and the role of childcare.  If I may say so, this pandemic has shown up how we have all come to think about it in an overly casual way.  As Mr. Bell said, we are reliant on the informality of help, whether it is an hour here or a pickup there, to deal with all of the additional things families require to be able to get through their working week and support and manage their children at every stage and children at different ages with different needs.  What healthcare workers have done in terms of their commitment to their work is simply without parallel in this period.  I feel very strongly that, at a minimum, they need to be reimbursed.  It is not the correct word and I ask the witnesses to forgive me.  Their work needs to be acknowledged, at a minimum, in terms of repaying them for this period with annual and parental leave.  <\/p><p> With that as a background, I ask Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha and Mr. Bell for some practical details on their submissions.

Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha made the point that this issue has not gone away and has not been resolved.  What can be done to rectify the situation for healthcare workers?  In particular, can the representative of SIPTU speak about the childcare and early years workers as well?  One thing this has shown is not only how invaluable the role of the front-line workers is but also how invaluable the early years and childcare sector is.  It has been neglected, unfortunately, as well as underfunded and taken for granted for a long time by the Government.  The pandemic has highlighted that.  What can we do, particularly in view of the fact that there is talk of a potential phase 2 and that there might have to be another lockdown?  We do not know that, but what can be done?  I doubt that anybody could sustain some of the examples the witnesses have given, such as spending weeks without their children and having to rely on family members.  Nobody should have to do that anyway, but it certainly could not be sustained into the future.  What do the witnesses see as the solutions that would benefit their members?  They should also bear in mind the people who work in the early years and childcare sector.

However, when we look back on the pandemic, there will be a number of aspects which we all will assume were weaknesses in trying to respond to the crisis.  Childcare has been one of the weaknesses in the sense that there seemed to be no understanding of the need for a structured childcare industry where people who are providing childcare, the childcare workers, are properly paid and supported and to ensure that the service is available at the direction of the State to provide childcare for essential workers.  While we are talking today about healthcare workers, there were other workers who were essential to the economy and they may have fallen into the same position of trying to provide various vital services but not having the back-up of childcare.<\/p> <p>  The Government must have a stronger input into the provision of childcare.  At this stage, taxpayers' money is being used to fund childcare and provide services, but when it came to the crunch on this occasion, there seemed to be an understanding that somewhere along the line the Government and Department of Children and Youth Affairs were remote in trying to encourage or having a say in the provision or direction of childcare services.  That is a weakness, and it has caused problems in the health service.  It is something on which the Government will have to reflect.  Regarding the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, it might interest the Deputy, and I believe my colleagues here will confirm this, that we did not speak to that Department until about 12 or 13 weeks into the emergency.  That engagement was provided after the failure of the initial childcare proposal, which we knew from the start was going to be very difficult to implement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#U01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bell"},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Can Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha respond on the same question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#U01100","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1592866800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>The most important aspect of the question is what we are going to do now.

The SIPTU members were not surveyed on the survey we have spoken of, and the only survey I am aware of that we can verify here is the survey by the INMO.  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha has been reduced to seeking a whole series of freedom of information requests to try to gather information on what has been happening and, no doubt, what is proposed to happen.  I believe this to be an absolutely shocking indictment of where we stand currently.  Where stands the morale of the INMO workers at this point?  It has been made abundantly clear that nine out of ten nurses and midwives are women, and equally the vast majority of healthcare workers are women.  One wonders if nine out of ten of the workers were male with childcare responsibilities, would we find ourselves in the position we find ourselves.

On morale during Covid-19, our members have felt extraordinarily proud of their contribution and have stood very tall due to there suddenly being an understanding in general terms about the massive contribution they make.  On morale in that respect, our members report that they are extraordinarily proud of their achievement.  When one looks at the Covid-19 statistics in the State, it is not a coincidence that the numbers of people who recovered and walked out of intensive care units did so.  It was because people got excellent nursing care.  It was also because they were nursed prone, which is recommended.  It takes a lot of work and a lot of concentrated clinical judgment and clinical expertise to ensure this happens.  As a representative of nurses and midwives, I am extraordinarily proud of the numbers when I report them internationally.<\/p><p>The number of citizens and other people who live in this country who have recovered from Covid-19 is remarkable.

Why is the State resisting the involvement of the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, in examining why infection rates were so high?

I will not repeat the background information about our sector, which is included in our written submission.  Suffice to say that Ireland is the joint lowest <i>per capita<\/i>investor in early years care and education in the European Union.  Our sector was already facing a diverse set of challenges on 12 March when the Government announced the closure of all childcare settings.  A number of key events have occurred since for which the timeline is outlined in table 5 of our submission.<br\/><br\/>As it stands, the primary focus of many settings is the re-opening that is scheduled to take place next Monday, 29 June.  The past three months have been extremely challenging for the early years sector.  From the sudden closure of settings in March, to the extension of the closure to the lack of clarity beyond August, the uncertainty is having a profoundly stressful impact on providers.  We acknowledge the additional supports that were provided to early years settings by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs as part of both the bespoke wage subsidy scheme and in the reopening package.  However, the need for special measures is in itself a tacit acceptance of the pre-existing precarious nature of the sector.  The issues of insurance, staff recruitment and retention and the viability of settings have not gone away and have, if anything, been exacerbated by the Covid-19 crisis.<\/p><p>Early years care and education is an essential service that allows a society and economy to function.  This will become even more apparent post-Covid as people adapt to non-traditional working arrangements.  Aside from the rights of babies and children to avail of high-quality early years experiences, a well resourced and sustainable early years system will be essential for this new economy to function.<\/p><p> When settings reopen next week, parents should not be expected to pay higher fees for the same or less service in order to ensure sustainability.  The answer to this is not direct payments to parents or tax-breaks to offset costs, rather it is ramping up investment in the national childcare scheme and implementation of the First 5 strategy.  The progressive universalism as outlined in First 5 must remain central to investment.<\/p><p> Lack of clarity on the post-Covid funding model after August is causing anxiety to providers, who are planning for reopening on 29 June with no clarity on the financial model which will be in place after the summer.  This is also true of settings that will reopen for the first time in September.  Central government needs urgently to engage with the sector and develop a plan on how funding needs will be met.  It must be acknowledged, however, that our sector is extremely diverse and problems cannot be resolved with a one size fits all solution.<\/p><p> While providers have largely been on board with the reopening guidelines, and this is as a result of proper stakeholder engagement, time will be needed to allow children and practitioners adjust to the new normal and work out the kinks.  Additional capital grants funding will need to be made available swiftly to ensure that settings can meet their obligations under the new guidelines, and to meet capacity and distancing requirements which will impact on staff and parents.<\/p><p> Increased capacity must not be at the expense of staffing levels or sacrificing quality standards.  The pre-existing issues with regard to recruiting and retaining staff will have been exacerbated by Covid as some workers elect not to return to work and travel restrictions inhibit the return or recruitment of workers from outside Ireland.  The Government needs to give serious consideration to how staffing levels can be maintained in this context.<\/p><p> We welcome the highlighting of the role grandparents and other family members play in providing care and support but public funding needs to remain focused on consolidating the fragmented care and education sector.  We include childminders in this cohort, whom 87% of the public wish to receive Garda vetting and basic training for their important roles.<\/p><p> The Covid-19 pandemic had an immediate and profound impact on the early years and school-age sector.  The response from Government was salutary, in that the provision of a bespoke wage subsidy scheme, which covered 100% of staff wages, acknowledged the fragility of our member settings.  On the other hand, this also demonstrated recognition of the importance of childcare to the rest of society and economy.<\/p><p> The Government and other policymakers now have an unprecedented opportunity to act to increase investment in the sector, as envisaged in the First 5 strategy.  Early Childhood Ireland recommends that, along with a funding plan which brings Ireland from the bottom to the top of the EU investment plan, the actions envisaged in First 5 to develop a new funding model and a proper workforce plan are prioritised without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#MM00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Heeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1592866800,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for this opportunity.  My name is Paula Donohoe.  I am a private provider.  I am a member of the national committee of the Association of Childhood Professionals and I am joined here today by Ms Marian Quinn, its chairperson.  I will provide the committee with a brief summary of our Covid experience.<br\/><br\/>On 12 March, the word came through from An Taoiseach that we were to close our services at the end of that working day.  In my case, and in that of many of my colleagues, the first we heard of this closure order was from parents arriving at our doors.  It gave us no time for planning.  That evening, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs wrote to providers and assured us that the closure was covered by <i>force majeure<\/i>so we would continue to be paid under the various fee subsidies schemes for the duration of the announced closure.  However, with the closure of services, most providers were concerned about loss of parental fees and the resulting unsustainability of their services that endangered their ability to pay overheads, including staff wages.<\/p><p>What ensued amounted to an information vacuum that was filled with speculation, misinformation, media interpretation and generally unhelpful commentary.  This had the natural effect of raising already heightened stress levels and communicating with our families and staff became difficult.<\/p><p> The announcement of the temporary wages subsidy scheme, TWSS, and the temporary wage subsidy childcare scheme, TWSCS, on 25 March was welcomed by many providers because it allowed us to maintain contact with what we consider to be our most valuable asset, namely, our staff.  An extra difficulty with this scheme was that sole traders were excluded from the TWSS, as were employees who were not on the payroll in January and February.  A further challenge was that the TWSCS payment was sufficient for some providers, while others needed to take out micro-loans to cover non-deferrable overheads.  Following the eventual issuing of the TWSCS funding agreement on 15 April, three weeks after the initial announcement, 85% of services signed up for the scheme.  Time will tell how this support has helped us to remain viable.<\/p><p> Having overcome the funding and wage issues, the next milestone was phase 1 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business on 18 May and the provision of childcare for front-line healthcare staff.  The issues with this failed scheme have been widely reported and it is accepted to have been a non-runner from the start.  The issues relating to insurance and HR had been communicated in advance of the roll-out of the scheme.  It has to be said that there was willingness on behalf of the providers and educators to provide such a service but not in the format it was being offered.<\/p><p> We then turned our focus to phase 3 and 29 June.  Thankfully, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs heard the concerns of providers and agreed that it was more feasible to merge phases 3 and 4 and to open services to all families previously connected with our services.  We are to prioritise families involved in essential work followed by those families with children with disabilities or from disadvantaged or vulnerable backgrounds.  If we have further capacity, we can then roll it out to the remainder of families within our services.<\/p><p> The announcement of a capital grant and a reopening grant, to help offset the costs involved in reopening under the new play-pod model, is positive, as is the reinstatement of the funding schemes, coupled with the simplified version of the re-registration process.  The announcement that the fee subsidy schemes were being reactivated offered a reassurance to our parent body and allayed many of its fears regarding the costs involved in childcare.  However, the very late notification of the funding model &ndash; a mere 12 working days prior to reopening - caused the now familiar stress levels to rise, as again we worked in the dark, while trying to plan a reopening without knowing if it would be viable.  The pod model of provision was first mooted on the floor of the D&aacute;il Chamber on 20 May by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  We, the providers, educators and parents, had no clear idea how this was to work.  This proved to be extremely confusing and still poses confusion among the professional and parent body alike.  Thankfully, the Department has now provided useful supports for parents, providers and educators on the First 5 and Let's Get Ready websites.<\/p><p> In the childcare sector, we are used to working to stringent hygiene standards and are familiar with the risk analysis required to maintain a safe and hygienic environment.  This is a regular part of our daily practice and is manageable with the proper supports in place.  The additional Covid-19 health and safety requirements that must be implemented throughout our working day are a further responsibility for the staff team and will entail the need for supplementary staff over and above the regulatory requirements.  Extra personnel will be required for: managing arrivals and departures; enhanced cleaning and; additional administration.  The enhanced staff team may be possible for providers because of the TWSS being in place as between 70% and 85% of the wages will be covered under this scheme, leaving the smaller portion to be covered by the provider through fees and subsidies they receive.<\/p><p> The summer months are naturally a quieter period in most services and due to Covid-19 we would anticipate an even greater reduction in the demand for childcare.  This should mean that we have staff available to cover this extra work.  However, this assumes that we can afford to pay for these additional staff and that all our staff will be in a position to return to work.  Some staff will experience difficulty returning due to family care needs and may have underlying health concerns of their own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#NN00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Ms Donohoe and I am sorry for the mix-up earlier.

Crann Support Group is a community voluntary organisation working to improve and enhance the governance and operations of community childcare organisations through the provision of shared business services.  Crann Support Group is responsible for the administration of in excess of &euro;7 million and maintains assets to the value of &euro;5.6 million.<\/p><p>Crann works within the principles of community development.  We believe that by working together we can achieve more.<\/p><p> There is no doubt but that the recent pandemic has been a challenging time for our society as a whole.  I take this opportunity to commend the Government, in particular the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, for providing us with the infrastructure to be able to maintain the continuity of the employer-employee relationship.  In doing so, we were able to continue to support our children and families through the use of our in-house communication tool, Child Paths.<\/p><p> It goes without saying that childcare has undergone many changes in the past ten to 15 years.  In this time we have seen investment from the Government, starting from a very low base; the making compulsory of QQI qualifications - a minimum of level 5, level 6 for preschool, as we now strive to have 60% degree-led; and an increased number of inspections from Tusla, Pobal, DEIS and environmental officers to ensure compliance with regulations.<\/p><p> On 5 February, tens of thousands of early years childcare providers, educators demonstrating their support and parents took part in a protest in Dublin city calling on the Government to provide increased funding to reduce fees for parents, to introduce a recognised pay scale for early years professionals and to support the sustainability of the services.  Current research demonstrates that 60% of early years childcare professionals earn less than the living wage.  This factor has a great impact on the retention of staff.  According to the Early Years Sector Profile Report 2018\/2019, nationally, on average, there is a 23.4% annual turnover of staff within the sector, with 23% of services reporting vacancies and 53% reporting difficulty recruiting.  While we acknowledge that these statistics are marginally down on previous years, the Government needs to focus on a robust governance structure that would provide for strong, effective leadership and Government investment in career and salary structures for the sector.<\/p><p> In May, the NCCF, in collaboration with the Association of Childhood Professionals, ACP, and the National Childhood Network, NCN, carried out a survey of both community and private providers to indicate the effects of Covid-19 and the difficulties in reopening.  There were over 3,500 responses, and 2,500 providers completed the survey.  The indicators were that 98% stated they would have some level of financial difficulty in reopening and 79% stated they had concerns about staff returning, with the greatest worry for staff being the health implications for themselves and their families.  Reduction of staff hours or staff redundancy was an issue, as was the need for access to Covid-19 testing.  Other issues included cross-contamination and the financial implications of operating on reduced ratios.  As an air of confusion, insecurity and anxiety floated through the early years sector, it became very evident that Crann services were needed.  The need for the services provided by Crann increased by 400% over the pandemic due to the lack of confidence within the community sector to identify the necessary actions to prepare for the reopening of services.  The Crann support team had the necessary professional experience, knowledge and skills to amalgamate the guidelines from the relevant authorities.  There was a statutory requirement for a Covid-19 document for the safe reopening of services.<\/p><p> Regarding the HSA and the back-to-work protocol, on 8 May Crann support teams started to work on the list of things needed for the Covid-19 response document.  The committee can see my written statement for details.  There are many benefits of a shared services model similar to that of Crann.  These benefits have been documented following a recent external evaluation of the Crann model by Trinity College Dublin.  The Trinity College research team has highlighted that the model allows member organisations to focus on core business activities; gives confidence and reliability in management and human resource services; gives access to significant expertise and knowledge working within the non-profit sector; gives confidence and reliability in the accuracy and efficiency of accountancy and payroll services; oversees compliance with statutory law; maximises training of qualified personnel; and is cost-effective, with substantial savings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#OO00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I will stop Ms Daly there.

When it is reported that &euro;75 million was put into early years services, it puts huge expectation on service providers to open next week and be available for parents.  The reality is that some services will still have sustainability issues.  If their staff are not eligible under the wage subsidy scheme the providers will have to find the full level of funding to be able to pay the wages for those staff members.  If staff were on reduced wages, were out sick or took leave in January or February, then their average wage would be lower by Revenue's calculation than what their employers are going to have to pay them.  Effectively, their employers will have to pay the full wage.  All those things are going to add to the providers' financial outlay while there will be limitations on their incomes because they will not come back with 100% capacity for children.  We will only see over time how that capacity will increase across the summer.  Without a doubt, there will be sustainability issues.

There are two questions.  First, why did they not take them up, what are the issues and is there any learning from that going forward?  Second, what is the likely outcome?  There was concern that many of the providers who were not taking this up were planning to close or might have been forced to close.  This speaks to the issue of sustainability, the availability of placements and the cost of placements.  If the providers represented here can provide any insight into those issues, it would be useful.<\/p> <p>  Looking forward, there is the committee on reopening yet what I am hearing from the providers is that they are operating in the dark, there are still a lot of things to be worked out and there is a lack of information.

The members of Early Childhood Ireland to whom I have been speaking were mostly relieved with the package, which gave them some certainty for the next eight weeks.

Providers are now trying to work through that reality in terms of what they are able to do, what is expected of them and what information is untrue.  One will hear media reports about the pod system being inhumane.  We have seen international images where children were in chalked out boxes and they were not allowed to engage with other people.  One also hears about social distancing.  However, the reality of social distancing and the pod model is different in an early years service.  It will be adults who will be social distancing from each other whereas the children's needs will be met.  If they need hugs, reassurance or the supports of the adults, they will get them.  They will be able to engage with the children who are in the pod.  What that means is that it is just a structure of a group of children together and they are not going to be interacting with other children or other adults from it.

The messages they are imparting to us are well rehearsed, perhaps, in that they have spoken on these challenges previously.  My first question relates to the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  If it is the case that public funding accounts for approximately 58% of wages in the sector, is it now time to consider continuing with the temporary wage subsidy scheme for the providers who will reopen in September and to use that as a launch pad to build out the employment rights and proper wages akin to people's qualifications, so we can get the wages element of this resolved once and for all?  There was an opportunity, which was articulated very well to me by Darragh O'Connor of SIPTU recently, whereby this could have been a launch pad for resolving the wages element of this.  We see the high rates of attrition and the fact that some people will now cease to avail of the temporary wage subsidy scheme as it relates to the childcare sector.  This has created a massive amount of uncertainty, which the witnesses have just articulated.

It was very regrettable that it took another three weeks to sort it all out and it certainly caused great anxiety.

We therefore, as a society, need to grasp that nettle.<\/p> <p>  I will move to my second and final question.  There are many disparate groups representing childcare interests.  I have to be honest; they are all excellent people but there are many different voices and I believe that now is the time for the sector to unite as one voice because it is sometimes difficult for us, as politicians, to distinguish which group represents what interest.  I put it to the witnesses, as advocates on behalf of children and parents and as providers, that now is the time for some sort of citizens' assembly to look at the future of childcare provision and the early years sector in Ireland.  Perhaps it is time to consider having one coherent voice in that regard because, quite frankly, if I was not spokesperson for children, I would be largely ignorant of the childcare model.  I am telling the truth in that.  I am a father of two young smallies as well, so I have a particular interest in this area, but sometimes speaking with one voice is more coherent and can strengthen one's message in interacting with Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#WW00300","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I thank the different groups that have come in to talk to us.

She said that children have largely been invisible during the pandemic except when they are being blamed and called superspreaders and vectors.  The discussion around children has largely been negative.  That has been very problematic.  Children as a group were not hit from a health perspective but mental health issues will impact on them much more than on other cohorts and groups in our society.  I have been very vocal about the need to incorporate advice from psychology experts into development of policies relating to children and their transition back into normal childcare and educational settings.  It is being recognised that the mental health curve is the next curve we will have to flatten.  We have not had the necessary focus on that issue recently.<\/p> <p>  My question relates to those psychological supports.  Do the representatives think their organisations' members are sufficiently resourced and have the capacity to identify and respond to the emotional, social and psychological challenges children may face when transitioning from a family setting and lockdown scenario back to the cr&egrave;che environment?  As a mother of four, I know that a lot goes on in their heads that they may not be able to verbalise.  Childcare settings can provide somewhat of a family setting.  When one has the right childcare provider, they become a member of one's family.  There is an opportunity that children will open up when they go back to those settings.  Are providers ready for that?  Have they received the proper guidance and supports from the Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#WW00400","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1592866800,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy very much for her question.

The Department, in its submission to the committee, states that the scheme of childcare for essential healthcare workers had to be cancelled because it was not possible to meet all the requirements that would have made it attractive to providers.  Ms Grant referred to the insurance element.  Can she elaborate - briefly, because we are stuck for time - on any other elements that were an obstacle to the scheme's introduction?  Were they just insurance-related or were they also to do with premises costs such as the payment of rents and rate?  Was a lack of sick pay a factor?

When it comes to going into somebody's home, one is looking at employer law and services having to take responsibility for supervising the people who would be going in there.  That would have left our staff open to allegations that might be made against them.

I did not believe for one minute that the witnesses did not consider it valuable or worthwhile to participate in the scheme.  There were obviously very complex obstacles for the sector.  However, several of the witnesses have mentioned the fractured nature of the services and how there are so many different organisations overseeing different aspects of it.  Believe me, I am not the witnesses' enemy.  I think they are all wonderful and I know lots of childcare providers and workers in my own community.  However, it strikes me - this is a point the witnesses may not like me making - that one of the problems we have is that this country has the highest level of private childcare provision in the whole of the OECD.  The levels are huge compared with other countries, with the data showing that 99% of children attending pre-primary education are enrolled in private facilities, compared with an OECD average of 34%.  Other Deputies talked about the need for a conversation and probably citizens' assembly to look at the issue of childcare provision.<\/p><p>We really have to cop on in this country and look at the public provision of childcare in the same way as we look at the public provision of education and health.  That should not exclude the witnesses or the very dedicated and highly trained workers who work with them.  Instead, I believe it should encompass them.  We need to start to look at such a public model because the data show the benefits of it.  The Nordic countries are always the best.  I have seen that at first hand as my two nephews grew up in Sweden.  In Sweden, they spend 1% of GDP on childcare and we spend approximately 0.4%.  There are higher returns for children with high levels of public investment.  That high level of public investment also leads to better security and better returns for the parents and a higher level of maternal workplace engagement.  It would probably have gone a long way towards helping to solve the problems we had with front-line workers.  The fees are lower for parents and in general the outcomes are much better.<\/p><p> I emphasise that I am not opposed to those in the private childcare sector; I am on their side.  In the brief time we have left I ask the witnesses to comment on the need to move to the public provision of childcare and to a higher spend of GDP on childcare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#XX01000","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1592866800,"counter":281,"content":"<p>We are not disputing that we need to look at a different model or that we need to consider the situation going forward, but the reality is that childcare in Ireland has grown up in the way it has because of the lack of Government interest or investment, or it has not been seen as a priority.  In the absence of that, it was something women in the local community set up for each other to support each other.  That was gradually extended to families and then to being based in a centre.  That has been the reality for between 40 and 50 years.  We are looking for a new model now that will incorporate the brilliant work that has been done by providers for many years in the absence of that level of investment.<\/p> <p>  The big fees in Ireland are due to the lack of Government investment; it is not that the provision in Ireland is hugely more expensive than in other countries, it is because the fees for parents are not subsidised.

The person speaking also highlighted the fact that a second person would be needed to provide cover for somebody going to the loo and when parents come to drop off or collect a child.

The difference is that the children in the 1-2 room will not socialise with the children in the 2-3 room.  Each room will have staff looking after the children and there will be relief staff.  We will not put a third staff member in as we could not afford to do that but another staff member will provide relief and lunch breaks.

When one is increasing from a very low base, however, any multiple of increase will still be very low, relatively speaking.  We are communicating.  There have been repeated budget submissions and engagements.  The Department is well aware of the level of funding, and it would also be able to identify the level of funding that might be needed by the Department to get where it wants to go.<\/p><p>It is about convincing the Department of Finance and all the other Departments that are around the table of the level of investment that is needed.

In some instances, quite a number of parents - or a majority of them - have said they could really do with that service but, unfortunately, the providers are unable to be involved in the scheme for opening because it is predominantly for those services that typically open.

There are providers that try really hard to provide a pay scale.  The problem is that Ireland is the joint lowest investor in the EU.

The package of supports is due to the fact that services are going to reopen with fewer children and therefore less income and with the range of debts that have been incurred during closure.

I am joined by Ms Bernie McNally, Dr. Anne-Marie Brooks, Mr. Toby Wolfe and Mr. Mark Considine.<\/p> <p>  The closure of all centre based early learning services and most childminders from 12 March was necessary due to Covid-19, but it has had adverse effects on children as well as bringing major challenges for the sustainability of the sector.  In dealing with this issue, the Department's primary concern has been to meet the needs of children and families and to do what is best for them.  We also want to do all we possibly can to help sustain the early learning and care and school age childcare sector.  We are conscious that, unlike schools, the State does not either own or almost fully fund this sector.  In fact, public funding accounts for approximately 58% of childcare providers' income in what is essentially a private sector system.  Parents account for the remaining 42% of income in a sector that has approximately 75% for-profit and 25% non-profit or community services.<\/p><p>We recognise that the sector operates in a very challenging environment with low pay and a high turnover of staff.  The Department&rsquo;s work to support the sector is focused on promoting high quality, affordable and accessible childcare.<\/p><p> When services closed in March we moved, as a first measure, to guarantee State funding through the existing early childhood care and education scheme and the national childcare scheme, which incorporates the older legacy schemes.  These operated from 13 March until early April, by which time we introduced a temporary wage subsidy childcare scheme, operating to 28 June in conjunction with the corresponding Revenue scheme.  This system has protected parents by guaranteeing no parental fees for participating providers for the duration of the scheme.  It has also protected childcare workers by ensuring that up to 85% of them could retain their pre-Covid-19 income and maintain a relationship with their employer.  This helped prevent losing them to unemployment and possibly not returning to their jobs.  Our focus was on helping providers to maintain viability to the greatest possible extent.  The result was that the temporary wage subsidy childcare scheme supported just over 3,900 providers, which represents some 87% of the sector, and some 22,670 staff at an estimated cost of &euro;77.3 million to the Department.<\/p><p> The Department has worked intensively with the sector on a plan for the phased reopening of childcare services from 29 June.  We are grateful to the sector, including the members of an advisory group that has met once or twice every week since the middle of May, for the advices and collaborative perspectives they have offered.  Again, our first concern was for the safety and welfare of children and staff.  Critical to this was the public health guidance we received.  We worked in collaboration with the Department of Health, the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to ensure the sector was provided with expert guidance on how services could be managed when reopening and what arrangements and procedures were needed to minimise the risk from Covid-19 to children, families and staff.<\/p><p> Estimating likely demand for childcare services between 29 June and early September is a significant challenge.  The planned reopening on 29 June occurs at a time of year when just 40% of services would normally be open.  That is 1,800 out of approximately 4,500 providers.  We are conscious that demand may be lower to start but may rise as parents seek to return to their own work and to more normal living and feel greater confidence regarding the safety of their children.  However, compared to pre-Covid, demand this autumn may be lower because of job losses among parents or because of more flexible working that allows families to better balance caring and working responsibilities.  Overall, we anticipate that demand for places will rise progressively over the summer and autumn but we are in uncharted waters this year and we cannot be definitive about uptake.<\/p><p> In turn, this brings challenges with regard to the type of funding model that stands the best chance of successfully supporting the sector in the weeks and months ahead.  The Department developed, and the Government approved, a significant funding package for the period from 29 June to 23 August.  At &euro;75 million, it is more than two and a half times what we would have projected to spend in a normal year for this eight-week period.  The Department&rsquo;s written submission to the committee sets out the details of the funding package, comprising the Revenue temporary wage subsidy scheme, resumption of the Department&rsquo;s existing funding schemes and two further supports: a reopening grant to the value of &euro;18 million and a capital grant totalling &euro;14.2 million, with a further fund of &euro;375,000 for certain childminders.<\/p><p> We have sought to offer clear advice about the practicalities of reopening.  We have developed a suite of guidance documents for providers, practitioners and parents and we are updating the website regularly as further guidance is developed.  We have sector-specific advice on preparing to reopen, a health and safety checklist, and frequently asked questions for providers and practitioners as well as separate frequently asked question documents on reopening and on funding.<\/p><p> The Department is strongly committed to doing all we can to support early learning and care and school-aged childcare services in reopening.  We believe it is vital that services can do so to the benefit of children and their families.  Not all our efforts have been successful.  The scheme of childcare for essential healthcare workers had to be cancelled because it was not possible to meet all of the requirements that would have made it attractive to providers.  This underlines the difficulty of putting in place at short notice often complex measures that meet public health requirements and the concerns and needs of providers and parents.  However, we have continued to work hard with the sector to do everything possible to make the reopening on 29 June a feasible proposition, again within the boundaries of where we must operate for the safety of children and staff.<\/p><p> We have worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills to support the transitions for children returning to services.  The joint initiative, Let's Get Ready, which was launched on 15 June, seeks to help parents and children with the transitions for children returning to, or going to, preschool for the first time and for children moving from preschool to primary school.<\/p><p>More recently, our focus has been on getting ready for the first phase of reopening on 29 June.  While it is difficult just yet to predict the situation that will apply after this initial eight-week period, we have commenced planning for the 2020-21 programme year, which we propose to start on 24 August.  The Department will review demand and supply over the next few weeks and we will consult stakeholders before finalising the programme from August.  We will seek to finalise these arrangements as quickly as possible, having analysed the outcome of the initial reopening phase in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> Finally, the committee may wish to note, regarding the wider development and improvement of early years services, that the European Commission, in its recent semester report on Ireland for 2019, has noted substantial progress in increasing access to affordable and quality childcare.  There is much more to be done, and I am referring to this simply as an indication of the road travelled to date and the progress made from a low base in recent years.  In the time available, I have highlighted some of the key points of importance to this issue.  A much fuller and more detailed treatment of these matters is contained in the Department's written submission to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#RRR00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Lynch.

We heard earlier from representatives of the unions for front-line healthcare workers that there were zero consultations with their own Department regarding what we now know was a failed childcare scheme proposal.  I welcome the advisory committee that was set up in the past few weeks but it really should have been put in place at the very start of all this, not in the middle of May.  The group has worked well and I want to know whether the Department is committed to keeping it in place and inviting relevant groups to participate as the process develops.  For example, the union representatives should be brought in to discuss any childcare scheme for front-line workers.  If the advisory group had been in place from the start, maybe we would have got a scheme that actually worked.  Since it has been up and running, consultation has been a lot clearer and better, from what I can see, and it is key to many different issues.  Can we get a commitment from the Department - I hope there will be a Department in the future to fulfil any such commitment - that the advisory group will stay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#TTT00300","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1592866800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I certainly can give a commitment that we will retain the advisory group, which we have found very helpful.  The group has met once or twice a week since the middle of May and we have worked very collaboratively with it to produce very positive results.  To deal with the Deputy's point regarding what was discussed this morning, ideally we would have had much earlier-stage consultations, including with the unions.  At the time, for practical reasons, that simply did not prove possible because of the nature of what we were dealing with in a very compressed time period.  We were essentially operating off a very limited number of options.  The public health requirements in particular effectively would have limited us to one of two options, namely, either childcare workers providing a service at home or else a limited opening of services.  It became clear very early on in our discussions with NPHET, which was very helpful, that the only game in town was childcare workers going into the homes of healthcare workers.  We were very limited in our options and what we could discuss with others.<\/p> <p>  It is fair to say that we have a good record of consulting, generally speaking, throughout the Department on all sorts of issues.  It was unfortunate that we did not have an opportunity to do that in the early stages of the development of this particular scheme but I certainly can give a commitment that we will continue to consult widely, going forward, in regard to the schemes.  With particular reference to the advisory group, it has been a good group which has met, as I said, once or twice a week since the middle of May.

I have been asking about a sustainability fund for the childcare sector and the one that exists for community services.  I have not got a clear answer as to whether that fund will be used to help childcare facilities that now have debt due to the Covid closures and may not be able to reopen.  I would like a reassurance from the Secretary General that there will be a sustainability fund to assist them.  Otherwise, there will be closures and job losses.<\/p> <p>  I also want to ask about the wage subsidy scheme.  Can a commitment be given to continue the payments under that scheme at the full rate, not the 85% rate?<\/p><p>As Dr. Lynch said in his opening statement, the very reason it was set up was to keep people in the sector, and we will see them leaving the sector.

I would emphasise that the scheme we have put in place for the next eight weeks includes a capital scheme of &euro;14.2 million and a reopening grant totalling &euro;18 million.

Due to the new arrangements requiring the pod system and the same children with the same childcare worker, the model is essentially disrupted because they do not have this physical space to be able to keep people separate enough.

This year, the package that is available is &euro;75 million, as Deputies have heard previously.  There is significant extra money going into the sector in the knowledge that some parents will not return and, as such, the sector is losing parental fees.  That package of measures is expected to be sufficient.  To begin to make a profit, providers will need to get either 40% of parents back or maybe 20% and charge some kind of retention deposit for July and August.

I acknowledge that it has been a difficult period and that a great deal of work has been done by the Department in challenging circumstances.  I want to come back to some of the previous points that were made.  Seeking to develop a policy to provide a specific childcare service for front-line workers and not including the representative bodies of those workers in the discussions was a huge flaw.  It beggars belief that we essentially got to 14 May with a scheme that was bound to fail.  Dr. Lynch mentioned that the provision of childcare in the homes of front-line workers was the only option available.  However, the INMO gave us documentation this morning - and I am not sure if Dr. Lynch and his colleagues have received it - which provides a breakdown of the front-line workers and the types of childcare provision of which they currently avail.<\/p><p>It shows that 30% of them use childminders in the childminder's home.  Perhaps the Department did examine this, but it seems to me there was a possibility of continuing arrangements for children of front-line workers who had existing arrangements with childcare minders.  Did the Department look into this possibility?  If so, what were the barriers to utilising it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#AAAA00600","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1592866800,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Yes, we did look at that and a range of other issues.  I will ask Ms McNally to comment on that in a minute but I will first say that in proposing what we proposed, we were conscious that a smaller informal scheme which was being organised online successfully matched approximately 1,400 people who were willing to provide childcare to essential workers.  Obviously, they faced the same sorts of issues we were conscious of, including the insurance issue and concerns about rest breaks, unfamiliar working environments and so on.  We looked at a range of issues.  At the time, however, especially in the early days, when there were such concerns about doing anything that would relax the public health restrictions, the key issue we were brought back to the whole time was, obviously and understandably, one of public health.  I am not in any way criticising NPHET for the conclusions it reached at the time but one of those conclusions, from our having looked at these issues, was that this was the only possibility that could be developed at that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#BBBB00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I have only a couple of minutes and I have another question.  Two things have become really clear over the course of Covid, the first being that in the absence of childcare, women are left holding the baby.  The second, which has become blatantly clear, is that women can no longer be left holding the baby while also trying to hold down a job.  We will have to address this.  We have to get the childcare requirements of families right.  I think there is a real risk at this point that if we do not get childcare right for families, we will have a two-tiered workforce system when we return to work and women will be left behind.  It will be women who will be required to stay at home or, perhaps, take jobs that offer more flexibility but lower wages.  I think there is a real risk that women's participation in the workforce will be very negatively impacted if we do not provide proper childcare facilities.  Has the Department conducted a gender analysis of the lack of childcare and its impact on specific sectors?  We see that the caring sector, including nursing, is heavily gendered.  Has the Department provided a gender analysis in this regard?  If not, is it willing to do one?  My second question in that regard is this: Has the Department had any discussions with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation about the impacts of lack of childcare on female employees and employers in the sector and in the business area?  Is the Department looking at pre-emptive solutions to mitigate any potential problems coming down the road?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#BBBB00300","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1592866800,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I will answer those questions.  Regarding female labour market participation, we have done a huge amount of work on a cross-government basis under First 5, the whole-of-government strategy for babies, young children and families.  That focused hugely on supporting women who choose to work outside the home to do so.  Not only did it look at childcare, but we also worked with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on paternity leave, paid parental leave and encouraging both partners, if there are two partners, to share that leave in order that it might be the woman who goes back to work and her partner who stays at home.  A lot is contained in First 5, which is a ten-year strategy up to 2028.  We work with the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Finance regularly as well on jobs and the economy, and we know that childcare is very much central to that.  First 5 commits to doubling the level of investment in childcare over the coming years to make it more accessible, more affordable, higher-quality and more flexible.  There was a draft childminding action plan that would reform childminding because we know that childminding is probably more flexible in some ways and responsive for parents who work shifts, such as front-line workers.  There is a lot of work in progress - a lot more to be done but a lot started - and the national childcare scheme that was developed just last November is also a potential solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#BBBB00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie McNally"},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I want to talk about the Oireachtas Library and Research Service report on public provision of early childhood education.  It is only a three-page report but I think it is a dynamite report.  The report finds that the key challenges to universal provision in Ireland - in other words, provision for all - are the negative economic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and what it describes as the market-driven approach to early childhood education and care in this country.  It states that early childhood care and education in this country is characterised by low state investment, low wages and high fees.  It states that 99% of pre-primary services, that is for children aged three to five years, is in the private sector, whereas the OECD average is 34%.  It finds that the average wage for workers in the sector is &euro;11.44 per hour, whereas the living wage is nearly a euro higher than that at &euro;12.30.  It finds that early childcare and education fees for under-threes are the highest in Europe alongside the Netherlands, the UK and Switzerland.  Earlier today the situation was summed up by the Desmond Chair of Early Childhood Education in Dublin City University, Professor Mathias Urban, who said the system here is fragmented, very expensive and does not produce good results for children, families or the state.<\/p> <p>  The report quotes from a survey done last year by Yerkes and Javornik which found high levels of access, availability, affordability and quality in countries which had public childcare systems, instancing Iceland, Slovenia and Sweden, and the opposite in those which had lower levels of state investment, instancing the Netherlands, Australia and the UK.  The report finds that in Germany when there was a switch to full public provision of childcare there was a decline in child abuse and neglect; an increase in child birth rates; an improvement in the social and emotional development of children; and, an improvement in maternal life satisfaction.  To repeat, it states that the obstacles to universal childcare provision are the economic consequences of Covid and the market-driven system.<\/p> <p>  There are no costings included.  Some will ask if the country can afford to move towards universal public provision.  I think in the light of this data and this report the question is framed the wrong way.  The question is, can we afford not to do that?  Low-paid childcare workers and hard-pressed parents would say that we cannot afford not to move towards this.  I would favour a system which is free and which is funded through steeply progressive taxation with particular concentration on the big corporations and the very highest income earners.<\/p> <p>  My question relates to financing.  Are there plans in place, and if there are can the witnesses describe what they are, to do some costings on the type of provision that is mentioned in this dynamite report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#CCCC00100","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1592866800,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  What he has described summarises very well many of the issues that we have been very conscious of for a considerable period of time and a lot of it would be generally accepted, including the issues of low State investment, high fees, low pay and so on.  There is no argument about those.  Obviously, I am not going to get into policy debate about what Government should do.  I will say that there is an expert group which is developing a funding model at the moment and that started around this time last year, I think.  That expert group has been working to help us develop proposals for the future in that regard.  The funding model that it could propose could, for example, operate in parallel to the existing schemes or it could propose something else but the key issue emerging from all of this work is the scale and complexity of it and the time it would take to develop a new funding model.<\/p><p>Among other issues it would deal with would be things like fee controls, the question of reasonable profits and how best to develop a system for the future.  I stress that it is a matter for Government to decide whether it wants to move to a particular different model, be it a public one or a mixed public and private one.  We are certainly doing extensive work through the expert group, which includes experts from other countries and people within the system here to develop proposals for the future in that regard.<\/p><p> Obviously, the cost will be a major issue.  The Deputy rightly identified that by comparison with other countries, Irish spending is low, although it has increased very significantly in recent years.  State funding of childcare has increased by about 141% in the past five years, but admittedly from a very low base.  We are starting from a low base and we have a significant expert group working on that funding model. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#CCCC00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I thank the departmental officials for attending today.

The Alliance insurance cost for a child in full-time care is about &euro;60 per child per year.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the risk of the sector, we would say this is a heavily regulated sector.  There are a number of safeties built into that which should be factored into any consideration of insurance and risk.  People in the sector will say they feel overregulated.

Health and safety, and other regulators also have a role in the sector.<\/p> <p>  We were due to publish the Crowe independent review of costs in April, but unfortunately Covid struck us.

Is it undertaking any mitigation exercises to allow them to come back into the marketplace which will be extremely difficult if they have not been able to cover their full costs over recent months?  For small businesses, dealing with Departments and trying to claim subsidies tends to be very onerous.  Does the Department have a digital dashboard in place in order that people can do this quickly and efficiently?  One of our contributors this morning spoke of having to give up 12 to 14 hours a day with the children to spend all her time managing her business.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that as well.<\/p><p>On the sole traders, it was regrettable that of about 4,500 providers in the sector, more than 1,000 are owner-managers who were not on the payroll.  Therefore, when the Revenue temporary wage subsidy scheme was developed they had no option to go on the temporary wage subsidy scheme as they were not on the payroll.  Their only option was the pandemic unemployment payment, so we could not top them up.  We topped up other providers but we could not top them up because they were not on the Revenue scheme and our scheme layered on top of that.  That was regrettable.  What we did to assist them was give them overheads and we continued to make 15% of their staff costs or about 10% of their operational costs available to assist them with other overheads.  As the Secretary General mentioned earlier, from 29 June they all will be able to open their doors again so they will have access to that &euro;75 million just like others, including the capital and the reopening grant.  They will not get the temporary wage subsidy scheme, so they will be missing out on that again.  In speaking to the sector about this, we have told them that if they can get another two children it would match their pandemic unemployment payment, and if they can get three extra children it would give them more income.  The doors are now open and they can come back in from 29 June and avail of this.  We hope that, come September, demand from parents will increase even further and the funding they can access through our schemes would therefore come back as normal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#DDDD00400","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McNally.

I will read them out and they might be able to answer them now but if not they might provide a written reply later.  Why did the Department pull all ECCE funding, which had devastating consequences for services?  Will the witnesses guarantee that they will never consider doing this again?

Just to be clear as regards the ECCE funding, when we moved to the new funding model of the temporary wage subsidy scheme for childcare, we basically repurposed our money.  The difficulty was that, while leaving the ECCE funding in place would have been fine for ECCE providers because it funded pretty much the full cost of what they were being exposed to, only 58% of all the funding comes from the State system, as I mentioned in my opening statement.  Therefore, the non-ECCE funders which are full-time providers of services would have continued to be at a major financial disadvantage.  We needed to spread the funding across a larger number of providers and while it was reasonable to continue the ECCE funding for the first few weeks from the middle of March to early April, after that it was clear that we needed to move to a different model, and that is what we did.  As to guaranteeing never to do it again, we need to look at the circumstances in each case.  Hopefully we will never go back to a situation where we need to close providers but that was a very difficult situation.<\/p><p> In terms of the number of services closing, I mentioned earlier that we have notification of 18 closures but that 17 new services have indicated an intention to open.  That is not unusual.  Every year a number of services open and others close.  The total number of places has increased significantly each year.<\/p><p> On the danger of there being a preschool desert, we hope that will never happen but we need to look at each part of the country and support the provision of services as best we can.  That very much depends on demand and supply in different areas.  As already stated, it is difficult to predict with any degree of confidence or certainty what the level of demand and supply will be over the next number of months.  We are facing into an uncertain period, there is no doubt about that.  The original funding model finishes on 28 June and the new funding model that will come into place on 29 June is based on trying to support, as much as we possibly can, the provision of childcare in an efficient, fair and reasonable way.  Above all, we need a model that works for the benefit of children.  We recognise that it is a very difficult environment to be operating in.  We know that childcare providers face a very difficult situation at the moment.  We have been as helpful as we possibly can in terms of developing a model that would assist them in the context of their operations.  We have been as helpful as we possibly can with regard to explaining and supporting the public health requirements, including play pods.  We are hopeful that we will have a reasonable number of well functioning services operating from 29 June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020062300002#EEEE00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592866800,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Dr. Lynch said that 18 services are closing.

We heard from a witness that she was up until midnight filling out forms.

However, there are two reasons for much of the administration.  One of these relates to regulation and regulatory requirements, which is coming from the perspective of child safety and child protection, so there is a certain amount they need to do.  We have seen the impact that poor regulation has on children and families, so it is right that there is a strong regulatory regime.  I note the draft programme for Government.  The previous programme for Government looked to us to streamline various inspectorates and so on, and we will work on that.  The second aspect of administration is associated with those services that are getting Government funding.  If they are not running any Government schemes, there is not that much paperwork.  If they are running our schemes, because they are in receipt of Exchequer funding, there are a certain number of rules attaching to that.<\/p> <p>  We are trying to lessen the burden.  For example, the national childcare scheme is a more IT-based system and the burden for providers will be lower with that than it was for the old community childcare subvention and training and employment childcare schemes.  That is one tangible example of what we are doing to try to reduce the workload on them.  We have also given extra funding and, for example, we have given the programme support payments to recognise there are a lot of the administrative demands on provider.

The applications have already started for the access and inclusion model, AIM, system which kicks in for ECCE from September.

We have had a well functioning early years forum for quite a period, which the Minister set up some years ago.  The advisory group we established recently for the current scheme has, I believe, also functioned well.  Certainly, the Department would be open to working with all the key stakeholders to ensure that we develop solutions for the future.  This has worked very well for the scheme that is to start on 29 June.

The Deputy asked about the childcare scheme which was put in place for front-line health workers and which did not work.  Did anyone in the Department raise a red flag to indicate that the scheme might not or would not work?  The question may have been directed at Dr. Lynch and the buck stops with him as the head of the Department.  Did he or any of his senior staff raise concerns that the scheme might not work?  When she responded, Ms McNally said that they hoped it would work.  That was not the question that was asked.  The question was not about whether the Department hoped it would work, it was about whether people within the Department had concerns, or had articulated concerns, to the effect that maybe the scheme would not work.

Second - this emerged later - was the concern raised by individual providers about rest breaks and arrangements of that kind.  In each instance, it is fair to say that we identified what the risks were.  As Ms McNally said earlier, we identified those risks but at no stage did we think that the scheme was \"bonkers\", which was the term used by Deputy Carthy.  We never believed that the scheme was bonkers.  Neither did we believe it was doomed to failure.  There were issues that needed to be overcome, and we were very much influenced by the fact, as referred to earlier, that there was an informal scheme then functioning - organised in an informal way - which got over all of these issues.  Insurance did not become an issue and the question of supervision did not become an issue.  Neither did any of the other concerns that were raised in the course of the process.  At no stage did we believe that the scheme was doomed to failure.  At no stage did we believe it was bonkers.  We had identified correctly a number of specific risks.

They waited four weeks for the plan to be announced, but when it was announced, it did not work.
