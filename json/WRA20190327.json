However, we must step up the scale of our ambition even further in order to meet our climate ambitions. It is my intention to set a target of 70% for renewable electricity by 2030.  <\/p>  <p>  I am currently developing an all of government Climate Action Plan, to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change, with actions across all areas such as heat, electricity, transport and agriculture according to strict timelines. <\/p>  <p>  Transitioning to green energy is an integral part of that Plan. Analysis and modelling to underpin the Plan is assessing a range of options to ensure that Ireland meets its 2030 climate and energy ambitions. It is my intention that our ambition in terms of renewable electricity will step up significantly from the 55% set out in the draft National Energy and Climate Plan up to the new target of 70%. The plan will identify a range of technical, regulatory, legislative and economic factors that arise in going beyond this figure. The impact on the costs of electricity, affordability for consumers and business competitiveness of setting higher renewable electricity targets also has to be considered. <\/p>  <p>  In order to meet the 70% RES-E target, major capital investment will be needed in new generation capacity, system service infrastructure and electricity transmission and distribution networks. A review will also be needed to the policy and regulatory framework to incentivise electricity storage, which will be critical to absorbing high levels of renewable generation on to the system. In addition, increased interconnection will be required to facilitate the large upscaling in onshore and offshore wind required so that we can balance the grid and ensure supply security. <\/p>  <p>  The new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is critical to meeting Ireland's contribution to the EU's 2030 renewable energy targets and will be designed to achieve its targets in the a cost competitive way. Private sector funding though corporate contracting will also be essential for meeting higher levels of ambition to increase renewable energy supply and deliver on long term decarbonisation of the electricity sector. This will also reduce consumer costs through a reduction in the Public Service Obligation levy.<\/p>  <p>  The intention is to finalise and publish the whole of Government Climate Action Plan within the next few weeks and this in turn will feed into the National Energy and Climate Plan process, which is due to be finalised and submitted to the Commission in December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700067#WRB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":32,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 64 and 65 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":33,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700067#WRB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[14202\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700067#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which the provision of broadband nationally is progressing in line with expectations; if the provision of services to the blank spaces between services within a reasonable time is anticipated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":35,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that every home, school and business in Ireland has access to high speed broadband.

In determining their willingness to enter into or remain in a particular sector of the market, insurers will generally make an assessment of what they consider the overall risk to be. Therefore, part of their assessment of what premium level to charge, or whether to offer cover in the first place will be based on what they consider the general likely trend for claims in the sector will be, based on their overall past experience.  <\/p>  <p>  In a recent meeting with Insurance Ireland, I understand that the Minister of State with responsibility for Insurance, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, raised the issue of the difficulties play centres currently face in securing insurance.  In response, Insurance Ireland highlighted the problems that Irish insurers encountered in this sector regarding claims and specifically the high amounts being paid out.  Having said that, Insurance Ireland agreed to relay Minister D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s concerns to its members taking into account some of the implemented and proposed Cost of Insurance Working Group reforms, including the proposal to implement the recommendations of the second Personal Injuries Commission Report.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which was established in July 2016, has undertaken a detailed examination of the factors contributing to the cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  <\/p>  <p>  The CIWG has produced two reports and a number of quarterly progress updates on the various recommendations made by CIWG and endorsed by Government.  The difficulties facing the consumer, voluntary and small business sector from the high cost of insurance premiums are recognised.  In addition, it is also acknowledged that in some cases the survival of a business as a viable entity is being put at peril because of insurance pricing.  One of the key areas raised by various stakeholders to the CIWG is the level of awards in this country compared with elsewhere.  As a result, the Working Group established the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) and commissioned it to examine this issue amongst other things.  The PIC reported in September 2018 and concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher here than in the UK and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council.  The PIC recommended that this body would become responsible for preparing the guidelines on personal injury award levels, and would replace the Book of Quantum.  In doing this, the PIC believes that the Judicial Council will, in compiling the guidelines, take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal, the results of its benchmarking exercise etc.  <\/p>  <p>  The current position with the Judicial Council Bill is that the Minister for Justice and Equality has recently advised of his intention to further this Bill with a view to having it in place as soon as possible.  Alongside this, the Law Reform Commission has included the subject of capping damages in personal injuries litigation in its draft 5th Programme of Law Reform and this work will begin in the next couple of weeks.  It is hoped that if there was a significant move in this area, it could have an impact on insurance pricing and could also help attract new entrants into the market.  Such outcomes would be of benefit to all concerned and in particular to small businesses such as those in the play centre sector.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, while I am very conscious of the difficulties being faced by the play centre sector in obtaining insurance and that a number of such centres face closure if they are unable to get cover, I believe that the work that is being done to address the cost and provision of insurance to such businesses is where the real solution lies.  It is likely that the provision of any support package would amount to the State in effect becoming an insurance provider. Such a step would likely be in breach of the Solvency II Directive and as it would involve the State providing preferential support to one part of the economy over another, it would run the risk of being consider State Aid and contrary to EU State Aid rules.  In addition, if a package of Government support, contained or otherwise available more generally to businesses, was put in place, it is also likely that such a measure could result ultimately in insurers withdrawing from large parts of the overall market.  This would end up being counter-productive and bad for small businesses in the longer term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700069#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Costs","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700069#WRD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[14309\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700069#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cumulative financial cost to his Department and other State bodies in dealing with the appeal against the decision by the European Commission in a tax case (details supplied); the amount paid to each individual provider of services in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019 in tabular form; and the nature of services provided in defending the position of the State in the case.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>There has been insufficient time to compile all the data in the time allowed and in the format requested by the Deputy.

I can assure the Deputy that supporting student wellbeing is a priority for my Department and for schools. <\/p>  <p>  In Early Years&rsquo; Settings, children are supported in their personal and social development through Aistear: the Early Childhood Curriculum Framework. Within Aistear, the theme of Well-being aims to develop children as confident, happy and healthy young people. Within Goal 1 of this theme, children are encouraged to make strong attachments and develop warm and supportive relationships with peers, be aware of and name their own feelings, and understand that others may have different feelings, be confident and self-reliant, respect themselves, others and the environment, and make decisions and choices about their own learning and development. In addition, under the theme of Identity and Belonging, children will learn to express their views and help make decisions in matters that affect them, understand the rules and the boundaries of acceptable behaviour, interact, work co-operatively, and help others, be aware of and respect others&rsquo; needs, rights and feelings, have a sense of social justice and recognise and deal with unfair behaviour, and demonstrate the skills of co-operation, responsibility, negotiation, and conflict resolution. <\/p>  <p>  At primary level, all teachers at primary level are fully trained in the implementation of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum which is taught at all class levels. The curriculum provides particular opportunities to foster the personal development, wellbeing, and social and emotional health of the individual child. SPHE promotes intrapersonal development by helping children to recognise, understand and accept themselves as unique individuals who feel valued and loved. It provides particular opportunities to nurture self-worth and self-confidence, helping the child to set and assess his\/her own goals and to be able to manage his\/her own behaviour. SPHE enables the child to build a sense of self-efficacy which in turn can increase his\/her sense of personal control, promote self-awareness and enable self-directed learning. <\/p>  <p>  At Post-Primary level, the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015 is underpinned by eight key principles that inform the planning, development and implementation of junior cycle programmes in all schools. One of the principles is Wellbeing.  Wellbeing permeates a student's entire junior cycle experience and is reflected in a number of the 'Statements of Learning' in the Framework. These provide learning opportunities that enhance the physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing of students and enable students to build life skills and develop a strong sense of connectedness to the school and to their community. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these curricular areas, learners are supported by a number of policy and practice initiatives that emphasise the reduction of bullying and the promotion of positive mental health. <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan on Bullying, published in January 2013, sets out my Department's approach to tackling bullying and promoting an anti-bullying culture in schools. It recommended 12 actions that focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying are addressed.  A number of these actions have been implemented in full while others by their nature involve continuous action and are the subject of ongoing implementation.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from the Action Plan on Bullying, National Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary schools, were published in September 2013 and are currently being implemented by all 4,000 primary and post primary schools in the country.<\/p>  <p>  The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying amongst their pupils.  The procedures require that the prevention of bullying must be an integral part of a school&rsquo;s anti-bullying policy. <\/p>  <p>  All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of the procedures. The procedures include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.  The strategies that schools implement must be documented in the anti-bullying policy and must explicitly deal with the issue of identity-based bullying.  Schools&rsquo; actions to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying are included in the whole school evaluation process carried out by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate.<\/p>  <p>  Other actions included in the Action Plan on Bullying include support for anti-bullying awareness raising initiatives and the development and roll out of anti-bullying training materials for parents, teachers and Boards of Management.  The Department funds anti-bullying training for parents via the National Parent&rsquo;s Council. The training sessions, which are available nationwide, provide supports to parents to enable them to assist their children when issues of bullying arise. They also inform parents about the Anti-Bullying Procedures for primary and post primary schools.  <\/p>  <p>  Also under implementation of the Action Plan, the national anti-bullying website, www.tacklebullying.ie was launched in 2013.  Funded by the Department, the website provides information, support and advice for students, teachers and parents on how to recognise and deal with bullying behaviour and allows teenagers to share experiences with their peers <\/p>  <p>  In July 2018, the DES published the Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice, which sets out indicators of success in wellbeing promotion in our education system. It requires every school and centre for education to use the School Self-Evaluation (SSE) process to initiate a wellbeing promotion review and development cycle by 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700070#WRE03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700070#WRE03900"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[14291\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700070#WRE04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress being made in providing a new school building for a school (details supplied); the timeline for this project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, a building project for the school to which he refers is included in my Department's 6 Year Construction Programme.<\/p><p>My Department is currently liaising with the patron of the school in relation to the delivery of the building project and is awaiting further contact from the patron in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700070#WRE04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Admissions","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700071#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[14304\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700071#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>The selection and enrolment of pupils is the responsibility of the management authorities in each individual school.

I would advise parents who have questions or views in this regard to discuss these with their school patron.   <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment of reaching 400 multi-\/non-denominational schools in Ireland by the year 2030. The Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process is aimed at assisting in achieving this target by transferring existing schools from denominational to multi-\/non-denominational patronage in line with the wishes of the school community.<\/p>  <p>  The process is composed of two separate and distinct phases - the Identification Phase and the subsequent Implementation Phase. The first Identification Phase of the phase 1 pilot process is nearing completion for 16 initial areas nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  In the Identification Phase, each of the country&rsquo;s 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) have selected an initial pilot area within their district where they consider, based on census data and local knowledge, there exists an oncoming demand for more diversity within the local educational provision. <\/p>  <p>  Surveys of parents of pre-school children have been carried out in these areas by the relevant City\/County Childcare Committee on behalf of the ETBs. ETBs, having analysed the survey results, then draw up comprehensive reports detailing the outcomes of the surveys in relation to each of the 16 pilot areas. <\/p>  <p>  This forms the basis of discussions with the most prevalent patron\/landowner in the area, which is the Catholic Bishop or Archbishop in most cases, concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school(s) to meet that demand. The response by the Bishop to any identified oncoming demand for greater diversity of school patronage in the area is included in the report prepared by the ETB, for submission to my Department, who will subsequently publicly publish the reports on its website. <\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the Identification Phase reports from the initial areas will be published in the first half of this year. <\/p>  <p>  Following the completion of the Identification Phase, it is intended that the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process will move into the Implementation Phase, which would involve the existing patron of the majority of schools in each area, i.e., the relevant Catholic Archbishop or Bishop, consulting with their local school communities on accommodating the oncoming demand for a greater diversity of patronage among the schools in their area. <\/p>  <p>  The transfer to a new patron should reflect the wishes of parents and the school community. The Department envisages that such consultation would include an outline of contingencies that may be put in place for parents who wish for their children to retain the current ethos of the school, having regard to local circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The Implementation Phase would also provide an opportunity for potential multi-denominational and non-denominational patrons to engage in a consultative process with the existing school community, affording the best possible opportunity for patron bodies themselves to inform parents as to the unique characteristics of their schools. This may include a meeting where prospective patrons could provide information to the school community. <\/p>  <p>  The Implementation Phase of the process has yet to formally commence. Draft protocols for the Implementation Phase are at an advanced stage of development and consultation with Catholic Church representatives is ongoing. <\/p>  <p>  It is also possible for any school community to directly engage their current patron, outside of the main reconfiguration process, and to seek a transfer of patronage to a multi-denominational patron, fast-tracking the patronage reassignment.  Already the first 'early mover' reconfiguration has successfully taken place, with Two-Mile Community National School in Kerry opening in September 2017.  I encourage any school which is seeking a transfer of patronage under the &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision to contact their school patron directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700071#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":215,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700071#WRF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":216,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[14360\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700071#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if students in a community or education and training board school in which the NCCA religious education course is mandatory under circular 0062\/2018 have a right to opt out of that subject in line with Article 44.2.4o of the Constitution or section 30(2)(e) of the Education Act 1998; if provision will be made to exercise the right to opt out of the course in such schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1434","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":217,"content":"<p>The Religious Education curriculum designed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is an optional examinable subject at Junior and Leaving Certificate. <\/p>  <p>  The Department does not require schools to include the NCCA-developed Religious Education syllabuses at Junior or Senior Cycle as mandatory subjects on their curriculum.

The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel using the Cohort Model is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, operational strategies and transfers applications, including welfare issues. When allocations are taking place, comprehensive consultation is carried out with Local Management during which all factors are taken into consideration. Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Galway Division on 31 January 2019, the latest date for which figures are readily available was 606. There are also 28 Garda Reserves and 77 Garda civilian staff attached to the Galway Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 41 members have been assigned to the Galway Division.<\/p><p>In relation to the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;, it is important to keep in mind that they have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme. While not all Garda Stations are training stations, it is important to note that the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer. <\/p><p>The Government remains committed to the recruitment of additional Garda&iacute; and accordingly has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year. The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and 600 Garda Civilian Staff.

The position is the same in relation to records of the Court of Criminal Appeal for appeals heard by that Court in 2013 and up to the 28th October 2014 when the Court of Appeal was established and inherited the jurisdiction previously exercisable by the Court of Criminal Appeal. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700073#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":301,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[14393\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700073#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the street value of cannabis seized by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in each of the years 2013 to 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":302,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is provided in the attached table from data available in the 2013 to 2017 annual reports of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the 2018 annual report is not yet published.<\/p><p>The continued disruption of the supply of all illicit drugs remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other state agencies tasked with responsibilities in this regard.

One intervention methodology which has developed as a response to criminal offending is victim-centred restorative justice.  It is a methodology which, by its very nature, is evolving and developing further in response to the challenges facing the criminal justice system.<\/p><p>The Probation Service has for many years played a key role in the delivery of restorative justice practice as part of its overall mission of reducing re-offending and further victimisation in our communities. It is engaged in work in courts, communities and prisons. On any given day, up to 10,000 offenders, who are at different stages in the criminal justice process, are registered with the Probation Service.  Although victims of crime may initiate a request for a restorative justice intervention at any stage in the criminal justice process, the interventions take place post-conviction. The interventions are part of court assessment and court orders, including community and prison based sanctions.<\/p><p>In the details supplied with this question, the Deputy refers to the recommendations contained in a study called <i>&quot;Sexual Trauma and Abuse: Restorative and Transformation Possibilities?&quot; <\/i>published in 2014<i>.  <\/i>This study examined the potential of restorative justice to address the aftermath of sexual trauma and violence.  Officials in my Department subsequently met with the author of the report and a research consultant to discuss the findings of the research.  At that meeting, a case was made for establishing a stand-alone restorative justice service; one of the arguments being that the Probation Service is aligned in the public mind with offenders, not victims.  <\/p><p>Following consideration of the matter, the then Minister took the view that the restorative justice model was properly located within the Probation Service. This view was informed by the expertise and skills of the service in working to reduce offending and victimisation in our communities, with the victim at the centre of this work.  The Probation Service has been providing restorative justice services since the late 1990s through experienced and trained staff and in collaboration with its dedicated Community Based Organisations.  I too am satisfied that the Probation Service has the expertise to continue its work in reducing offending and victimisation in our communities, including through the restorative justice model.  <\/p><p>After the meeting with the authors of the 2014 Report, the then Minister asked the Probation Service to examine and make a proposal for the provision of a restorative Justice pilot programme for victims of sexual crime.  In 2015 the Probation Service established a small two-year pilot programme, under the auspices of its Victim Services Team, to respond to requests from victims of sexual crime for victim-offender mediation.  The pilot operated within a dedicated national structure, with all services provided by trained, experienced staff  and with appropriate oversight and support.  A review of the programme was undertaken by the Probation Service, covering the period September, 2015 to January, 2018.  Its conclusions were that:<\/p><p>-  A timely and effective response was provided to all requests for victim offender mediation.<\/p><p>-  The availability of structured protocols to guide implementation was critical to ensuring effective and accountable practice.<\/p><p>-  There is a need to ensure that there is an even spread of expertise across prisons and community.<\/p><p>-  The provision of supervision and the use of peer support was central to the pilot and critical to safe and effective interventions.<\/p><p>-  Liaison with partner agencies and NGOs was positive.<\/p><p>A dedicated Restorative Justice and Victim Services Unit in the Probation Service, with a national remit, commenced operation in September, 2018.  This Unit provides leadership and support for the consistent delivery of restorative justice models across the organisation.  The work of this Unit will continue to support and monitor the safe and effective delivery of restorative justice services to victims.<\/p><p>In my response to D&aacute;il Question No. 167 of 13 March, 2019, I said that between January 2016 and January 2018 four requests for mediation were received under the pilot scheme.  It would not be appropriate for me to indicate if all four cases resulted in victim-offender mediation. This is because, while the process is entirely confidential and facilitated by trained staff, the numbers are small enough to allow for identification of the individuals involved. As a general point, the process is wholly voluntary with either of the parties having the option to withdraw at any stage.  <\/p><p>As to whether the existence of the dedicated restorative justice and victim services unit has been sufficiently widely advertised, there is on-going collaboration with victim advocacy organisations to facilitate contact by victims, as well as collaboration with other criminal justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prisons Service.  <\/p><p>The Probation Service engages in other activities both to advertise its work in this area and to learn from restorative practices elsewhere.  For example, it held a seminar on the subject of restorative justice during International Restorative Justice week last November.  The subject was also discussed with a number of advocacy groups at an event on 22 February, 2019 to mark European Day for Victims of Crime. The Probation Service also made a presentation at a conference on Restorative Justice held in Maynooth University on 1 March, 2019. This conference served as the Irish launch of a four year project called <i>&quot;Restorative Justice: Strategies for Change&quot;<\/i>which is taking place in nine other European countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700073#WRH02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fines Data","counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700073#WRH03000"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[14414\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700073#WRH03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number and amount of fines that were outstanding to the Court Service at the beginning of each of the years 2014 to 2018; the number and value of fines issued by the courts in the course of each of these years; the number and amount of fines collected by the Courts Service in the same period; the outstanding number and value of fines at the end of each of these years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":313,"content":"<p>My Department is compiling the information in relation to this matter from the Courts Service and I will contact the Deputy directly as soon as I have the information to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700073#WRH03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision Data","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700073#WRH03300"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[14423\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700073#WRH03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons with a registered disability residing in the direct provision system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1269","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":316,"content":"<p>Health services for protection applicants residing in RIA accommodation are mainstreamed.

This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland, following issues which had emerged in relation to the CervicalCheck screening programme. <\/p>  <p>  During 2018, there was a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This included women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening. This increased level of engagement with the programme is welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put pressure on lab capacity and turnaround times. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has been working closely with labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. In addition, the HSE is working intensively to put in place additional capacity, through extensive searches internationally. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE advises that the CervicalCheck Programme has recently agreed with laboratories to prioritise those slides which originate from women who attended colposcopy, as this cohort of women are considered to have the most serious need. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE also advises that the natural history of cervical cancer would indicate that the disease would normally develop over a period of 10 to 15 years. Due to this very fact, it is important that any woman of screening age attends for cervical screening each and every time she is invited to participate. The HSE has advised that in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results, whilst undesirable, is not necessarily dangerous and poses a very low risk to women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700076#WRL01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700076#WRL01900"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[14431\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700076#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for a dispensary (details supplied) in County Roscommon in view of the retirement of the general practitioner; his further plans for the provision of community primary care services in the area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for it to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700076#WRL02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists Data","counter":427,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700076#WRL02200"},{"type":"question","counter":428,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[14443\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700076#WRL02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the waiting lists for neurology treatments by CHO area in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1269","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":429,"content":"<p>Reducing waiting time for patients for hospital operations and procedures is a key priority for Government.

Lyme disease is a notifiable disease in Ireland since 2012.  Lyme disease is a well-recognised infection, which is familiar to GPs and hospital specialists (especially those specialising in Infectious Diseases, Neurology, Dermatology Cardiology and Microbiology).  Accordingly, such specialists would be very familiar with how to manage such patients, and as a result, all physicians deal with Lyme disease, as they would with any other infectious disease for which they have responsibility.  <\/p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and the Department of Health have highlighted the issue of Lyme disease, and how to prevent tick bites and Lyme disease, since 2008.  The HPSC publishes significant amounts of information on Lyme disease on its website - hpsc.ie - for the general public and health professionals.  In addition, Public Health physicians give talks at medical conferences to junior physicians as part of their continuing medical education, bringing the issue of Lyme disease (along with the other wide range of infectious diseases) to the attention of established physicians and doctors in training.  Also, the HPSC holds a Lyme Awareness Day each year to highlight this issue and is constantly adding new material to its website.     <\/p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC established a Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee to look at ways of increasing public awareness - that Subcommittee is due to report before the summer.  Part of the work of the Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee is to ensure that all GPs are familiar with identifying and managing Lyme disease. <\/p>  <p>  Tests used in Ireland conform to all international standards.  Clinical laboratories in Ireland operate to the highest quality standards.  Testing for Lyme disease in such laboratories is to an internationally accredited level.  Microbiologists in all major centres would be familiar with Lyme testing and the tests they use are internationally recognised and eminently effective at differentiating those who truly have Lyme disease from those who truly have not.  As testing and treatment for Lyme borelliosis is widely available in all major hospitals in Ireland there is no need for people to travel abroad.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department has no plans to extend medical cards for people with Lyme disease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700077#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":459,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700077#WRM01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Eligibility","counter":458,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700077#WRM01100"},{"type":"question","counter":459,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[14350\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700077#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the criteria used to define a parcel of land as scrub for the purposes of the basic payment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1283","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":460,"content":"<p>Under the Basic Payment scheme, any portion of a land parcel which is covered in dense non-grazable woody shrubs, with no interspersed grazing is described as scrub.

The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at consumerline@comreg.ie and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding ComReg's independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect. The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the coverage deficits across the country. An Implementation Group is overseeing the implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.

This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. <\/p>  <p>  - A focus group was established to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots. It will also inform future policy in my Department with regards to priorities for mobile phone services.<\/p>  <p>  - A working group has been established with the remit of investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  - ComReg has published a composite national outdoor coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them. <\/p>  <p>  - ComReg has developed a licensing scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage.

The objective of this new provision is to provide an incentive to producers to design products that contribute to waste prevention and facilitate recycling by taking into account their durability, reparability, re-usability, recyclability and the presence of hazardous substances. EU guidance on modulated fees is expected later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Repak is considering how to address this obligation as part of their Plastic Packaging Recycling Strategy 2018-2030 and is working with my Department to ensure modulated fees are brought in as quickly as practicable, to drive changes to ensure packaging is easily recyclable.<\/p>  <p>  At EU level, the first-ever Europe-wide strategy on plastics has been adopted. The strategy envisages that all plastic packaging on the EU market will be recyclable by 2030 and the consumption of single-use plastics will be reduced. The strategy is underpinned by a proposed directive for the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment. This Directive, due to be finalised shortly, will enable me to introduce concrete measures to reduce, and in some cases, ban the use of single-use plastics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700079#WRO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Disposal","counter":539,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700079#WRO00500"},{"type":"question","counter":540,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[14524\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700079#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which reliance on landfill waste disposal facilities continues to be monitored, with particular reference to the utilisation of best practice in terms of reduce, reuse and recycle; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":541,"content":"<p>European, national and regional waste management policy is predicated on the waste hierarchy as set out in Article 4 of the 2008 Waste Framework Directive (2008\/98\/EC), whereby the prevention, preparing for reuse, recycling and other recovery of waste are preferred options to the disposal or landfilling of waste.  <\/p><p>Statistics compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency show that we have come a long way in a relatively short period of time in terms of improving our recycling and recovery rates and reducing our reliance on landfill.

Officials in my Department, supported by the Pensions Authority, have conducted detailed analysis on the implementation of the Directive.  <\/p>  <p>  While the Directive provides for the possibility of derogation from specific Articles for smaller schemes, I believe that members of smaller schemes should get the same protections and oversight as members of large schemes.  <\/p>  <p>  The value of investments held in many schemes fell substantially during the financial crisis.  This highlighted the need for stricter regulation and greater protections, especially for small schemes investing in riskier unregulated markets. Concerns in relation to this sector are particularly around the protection of the consumer and the money they have invested, the riskiness of investments, the charges that apply, and the standard of governance.  Accordingly, the Government has decided that the provisions of the Directive should apply to all funded occupational pension schemes.  Money saved for pension purposes should be properly protected to ensure that people have adequate income for their retirement years.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Directive the underlying principle for capital investment is for schemes to invest in accordance with the 'prudent person' rule and other specific rules set out.  It is recognised that there should be an appropriate level of investment freedom for schemes within prudent limits and this is reflected in the rules.  Assets must be predominantly invested on regulated markets, i.e., at least 50%.  This allows adequate scope for investment in instruments with a long-term economic profile and non-listed undertakings such as property and infrastructure. In this regard the application of the Directive is prospective, not retrospective.  This means that existing investments and borrowings can remain in place.  After transposition all single member schemes, including small self-administered schemes, who are the only schemes currently allowed to borrow, will not be allowed to enter into new borrowing arrangements, except for short term and liquidity purposes.  All of their future investments will have to be made in accordance with the investment rules in the Directive. The Pension Authority advises that there are approx. 100,000 single member schemes and that c.98% of these schemes are already compliant with the investment rules of the IORP II Directive.  <\/p>  <p>  While small self-administered pension schemes may continue to invest in the Irish economy, including property and SMEs, the assets of the scheme must be properly diversified to avoid excessive reliance on any particular asset and thereby minimise risk in the portfolio as a whole.  Such diversification has been proven to reduce investment risk.   <\/p>  <p>  According to the 2017 Report of the Association of Pension Trustees of Ireland (APTI) there are 7,756 small self-administered pension schemes with &euro;3.38 billion in assets.  The majority of these are already compliant with the provisions of the new Directive.    <\/p>  <p>  This approach will enhance consumer protection so that pension savers have adequate income for their retirement years. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700080#WRP03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments","counter":613,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700080#WRP03500"},{"type":"question","counter":614,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[14345\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700080#WRP03600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when illness benefit and disability allowance arrears will issue in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":615,"content":"<p>The person concerned is currently in receipt of Illness Benefit at the maximum rate.

Two of the sites are located in the Dublin City Council area with one each in the County Council areas of South Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Louth. <\/p><p>The Social Housing PPP Programme is being delivered through the &lsquo;availability&rsquo;-based PPP model. Under this type of contract, the PPP project company, as the private partner, designs, builds, finances and maintains public buildings on sites provided by the State, in this case through the local authority. Payment is made by the State only once construction of the buildings is complete and the units are ready to house tenants.

This cost includes all maintenance, operating, lifecycle, tenancy management and financing costs. Service provision that is included in the contract includes building and asset management, waste management, security, void management, tenant helpdesk services, and the provision of community development services. At the end of this period the units are handed over to the relevant local authority.<\/p><p>The estimated full value of the contract, as outlined above, is due to be published as part of the Contract Award Notice in the Official Journal of the European Union, as is standard practice under European procurement procedures.
