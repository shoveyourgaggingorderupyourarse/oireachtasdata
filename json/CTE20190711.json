There is a system in place for parliamentary questions during recess, so we are not setting and new ground.<\/p> <p>  No. 2312 B is from the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, dated 5 July 2019 providing his response to our report on the examination of matters in relation to receipts from corporation tax, which we will note and publish.  The Minister sent a note during the week.  The committee issued this report in June 2018 but I think the ministerial response probably got lost in the mix in the Department.  We have received responses from our other periodic reports, Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, and the Department probably spotted that this was not there.<\/p><p>We can make a quick note of it but much of it relates to items in the public domain.  We will continually come back to issues such as corporation tax.<br\/><br\/>Our first recommendation was on the concentrated nature of corporation tax receipts.  We had asked for a special report but the Minister stated that one had been conducted by Revenue over the course of finance discussions some time ago.  He said the matter was under review and we will all be keeping it under review.  We will note that.<br\/><br\/>We asked for details of PAYE paid by participators in close companies.  The Minister said:<\/p><blockquote>To a large extent the close company provisions are designed to modify behaviour by preventing certain activities.  Revenue statistics provided to the Committee indicate that approximately 4% of close companies paid the surcharge in 2015 and approximately 4.3% of close companies paid the surcharge in 2014.  These figures indicate the effectiveness of that provision and Revenue is satisfied that the application of close company rules is achieving its intended purpose.<\/blockquote><p>The Minister has given a two-page response but I am only reading out his concluding paragraph.  We will note and publish this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019071100002#B02900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562832000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>On what page is the Chairman?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019071100002#C00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1562832000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I am on the bottom of page 5.  If any member wants to take up this issue, that would be useful as we approach the next budget because this information can be used in discussions of tax matters.  It is not exclusive to the Committee of Public Accounts.<\/p><p>We recommended separating the carry-forward losses for corporation tax between losses forward and capital allowances.  We asked Revenue to distinguish between those and have a separate line on tax returns to capture that information.  The Minister does not think this would provide much additional information.  However, Revenue has since written back to us to say it is a legislative matter.  It has separately told us that it cannot seek information to which there is no legislative basis, so if members want to achieve that, it would require an amendment to the Finance Bill.  The committee has taken this issue as far as it can.  It is now up to individual Deputies to decide if they want to bring it to the Oireachtas as part of the Finance Bill.<\/p><p>We made another recommendation on the sustainability of corporation tax.  The Minister had previously prepared a paper on this for the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, which he has attached.  It is a live issue, and we note that.<\/p><p>On double taxation agreements, we concluded: &quot;The Department of Finance should ensure mechanisms are in place to verify any claims for double taxation relief made in Ireland  by companies that are non-resident In Ireland.&quot;  The final paragraph of the Minister's response states:<\/p><blockquote>While Revenue do have information from corporation tax returns on the number of non-resident companies who file returns in Ireland and the amount of corporation tax paid, they do not have available information in relation to any claims for double taxation relief made by these companies in their country of tax residence.  In practical terms it would be difficult to obtain such information and, as it is the country of tax residence that would be granting relief for Irish tax already paid on the same income, it would primarily be a matter for that country to verify the claim before granting the relief.<\/blockquote> <p>These companies are non-resident in Ireland for tax purposes and the Minister says the onus is on revenue authorities in the countries in which they are tax resident.  We made a fair point and that is probably a legitimate answer.<\/p><p>We asked about the effective rate of corporation tax and recommended: &quot;The Department of Finance should examine this matter such that there is general agreement on a single most appropriate method for calculating the effective rate of Corporation Tax on company profits.&quot;  In his response, the Minister refers to about five different methods of calculation.  Two or three of them are from the OECD but every international body has a different definition of the effective rate of corporation tax.  The Minister says each report can add value because they all have different nuances.  He does not agree that there should be one effective rate because there is no international agreement on the matter.<\/p><p>We referred to real estate investment trusts and stated: &quot;The Department of Finance should carry out a review of the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) regime to ensure that domestic and EU ownership is being encouraged appropriately.&quot;  Our concern was many of these REITs are from outside the EU.  The Minister's conclusion states:<\/p><blockquote>REITS provide a number of benefits for investors when compared to direct property investment, including diversification of risk, increased liquidity, lower entry costs, and regular income streams.  They were designed to provide investors with access to investment in real estate without buying property directly.  This reduces the risk to both landlords and tenants that results from the more common model, in the Irish residential property market in particular, of an individual landlord owning one or two heavily-leveraged rental properties.<\/blockquote> <p>The role of REITs which come into Ireland to buy up entire blocks is a big political debate.  Local people cannot buy anything because everything is being bought by REITs.  We will note the Minister's response and put it on the record.  These are all policy issues, which we will be discussing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019071100002#C00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1562832000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>REITs were recently described as the gift that keeps on giving.  While I accept this is a policy area, we will return to this issue in time and ask if the REITs were value for money.  Rather than seeing it in hindsight, we can see forward with 20:20 vision.  If one could make that prediction now, we would say the REITs are clearly not value for money.  It is extremely frustrating that we can see that and that it is happening in real time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019071100002#C00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1562832000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>The legislation for REITs, through the taxation method of incentivising investment, is a form of social engineering which attempts to move Ireland towards rental accommodation and away from home ownership.

It is a detailed response and I thank him for it.  It is a good example of being on top of one's brief, as were the representatives of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, who were here last week.  They were very professional in answering questions and the meeting went off without a hitch.  I ask all Departments to follow suit in order to make life much easier both for themselves and the committee.<\/p><p>Parts of this response from the Department of Finance relate to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, which we will be discussing in private session this afternoon.  Mr. Moran provides a note on the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  He also gives details of the two sets of litigants in the cases taken regarding the liquidation of IBRC, including a note on the cost of defending these cases.  He provides a history of the case taken by Mr. David Hall and also mentions that Mr. Paddy McKillen has issued a second plenary summons in relation to a different matter.  That is on the public record.<\/p><p>Mr. Moran provides details on the advice of KPMG in relation to the IBRC liquidation, including terms of reference and dates of contact.  He confirms the following: &quot;As part of the preparatory work leading up to the Special Liquidation of IBRC, Kieran Wallace was consulted on a confidential basis as set out in the engagement letter dated 7 February 2013 between the Department of Finance and KPMG.&quot;  That was around the time the special legislation went through.  Mr. Moran further states: &quot;A copy of this letter was provided to the Committee on 19 January 2018 and sets out the services provided to the Department in relation to general restructuring advice and acting as Special Liquidator.&quot;<\/p><p>The next issue we asked for information on was the Minister's decision not to follow the recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts to establish a committee of inspection on IBRC.  Mr. Moran gives a detailed response stating, essentially, that the purpose of a committee of inspection is to protect the unsecured creditors.  He confirms that, ultimately, the only unsecured creditor in this case will be the State and that the Minister for Finance, as the shareholder, will deal with that.  The Department of Finance is<i>de facto <\/i>the only unsecured creditor and Mr. Moran believes nobody else could be on an inspection committee, as there is no other unsecured creditor.  Only the State and the taxpayer will be at a loss.  Special legislation was enacted to set aside the normal provisions in the Companies Act because, ultimately, only one unsecured creditor was to be expected at the end of the day.  It is a policy matter, as the issue arises from the legislation and that is the essence of what we will be discussing this afternoon.  Our concern is the lack of oversight by the Department, which is not doing as thorough a job as a committee of inspection would normally do, as we have highlighted.

I have had a glance of this only in the last 20 minutes.  Essentially, in a liquidation the unsecured creditors, which can include trade creditors, come together and employ the liquidator - Revenue is regularly involved - to look after their interests and recover as much money as possible for them.  The Minister is saying that when the Department came to the IBRC it had been nationalised.  The Government decided to liquidate it, and it was clear at that stage that the only unsecured creditor likely to be standing at the end of the liquidation process was the State, which is now the case.  The Minister is saying there is only one unsecured creditor, namely, the Minister for Finance acting on behalf of all the citizens of Ireland.  The Government is therefore saying it disapplied the Companies Act committee of inspection provisions that would apply in a normal liquidation because this liquidation was different in that there was only one unsecured creditor, namely, the Minister for Finance as the shareholder.  He is therefore saying he is the committee of inspection and the only one looking for money at the end of this process to come back to him on behalf of us.  He is saying the Department took over the job of the committee of inspection.  That job would normally be done by a committee of several creditors.  I am explaining this as best I can.  I am not defending the Minister's position but outlining it to Deputy Connolly as I read it.  The Oireachtas agreed to this, which is the other point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019071100002#D00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1562832000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Some of us did not vote.

In fact, the very point that was made was that we were missing things in the Bill by virtue of the fact that we did not have the time to scrutinise it properly and we were advised that it had to be adopted before the markets opened in the morning.  It is very easy to miss things in such a scenario, which is important to say if we are saying the Oireachtas passed the legislation.  In the normal course of events it is a court that supervises a liquidation.  This is the biggest liquidation in the history of the State.  The point the Chairman made is the point we have been trying to make, that is, that it is a matter of scrutiny and oversight.  Let us consider the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  The Comptroller and Auditor General audits NAMA and has a number of people within the agency with oversight of what is happening.  This was Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.

When one stands back and looks at this it is clear that, as a result of the banking crisis, we put most of the debt into NAMA for it to manage and to get the best return for the taxpayer.  NAMA is a public body audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It has come before this committee and the finance and public expenditure committee.  There is total public scrutiny of NAMA's activity.  This was part of the same exercise.  There were bank debts but a special liquidation process was set up without public scrutiny, auditing by the Comptroller and Auditor General or oversight from the finance committee of the Houses or the Committee of Public Accounts.  In hindsight, perhaps there should have been a subsidiary of NAMA set up to oversee the liquidation.  It is too late to have that conversation now but, in retrospect, I think all the oversight we have over NAMA could have been achieved in the case of this body had we taken a different route from that of the special liquidator.  However, that is a policy matter.  At this stage, one of the biggest criticisms is probably that we took the liquidation of IBRC away from public scrutiny and transparency.  We did not do so with the other bank debts.  We put them into NAMA.  That was a big call, and that is probably the essence of the reason we continue to debate this issue.

The Minister had some documents out there well in advance.  It was highly teased out.  I am sure there are still flaws in it.  We spotted the flaws in section 172 here as a result of our work ten years on, or perhaps it was known much earlier in the Department, but the D&aacute;il did not seem to pick it up.  This was emergency legislation that was rushed through.  We can see the consequences now, but my recollection is that the Department was willing to come in and talk about that.  Kieran Wallace, I think, was due to come before the committee as well.  However, the initiation of court proceedings stopped the meeting from going ahead.  One could argue that the reason we do not have the level of scrutiny at the Committee of Public Accounts is the court case.  The Department said it was most anxious to come in, and the liquidator was most anxious to come in and speak as much as he could.  However, once the court case was initiated, it stopped them coming in.  It is a pity there is not public scrutiny here.<\/p><p>We will have a private meeting this afternoon with David Hall and others specifically on this topic.  Our concerns have been well ventilated here.  The next notes in this correspondence are 5 and 6, which relate to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, which will be noted and published but we will discuss it in private session.<br\/><br\/>Note 7 is the Exchequer borrowing requirement to refinance the commercial Irish Water loans.<br\/><br\/>Note 8 is the year-on-year decrease in loans to the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, between 2013 and 2017, to include details of any impact on the ability of the HFA to deliver new housing stock.  We will note this.  People can comment on that and use this information.<br\/><br\/>Note 9 is on the possible fines that can be levied against Ireland by the European Commission in respect of missed climate targets, to include details of the availability of carbon credits and their potential to offset fines.  We will note this and specifically cover it in our periodic report during the week.<br\/><br\/>Note 10 is on the &euro;14.5 million recovered from Aughinish Alumina, to include details of the deposit account in which it is being held and any fees or interest applicable.  There also is a detailed note on that.  A hearing took place on this on 2 April 2019 and a judgment is awaited.  The money - approximately &euro;15 million - has been left in a general zero interest account, or thereabouts, and is lodged with Danske Bank after a recommendation by the Comptroller and Auditor General some time ago.  Note 10 is on the internal scoping exercise being carried out by the Department, to include details of the start and completion dates.  This relates to the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on Ireland's transactions with the EU.  That is all noted.<br\/><br\/>The following notes, 11 and 12, are schedules and breakdowns on categories and grades of staff set out.<br\/><br\/>Note 13 is on the public interest directors as appointed to various banking bodies by the Minister, to include clarification of the role, structures, recent appointments and when any outstanding appointments are due to be completed.  Members can read that information.  We covered that subject generally at the meeting.<br\/><br\/>Note 14 is on the surge in corporation tax receipts in recent years and the development of GNI* to include the effect of multinational activity on Ireland&rsquo;s EU contributions.  There is a detailed note on this and the figures are given for 2016, 2017 and 2018.  The correspondence refers to the budget contributions and a paper that has been commissioned in this regard.  Mr. Moran stated in his correspondence: <\/p><blockquote>Finally, it should be noted that the Minister for Finance has commissioned a paper to highlight some of these in-built vulnerabilities and to quantify where possible, the impact of such a shock. [This is a reference to the corporation tax issue] Potential solutions to this are presented in order to prompt a policy discussion around how best to mitigate against this emerging over-reliance [on corporation tax].  It is the Minister's intention to give consideration to these - and possibly other suggestions - with a view to making recommendations to Government in the autumn. [That obviously means before the budget] <\/blockquote><p>This review of the potential over-reliance on corporation tax is being reviewed and we would expect to see information on that published before the autumn.  Members should note that for the end of September.  We need sight of that before the budget.<br\/><br\/>Note 15 is on the projected changes to Ireland's EU contributions and money received in the event of Brexit.  Mr. Moran does not give the figure because he said it is sensitive information currently, but I believe a figure was mentioned by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade yesterday.<br\/><br\/>The final item in Mr. Moran's correspondence is note 16 on An Post National Lottery Company entering voluntary liquidation after the sale of the franchise to include details of the winding-up process, the transfer of unclaimed prizes and any difficulties encountered.  The board has liquidated all of its assets and cash in hand, but the transfer of expired unclaimed prizes did not impact on the matter because they were now defunct.  That fund of unclaimed prizes is managed and controlled by the Regulator of the National Lottery.  While Premier Lotteries Ireland - the private operator - sought these expired unclaimed prizes to supplement lottery prizes to supplement its lottery prize money the Department considers that the proper and legal course is that these moneys should be returned to the Exchequer, in support of the subvention of good causes, and Mr. Moran's Department has written to the national lottery regulator accordingly.  The regulator has sought some additional information from the Department, which has recently been provided, and the Department currently awaits the regulator's decision.  That issue of unclaimed prizes is being dealt with by the Regulator of the National Lottery and the Department is looking for the money to be returned to the Exchequer for good causes.  They await a final outcome from the regulator on that.  I apologise for all of those long documents but it is good to clear them.<br\/><br\/>We will move on to category C, which is correspondence from private individuals and other correspondence.<br\/><br\/>No. 2253C is from an individual, dated 16 May 2019, requesting the committee to make an inquiry regarding the University of Limerick student records system.  A significant level of detail is provided in this correspondence and at our committee meeting on 20 June 2019 we decided to hold it over for further consideration.  We had previously requested the University of Limerick for a response and the reply from the university stated there was no record of a submission from the individual concerned.  It goes back a number of years to 2011 and 2012.  As the matter is highlighted the individual has come forward stating that the grades she received in 2011 and 2012 were not adequately recorded.  The individual has written again to the committee and it appears that she brought the matter to the attention of certain individuals at the college but not through the normal proper structures to have a regrading looked at.  The individual is now saying that the college is not going back to 2011 and 2012.  This matter is not within the remit of the committee and I do not see how the committee can help any further.  We have exhausted this with the university directly.  I propose to advise the individual that if she believes she was not treated fairly, she should contact the Office of the Ombudsman, if she has not already done that.  We have taken it as far as we can.  We are disappointed we did not get satisfaction but we cannot take it any further.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br\/><br\/>No. 2299C is anonymous correspondence in respect of Maynooth university.  At our meeting on 27 June, the committee considered the 2018 accounts and statements of the National University of Ireland Maynooth and noted a provision of &euro;750,000 relating to impairment of a loan to a loss-making subsidiary company that was set up to commercialise intellectual property and to provide consultancy and training services.

The correspondents ask why the governing body of the university did not know about it, why the Comptroller and Auditor General did not know about it and why was it not made known long before now.  No. 2315C also alleges an issue of some 800 part-time staff being employed on zero-hour contracts and with no proper employment rights.

I want to make some suggestions.  I will explain how this works practically.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report will be out at the end of September.  We will have to give people at least a week to come in.  We might speak to the Comptroller and Auditor General closer to that time about who we might invite in.  Maybe that will happen in early October.  We will probably have three meetings around the end of September and the beginning of October before we have a chance to deal with the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  I suggest that in the meantime, pending the Comptroller and Auditor General's documents, we should hear from certain organisations that have not been here before or have not been here for a long time.  I think it could be very useful.  Maybe we will ask the secretariat to arrange such meetings for dates around the end of September.<\/p> <p>  I suggest that an invitation be sent to the Data Protection Commissioner because data protection is a big issue in Ireland now.  We have big European responsibilities here.  We want to check the Data Protection Commissioner's governance and arrangements.  I do not think An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been here for quite some time.  People might want to see how An Bord Plean&aacute;la is being operated.  The Charities Regulatory Authority has not been here for quite some time.  Having gone through a list, I have decided to suggest those three organisations for early invitation.  We are not waiting for the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in those cases.  We will ask all three bodies to have up-to-date financial information.  It will not look good if they do not have their 2018 accounts audited and available to us.  If such accounts are not available, we will go ahead with the meetings anyway.  The bodies in question will be required to provide draft information or something on which we can have a meaningful discussion.  We need up-to-date information, even if it is awaiting publication or final sign-off.<\/p> <p>  It has been mentioned that Bord na gCon will be in at an early stage.  When we get the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, we will see if there is anything on Bord na gCon in it.  There are some other items that have been on our work programme for some time, but are not specifically listed for a meeting.  We have said we will come back to the issues of capital projects, procurement and public private partnerships.  The issue of protected disclosures is hanging around across many Departments the whole time.  I think we will try to start with the Data Protection Commissioner, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Charities Regulatory Authority.  We will consider those types of subjects.  As soon as NAMA is ready with Project Nantes, officials from NAMA will be asked to come in as well.  When we get the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, we will be able to move into other areas in early October.  We want to let the secretariat make some arrangements over the summer so that meetings will have been arranged for us when we come back.

We must ensure there is transparency in relation to how it operates, not in relation to how it comes to its decisions or anything to do with that.  People do not know how it operates.

The commission operates under the framework established by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003.  The commission's accounts are a cash-based record of receipts and payments compared to the Estimates.  Funding for the commission is provided for statutorily every three years, with Estimates proposed annually to draw a tranche of the three-year budget.  The overall funding approved for 2016 to 2018 amounted to &euro;369 million.  By the end of 2018, a total of &euro;363 million had been used.  The balance of &euro;6 million is no longer available to the commission.<\/p> <p>  The commission's 2018 account recorded gross expenditure of &euro;134.4 million, distributed among service areas as indicated in the diagram on screen.  Pay-related expenses are distributed across a number of the categories and amounted to approximately 65% of total spending in 2018.  Further expenditure related to the operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas in 2018 was borne by some Votes and the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  This includes spending by the Office of Public Works, OPW, on the premises used to accommodate the services, totalling an estimated &euro;11.6 million; parliamentary activities allowances paid to political parties and Independent Members, totalling &euro;8.6 million; funding for political parties related to their share of the vote in D&aacute;il elections, totalling just under &euro;6 million; and pensions and retirement gratuities of retired staff members, totalling &euro;4 million.  Payments in respect of the pensions of Members of the Houses are accounted for in the appropriation account in the form of an annual grant to Ciste Pinsean Thithe an Oireachtais.  This amounted to &euro;11.8 million in 2018.  A separate account is prepared in respect of the ciste.<\/p> <p>  Receipts of the commission in 2018 were just under &euro;2.8 million.  This included just under &euro;200,000 remitted to the commission under an agreement governing the operation of the Houses catering and bar services.

Is &eacute; seo an ch&eacute;ad uair dom a bheith i l&aacute;thair mar Oifigeach Cuntasa&iacute;ochta Sheirbh&iacute;s Thithe an Oireachtais.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity to attend before the committee to assist in the examination of the accounts of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission for 2018.  This is my first appearance as Accounting Officer of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am joined by members of my management team, who are sitting alongside me, and some senior colleagues who are sitting behind.  In this statement, I propose to give the committee a brief overview on the funding allocation and 2018 appropriation account, some key activities during 2018 and beyond, our corporate governance system, and our strategic goals for 2019 to 2021.<\/p> <p>  The commission is funded on a three-year statutory cycle basis, as approved by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and paid out of the Central Fund.  The 2016-2018 allocation was &euro;369 million.  The total outturn for the period was &euro;363 million, or 98.5% of the allocated budget.  The unspent allocation of &euro;6 million was not carried over to the 2019-2021 funding period.<\/p> <p>  The accounts under consideration relate to 2018, which is the third year of the current D&aacute;il and the final year of our three-year allocation.  The audited accounts of the commission show that the gross expenditure for the Houses in 2018 was &euro;134.4 million against an Estimate provision of &euro;135.9 million, representing a 1% underspend.  Salaries, pensions and allowances accounted for &euro;97.4 million, or 73% of total spend, which can be classified as non-discretionary spend.  Interparliamentary activities, broadcasting services, committee expenses, parliamentary printing, legal costs and essential consultancy and administration costs, including office premises, facilities, basic ICT equipment and services, and postal and telecommunication services, amounted to &euro;26 million, or 19% of total spend.  This was also non-discretionary.  The remaining budget of &euro;11 million, or 8%, provided for ICT, Library and Research Service project spending, and training and development costs.  This was the discretionary element.<\/p> <p>  The committee should note that the Houses of the Oireachtas Service is now a large organisation.  We have a total payroll in respect of 2,027 people, catering for the salaries, allowances and pensions of Members and former Members, political staff, MEPs, former MEPs and Civil Service staff, including some former State industrial, officeholder and catering staff.  On 31 December 2018, the commission employed 564 full-time equivalent, FTE, staff, comprising 511 Civil Service staff, 17 State industrial and officeholder staff and 36 catering staff, at a cost of &euro;31 million or 23% of the budget.<\/p> <p>  I will draw the committee's attention to some of the key activities in 2018 and beyond.  The expenditure for 2018 reflects the considerable changes implemented in the D&aacute;il reform programme agreed in response to the needs of the Houses and Members.  These include the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office; the development of the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers to include drafting and advisory services on Private Members' Bills; the increase in the number of parliamentary committees from 15 to 28, including eight specialist committees to date during this D&aacute;il term; the extension of services by the Library and Research Service, Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in, the Debates Office and House services; the establishment of the Business Committee, which members will know has become an important support for the running of the Houses; and some incidental and ancillary costs arising from sitting hours, security arrangements, etc.<\/p> <p>  One of the key areas that we focused on in 2018 was our ICT investment programme.  The service made a significant financial investment in new technology and systems in 2018 under its digital transformation programme.  This key strategic decision for the service was taken by the commission in 2016.  We have invested in our key business processes, systems and in-house ICT expertise, and have mapped more than 1,000 business processes.<\/p><p>We are now developing a parliamentary procedural system and this is being delivered on a phased basis.<\/p><p> Some other notable outputs from our digital transformation programme include: the upgrading of the Wi-Fi system across Oireachtas buildings; a new website to facilitate greater public engagement; and the roll-out of Microsoft Outlook to replace Lotus Notes, which was the email system for many years in the Oireachtas.  We have also upgraded the Chambers and committee rooms, adding in simultaneous translation to allow us to host meetings conducted in Irish in any of the four committee rooms.  The commission will continue with its investment in digital technology in the coming years to advance the modernisation of the processes and systems.<\/p><p> Another major feature of the spend in 2018 was the Leinster House restoration project, which is coming to an end.  This involved essential restoration and structural works to Leinster House and was managed by the Office of Public Works, OPW, on behalf of the commission.  I am pleased to be able to report that the sittings of the Houses and their committees continued uninterrupted during this work.  The work will be completed in time for the return of the Houses after the summer recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019071100002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562832000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Are you sure about that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019071100002#M00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562832000,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Absolutely, and I will provide an update on that point.  The OPW briefed the commission on Tuesday and the handover of the building takes place on 2 August.  All is on track.<\/p> <p>  Another notable feature of the spend in 2018 was expenditure on legal proceedings.  During 2018, the O'Brien and Kerins Supreme Court cases were managed by the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers.  The judgments were delivered in 2019.  Liabilities arising from the Kerins case remain to be quantified and should fall due for payment during the current three-year funding allocation period 2019 to 2021.<\/p> <p>  A major feature of our work during the past three years has been our public engagement programme.  When the Ceann Comhairle took up his position he spoke about a Parliament of the people.  We have pursued that during the past three years.  Part of this involves the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 commemorations during 2018, which provided the opportunity to increase public understanding and improve perception of the Oireachtas, especially the role of women in our national Parliament.  The programme of events reflected positively on both the Oireachtas and on the service and provided an appropriate platform for the D&aacute;il 100 programme, which is ongoing.  In addition, our public engagement programme included a significant parliamentary education programme which is delivered by our education officer, Conor Reale.  This has been strengthened significantly following Conor's arrival in the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  In 2018 we published a new policy on dignity and respect.  The parliamentary community, which comprises Members, their staff, civil servants and service providers, have signed up to the dignity and respect statement of principles and policies which developed over the course of the past year.<\/p> <p>  I will turn briefly to corporate governance.  The main policies and procedures for corporate governance of the service are outlined in the governance framework.  This includes the assurance framework that sets out the key sources of assurance, internal and external, underpinning the governance arrangements and activities of the service.  A review of the management committee was completed in 2018.  A new structure of management board and strategic committees evolved that focuses on providing strategic direction to oversee and account for the performance of the service through collective leadership.  The board reviewed the risk and corporate governance controls of the service.  We are now in the process of further professionalising our governance functions to include a chief risk officer, chief financial officer and a qualified internal auditor.  Our new chief financial officer is due to start at the beginning of September.  The commission's audit committee advises me on financial matters relating to my functions and advises the commission on matters of corporate governance relating to its functions.  The reports are published in the commission's annual reports.<\/p> <p>  For the next three years up to 2021, the budget allocated for running the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is &euro;422.3 million.  The commission adopted its strategic plan last Tuesday and has identified four key strategic goals.  These are: the development of an effective Parliament; an open and engaged Parliament; a digital Parliament; and a well-supported parliamentary community.<\/p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge the support and assistance provided by the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach and members of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  My colleagues and I in the Houses of the Oireachtas Service take immense pride in serving our national Parliament and its members.  We look forward to contributing to its development during the period 2019 to 2021.  I am now happy to take any questions members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019071100002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1562832000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Finnegan, for your opening statement.

That is probably not a surprise but I wish to compliment the officials on the centenary celebrations of the Oireachtas because they have been exceptionally well performed or pulled off or whatever one calls it.  In particular, the D&aacute;il 100 events were well managed and some of the finances for this were expended in 2018.  There have been some well-put-together programmes, especially in respect of public engagement.  As this is the only opportunity I will most likely get to note that, I think it appropriate to do so.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to a somewhat less important matter but it is probably as important for the persons who use the bar in this establishment.  There has to be some pun thrown into the debate this morning about rats.  There was mention of a certain dish being on the menu today.  I will put it out there.  It would be interesting if the canteen put on ratatouille.  Equally, with a slight element of seriousness, I appreciate the building is old and various works have been undertaken.  It is a concern to all those individuals who are on the payroll, including this one, in respect of expenditure on pest control and so on.  I have a genuine concern about it and I imagine the officials share this because of the proximity of all the services provided by the catering unit and bar and so on.  It is not a question but a badly-performed pun on my part.<\/p> <p>  I will comment on the information and communications technology side of things because it is probably the only really point in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that is worth discussing.  I note that the commission has come in under budget.  The commission is consistent in that regard.  I understand the commission was significantly under-budget in the previous year - the figure was &euro;13 million.  This year the figure is &euro;1 million.  I am citing the figures from memory - I read the material yesterday.  One thing that jumped out at me was the provision for certain expenditure programmes compared with the actual expenditure.  There was a significant disparity.  The figure that jumped out was for ICT.  There was provision for &euro;14.6 million but the commission spent &euro;22.7 million.  I appreciate a great deal of work has been done.  My office was reissued with new laptops for the first time since I was elected in 2011 and I thank the commission for that.  There was expenditure on software licences and so on.  Can Mr. Finnegan be specific about where the overrun came to pass?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019071100002#M00500","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562832000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Before I answer that question, I thank the Deputy for his kind words on the commemoration.  I will pass that onto the team.  It was truly a team effort.  It was a great privilege to be involved and to be in Leinster House at the time of the centenary of the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  The ICT expenditure has exceeded the budget but this was due to a conscious decision taken by us in the first quarter of 2018.  We track our expenditure carefully.  We have monthly management meetings and it became apparent to us that we were going to have a significant underspend in 2018, which was the last year of our financial cycle.  Under the funding regulations that apply under the Act, we cannot carry forward the allocation to subsequent years.  We took the view that the most appropriate thing to do was to invest &euro;8 million further in services and essentially bring forward expenditure that we had planned for later years.  That is why we did that.<\/p><p>We consider the ICT programme to be very important.  The background is that there was significant underinvestment in ICT in the Houses, probably for 15 years.  Statistics indicate that one should spend in the region of 10% of one&rsquo;s annual budget on ICT, but we hovered around 6% or 7% and that dropped during the downturn.  Our systems were quite old and outdated and we needed to significantly upgrade them.  One of the things of which we are conscious in terms of ICT expenditure is our ability to support Members.  We have a new generation of Members within Leinster House, with 70% having spent fewer than ten years here.  All of our Members use modern ICT in their work and we need to be able to support that, particularly things such as mobile devices.<\/p><p> The second big issue relates to what we discussed earlier, namely, public engagement.  ICT is a key strategy in our engagement with the public because it allows us to reach out and it allows the public to reach in.  It is about having a Parliament that is accessible to the people.  That has been a strong objective for us over the past year.  Understandably, there has been criticism of the Oireachtas from time to time, but our view is that unless people experience it and see the work being done by Members, such as at committees, it will be impossible to change that perception.  People who come to Leinster House are invariably impressed.  The type of ICT investment we are making will allow people to do things they do anyway on their phones.  If one is going home on the bus in the evening, one will check the news and weather and one might look up real-time passenger information for the next bus.  One can also look at what is going on in the Oireachtas, including the committees.  It is very important to be able to showcase the work that is going on in the Oireachtas and allow people to form an independent view of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019071100002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562832000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>One of the things from which Members and their staff have benefited is the upgrade from Lotus Notes email to Outlook.

I am personally in favour of State funding for political parties, groupings and Independents.  How does it work?  As we do during the so-called silly season, we will have any number of articles on expenses for politicians and how much political parties and Independents cost the State.  That is all grand as we all have to be held to account.  Sometimes, however, the facts underpinning it are not always put out there.  How does it work?  How are political parties funded and what was the total cost for each grouping in 2018?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019071100002#P04100","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562832000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I preface my remarks by saying it is a very important source of funding because it really is the funding of the democratic system.

I refer to page 4 of Mr. Finnegan's opening statement.  He referenced the Kerins Supreme Court case, which involved this particular committee, and the ramifications of it.  Additionally, Mr. Finnegan wrote to all the members last night setting out his thoughts in respect of the establishment of a working group that would examine this particular Supreme Court case and the need for Oireachtas committees to have clear terms of reference and to remain within them.  One of the points he made in his letter to us was about the conduct of meetings, the conduct of hearings by the committee as a whole and the supervision of such hearings by the Chair.  In terms of the implementation or scope of these changes, who will be policing who?  My fear would be about the ethos of the group and how far it would be prepared to go in terms of the implementation of changes.<\/p> <p>  In recent committee hearings we saw the Irish Greyhound Board, which is in receipt of huge amounts of public money, and the need for proper scrutiny of the expenditure of that public money.  We have seen, in recent committee hearings, witnesses from the Football Association of Ireland stonewalling in respect of questions and citing legal cases in that particular week as a defence.  In the end, it lost its State funding but the fear is that this working group would go so far in trying to rein in committees that we would not have that proper scrutiny of public expenditure.

The court is at pains throughout the decisions in both the Supreme Court judgments in Kerins in this regard.<\/p><p>As the Secretary General said, the court is asking Parliament to set up a system that will rebalance the rights of non-Members when they appear in front of committees.  It is stating that if we put procedures in place to provide an avenue of redress for people who believe they have been unfairly treated in front of committees and that if such a system includes remedies that will come into play when a Member or a committee acts unlawfully, the rights that need to be given to non-Members will have been rebalanced.  It is stating that when such a system is in place, the Judiciary and the courts will give Parliament a very wide margin of appreciation in how it runs its business.  It is far from a chilling effect.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, a number of errors occurred in that case in terms of remit, the letter of invitation and how the hearings were actually run.  When the working group has finished its consultations and reported back to the Committee on Procedure, a system will be put in place.  We hope Standing Orders will be amended to allow for a redress system.

It might be helpful to do this on a more regular basis.  I thank the witnesses for setting out the functions of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The efforts to make Parliament more accessible are very welcome.  I would like to know more about the key performance indicators, to use the jargon we have learned from the Comptroller and Auditor General, that will be used as efforts are made to make Parliament more effective.  Money messages come to mind, but we will leave that matter for another day.  However, I welcome the efforts being made to make Parliament more effective and open.  Oireachtas TV has been an eye-opener for me.  Many people watch it.  We are empowering people and it is money well spent.  Those who watch Oireachtas TV can see for themselves what is going on in their Parliament without having to rely on social media.  It is important for them to be able to learn directly.<\/p> <p>  Before I refer to specific legal cases, I thank the staff on the ground.  If the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is to learn anything, it must listen to the staff on the ground.  When I leave here, my abiding memory will be of the ushers.  Any visitor I have ever brought to the Oireachtas has spoken about them and the staff in the restaurants.  They sell the D&aacute;il to the people and us.  In addition to officials like Mr. Finnegan, they made us comfortable from day one.  If Oireachtas officials are to avoid misunderstandings and cases in the future, they should listen to people from the bottom up.  There should be a mechanism for reporting issues that are arising and the things happening on the ground.  That would help to improve matters.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask about the extraordinary amounts paid out in compensation and on legal cases.  I am referring to note 6 on page 25 of the briefing documentation.

I take the opportunity to acknowledge what I regard as the absolutely outstanding work of the OPW.  We have had a superb team of architects, led by Mr. Ciaran O'Connor, the State architect.  It has been a labour of love for them and I have seen the level of commitment and hours invested in the project by the team.  Sometimes the public sector is criticised correctly on projects, but this is an example of a project that has gone well and been well managed.  It will leave a lasting legacy for generations of Irish people who will come to Leinster House.<\/p> <p>  On a personal level, I am really looking forward to the building being opened in order that people can come to Leinster House to see the outstanding work that has been done.  We will have tours at weekends in the autumn once Leinster House is reopened as I anticipate a very high level of interest in coming to see the refurbished building.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019071100002#V00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1562832000,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I concur with those comments.

An assistant goes down, wires up what is required and then leaves.  I suggest it would be a big help to the operation of the Oireachtas if a programme could be put in place, even for half a day per year, to visit the constituency offices to train the Members' staff there.  They have no access.  They will not come here from all over the country for a day's training twice per year.  All it would take is one of two of the people doing the training to create a programme.

On behalf of the Commission for Communications Regulation, we are happy to appear before the committee again to address further queries on the national broadband plan, NBP, and specifically in respect of universal service.  I am joined today by my fellow commissioners, Jeremy Godfrey and Robert Mourik, and by my colleague, Barbara Delaney, who is the director of retail and consumer services in ComReg.  As I stated when we appeared before the committee on 5 June, I have been chair of ComReg since January of this year.  My fellow commissioner, Robert Mourik, also joined at this time, while Jeremy Godfrey has now been with ComReg for almost six years.<\/p> <p>  ComReg is the national regulatory authority for electronic communications.  We promote competition and investment in the sector.  We uphold end-user rights and we manage the radio spectrum.  In our recently-published strategy statement, we confirmed our vision for the sector that consumers and businesses in Ireland have affordable, high-quality and widespread access to communications services and applications that support their social and economic needs.<\/p> <p>  Our role in achieving this vision is to ensure that communications markets operate effectively in the interests of end-users and society.  In the past several years, predictable and proportionate regulation has created an environment that has led to investment in high-speed broadband networks covering three quarters of the premises in the State; at the same time, there has been an increasing choice of service providers.  In the next few years, operators plan to make available direct fibre connections to most of these premises.<\/p> <p>  However, there are parts of the State where the population density is lower and high-speed broadband would not be a viable commercial investment.  Consumers and businesses in these areas have not benefitted equally.  That is why we welcome the Government&rsquo;s national broadband plan, which will address this market failure.<\/p> <p>  ComReg has provided the committee with a detailed submission on universal service in advance of this meeting but in the interests of time, if it is allowed, I will give a summary.<\/p> <p>  Universal service is a safety net currently used to ensure that voice and other basic communications services are made available at an affordable price to a minority of citizens that may not be able to access those services as they are not commercially available, when the majority of citizens already have access.  It also protects citizens where legacy services are in danger of being withdrawn or not provided at an acceptable quality standard when there is no affordable alternative.<\/p> <p>  With regard to broadband, the current legislative framework does not allow for a universal service obligation, USO, that includes high-speed broadband.  Previous Government policy interventions have been used to bring basic broadband to end-users.  The NBP is designed to ensure high-speed broadband.  The current obligations under universal service, that is, not broadband, were put in place by ComReg to provide a safety net to ensure that end-users can access voice and other basic services.<\/p> <p>  A new framework has been adopted in EU law.  It has not yet been transposed but it is due to be transposed into national law by the end of 2020.  This makes provision for member states to use a USO to ensure that adequate broadband is available to all end-users.  It is for member states to define \"adequate broadband\" in the light of various criteria and of national conditions.<\/p> <p>  This USO mechanism is not intended to replace public policy interventions such as the NBP or a commercial roll-out.  Instead, the new framework permits a USO only to be used to ensure the connection of remaining unserviced premises where the commercial roll-out and public policy interventions cannot achieve that.  It does not allow a USO to replace a public policy intervention such as the NBP, which must be carried out in advance of the consideration of any USO being required to be put in place, as necessary.  If a USO were implemented, there would need to be an open process to select the universal service provider or providers so that all interested parties could be considered and market distortion is minimised.<\/p> <p>  While transposition of this legislation is required by 21 December 2020, subsequent analysis regarding the necessity for a broadband USO and any subsequent consideration of designation of a universal service provider, if appropriate, would require additional time.<\/p> <p>  Under the new framework, where the verified net costs are found to be an unfair burden, designated providers could be compensated for the verified net costs of providing the USO.  The financing of the verified net costs could come from public funds, industry or both, depending on how it is transposed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p> <p>  ComReg&rsquo;s role under the new framework has yet to be determined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562799600,"counter":633,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1562799600,"counter":634,"content":"<p>Can we just concentrate-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071100002#C00500","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1562799600,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I am sorry-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071100002#C00600","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1562799600,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I know you might be getting direction from Fine Gael headquarters on the questions to ask but we might wait until the submission has been made before you do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071100002#C00700","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1562799600,"counter":637,"content":"<p>We will let Mr. Blaney continue his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071100002#C00800","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562799600,"counter":638,"content":"<p>This will be made clear upon transposition.

Eir indicated to us that if many of the regulatory obligations required to be met by bidders were to be stripped away to create a level playing pitch on which everyone would be able to compete, it could deliver broadband for less than &euro;1 billion, while the State was looking at spending upwards of &euro;3 billion on the preferred bidder's proposal.

We have to provide high speed broadband for the people who want it as quickly as possible, but we have to do so in a judicious and cost-effective way.

That is one part of the necessary governance - looking after the commercial and financial issues involved.  It is not something in which ComReg is involved in any other circumstance.<\/p> <p>  There is also a set of governance requirements related to the behaviour of the winning bidder in the marketplace.  What products, including wholesale products, does it offer?  How are they priced?  Does it treat all of its retail service customers equally?  These matters are similar to the obligations ComReg might impose on an operator within our regulatory remit that has been found to have significant market power, but in this case they would be imposed on foot of the receipt of state aid.  Under the guidelines, we are not limited to imposing such obligations on those with significant market power.

We have not been an adviser on the potential cost to the public purse of different scenarios.  In any event, we have not had shared with us the information necessary to do that.

As I mentioned to Deputy Dooley when I was discussing state aid, there are matters that have nothing to do with significant market power.  These include looking after the money, ensuring that the networks are rolled out and so forth.  The behavioural aspects of the obligations are in many ways similar.  State aid guidelines encourage member states to align behavioural obligations to what might be imposed under significant market power, in particular, the requirement to treat all retail service providers in a non-discriminatory manner.  However, the state aid guidelines also say it is perfectly reasonable and to be expected that some additional obligations might potentially be required in exchange for state aid.  For example, under ComReg's regulation of Eir, there is a set of products we require the company to make available on a wholesale basis.  The recommended products required to be made available in the state aid context are a somewhat greater set of products.  We do not believe it is necessary or proportionate to require Eir to develop those products in commercial areas that it is required to develop in the other area.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue.  ComReg's regulation of significant market power operates on a five-year cycle.  Every five years we have to study the market and check whether one entity has significant market power.  We have to check whether this causes competition problems and what the appropriate remedies are.  Where it is envisaged for a state aided company, it is not unreasonable for the State to want to have the access obligations apply for the entire length of the contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071100002#E01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Godfrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1562799600,"counter":679,"content":"<p>State aid is effectivity for the Department.

As to the exact level at which the USO would kick in, and whether it would be 2% or 1%, we noted it is 2% in the UK, but those are matters to go through at the time and there is consultation to ensure we have whatever USO mechanism is appropriate.  That is the principle behind USO generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019071100002#F01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1562799600,"counter":703,"content":"<p>With regard to the terms of ownership and whether there is a concession or gap model, we have heard various presentations and everybody involved in the process usually says that if, at this late stage, we were to look to switch to a concession model whereby the State would end up owning the asset, while we would still maintain the other elements of the service, it would mean a five-year delay.

Specialist legal counsel has been sought on the Bill overall and on specific legal issues to ensure the enactment of the Bill's provisions will have no unforeseen or unintended consequences.  In particular, advice has been sought on the following issues: insurable interests in section 5; the cutting-off period in section 9; post-contractual duties of consumers and insurers in section 13; replacing insurance warranties in section 16; unfair and onerous terms in section 17; and subrogation in sections 19, 20 and 21.

With amendment No. 13, I propose to insert a new section 3 that will provide that certain sections of the Bill are designated enactments under the Central Bank Act 1942.  The particular sections of the Bill that the Central Bank will have a role in are section 8 - form of contract of insurance and information to be provided by insurer; section 9 - right to withdraw from contract of insurance by notice: cooling-off period; section 11 - cancellation of contract of insurance; and section 14 - claims handling: duties of consumer and insurer.  The purpose of this new section is to ensure that the Central Bank can enforce upon insurers their obligations under the Bill.<\/pli0><\/p> <p>With amendment No. 14, I propose to insert a new section 4 which will have the effect of clarifying and preserving the role of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman in the operation of the Act.  This is to be achieved by making an amendment to section 60 of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act which will refer to the consumer insurance contracts Act 2019;<i> <\/i>allow the ombudsman to make decisions by referring to this Act; and link section 22 of the 2019 Act - effect of failure to comply with the Act - to the power of the ombudsman to direct compensation.  The ombudsman&rsquo;s powers to direct compensation will not exceed the amount that the ombudsman has jurisdiction to pay out under this Act.  This amendment is very important as it confirms the fact that the FSPO should be the first port of call for the resolution of complaints and that this Bill will not undermine this core principle.  It is important that the Bill should preserve this parallel jurisdiction and should not inadvertently reserve any new rights granted to consumers to the sole jurisdiction of the courts or diminish the effectiveness of the FSPO as a forum for the resolution of complaints.<\/p> <p><b>  <\/b>Amendment No. 15 is a technical drafting amendment which does not change the underlying substance of the Bill.  Amendment No. 16 provides that section 3(2) be deleted.  Section 3(2) provides that the Central Bank can issue a code of practice concerning the form of a consumer insurance contract as set out in this Act.  However, this provision is superfluous as section 48 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 gives the Central Bank the power to make regulations for the proper and effective regulation of regulated financial services providers.  Deleting section 3(2) will also involve a consequential amendment to the title of the section to remove the reference to &ldquo;Codes of Practice&rdquo;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019071100002#E03700","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1562799600,"counter":782,"content":"<p>There is no issue with amendment No. 13, which is a technical amendment to Schedule 2 of the Central Bank Act.

The Minister of State might confirm if that is the correct interpretation of amendment No. 14.  Amendment No. 15 is technical.  Amendment No. 16 is not technical.  It deletes the powers of the Central Bank to make regulations and is connected with the deletion of section 4 of the Bill.

It highlighted in particular that the insurance distribution directive, IDD, has been introduced since the Law Reform Commission, LRC, reported.  It has extensive requirements in Part 7 on &quot;Information Requirements and Conduct of Business Rules&quot;.  For instance, an insurance product information document is required to be prepared in which it is necessary to set out a lot of information about the insurance product being sold.  While they do not fully match section 8, the IDD regulations offer very strong and clear protection to policyholders.<\/p><p>While it is acknowledged that we could have instead tried to repeal the relevant provisions in these other regulations and thus consolidate them in the Bill, this could have proved to be a complex task and we would run the risk of finding ourselves not in full compliance with EU law.  In addition, it could make any future amending transpositions of IDD very complicated as they would almost certainly have to be done through primary legislation rather than secondary legislation.<\/p><p>It is proposed instead that the requirements that have been identified as not being covered by existing legislation should be included in a significantly revised section 8.  These provisions are: the insurer after concluding a contract of insurance should provide the consumer with the completed application or proposal form and when there is uncertainty over any term in a document, the rule of law and interpretation most beneficial to a consumer should prevail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019071100002#G02100","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1562799600,"counter":847,"content":"<p>This amendment has the effect of deleting section 8.  It is highly technical, as we have heard from the Minister of State, but the consumer protection code is not on a legislative footing and that creates some grey areas in respect of consumer protection.  We should use this Bill to enhance as much as possible, and to put into primary legislation, consumer protection and transparency issues.

The substantial change in the amendment from the Minister of State stems from the expression \"within a reasonable time after concluding a contract of insurance\".  The proposed section 8 then stipulates the need for the insurer to provide a contract on paper or some other durable medium and so forth.  In the Bill as drafted, the reference is to within a reasonable time before a consumer is bound by a contract of insurance.  There is a substantial difference.  Under the amendment, the consumer has to provide all the details after entering into a contract or after concluding a contract whereas originally the consumer had to supply all this information in a clear way before being bound by it.  I am aware that we have cooling off periods in the legislation for non-life and life insurance.  In some cases a reasonable time could be deemed to be outside the cooling off periods of 15 days or 30 days, depending on the insurance contract.

It took a great deal of effort on their part to ask each of the companies how much they paid out in premiums during the previous five years and the number of claims made against the company and so on and so forth.

The biggest reform we need is transparency.  This was meant to be achieved through the national claims information database.

Nevertheless, it is the best facility we have at the moment but it is only taking data for motor insurance.  We have discussed this issue on many occasions.  We are years into a crisis with public liability for small businesses.  It is an emergency in my view, yet we have almost zero transparency in the field of public liability insurance.  The Central Statistics Office does not collect those statistics.  We have CSO data on motor insurance but not on public liability insurance.  We are, therefore, completely blindfolded on this matter and at the mercy of what the industry tells us.  In recent days, we have shaken to the core the credibility of that industry.  Given that this information is not collected, the amendment proposes that the Central Bank report back within one month on adding public liability insurance to the database.  It would not require the bank to provide that data within one month.

We thought it appropriate to start with motor insurance information, get established and have this done correctly first, before dealing with employer's liability and public liability insurance.  We have been dealing with the CSO regarding the compilation of data similar to the information on motor insurance increases and decreases.  There is, however, a major variance between employer's liability and public liability insurance calculations because these types of insurance range across everything from a circus to an abattoir.  The CSO data for motor insurance is solely concerned with vehicles.  This is a difficult problem, on which we do not yet have a handle but we are working on it.  We are down to one option and if we cannot get that option to work, we do not believe it will be possible to do a CSO analysis of employer's liability and public liability insurance.

After section 14, I propose a new section 15, which aims to limit the issue of retention by insurers in property damage claims.

It is proposed that, where an insurer wishes to include retention as a term of the contract, it will ensure the policyholder is made aware of this provision and informed of its application when a claim is submitted.  It is further proposed to include limits to be applied to any retention amounts in a proportionate manner as follows.  Where the insurer intends to apply a retention amount against a claim settlement offer, the insurer will not retain or withhold more than 5% of the claim settlement offer, where the claim settlement offer is below &euro;20,000, or more than 10% of the claim settlement offer, where the claim settlement offer is &euro;20,000 or above.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 43 proposes to remove section 15(1) about seeking damages if insurer withholds a claim.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 45 proposes to remove from section 15 a subsection  about a consumer being excluded from requesting damages if there was fraud.

I propose that section 15(1) to be deleted in its entirety.  It is not considered necessary and may cause more harm, as well as leading to increased litigation for no discernible justification.  The term &ldquo;unreasonable delay&rdquo; is ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways, which could result in disputes arising.  This provision could give rise to an increase in complaints about insurers or an increase in policyholders seeking damages or both where there is a view that the payment of the claim is unreasonably delayed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019071100002#K05000","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562799600,"counter":950,"content":"<p>That is not amendment No. 45.

I cannot get my head around why the first part of section 15(5)(a) is being deleted.  This section deals with proportionate remedies.  The intention is that where an innocent party is part of a joint insurance contract and is completely innocent but the other party to the contract is guilty of insurance fraud, that the innocent party should not have his or her proportion of the claim denied because they were jointly insured.  There are examples of partners or husbands burning down the house and even though they could be separated, there is a joint insurance policy and as a result the wife's claim would be nullified.<\/p> <p>  The bit that is left in is fine because it deals with cover for loss or damage of property caused by criminal or intentional act, but what it does not cover is personal injury as part of an insurance claim.  As an example, consider the case where my wife and I had a joint travel insurance policy, we went to a hotel, the hotel was flooded and we both lodged claims.  If she was injured on the holiday but my claim stated I had stayed at another hotel, thereby incurring a bill, but I actually had stayed at a friend's house in M&aacute;laga or wherever while my wife was in hospital, my claim would be invalidated.  So too would her claim, however, because there was no loss to property or damage.  The case I outlined was included in a submission we received on the Bill.  My concern is that the claim of the innocent party would be validated but only for loss or damage to property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019071100002#M00800","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1562799600,"counter":972,"content":"<p>I am happy to take a look at it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019071100002#M00900","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1562799600,"counter":973,"content":"<p>I will discuss amendment No. 67 as it is not a technical amendment.  This group of amendments has substance.  Amendment No. 67 states that in the case of awards, that if one fails to comply with the Act, a court can reduce the award made.  If the company was going to pay &euro;20,000 but if one failed to comply with a portion of the Act, the award could be proportionately reduced, for example, to &euro;10,000.  If an insurer breaches the duty of the Act, the courts can increase the sum for the consumer, which is what the Bill states, but the amendment states it cannot increase awards above the monetary level for which the court has jurisdiction.  My only concern in that regard is that in a District Court, if an award of &euro;15,000 was to be paid and an insurance company was in breach of the legislation, nothing could be done because &euro;15,000 is the limit of award payable under the District Court, or &euro;60,000 in the case of the Circuit Court.  The court reports from last week show a reduction in awards but they also show that the highest award paid by the Circuit Court was far in excess of &euro;60,000, which can be done where there is agreement between both parties.  The courts do, on occasion, pay beyond their limit, and they are allowed to do that when there is agreement between both parties.  With that in mind, I am concerned that we are limiting awards.

That will no longer be the case because the burglar alarm had nothing to do with the fact that lightning hit the house and, therefore, the insurance company will pay out.<\/p> <p>  Even if one was in breach of the warranty for a period, it is only for that period that one's insurance contract is invalidated for and only for the portion to which the warranty refers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019071100002#N04800","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1562799600,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>We have asked legal counsel for a specific view about warranties because we want to bring clarity to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019071100002#N04900","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1562799600,"counter":1027,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019071100002#N05000","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1562799600,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>We are trying to rebalance the authorisation between the insurer and the insured.

against the insurer.<br \/><br \/>(6) When bringing proceedings under <i>subsection (2)(a)<\/i>, the third party may also make the insured a defendant to those proceedings.<br \/><br \/>(7) If (but
