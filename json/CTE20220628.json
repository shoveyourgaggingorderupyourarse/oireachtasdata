The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, will be in attendance.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Ms Rachel Collier, CEO, and Mr. Barry Peak, learning and training specialist, from Young Social Innovators, YSI.  Mr. Gerry Fitzpatrick, chairperson, YSI, cannot attend due to illness.  I also welcome a delegation from Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de, Carnew, County Wicklow that comprises Ms Karen Murphy, teacher, Mr. Darragh Rawson, student, and Ms Annie Sheppard, student, who undertook the YSI project.  The witnesses are here to discuss the YSI project.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Ms Collier to make a brief five-minute opening statement.  She will be followed by Mr. Rawson and Ms Sheppard, who will share a five-minute slot.  Members will then each have an eight-minute slot to ask questions and receive responses from the witnesses.  I ask the witnesses and members to keep an eye on the time shown on the television screens during their slots.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee will publish the opening statement on its website following the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>That also applies to the witnesses.

Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks by the Chair.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction from the Chair.<\/p><p> I call on Ms Collier to make her opening statement to be followed by the other two statements.

The vision of Young Social Innovators is to inspire, equip and empower young people to change the world for good.  We do this through social innovation education.  In essence, through the social innovation programmes we have designed, we engage thousands of young people, mainly teenagers, in social issues that concern them.  In teams, they explore these issues, identify new responses or solutions and turn their ideas into action.  It is team-based, action-focused and very much youth-led.  Importantly for everyone, it exemplifies inclusive education.<\/p> <p>  Every year, we invite teenagers to take part in social innovation projects.  They do this mainly through schools, Youthreach centres and youth services that sign up and receive access to our programmes and educator training.  We train educators to facilitate teams of young people using our unique social innovation framework and resources.  Teams at senior cycle are invited to a series of regional and national events.  We operate a social impact fund on an annual basis and have given out over &euro;100,000 to young people over the past 15 years.  The Speak Out tour is another feature.  We host it in the provinces and it gives an opportunity to young people to share their ideas locally, some of which are selected for our national awards. <\/p> <p>  Young Social Innovators, YSI, may be best known for its annual awards but that is just one element of our work.  We have a competitive element, which is optional for young people, but our overriding purpose is to empower young people in society and to give them opportunities to contribute to creating a fairer and more sustainable world and to create much-needed social capital in Ireland, ultimately building our capacity to address the many challenges we face.<\/p> <p>  To date, more than 150,000 young people in some 600 schools have taken part in setting up over 5,000 youth-led innovations.  YSI has trained more than 1,500 educators.  Every year, approximately 220 post-primary schools and 14,000 to 15,000 young people get involved.  We are also piloting a programme in primary schools.<\/p> <p>  YSI is, in fact, the originator of the concept of social innovation education in the world.  This is a term we use to describe the learning and practice of using creativity to develop ideas to improve the well-being of people, communities and the planet.  While social innovation and entrepreneurship and its methods were gaining momentum in the early 2000s, education in the area had yet to be discovered.  It was virtually unheard of.  It is informed by values of social justice, human rights and sustainable development and a firm belief that young people can and should contribute to communities and society in a much more pervasive way.  It involves a pathway of change that incorporates design thinking, human-centred design and frameworks for critical and creative thinking. <\/p> <p>  The 2020 programme for Government commits to expanding access to social innovation programmes to all post-primary schools.  With investment from the Tomar Trust and the Department of Education through the Dormant Accounts Fund, we are doing this by developing an area-based approach to youth-led social innovation.  We now have local leaders in ten regions around the country.  As well as supporting local schools, we are building networks of support for youth-led social innovation in different sectors from the business sector to the public, education and community sectors.  We are ambitious in this approach.  There is a challenge here that is not just for schools, education services and youth services.  We are attempting to change a culture which has largely been exclusive of young people&rsquo;s ideas and voices to one which is inclusive of youth voice, participation and innovation.<\/p><p>YSI is conscious that for this to happen, there is a need for us all to take up the challenge.  It needs to be an important part of our very culture and the way we do things.  We need all sectors on board to place a value on young people, their ideas and their innovations.  They want to be involved, as we know from research we recently carried out with Am&aacute;rach Research on the generation Z index, which was published last week and shows teenagers want to be involved.  In fact, 78% of them want a greater say in future policies and planning, while 35% of them would consider becoming a political representative, which is very good news.  Importantly, however, the vast majority, or 82%, do not believe young people have a say in how their area is planned, while a majority of members of generation Z approached for the survey wanted those over the age of 16 to have a vote and a say in Ireland.<\/p><p> We have seen many impactful projects over the years, not least those initiated by the young people here today, including the origin of the National Missing Persons Day, which was adopted by the then Department of Justice and Equality and which every year brings families together to remember those lost or missing.  Many towns have benefited from YSI projects, including through environmental projects, playgrounds and gardens.  This year, the high-impact award was given to Boomerang Youth Caf&eacute; in Drogheda, a project initiated by Our Lady&rsquo;s College, Greenhills in the town.  In Fingal, too, projects have been shown to be very impactful, such as in St. Fintan's High School, where the first ever student-led sustainable energy community for schools in the country was set up.  Another school in Fingal mapped Lesotho in Africa, leading to much better planning in the country.  Projects on policies include those relating to sex trafficking, human trafficking, sexting and cyberbullying - I could go on but the committee will hear more from the young people during the meeting.  Our model of learning is being transferred from Ireland to new regions, in particular in Lebanon, Zambia and Sweden, through our international programme.<\/p><p> To address the challenges we face, we need to build Ireland's capacity and competencies in social change and innovation.  Children and young people are an important part of that change who can and do deliver solutions to social problems.  They should not be overlooked but should form an integral part of building our capacity to create the change we need to make.  Our recommendations for the committee include support for the full roll-out of social innovation programmes; area-based support for youth-led social innovation; the development of an agency to support people under the age of 18 and to provide seed funding for their innovations; increasing research into youth-led social innovation; and support for our international programme to transfer knowledge to our partner countries as part of our remit to build peace in the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Collier","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Collier.

As we quickly learned, listing the issues that exist was not difficult.  Our challenge was finding a topic all 22 students were interested in and passionate about.  Our breakthrough came just before Christmas, when our teacher shared an article with us about body shaming and comparison culture.<\/p><p>The article explained how the American artist, Lizzo, had recently worn a sheer dress to an awards ceremony and, as a plus size woman, had been roundly criticised online.  She is a talented artist who won awards at this particular ceremony, but none of the articles mentioned this fact.  They focused solely on how she looked.  Her talent and professional achievements faded into the background and all that people wanted to discuss was her choice of clothing.  Interestingly, Rihanna had worn a similar dress previously and was widely applauded for her fashion choice.

It is an agenda that I feel strongly about, so I am delighted to see that it is represented in this social enterprise.  While it is not strictly related to social enterprise, it is being marked out by the EU as an area where there is an opportunity for growth and to reinterpret our economic growth in a way that decouples us from emissions.<\/p> <p>  Our guests' work is inspiring.  I am reminded very much about a debate that was held in the D&aacute;il on Thursday.<\/p><p>Deputy Pringle brought forward a Bill on lowering the voting age to 16.  There was a cross-party consensus that this is something that needs to be looked at.  If we look at the work that the students from Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de are producing it shows that they are politically engaged and that they are thoughtful about that political engagement.  They are more than capable of being able to exercise a franchise and of deciding who they should be voting for to represent them.  If we lowered the voting age to 16 that would have an impact on the manifestos of all parties in taking the concerns of young people more seriously and in putting them at the heart of politics going forward.<\/p><p> I am also reminded of an experiment I ran a long time ago when I was a teacher.  I was teaching sixth class and I asked my pupils to cut out images from newspapers.  We made four columns.  One was if you were in a newspaper for doing something and the other was if you were in the newspaper for looking a certain way.  We did that for images of men and women.  It was incredibly striking when we saw how many men were in the newspaper for doing something and how many women were in it for looking a particular way.  From what our guests are saying, that is not as stark a male and female issue as it was.  Instagram and its influencers have changed that.  Boys and men are increasingly coming under the same pressure to look a certain way that was more often associated with girls and women in the past, albeit that was not right.<\/p><p> I would like our guests to tell me more about the discussion.  Achieving a consensus in a group of 22 people is not at all easy.  In that context, I would like them to talk to me about the process of how they arrived at that notion with the class group.  It sounds brilliant, and I will have to go away and have a look at the Norwegian legislation to see how easily it could be transposed to an Irish context but what were the other issues.  Our guests spent a lot of time teasing through the issues that affect people of their age within a particular context.  The school is at the border with Wicklow so it might be different from what students in a Dublin school, or a Waterford school in my context, would be thinking about.  Can our guests give me an overview of what other issues came close to the mark in what they were hoping to take on?  Did they see any projects from other schools that they thought were interesting and inspiring?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062800002#E00800","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>At the start of the year, we had a YSI representative come down to talk to us on a Thursday morning.

Edited and photoshopped images online have a negative effect on people's mental health.  As Annie said, it would be a very difficult thing to police in an Irish situation but we were struck by the lack of awareness among young people about the amount of edited imagery online.  We visited primary schools as part of our project and did workshops and exercises with students from age nine to about 12.  We got them to compare edited and unedited photographs to see the differences and the majority genuinely did not think these photographs were edited.  They thought people actually look like this on a daily basis.  They did not know the images were edited, although older students know.  In our school, students are told about this as part of the SPHE module and other well-being modules, but students who are eight, nine, ten or 11 do not know it.

I thank the witnesses for coming in and for the work YSI does nationally, as well as in the school in Carnew.  It is very beneficial that Senator Casey is bringing them in to meet the Minister.  That is very useful.  I am a fan of YSI.  I participated in 2005, which was not today or yesterday.  We went to the national showcase and it was a very enjoyable experience.  Our project was about a garden of remembrance for people who had died violently.  I remember it being as much about what you learn from putting together the proposal and learning to work together as about the project itself.  It was probably the first time we had to approach businesses to sponsor items.  We were students approaching adults and it was a bit intimidating but people responded very well.  One of the things about being a younger politician - I am not sure I am one anymore but I was in the younger generation for a while - is that you get asked questions about being a younger person in politics.  People ask why more young people are not interested in politics.  My answer to that was always that I did not agree.  Politics is not just party politics.  Wanting to improve your community is politics.  Wanting to have an impact on policy is politics, whether that means getting involved in a community association, a youth club, or projects like this, which are very important in tackling issues around body image and the manipulation of imagery.  This is a massive and growing issue, which probably affects this generation more than previous ones and is likely to continue to do so.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Ms Collier and Mr. Peak.  They spoke about integrating social innovation or youth social innovation into the school system as a whole.  What is the current reach in that regard and what is the best method to achieve that aim?  Is it curricular change or access to programmes?  What way can that be best achieved?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Darragh and Annie.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has addressed the issue in relation to the Norwegian legislation, which sounds interesting.  I imagine that there are other avenues that can be pursued.  I can imagine that education is potentially one of those.  It occurs to me that tricky thing about some of these issues around manipulation of images is that sometimes, while we can intellectually understand that something has been manipulated, that does not mean that we do not still have an emotional response to it.  The two things can happen at the same time. <\/p><p> Awareness will be important in people's education of the online space generally.  This includes everything that happens online.  It relates to what is real and what is not, as well as what is plausible and what is not.  Aside from the legislation, which I intend to look at, as does Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh, what other areas of policy change can we in this institution help to address this issue?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062800002#G00400","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Awareness will be a big part in this regard.

We want to get this into their heads that this content can be changed, so that they do not look in newspapers and think that it is real, when it is fake.

We brought awareness to this issue through the project.  We sat back and thought that particular images were altered or filtered or something.  Education, as well as legislation, is important.  We had two main goals at the start of our project.  Our first goal was to educate the young people of Ireland.  Our second, bigger goal was to change the legislation.

The new junior cycle curriculum has created more space for applied learning projects, such as in the area of social innovation.  There could be more space at the senior cycle for applied learning.  That would help.  We could also have different access points for social innovation.  This is very important.  Whether a person is in Youthreach, in a school, at primary level or in a community service, they should be able to access social innovation methods, learning and support.

We therefore work actively with Delivering Equality of Opportunity In Schools, DEIS, schools.  We work with Youthreach centres.  We are increasing our reach into primary schools.  This is important to us, because we think that there is real value in social innovation education.  The projects that the kids are doing are incredible, in terms of their outcomes, the impact on the community and the difference they are making in social justice.

In addition, as Annie mentioned, for me on a personal level the thing with people having babies and appearing five minutes later on social media in a bikini is truly detrimental.  There is the incidence of post-natal depression, especially in isolation during Covid-19, and then seeing an image of somebody like that online.  Even though one knows it is fake and that the person has a personal chef and has taken 27,000 shots in order to get that one shot, the rational part of one's brain is put to the side and that other part just comes to the fore.

I was fairly well versed with the media, although it was approximately ten years ago so social media did not have the same impact.  Education and critical thinking are key to it.  Many of the things we do in YSI encourage young people to be more critical thinkers, to engage with a variety of media sources, to identify those they can trust and to think about things such as reliability and validity.  They need a type of toolkit whereby they can look at images and information and work out for themselves who are the authentic, reliable and valid voices.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  What is also important is that all this comes down to social justice.  It is all about enabling young people to fulfil their potential and live the most empowered lives they can regardless of the social issues that the young people choose, whether it is about body image, mental health or racism.  Every year we see a plethora of subjects.  It is all about social justice and enabling young people and everybody in society to reach their full potential.  Social media is an important part of that, but it is very important that we get young people to understand that they can use their agency to assert some control over their lives and to have an impact on social, economic, political, cultural and community life.  That is the essence of what we do.  That enables young people to be more critical thinkers and enables them to have more of an understanding of all facets of life, which will empower them as they go through their lives.<\/p> <p>  Increasingly, society is characterised by uncertainty and precarity so young people need to be critical thinkers and they need to be resilient, creative, adaptable and innovative.

There are probably no fewer people now who cannot think for themselves than there were previously.  It is not to do with social media but it is to do with the education system and that is why we are here.  I have kids who are generation Z and generation alpha.  YSI is being a leader and the results of what it is doing will be seen by generation alpha because they are the ones who were born in 2010 and after, and as the witnesses have said, it is about getting to people early.  They are all looking at \"Love Island\" and all of those things and they are seeing what is coming up on Instagram around those people.  There are many more pressures on boys now than there ever were before.  I never experienced that when I was young and it was all about girls and women and what they looked like.  There was not the same professionalism in sport before but people are in the gym all day long now because they get paid for it and then young boys are expected to behave like that.  I admire that Mr. Rawson brought that point up because he is doing a huge service for an awful lot of boys and young men out there.  Part of what I wanted to say is to ask what our young guests can do as advocates.  It should not just be about changing the system and we have a number of opportunities that I would love to come back in on.  There are opportunities for us to have young people mentoring young people and to do so throughout our education system so that it is not, as was said, about older people like me talking to young people.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that Senator Flynn wants to come in and I want to make sure that she can so I will ask my other question and then allow her to come back in.  We have a number of Bills going through the Houses and I am more than willing to speak to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, on behalf of our guests on the ideas they have around online imagery.  We have the online Bill coming before the Seanad the week after next and I will bring up those ideas with the Minister.  Maybe there is an opportunity to do it through the commissioner rather than just through legislation.  We should leave it with the commissioner to decide what we should do.<\/p> <p>  There is also the matter of education, which is separate in some ways, and the education system needs to be changed.  I know our guests are here to talk about their programme but any time I ask anyone who comes in here about transition year, including officials and Department staff, I say that schools in general should look more like transition year.  We need to have mentors and these opportunities for young people in every school year, not just in one year out of their lives.  They constantly revert to the idea that we should do that during transition year.  Is there a recommendation I can come out with from this committee to show how this can be done in first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth years?

It will have a significant impact on Irish young people in order that we will be a step ahead and have more confidence to speak out and talk about it in years go come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062800002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh Rawson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I could not agree more with Mr. Rawson.

As Ms Collier and Mr. Peak have said here today, the purpose of YSI is to show students that they have the power to make change in the world.  We did YSI training in which we were told that the one thing the facilitator must pass to his or her students is that they have the potential to change somebody's life with what they will do in class today.  It is not that one cannot do that in every other class, but a facilitator has to let students believe that they can make the change.  In recent years, because of Covid and for various other reasons, students have not had that opportunity.  For Mr. Rawson, Ms Sheppard and the students in our school and our community to see the change these students have made, and to hear the discussions we had in the art room of Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de at 9 a.m. on a Thursday morning happening in the media or on national radio, shows the power of student minds and what they can achieve when they work together.<\/p><p>To answer the question about how it can fit into the school curriculum and where it can be fit in across other years, there is massive potential in that regard but it must be student-led in order for it to be as powerful as it is in transition year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062800002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Following up from what Ms Sheppard and Ms Murphy have said, we have recently done research on social innovation education which shows the power of youth voice.  Youth voice is not an outcome of the well-being of students but is actually an enabler of well-being among young people.  They need to be heard and they need to contribute.  That is interesting.  For all the factors that have been researched on the well-being of young people, this is the first time it has been shown that youth voice is integral to well-being.  That is interesting.<\/p> <p>  Senator Pauline O'Reilly asked what we can change in education.  We have schools that adopt a whole-of-school approach to social innovation.  It is integral to what they do and how they embrace youth-led learning and youth voice in the schools.  They use the community of students to solve problems inside and outside the school.  There should be more project-based work allowed and space provided for it in post-primary schools.  The purpose of all those projects can be for societal good.  Why not?  We promote profit-making businesses in school without a problem.  We promote science and technology.  Why do we not promote all of those things for societal good?  It can happen.  Our school in Lebanon has trained all its teachers and it is core to all their subject areas.  Any project is done with societal good in mind so the young people learn those values very early.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062800002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Collier"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>The argument about this type of learning being crammed into transition year has been well rehearsed and was put forward by many organisations when the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, did its consultation.  In other parts of post-primary education, there is simply not enough space in the curriculum to focus, for example, on social justice and the things that really interest young people.  Particularly in the final two years of the senior cycle when students are preparing for their leaving certificate examinations, it does become a race for points for university entrance.  That means there is no space in the curriculum for young people to do things that give them joy and pleasure, and which make an impact on the communities in which they live.  We consider that very important.<\/p> <p>  From my own experience of the university and college admission system in the North, I know university places are offered on the basis of a student's personal statement, which includes the community work and sporting achievements of a student.  Students are, therefore, incentivised to do those things whereas the system in the South is very much focused on points.  There can be changes in the education system that incentivise young people to do this type of learning because we know it has benefits for them.  Using their voices and agency can have an impact.<\/p> <p>  We also know there is a correlation between educational attainment and different types of thinking, such as systems thinking, design thinking and critical thinking.  Those are the things that are lost in a lot of mainstream education.  Creating the space to allow young people to do those things will have an impact on them as individuals and the communities in which they live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062800002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Peak"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for inviting representatives of Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de to make a presentation on their Be Aware, Don't Compare campaign.  It is a privilege for me to welcome Ms Sheppard, Mr. Rawson, Ms Cullen, Ms Hynes, Ms Mulroe and Mr. Jordan, and indeed Ms Murphy and Ms Dunne, the principal.  It is my second time to welcome them to Leinster House.  I am here not to question them but to thank them for their campaign.  I will support them into the future to see can we bring some form of legislation through this House in response to their requests.<\/p> <p>  The most recent occasion on which representatives from Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de came to Leinster House, we had a great engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, visited Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de in Carnew and the students had two minutes to make a pitch to her.  That was when they grabbed my attention initially.  Since then, I have been honoured to be involved with this important campaign.<\/p><p>It is important that we listen to their needs and to what they are asking us to do in Leinster House to address this issue.  It is a simple ask.  They have asked us to introduce legislation to provide for the labelling of photographs that have been cropped, adjusted or filtered and for that to be clearly identified.  I congratulate these students on their massive PR campaign, which included the local press, the unveiling of a billboard in Gorey when we had a great day out, their engagement with Ryan Tubridy on the \"The Ryan Tubridy Show\" and their engaging with two Ministers, one in Leinster House and one in Carnew.  It is very special and a privilege for them to make it to a committee hearing today and I wish them the best of luck with their proposal.  Theirs is a simple ask.<\/p><p> When it comes to our physical health, we have no issue labelling products that cause harm, be it food products carrying a label with a fat or sugar content, alcohol products with a label indicating the damage alcohol can cause or cigarettes with a label indicating smoking is harmful.  The students have raised the impact photographs have on their mental health.  Why can such photographs not be labelled in terms of protecting young people's mental health and addressing the issue from a health perspective?  It would also have an educational and online impact.  The simple way to address it might be to introduce a legislative measure from a medical point of view and from the point of view of the impact such images have on young people and others.  We all know the impact social media has on our lives and how disturbing it can be.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for allowing me to contribute on this issue.  It is big honour for me as a Wicklow person to welcome students from a Wicklow school to this committee hearing.  I will support the students in whatever way I can to introduce legislation on this issue through the education system, through online media regulation or through the health area.  The students' ask is simple.  Let us label photographs that have been cropped, altered or changed.  All they are asking us to do today is to introduce such legislation.  We know the impact such images have on our mental health.  I thank all of our guests for coming to Leinster House, especially, as my colleague said, during their holidays.  They did not even get a day off school today for their trip to Leinster House.

The legislation around sexting is totally inappropriate for young people.  Often young people see things we do not see because we are not exposed to them.  They see things way ahead of time.  They were a major force in the marriage equality campaign.  LGBT rights have been talked about by young social innovators for years.  They see things in advance of the rest of us.

I reckon I will cover what I want to say in the allocated eight minutes.  It has been very refreshing to listen to all the students.  Senator Pat Casey is an incredible advocate for the school and what they are doing.  He shared with me a video that they put together, which is excellent.  I commend them on that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of social innovators in general, YSI is an incredible movement.<\/p><p>It is so important all our young people, no matter where they are, have the opportunity to learn about social entrepreneurship and the importance of teamwork.  I often think teamwork and collaboration is so important when we go into the world of work and no matter what we do, we cannot do it in isolation.  Yet, when we are in school and marked in our State exams, there is nothing really to give the opportunity for that type of collaboration to be tested.<\/p><p> This particular committee has spent much time over the past two years looking at reform of the leaving certificate.  This should be one of the areas in which we should be able to consider examination in some other way.  It is such a big part of life and yet we are marked for going in and completing a paper in isolation.  I am interested in general in comments relating to that.<\/p><p> That the witnesses have chosen this area is really important.  I am very proud to be a member of this committee but I am also a member of the education committee for the Council of Europe and that is where 46 countries come together.  There were 47 countries but after 24 February we booted out Russia because it was no upholding the principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.  We have the opportunity to look at different areas that affect education.  I was in Strasbourg last week and we spoke much about online communication and cybersecurity.  With the permission of the delegation, I would be delighted to be able to bring this project to the attention of my colleagues and the secretariat so we can have a discussion with colleagues from Norway about the legislation and what difficulties they may have had.  I note from the presentation that the UK tried to do this but was not able to bring it through.  We must see what are the potential pitfalls.<\/p><p> The work done on body image and body shaming is very important.  Every political party has a think-in every year and I happen to be a member of the same party as Senator Casey.  Last year, after our think-in, an article was written that body-shamed and clothes-shamed a number of representatives, particularly women.  There were six women named in that article and I was one of them, and we were slagged about what we were wearing.  Some of the men, although they were not photographed, were mentioned as well.<\/p><p> A number of women contacted me afterwards because they felt it was a really bad message for young people and particularly young girls that politicians were being judged on what they wore as opposed to what they were saying or the key matters on which we were meeting.  I want to give the witnesses some time to respond on that.<\/p><p> I love that Ms Sheppard finished by saying \"love who you are\" because it is such a strong message that cuts across everything.  It cuts across gender identity, ethnicity and all of that.  The projects that came in first, second and third place are really important.  They concerned food waste, mica and menstrual disorders.  We in the women's caucus have put much work into efforts against period poverty and it is in the programme for Government.  I hope measures against it will be introduced in September.<\/p><p> Generally speaking, this is a wonderful programme and I wish all the witnesses well.

I feel that at the end of the day, it is all just pushed into one exam.  We sit at our own desks with our own paper and we are marked on this one paper.

As a group, we can make our point.  If one person forgets something, the others can help out.  When we go in to sit a State exam, we are on our own.  Someone who is sick, for example with a headache, has to sit an exam that could be the difference between becoming a doctor or becoming a blocklayer.  The points we get can dictate the rest of our lives.  In Northern Ireland they have personal statements, where students can say how they are in communities.  We found with YSI that some of us like speaking in public but others do not.  Some people prefer the quiet approach.  I think the examination format for the leaving certificate, with everyone all by themselves, is very harsh.

The students decided who should lead the project, based on the merits of each individual.  Molly and Darragh have done a fantastic job in steering the class.  The students are clever.  They know each other's strengths.  Within our class we had individual groups working on design, logos and content for our school app and social media.  Working within groups allowed the students to work to their strengths.  Different people have different strengths.  An exam-based system only works for some people.  I am thinking of that famous cartoon where they have lots of different animals together and they tell them that success is getting to the top of a tree.  In the same group of animals there is a goldfish and a monkey.

I will go to the students first and maybe Ms Murphy will come in afterwards.  The committee has done a lot of module work on school bullying, including a report the witnesses might have seen, and on leaving certificate reform, as Senator O'Loughlin has mentioned.  The issue that came forward in both modules of work was social media and its effects on mental health, as Senator Casey has said.<\/p> <p>  We do not want to mention the dreaded word of suicide but we all know people who have died by suicide because of social media, secondary school students especially.  I have encountered it in my own constituency of Wexford.  We have had families communicating to this committee whose son or daughter died by suicide as a result of bullying on social media.  Did that form part of any of the research the witnesses are doing around social media?  There are a lot of people who do not want to talk about it, but I think it is so important that we talk about it and we make people aware that there is a lot of help out there.  There was an item on Ryan Tubridy's radio show this morning about a third year student at Maynooth University who committed suicide, although the show did not say it was because of social media or anything like that.  There is a lot of help out there but often people are afraid to go and ask for it, or maybe they are afraid it is not there.<\/p><p>Did that form part of our guests&rsquo; research?

In my opinion, if people get to the stage where they might need help, speaking to somebody, even once, to get it of their chest could make a big difference.  We recommend advertising it more.

I hope the committee will discuss this in September and visit the UK to look at the programme rolled out there in respect of therapeutic counsellors.  The therapeutic counsellor would be a person who is on-site in primary and post-primary schools so that a student does not have to make a phone call to get help.

We very rarely hear a conversation that does not start with, \"Did you see that online?\" or \"She said that online\".  Every conversation they have revolves around online media.  When something negative about them is put online, because their world is social media, their world crumbles down.  They do not have the sense of how transient and short-lived things are online that it will blow over in two or three days.  When you are in your world and something bad has been said about you online or a picture or post or whatever it is that has caused someone to go to that dark place, it seems like their entire world has turned against them.  The fact that it will blow over in two or three days and there will be another bikini thing or something to talk about down the line, the young people do not understand that.

It is lovely to have Young Social Innovators students from Col&aacute;iste Br&iacute;de here.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely understand and fully appreciate Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's motivation in bringing forward this Bill.  Equally, however, I am very conscious that schools have put a considerable amount of work, time, effort and energy into developing the new school admission policies, which have taken root in our schools only in the past academic year.  A key feature of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act is that where schools are not oversubscribed, they must accept all applicants.  The vast majority of our schools are not oversubscribed.  Equally, schools have the opportunity to opt out of the provision.  My view is that there is insufficient evidence available to us at this point to indicate that the provision this Bill proposes to delete poses difficulties for those seeking admission to schools where it is in use.  I note also that the pre-legislative scrutiny report of the committee recommends not only deletion but also the setting up of an expert group.  I believe that the establishment of an expert group to review the impact of the provision of the Act would be a useful first step.  I consider that a reasonable approach.  I therefore signal my intention to table on Report Stage an amendment to the Deputy's Bill which will establish an expert group to examine the impact of subsection 62(10)(b) on school admissions and provide a report detailing the expert group's findings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022062800002#A00500","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding the Minister's goodwill towards my motivation, I am crushingly disappointed by her attitude to the Bill and by the Department's response to the Bill.  It flies completely in the face of what the Minister is trying to do this week in respect of section 37A of the Education Act.  We are told to rush through legislation this week in order for it to be ready for September, yet we are told that schools cannot change their admissions policies for this September or even the following September.  The Minister tells me there is no evidence this provision has any effect.  Why is it there, then?  The very basis of the argument is that if even one child is disadvantaged by the provision, it needs to go.  I am blue in the face making the same argument over and over again but I will make it again.  This provision was inserted at the behest of those who are trying unfairly to keep an elitist bloodline running through certain schools' admissions policies, from grandfather to father to son or from grandmother to mother to daughter.  It is patently unfair on, for example, children of early school leavers, children whose parents are not from the area and, indeed, children whose parents are not from Ireland.  We can say all we want about Ukrainian students in this State, but I ask the Minister to imagine if even one Ukrainian was not able to access a second level school place on the basis of this provision because there are greater rights for those whose parents or grandparents went to the school in question.  The lack of energy or understanding on the part of the Department on this baffles me because there is no argument against what I and the committee and people such as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, who supported this Bill, are trying to achieve.  This provision should not have been put into law in the first place; it should not still be there.  I ask the Minister to imagine even one family in this State saying in years to come: \"We had hoped our child might be admitted to second level school A, but it was not possible because my parents did not go to school.\"  In a Republic, it should make us all deeply ashamed that such a provision exists.<\/p> <p>  I remember the previous debate we had on this in the D&aacute;il.  I walked into the Chamber and was excited as to what the Minister might provide.  I remember my first contribution being to the effect that I hoped she had come to the table with some level of understanding as to how we could collectively work together.  I was crushed by her presentation because I believe in these Houses of the Oireachtas and I believe there is no opposition, really, to what we are trying to achieve here.<\/p><p>Education is everything.  It is all that has benefited some families to break out of poverty.  Education is the only opportunity unless one's parents have money.  This is why it is so emotivel and so important.<\/p><p> I would ask the Minister to reconsider her position and the Department's position on this.  The Minister could easily row in behind this.  The provision could easily be deleted.  Every school in the country only has to change its enrolment policies for September 2023.  It is as simple as that.  One no longer gets to choose a child whose parents or grandparents went to this school over some other child.  It is as simple as that.<\/p><p> It is having an effect in areas that I represent or on parents who come to me from all over the country.  It is patently wrong and patently unfair.  The argument that we cannot be sure how many people are affected by it does not stack up.  It should not be there and it needs to go.<\/p><p> In summary, I have been leading this process.  I was delighted to be in the position to bring it forward.  The Department told me that the Minister would delay Second Stage for 12 months in order to do all the groundwork that needed to be done and I waited patiently from November 2020 to November 2021.  The Minister knows that is true.  We delayed the passing of Second Stage for 12 months.  We are in a position where the Minister comes back to this table and I am patiently waiting here for this Bill to be passed, but we want more reviews and we want to see how schools can have a number of admissions cycles to work through it.  What the Minister is doing is wrong.  The Minister knows it is wrong.  The Department knows its wrong.  I do not know what lobby group has such a hold over the Department that this needs to stay.  I can imagine who they are.<\/p><p> On this issue, the Minister needs to change her position.  The Minister needs to row in behind the Bill.  This section of the Act needs to be deleted.  We could all go back to normal and look children in the eye in September 2023 and say that it does not matter who one's parents or grandparents are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022062800002#A00600","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I reiterate my support for this legislation.  I commend Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on his work in relation to it.<\/p> <p>  We had pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation.  There is no coherent argument against it.  There is no argument that ultimately holds any water.<\/p> <p>  On the argument around most of the schools being undersubscribed, the problem, as with anything, in relation to admissions and who is admitted will only arise when a school is oversubscribed.  It is for that reason we have regulations as such.  It is for that reason we have admissions policies.  If no school was oversubscribed, we would not need admissions policies at all and every child would simply have a place.<\/p> <p>  The circumstances in which this applies - maybe in most schools it is not an issue because they are not oversubscribed - arise in the schools which are oversubscribed.  There are parts of the country where there is severe competition for school places in areas where there is a large young population.  In parts of Cork, much of Dublin, Kildare, parts of Wicklow and parts of County Meath there is a significant young population.  In those places, what the current legislation allows for is that where there are a limited number of places and there is a decision to be made between a child who lives 15 miles away but whose father or mother attended the school and a child who lives five doors away, it is the child who lives 15 miles away who will be preferred.  That is objectively true under the current proposal.  It provides that a school takes up the scope and the powers that it has to put in place such an admissions policy.  That being the case, that is the child who will be preferred.  That should not be acceptable to us in any way.<\/p> <p>  It is perfectly reasonable, in terms of families and their arrangements, etc., that preference is given to siblings.  That is a reasonable proposition, but in relation to parents, and even grandparents, one is potentially disadvantaging the local child.  It is the local child who should be at the centre of any decisions made on admissions.  Every child should be in a position to attend his or her local school provided that there are adequate spaces and if there are not, decisions about who gets in need to be made on a fair basis.  It is not a fair basis to prioritise those whose parents or grandparents attended.  One will continue to have a school tradition because many families will still live in the local community and many children will attend the school their parents and grandparents attended; the traditions, the culture and the history of the school can continue in that way, but it should not be at the expense of the child who lives five doors away from the school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022062800002#B00200","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank both Deputies.

I thank the members for the invitation to meet with the joint sub-committee to provide an update on the Linn Dara CAMHS service.  I am joined by my colleagues, Brendan Doody, Mary O'Kelly and Kevin Brady.<\/p> <p>  I will provide an overview of the HSE Linn Dara service.  CAMHS provides specialist mental health service to those aged up to 18 years, who have reached the threshold for a diagnosis of moderate to severe mental health disorder that requires the input of a consultant-led multidisciplinary mental health team.  CAMHS inpatient units offer assessment and treatment to children and adolescents up to the age of 18, with severe and often complex mental health difficulties.  For those aged over 18, general adult community teams and inpatient units provide these services.  Approximately 2% of the under-18 population will require a CAMHS intervention at any given time.<\/p> <p>  Linn Dara CAMHS in Dublin south, Kildare and west Wicklow provides the following services: community mental health teams; a community eating disorder service; Linn Dara approved centre, inpatient unit; ADMiRE-ADHD pathway; consultation and liaison psychiatry at the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght; and two mental health intellectual disability teams for mental health of intellectual disability services.<\/p> <p>  In line with the HSE CAMHS operational guide 2019, the Linn Dara approved centre provides acute, emergency and specialist inpatient child and adolescent mental health services and treatment on a tertiary basis for children and adolescents with severe and complex mental illness.  The approved centre is registered, regulated and inspected by the Mental Health Commission and subject to regulatory inspection in relation to care and treatment, facilities and premises, staffing and governance.<\/p> <p>  The Linn Dara approved centre is a 24-bedded unit, which is configured into three wards - Rowan, Oak and Hazel.  The Rowan and Hazel wards both consist of 11 individual beds and the Oak ward has two beds, which provide high dependency and care.  The Linn Dara approved centre provides services on a regional and national remit.  Our primary catchment area is community healthcare organisations 6, 7 and 8.  Linn Dara also works with the other specialist inpatient mental health services to provide services on a national basis as the need arises and where clinically appropriate.  The 24 beds in the Linn Dara approved centre are as follows: two high-dependency CAMHS beds, eight specialist eating disorder CAMHS beds and 14 acute or emergency CAMHS beds.<\/p> <p>  The Linn Dara approved centre provides eight specialist eating disorder beds, SEDBs, to level 4 care and treatment for children and adolescents with severe and complex eating disorders.  Level 4 in the HSE model of care for eating disorders is classified as the most intensive treatment setting.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the service developments at Linn Dara CAMHS.  The Linn Dara community eating disorder service was officially launched in September 2019.<\/p><p>It was the first Irish community-based dedicated eating disorder service for children and young people under the age of 18.  The team operates at levels 2, 3 and 4 of the stepped model of care, providing specialised outpatient, day patient care and support to people with eating disorders with an enhanced range of treatment options.<\/p><p> The ADMiRE ADHD pathway, which stands for assessment, diagnosis, management initiation, research and education, is the first public specialist service for children and adolescents with ADHD in Ireland.  Set up in September 2018 in south Dublin Linn Dara CAMHS, the primary goal was to reduce waiting times and provide early access to evidence-based assessment and management for young people with ADHD.<\/p><p> On the Kildare and west Wicklow community CAMHS team, in 2021 Linn Dara established a new community CAMHS team based in the Athy primary care centre serving south Kildare and south-west Wicklow, bringing the number of community CAMHS teams in Kildare and west Wicklow to a total of five.  Linn Dara has also established two specialist teams to deliver specialist mental health service to the mental health intellectual disability, MHID, community across the CHO and continues to develop this service through the national clinical programme.<\/p><p> Regarding new development posts, building on existing services and investments in CAMHS, in 2022 Linn Dara was allocated an additional &euro;950,000 to recruit nine new additional posts across the service, with recruitment currently ongoing.  These posts were targeted at the further development of the ADMiRE ADHD team and the community teams in Kildare and west Wicklow.<\/p><p> There are challenges in this area.  The Linn Dara approved centre treats complex and high-dependency cases that require intensive input from experienced and specialist staff.  Nursing posts account for more than 75% of the multidisciplinary staffing complement of an inpatient service.  The ability of the service to provide the necessary standards of quality care on a sustainable basis for patients over a 24-7 cycle depends on the necessary nursing staffing being in place.  Unfortunately, due to the level of current and projected core HSE nursing staff vacancies, the service was left with no choice but to reduce the number of operational beds on a temporary basis.  Extensive efforts continue, both nationally and internationally, to recruit nurses to these vacant posts.  This temporary reduction in bed capacity is being done strictly on the basis that the beds that will remain operational are available with a safe and sustainable staffing ratio, on a 24-7 basis.<\/p><p> Post Covid, there has been an increase in referrals to both to community and inpatient services within CAMHS.  Such an increase in referrals will have an impact on the level of service delivery, with the likelihood of increased waiting lists.  The response of CAMHS to the public health emergency has brought about some benefits, such as a rapid adoption and effective use of telehealth and video-enabled care.  It also created a public discourse about the importance of mental health to personal and societal well-being, thereby strengthening the case for continued investment in CAMHS and service developments to meet these increasing demands.<\/p><p> Since opening in December 2015, Linn Dara has continued to develop a number of services, as I have outlined, using models of care supported by clinical evidence through the national clinical programmes.  Notwithstanding the improvements, we are very aware of the continued need to further develop services and deal with identified challenges, including staffing vacancies, which impact on service delivery.  We will continue to work with all stakeholders in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022062800002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their contributions and the work they do on behalf of the people of Ireland.

The majority of young people who are admitted are admitted in a timely manner, although we have young people waiting longer than that for a bed.  The group who are usually waiting longer are primarily those with specific eating disorders.

There has been a huge increase in the number of people presenting with eating disorders specifically.  The vast majority of eating disorders are treated in the community and a small number will require inpatient admission.  As one would expect, one of the reasons for inpatient admission is that treatment in the community has not been effective.  Young people who are admitted will be admitted because they require the treatment package that can be delivered in an inpatient setting.  Some young people will re-present, given the severity of their conditions.  The children who will be admitted are more likely to have severe and chronic disorders.  A proportion will be readmitted but the majority of our admissions will be one-off admissions.<\/p> <p>  Inpatient services are dependent on the availability of community services to provide that level of intensive input at community level.

In recent years we have seen an upward trend in young people presenting with eating disorders and we have seen that they are presenting at an earlier age.  We also noted that the pandemic accelerated this increase.  There was an upward trajectory and we would feel that if you look at our referrals there is a correlation.  We have looked at referrals to the inpatient unit and in admissions and we definitely saw a Covid pandemic affect.  The impact of the Covid pandemic on the mental health and well-being of young people was negative and we saw an increase in a range of disorders, particularly anxiety-type disorders.

Through our multidisciplinary team, which includes family therapists, there is a strong focus on families and on working with families.

In other words, for us to be able to continue to provide that service, and it is a very specialist inpatient service, we must have adequate staffing.

I thank the staff who work in CAMHS and other front-line mental health services.  I had the privilege of meeting Ms O'Kelly in the primary healthcare centre in Tallaght recently as well as the staff there.

I also pay tribute to the nursing staff who are on the front line of all this.<\/p> <p>  However, the reality is that the decision to close 11 inpatient beds in Linn Dara is another abject failure of the Government to address children's mental health services.  According to the latest figures I have, there are 308 admissions of children into CAMHS.<\/p><p>Of those 308 admissions, 138 went to Linn Dara, which seems to be the primary place for inpatient admissions.  There are only 53 beds throughout the State at present.  A reply I received to a parliamentary question on 16 June indicated Linn Dara went down from 24 to 13 beds, St. Vincent's dropped from 12 beds to ten and Merlin Park in Galway has been reduced from 20 to 14 beds.  The only unit that had no change is Eist Linn in Cork.  The reductions seem to be almost right across the board.  We have heard from stakeholders and parents who are all very concerned that this closure of beds could lead to a further decrease in the services children get.  It could also lead to the placement of children in adult psychiatric facilities, which is another concern they have.<\/p><p> To return specifically to Linn Dara, this is the second time in five years this has happened.  The last time beds were closed in a similar situation was 2017.  What lessons have been learned?

When I asked a parliamentary question, the reply I received &ndash; it was actually signed by Mr. Ryan &ndash; stated that 49 children had been admitted to Merlin Park or Linn Dara in 2021 but that, in the same period, 115 children whose primary presentations were for eating disorders had been admitted to non-eating disorder inpatient public acute mental health facilities.  I have spoken to parents whose children are going through this process.  Their children are brought in and are not getting the specialist treatment and food intake supervision that they need.  All that seems to be done for them is to increase their body mass indices, at which point they are released, but it is a vicious circle, with them going back in and back out again.  While I welcome that there were places for 49 children to be admitted to specialist eating disorder units, there were another 115 children who needed that specialist help but were not getting it.<\/p><p>Is anything being done to address that?

The challenge is that there has been a very significant increase in demand over the last few years, as Dr. Doody mentioned earlier.  We are running to catch up.  A few years ago there was significant criticism of the practice of transferring young people abroad for the treatment of eating disorders, in particular.  I do not think anybody has been treated abroad in the last three years, which is a significant improvement.  That does not mean we are meeting the demand that is there at the moment.  Dr. Doody might speak to that issue.  It is about the journey we are on, particularly in relation to community care for patients with eating disorders and inpatient care.

We have eight eating disorder beds.  Obviously, that is a finite resource in respect of the number of young people we can admit.  Due to the fact the beds are specialist eating disorder beds and that we also offer the option of nasogastric, NG, feeding, we are able to admit young people who are much more unwell from paediatric ward settings.  We can treat them in a service where they are getting more than just the nutritional treatment, but also all of the other therapeutic interventions and the comprehensive therapeutic care package.  The team assesses all children with eating disorders who are referred to the service.  We make an assessment and prioritise the young people who we feel require and would benefit from inpatient care.  Given that we now have a specialist eating disorder community service, there may some cases where the needs of the young person can be met by that service.  We talked about the number of referrals earlier.  Looking at the figures from the community eating disorder team, the number of children that the community eating disorder team is referring on for inpatient admission is usually less than five per year.  The national clinical programme is about the need to provide specialist services in the community to enable parents to access specialist treatment in the community such that their child does not require to be admitted to hospital or an inpatient CAMHS setting.  On the one had, thinking back, when A Vision for Change was launched all those years ago there was a view that nationally, all we would require would be four inpatient beds for eating disorders.  Looking at what has happened over the last few years, we recognised the increased demand for the services, but we did not anticipate the degree to which the demand would explode.  We are obviously, in a sense, trying to catch up with something that is increasing.  It is important that we take a whole-system approach, particularly given the fact that the majority of young people with eating disorders can be treated successfully in the community.  Those specialist services need to be there.  The fact we have that specialist community service in Linn Dara is really positive.  It enables the young people and families to access specialist treatment at a community level, without having to wait for it.  That reduces the likelihood of negative outcomes.  We know that the longer an eating disorder persists, the more likely it is to become chronic.  The young people who are more likely to require inpatient treatment are those who have a disorder that persists.  In other words, the key is being able to access the specialist treatment in a timely fashion in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022062800002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan Doody"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I also want to raise the issue of the referrals to CAMHS that are not accepted.

We are saying that the 2% Dr. Doody mentioned earlier - internationally it is normally 2% to 3% - who require CAMHS may fall outside of it but that does not mean they do not need services.

Children are not referred without a need.  A question arises when CAMHS believes that need does not fall within its acceptance criteria.  For families, that does not mean a child does not have a need that needs to be met by services.  The reasons community CAMHS will not accept a referral are that the young person's presentation is such that he or she does not require the accessing of specialist mental health services, or the child's needs primarily require other interventions, as the Deputy said, with regard to disability services.  He specifically mentioned children with autism.<\/p> <p>  Again, the Deputy is correct that if children have a neurodevelopmental disorder, that does not mean they cannot have a mental health problem as well.  It is about steps with us.  We have looked at forums, which the chief officer can also talk about, regarding how we as a much broader HSE service - we are one part of a service - integrate the various components of HSE service work more closely together such that families do not feel, as the Deputy said, they have slipped between the gaps of two services.  Some of that is about recognising that these children have needs.  We then need to look at resourcing primary care, which we also talk about.  Sometimes the issue can be one of gaps in primary care, for example, if there is not adequate resourcing of primary care psychology services.  Young people are then referred to a specialist service, when their need would be much better met at a lower or primary care level.  It is something within the CHO area for which there is an acknowledgement of how the wider and broader range of HSE services meet the needs of this group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022062800002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan Doody"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Quite a number of the questions I wanted to ask have been very comprehensively covered.

We talk about young people, for example, with eating disorders, for whom, clearly, the primary goal of inpatient is weight restoration and normalisation of dietary intake such that the young person is able to function and return to be with their family and in the community.  In a sense, when it comes to a clear outcome, that would be the target for a young person with an eating disorder.<\/p> <p>  All young people who are admitted will have care plans, which identify the goals of treatment and admission.  These are updated on a regular basis.  During the admission, the team will work closely with the community service to which the young person will return to on discharge.  That is very important because the inpatient setting is very intensive and stepping down to a community setting can at times be both daunting and challenging, that is, going from a very intensive service to a community service.  Again, it is very much about identifying what additional supports will facilitate and allow for that transition.  That transition obviously takes working with the young person, the family, but also the services in the community.  Are there additional supports that can be provided within the service that the young person is attending? <\/p> <p>  With regard to the young person reintegrating, our school is also a very important part of our service.  The Linn Dara schools will link with the young person&rsquo;s school to make sure that young person has a smooth transition back into his or her school and assess if a different type of schooling is required.  We also run a kind of a transition school programme.  Young people can step down within our educational programme.

Obviously if you look back, in 2010 more young people were being admitted to adult units than to child units.  As a percentage of admissions it is now down to 7% of admissions to HSE.  There was a total of 361 admissions in 2021 and 27 were admitted to adult units.  Of those, 16 subsequently transferred to CAMHS units.  If, as Jim has said, we have the national tele-call - if a young person is admitted to an adult unit they are seen and assessed and what we find is on average a young person is three or four days in that adult setting and then either transferred to a CAMHS unit or discharged.  Last year, 60% of those admitted to an adult unit were subsequently transferred to a CAMHS unit and again the average age was 17 and a half years.  The vast majority of these young people are actually aged 17 years.  Although it is 7% of admissions if you look at actual bed days it is much smaller than that.  Clearly, one would like to reduce this as much as possible.  However, I do not think it is realistic as in a crisis situation admission to an adult unit may be in the young person's best interest but again, if that occurs it should be for the minimum amount of time and the young person should be transferred as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  Within our particular primary catchment area we have had very few admissions to adult units in the past two and a half years.  However, again the focus should be not only on reducing the number of admissions but also ensuring if an admission occurs the young person is assessed, triaged and transferred if that is appropriate and if they are not, that they are discharged, so it is not that young people are spending extended periods of time in adult units.

We have done a few things over recent years.  There is an increasing demand for health services generally, and our ability to meet that demand has to be met in different ways.  One of the things we have done in mental health is around e-health and e-mental health, and that is a way in which we can reduce the number of young people or adults who need to go up the line.<\/p><p>Under the tiered model of care, we are trying to have as many people as possible seen at the lower level.  Taking youth mental health as an example, we have a service agreement with the likes of Jigsaw, Turn To Me, MyMind, SpunOut, etc.  All these organisations are able to pivot very quickly.  They can upscale their operations.  That is an attractive way for young people to access services when traditionally they might have come to mental health services.  We have attempted to take that approach over recent years, and mental health was one of the initiators of that approach.  It has made a big difference.  The numbers attending Jigsaw are increasing significantly.  It has the same issues that we have about providing bricks and mortar services but it is able to upscale its online service much quicker because people can work from home and work more flexible hours, as we mentioned earlier.  We must do a combination of things.  We must ensure our secondary and tertiary care services are delivered by professionally qualified and appropriate staff.  We must reduce the numbers moving up the system through our services and by working with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, which have a significant role to play.<\/p><p> I worked for an NGO in Tallaght as a youth worker years ago.  Treatment from an NGO makes a considerable difference because young people are in their own communities and within their own settings.  We are trying to reduce the numbers of people moving up the system.  On the point Ms O'Kelly made earlier, we will have to look at some way of trying to incentivise some services.  Other people will come in here and say we are not prioritising their area.  We are in competition with the likes of enhanced community care.  \"Competition\" is not the right word.  Citizens need more services and we are trying to deliver them.  The way in which we provide services must include face-to-face consultations but the other ways of doing it online will make a difference.  Rather than seeing those alternatives as less positive, we should instead be saying how much more positive they are.  We have many examples of that.  Some young people much prefer texting and online consultations to face-to-face consultations.  Rather than seeing that as a problem, we should see it as a benefit and take advantage of social media and different ways to try to deliver services.  We are not going to be able to deliver services for everybody in every part of the country in the manner people might have thought we could.  Consultants in more peripheral areas of the country find it difficult.  South Kerry was mentioned earlier in that regard.  It is more difficult to get consultants in such areas.   However, remote consultation works quite well.<\/p><p> A combination of approaches is required.  There is no silver bullet.  We need to prioritise certain of our services and that is why we have found the need to prioritise the 2% of young people who require secondary care and those types of services.  Those are the sickest young people we have from a mental health perspective.  I do not believe there is any one solution because if there were, somebody else would have thought of it before me.  We must continue to do those type of things.  It is about trying to broaden the way in which we deliver services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022062800002#S01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":322,"content":"<p>One thing we would like to be able to look at it, which we have discussed in the CHO, is growing our own.  We are a population of more than 700,000 and a large part of the area is socially deprived.  Families are striving hard with children in secondary education.  The first academic primary care centre in the country is in the Russell Centre, Tallaght, which Deputy Ward visited recently.  Trinity College Dublin is its academic partner.  One of the pieces we would like to look at is being able to grow our own within our population.  There is an anchor of people who live in the area.  We had that discussion.  There are people who live in the area and who are passionate about working in their local communities.  That is definitely something to consider from a national point of view.  Deputy Ward will be sick of hearing me say this but we must consider being able to assist people with accommodation and a weighting in addition to basic pay.

We deal with families who are impacted because someone they love has an addiction problem.  An awful lot of family members come to the RISE Foundation with mental health issues.  Initially, we would not have thought online consultations would have worked but they are actually working better from a therapeutic point of view.  The foundation has fully qualified therapists and the service is working better from a therapeutic point of view, whether it is one to one, a group dynamic or aftercare.  It is definitely working, which was a real eye-opener for us, and it expands our services countrywide.  People do not have to travel from Donegal anymore, for example.  They can avail of our services in their homes now.  We find that very beneficial.  It is one of the ways forward but, obviously, it does not suit everyone.<\/p> <p>  More and more people are being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.  This is an area in which I have a specific interest.  Many of these diagnoses are of adults who suffered greatly in educational or workplace settings because their needs were not recognised.  This definitely demonstrates the importance of early diagnosis.  Will the witnesses tell me a little more about the assessment, diagnosis, management initiation, research and education, ADMIRE, ADHD pathway?

It is about how we improve the service and, following the programmatic approach, assess children in a comprehensive, effective and efficient manner to ensure a diagnosis is made and treatment is initiated.  We found that we often do well in the diagnosis service, but the quality of aftercare and treatment, which will often include medication, needs to be looked at and optimised.<\/p> <p>  The pathway, which is linked academically with Trinity College Dublin and is led by Professor Jane McGrath, is new and innovative and looks at taking the best from models abroad as to how to deliver for this group of children.  A diagnosis of ADHD for children and families can be life changing.  It gives families an understanding that their child's difficulties are something over which the child does not necessarily have full control.  The thing about ADHD is that it is not just a condition.  If left untreated, the outcomes for young people going from childhood to adulthood are not good.  Children with ADHD often have other difficulties that need to be picked up on as well.<\/p> <p>  Our pathway has won a number of awards.  For families, the link between academic and research has been very important.  When we were allocating a new development post, we saw that we needed to develop and strengthen the ADHD pathway team further because of the level of demand and throughput.  As a service, the pathway has been developing and putting together assessment packages that will be widely available.  Professor McGrath has received a lot of interest from services around the country as to what they can learn in regard to providing the best possible assessment and treatment for this group.<\/p> <p>  Children with ADHD make up a significant proportion of those who attend CAMHS services.  It is important we optimise the diagnosis, treatment and aftercare.  As was pointed out, it is often the case that when parents attend services with their children that they recognise they had those difficulties when they were a child.<\/p><p>We now need to develop services for adults because we have children who are being diagnosed and treated reaching their 18th birthday but where are the adult services to take them on?  That is one group.  You could say the young people are graduating.  There are also adults who, for the first time, are realising they need access to a treatment service.  The need to develop this has been recognised within the clinical programmes.  Once upon a time there was a belief ADHD was just a condition of childhood and that when you reached adulthood you grew out of it.  For a proportion it lessens in adulthood but for some their difficulties continue into adulthood and there is a need to not only diagnose it but also treat appropriately.  That is something for the national clinical programme and Mr. Ryan can perhaps talk about the development of services for adults.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022062800002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan Doody","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":326,"content":"<p>Just to add to that, we have recently received an additional five posts for the development of an adult ADHD team as well.

When a referral comes in, it is triaged.  It is not the case that everyone goes to the back of the queue.  Urgent cases are prioritised.  A child who is suicidal or a child with a serious eating disorder absolutely would be prioritised.  The concern about children who just meet the threshold is that a young person's presentation may not be seen as being as severe or as acute.  In other words, the concern is that the priority cases will forever jump to the top of the queue.  As for those on waiting lists, things change and families are encouraged to make contact and to speak to the team involved.  The Chairman talked about eating disorders, for example.  Currently, in our community specialist eating disorder service there are 15 on a waiting list, but 13 of those have an appointment and are seen in a very timely fashion.  The children who have that more acute presentation will be seen.  Sometimes the children waiting are those whose presentation is not as severe or as acute.  The case is made that if the children are waiting, things will deteriorate because they are not getting intervention.  That is a very valid point.  When our overall number of referrals are climbing and climbing and the complexity of the cases attending or being referred is increasing, we have to look at how we, as a service, meet the needs of all the young people who are referred.  It is challenging.  The children with more acute or severe presentation are seen and prioritised.  All referrals are prioritised, and those with the greatest need will be prioritised to be seen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022062800002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan Doody"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I have one more question.

It is proposed to remove this requirement and to allow the Garda Commissioner to determine this.
