The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, will be in attendance.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Ms Rachel Collier, CEO, and Mr. Barry Peak, learning and training specialist, from Young Social Innovators, YSI.  Mr. Gerry Fitzpatrick, chairperson, YSI, cannot attend due to illness.  I also welcome a delegation from Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de, Carnew, County Wicklow that comprises Ms Karen Murphy, teacher, Mr. Darragh Rawson, student, and Ms Annie Sheppard, student, who undertook the YSI project.  The witnesses are here to discuss the YSI project.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Ms Collier to make a brief five-minute opening statement.  She will be followed by Mr. Rawson and Ms Sheppard, who will share a five-minute slot.  Members will then each have an eight-minute slot to ask questions and receive responses from the witnesses.  I ask the witnesses and members to keep an eye on the time shown on the television screens during their slots.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee will publish the opening statement on its website following the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>That also applies to the witnesses.

Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks by the Chair.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction from the Chair.<\/p><p> I call on Ms Collier to make her opening statement to be followed by the other two statements.

The vision of Young Social Innovators is to inspire, equip and empower young people to change the world for good.  We do this through social innovation education.  In essence, through the social innovation programmes we have designed, we engage thousands of young people, mainly teenagers, in social issues that concern them.  In teams, they explore these issues, identify new responses or solutions and turn their ideas into action.  It is team-based, action-focused and very much youth-led.  Importantly for everyone, it exemplifies inclusive education.<\/p> <p>  Every year, we invite teenagers to take part in social innovation projects.  They do this mainly through schools, Youthreach centres and youth services that sign up and receive access to our programmes and educator training.  We train educators to facilitate teams of young people using our unique social innovation framework and resources.  Teams at senior cycle are invited to a series of regional and national events.  We operate a social impact fund on an annual basis and have given out over &euro;100,000 to young people over the past 15 years.  The Speak Out tour is another feature.  We host it in the provinces and it gives an opportunity to young people to share their ideas locally, some of which are selected for our national awards. <\/p> <p>  Young Social Innovators, YSI, may be best known for its annual awards but that is just one element of our work.  We have a competitive element, which is optional for young people, but our overriding purpose is to empower young people in society and to give them opportunities to contribute to creating a fairer and more sustainable world and to create much-needed social capital in Ireland, ultimately building our capacity to address the many challenges we face.<\/p> <p>  To date, more than 150,000 young people in some 600 schools have taken part in setting up over 5,000 youth-led innovations.  YSI has trained more than 1,500 educators.  Every year, approximately 220 post-primary schools and 14,000 to 15,000 young people get involved.  We are also piloting a programme in primary schools.<\/p> <p>  YSI is, in fact, the originator of the concept of social innovation education in the world.  This is a term we use to describe the learning and practice of using creativity to develop ideas to improve the well-being of people, communities and the planet.  While social innovation and entrepreneurship and its methods were gaining momentum in the early 2000s, education in the area had yet to be discovered.  It was virtually unheard of.  It is informed by values of social justice, human rights and sustainable development and a firm belief that young people can and should contribute to communities and society in a much more pervasive way.  It involves a pathway of change that incorporates design thinking, human-centred design and frameworks for critical and creative thinking. <\/p> <p>  The 2020 programme for Government commits to expanding access to social innovation programmes to all post-primary schools.  With investment from the Tomar Trust and the Department of Education through the Dormant Accounts Fund, we are doing this by developing an area-based approach to youth-led social innovation.  We now have local leaders in ten regions around the country.  As well as supporting local schools, we are building networks of support for youth-led social innovation in different sectors from the business sector to the public, education and community sectors.  We are ambitious in this approach.  There is a challenge here that is not just for schools, education services and youth services.  We are attempting to change a culture which has largely been exclusive of young people&rsquo;s ideas and voices to one which is inclusive of youth voice, participation and innovation.<\/p><p>YSI is conscious that for this to happen, there is a need for us all to take up the challenge.  It needs to be an important part of our very culture and the way we do things.  We need all sectors on board to place a value on young people, their ideas and their innovations.  They want to be involved, as we know from research we recently carried out with Am&aacute;rach Research on the generation Z index, which was published last week and shows teenagers want to be involved.  In fact, 78% of them want a greater say in future policies and planning, while 35% of them would consider becoming a political representative, which is very good news.  Importantly, however, the vast majority, or 82%, do not believe young people have a say in how their area is planned, while a majority of members of generation Z approached for the survey wanted those over the age of 16 to have a vote and a say in Ireland.<\/p><p> We have seen many impactful projects over the years, not least those initiated by the young people here today, including the origin of the National Missing Persons Day, which was adopted by the then Department of Justice and Equality and which every year brings families together to remember those lost or missing.  Many towns have benefited from YSI projects, including through environmental projects, playgrounds and gardens.  This year, the high-impact award was given to Boomerang Youth Caf&eacute; in Drogheda, a project initiated by Our Lady&rsquo;s College, Greenhills in the town.  In Fingal, too, projects have been shown to be very impactful, such as in St. Fintan's High School, where the first ever student-led sustainable energy community for schools in the country was set up.  Another school in Fingal mapped Lesotho in Africa, leading to much better planning in the country.  Projects on policies include those relating to sex trafficking, human trafficking, sexting and cyberbullying - I could go on but the committee will hear more from the young people during the meeting.  Our model of learning is being transferred from Ireland to new regions, in particular in Lebanon, Zambia and Sweden, through our international programme.<\/p><p> To address the challenges we face, we need to build Ireland's capacity and competencies in social change and innovation.  Children and young people are an important part of that change who can and do deliver solutions to social problems.  They should not be overlooked but should form an integral part of building our capacity to create the change we need to make.  Our recommendations for the committee include support for the full roll-out of social innovation programmes; area-based support for youth-led social innovation; the development of an agency to support people under the age of 18 and to provide seed funding for their innovations; increasing research into youth-led social innovation; and support for our international programme to transfer knowledge to our partner countries as part of our remit to build peace in the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Collier","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Collier.

As we quickly learned, listing the issues that exist was not difficult.  Our challenge was finding a topic all 22 students were interested in and passionate about.  Our breakthrough came just before Christmas, when our teacher shared an article with us about body shaming and comparison culture.<\/p><p>The article explained how the American artist, Lizzo, had recently worn a sheer dress to an awards ceremony and, as a plus size woman, had been roundly criticised online.  She is a talented artist who won awards at this particular ceremony, but none of the articles mentioned this fact.  They focused solely on how she looked.  Her talent and professional achievements faded into the background and all that people wanted to discuss was her choice of clothing.  Interestingly, Rihanna had worn a similar dress previously and was widely applauded for her fashion choice.

It is an agenda that I feel strongly about, so I am delighted to see that it is represented in this social enterprise.  While it is not strictly related to social enterprise, it is being marked out by the EU as an area where there is an opportunity for growth and to reinterpret our economic growth in a way that decouples us from emissions.<\/p> <p>  Our guests' work is inspiring.  I am reminded very much about a debate that was held in the D&aacute;il on Thursday.<\/p><p>Deputy Pringle brought forward a Bill on lowering the voting age to 16.  There was a cross-party consensus that this is something that needs to be looked at.  If we look at the work that the students from Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de are producing it shows that they are politically engaged and that they are thoughtful about that political engagement.  They are more than capable of being able to exercise a franchise and of deciding who they should be voting for to represent them.  If we lowered the voting age to 16 that would have an impact on the manifestos of all parties in taking the concerns of young people more seriously and in putting them at the heart of politics going forward.<\/p><p> I am also reminded of an experiment I ran a long time ago when I was a teacher.  I was teaching sixth class and I asked my pupils to cut out images from newspapers.  We made four columns.  One was if you were in a newspaper for doing something and the other was if you were in the newspaper for looking a certain way.  We did that for images of men and women.  It was incredibly striking when we saw how many men were in the newspaper for doing something and how many women were in it for looking a particular way.  From what our guests are saying, that is not as stark a male and female issue as it was.  Instagram and its influencers have changed that.  Boys and men are increasingly coming under the same pressure to look a certain way that was more often associated with girls and women in the past, albeit that was not right.<\/p><p> I would like our guests to tell me more about the discussion.  Achieving a consensus in a group of 22 people is not at all easy.  In that context, I would like them to talk to me about the process of how they arrived at that notion with the class group.  It sounds brilliant, and I will have to go away and have a look at the Norwegian legislation to see how easily it could be transposed to an Irish context but what were the other issues.  Our guests spent a lot of time teasing through the issues that affect people of their age within a particular context.  The school is at the border with Wicklow so it might be different from what students in a Dublin school, or a Waterford school in my context, would be thinking about.  Can our guests give me an overview of what other issues came close to the mark in what they were hoping to take on?  Did they see any projects from other schools that they thought were interesting and inspiring?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062800002#E00800","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>At the start of the year, we had a YSI representative come down to talk to us on a Thursday morning.

Edited and photoshopped images online have a negative effect on people's mental health.  As Annie said, it would be a very difficult thing to police in an Irish situation but we were struck by the lack of awareness among young people about the amount of edited imagery online.  We visited primary schools as part of our project and did workshops and exercises with students from age nine to about 12.  We got them to compare edited and unedited photographs to see the differences and the majority genuinely did not think these photographs were edited.  They thought people actually look like this on a daily basis.  They did not know the images were edited, although older students know.  In our school, students are told about this as part of the SPHE module and other well-being modules, but students who are eight, nine, ten or 11 do not know it.

I thank the witnesses for coming in and for the work YSI does nationally, as well as in the school in Carnew.  It is very beneficial that Senator Casey is bringing them in to meet the Minister.  That is very useful.  I am a fan of YSI.  I participated in 2005, which was not today or yesterday.  We went to the national showcase and it was a very enjoyable experience.  Our project was about a garden of remembrance for people who had died violently.  I remember it being as much about what you learn from putting together the proposal and learning to work together as about the project itself.  It was probably the first time we had to approach businesses to sponsor items.  We were students approaching adults and it was a bit intimidating but people responded very well.  One of the things about being a younger politician - I am not sure I am one anymore but I was in the younger generation for a while - is that you get asked questions about being a younger person in politics.  People ask why more young people are not interested in politics.  My answer to that was always that I did not agree.  Politics is not just party politics.  Wanting to improve your community is politics.  Wanting to have an impact on policy is politics, whether that means getting involved in a community association, a youth club, or projects like this, which are very important in tackling issues around body image and the manipulation of imagery.  This is a massive and growing issue, which probably affects this generation more than previous ones and is likely to continue to do so.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Ms Collier and Mr. Peak.  They spoke about integrating social innovation or youth social innovation into the school system as a whole.  What is the current reach in that regard and what is the best method to achieve that aim?  Is it curricular change or access to programmes?  What way can that be best achieved?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Darragh and Annie.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has addressed the issue in relation to the Norwegian legislation, which sounds interesting.  I imagine that there are other avenues that can be pursued.  I can imagine that education is potentially one of those.  It occurs to me that tricky thing about some of these issues around manipulation of images is that sometimes, while we can intellectually understand that something has been manipulated, that does not mean that we do not still have an emotional response to it.  The two things can happen at the same time. <\/p><p> Awareness will be important in people's education of the online space generally.  This includes everything that happens online.  It relates to what is real and what is not, as well as what is plausible and what is not.  Aside from the legislation, which I intend to look at, as does Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh, what other areas of policy change can we in this institution help to address this issue?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062800002#G00400","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Awareness will be a big part in this regard.

We want to get this into their heads that this content can be changed, so that they do not look in newspapers and think that it is real, when it is fake.

We brought awareness to this issue through the project.  We sat back and thought that particular images were altered or filtered or something.  Education, as well as legislation, is important.  We had two main goals at the start of our project.  Our first goal was to educate the young people of Ireland.  Our second, bigger goal was to change the legislation.

The new junior cycle curriculum has created more space for applied learning projects, such as in the area of social innovation.  There could be more space at the senior cycle for applied learning.  That would help.  We could also have different access points for social innovation.  This is very important.  Whether a person is in Youthreach, in a school, at primary level or in a community service, they should be able to access social innovation methods, learning and support.

We therefore work actively with Delivering Equality of Opportunity In Schools, DEIS, schools.  We work with Youthreach centres.  We are increasing our reach into primary schools.  This is important to us, because we think that there is real value in social innovation education.  The projects that the kids are doing are incredible, in terms of their outcomes, the impact on the community and the difference they are making in social justice.

In addition, as Annie mentioned, for me on a personal level the thing with people having babies and appearing five minutes later on social media in a bikini is truly detrimental.  There is the incidence of post-natal depression, especially in isolation during Covid-19, and then seeing an image of somebody like that online.  Even though one knows it is fake and that the person has a personal chef and has taken 27,000 shots in order to get that one shot, the rational part of one's brain is put to the side and that other part just comes to the fore.

I was fairly well versed with the media, although it was approximately ten years ago so social media did not have the same impact.  Education and critical thinking are key to it.  Many of the things we do in YSI encourage young people to be more critical thinkers, to engage with a variety of media sources, to identify those they can trust and to think about things such as reliability and validity.  They need a type of toolkit whereby they can look at images and information and work out for themselves who are the authentic, reliable and valid voices.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  What is also important is that all this comes down to social justice.  It is all about enabling young people to fulfil their potential and live the most empowered lives they can regardless of the social issues that the young people choose, whether it is about body image, mental health or racism.  Every year we see a plethora of subjects.  It is all about social justice and enabling young people and everybody in society to reach their full potential.  Social media is an important part of that, but it is very important that we get young people to understand that they can use their agency to assert some control over their lives and to have an impact on social, economic, political, cultural and community life.  That is the essence of what we do.  That enables young people to be more critical thinkers and enables them to have more of an understanding of all facets of life, which will empower them as they go through their lives.<\/p> <p>  Increasingly, society is characterised by uncertainty and precarity so young people need to be critical thinkers and they need to be resilient, creative, adaptable and innovative.

There are probably no fewer people now who cannot think for themselves than there were previously.  It is not to do with social media but it is to do with the education system and that is why we are here.  I have kids who are generation Z and generation alpha.  YSI is being a leader and the results of what it is doing will be seen by generation alpha because they are the ones who were born in 2010 and after, and as the witnesses have said, it is about getting to people early.  They are all looking at \"Love Island\" and all of those things and they are seeing what is coming up on Instagram around those people.  There are many more pressures on boys now than there ever were before.  I never experienced that when I was young and it was all about girls and women and what they looked like.  There was not the same professionalism in sport before but people are in the gym all day long now because they get paid for it and then young boys are expected to behave like that.  I admire that Mr. Rawson brought that point up because he is doing a huge service for an awful lot of boys and young men out there.  Part of what I wanted to say is to ask what our young guests can do as advocates.  It should not just be about changing the system and we have a number of opportunities that I would love to come back in on.  There are opportunities for us to have young people mentoring young people and to do so throughout our education system so that it is not, as was said, about older people like me talking to young people.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that Senator Flynn wants to come in and I want to make sure that she can so I will ask my other question and then allow her to come back in.  We have a number of Bills going through the Houses and I am more than willing to speak to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, on behalf of our guests on the ideas they have around online imagery.  We have the online Bill coming before the Seanad the week after next and I will bring up those ideas with the Minister.  Maybe there is an opportunity to do it through the commissioner rather than just through legislation.  We should leave it with the commissioner to decide what we should do.<\/p> <p>  There is also the matter of education, which is separate in some ways, and the education system needs to be changed.  I know our guests are here to talk about their programme but any time I ask anyone who comes in here about transition year, including officials and Department staff, I say that schools in general should look more like transition year.  We need to have mentors and these opportunities for young people in every school year, not just in one year out of their lives.  They constantly revert to the idea that we should do that during transition year.  Is there a recommendation I can come out with from this committee to show how this can be done in first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth years?

It will have a significant impact on Irish young people in order that we will be a step ahead and have more confidence to speak out and talk about it in years go come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062800002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh Rawson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I could not agree more with Mr. Rawson.

As Ms Collier and Mr. Peak have said here today, the purpose of YSI is to show students that they have the power to make change in the world.  We did YSI training in which we were told that the one thing the facilitator must pass to his or her students is that they have the potential to change somebody's life with what they will do in class today.  It is not that one cannot do that in every other class, but a facilitator has to let students believe that they can make the change.  In recent years, because of Covid and for various other reasons, students have not had that opportunity.  For Mr. Rawson, Ms Sheppard and the students in our school and our community to see the change these students have made, and to hear the discussions we had in the art room of Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de at 9 a.m. on a Thursday morning happening in the media or on national radio, shows the power of student minds and what they can achieve when they work together.<\/p><p>To answer the question about how it can fit into the school curriculum and where it can be fit in across other years, there is massive potential in that regard but it must be student-led in order for it to be as powerful as it is in transition year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062800002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Following up from what Ms Sheppard and Ms Murphy have said, we have recently done research on social innovation education which shows the power of youth voice.  Youth voice is not an outcome of the well-being of students but is actually an enabler of well-being among young people.  They need to be heard and they need to contribute.  That is interesting.  For all the factors that have been researched on the well-being of young people, this is the first time it has been shown that youth voice is integral to well-being.  That is interesting.<\/p> <p>  Senator Pauline O'Reilly asked what we can change in education.  We have schools that adopt a whole-of-school approach to social innovation.  It is integral to what they do and how they embrace youth-led learning and youth voice in the schools.  They use the community of students to solve problems inside and outside the school.  There should be more project-based work allowed and space provided for it in post-primary schools.  The purpose of all those projects can be for societal good.  Why not?  We promote profit-making businesses in school without a problem.  We promote science and technology.  Why do we not promote all of those things for societal good?  It can happen.  Our school in Lebanon has trained all its teachers and it is core to all their subject areas.  Any project is done with societal good in mind so the young people learn those values very early.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062800002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Collier"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>The argument about this type of learning being crammed into transition year has been well rehearsed and was put forward by many organisations when the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, did its consultation.  In other parts of post-primary education, there is simply not enough space in the curriculum to focus, for example, on social justice and the things that really interest young people.  Particularly in the final two years of the senior cycle when students are preparing for their leaving certificate examinations, it does become a race for points for university entrance.  That means there is no space in the curriculum for young people to do things that give them joy and pleasure, and which make an impact on the communities in which they live.  We consider that very important.<\/p> <p>  From my own experience of the university and college admission system in the North, I know university places are offered on the basis of a student's personal statement, which includes the community work and sporting achievements of a student.  Students are, therefore, incentivised to do those things whereas the system in the South is very much focused on points.  There can be changes in the education system that incentivise young people to do this type of learning because we know it has benefits for them.  Using their voices and agency can have an impact.<\/p> <p>  We also know there is a correlation between educational attainment and different types of thinking, such as systems thinking, design thinking and critical thinking.  Those are the things that are lost in a lot of mainstream education.  Creating the space to allow young people to do those things will have an impact on them as individuals and the communities in which they live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062800002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Peak"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for inviting representatives of Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de to make a presentation on their Be Aware, Don't Compare campaign.  It is a privilege for me to welcome Ms Sheppard, Mr. Rawson, Ms Cullen, Ms Hynes, Ms Mulroe and Mr. Jordan, and indeed Ms Murphy and Ms Dunne, the principal.  It is my second time to welcome them to Leinster House.  I am here not to question them but to thank them for their campaign.  I will support them into the future to see can we bring some form of legislation through this House in response to their requests.<\/p> <p>  The most recent occasion on which representatives from Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de came to Leinster House, we had a great engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, visited Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de in Carnew and the students had two minutes to make a pitch to her.  That was when they grabbed my attention initially.  Since then, I have been honoured to be involved with this important campaign.<\/p><p>It is important that we listen to their needs and to what they are asking us to do in Leinster House to address this issue.  It is a simple ask.  They have asked us to introduce legislation to provide for the labelling of photographs that have been cropped, adjusted or filtered and for that to be clearly identified.  I congratulate these students on their massive PR campaign, which included the local press, the unveiling of a billboard in Gorey when we had a great day out, their engagement with Ryan Tubridy on the \"The Ryan Tubridy Show\" and their engaging with two Ministers, one in Leinster House and one in Carnew.  It is very special and a privilege for them to make it to a committee hearing today and I wish them the best of luck with their proposal.  Theirs is a simple ask.<\/p><p> When it comes to our physical health, we have no issue labelling products that cause harm, be it food products carrying a label with a fat or sugar content, alcohol products with a label indicating the damage alcohol can cause or cigarettes with a label indicating smoking is harmful.  The students have raised the impact photographs have on their mental health.  Why can such photographs not be labelled in terms of protecting young people's mental health and addressing the issue from a health perspective?  It would also have an educational and online impact.  The simple way to address it might be to introduce a legislative measure from a medical point of view and from the point of view of the impact such images have on young people and others.  We all know the impact social media has on our lives and how disturbing it can be.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for allowing me to contribute on this issue.  It is big honour for me as a Wicklow person to welcome students from a Wicklow school to this committee hearing.  I will support the students in whatever way I can to introduce legislation on this issue through the education system, through online media regulation or through the health area.  The students' ask is simple.  Let us label photographs that have been cropped, altered or changed.  All they are asking us to do today is to introduce such legislation.  We know the impact such images have on our mental health.  I thank all of our guests for coming to Leinster House, especially, as my colleague said, during their holidays.  They did not even get a day off school today for their trip to Leinster House.

The legislation around sexting is totally inappropriate for young people.  Often young people see things we do not see because we are not exposed to them.  They see things way ahead of time.  They were a major force in the marriage equality campaign.  LGBT rights have been talked about by young social innovators for years.  They see things in advance of the rest of us.

I reckon I will cover what I want to say in the allocated eight minutes.  It has been very refreshing to listen to all the students.  Senator Pat Casey is an incredible advocate for the school and what they are doing.  He shared with me a video that they put together, which is excellent.  I commend them on that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of social innovators in general, YSI is an incredible movement.<\/p><p>It is so important all our young people, no matter where they are, have the opportunity to learn about social entrepreneurship and the importance of teamwork.  I often think teamwork and collaboration is so important when we go into the world of work and no matter what we do, we cannot do it in isolation.  Yet, when we are in school and marked in our State exams, there is nothing really to give the opportunity for that type of collaboration to be tested.<\/p><p> This particular committee has spent much time over the past two years looking at reform of the leaving certificate.  This should be one of the areas in which we should be able to consider examination in some other way.  It is such a big part of life and yet we are marked for going in and completing a paper in isolation.  I am interested in general in comments relating to that.<\/p><p> That the witnesses have chosen this area is really important.  I am very proud to be a member of this committee but I am also a member of the education committee for the Council of Europe and that is where 46 countries come together.  There were 47 countries but after 24 February we booted out Russia because it was no upholding the principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.  We have the opportunity to look at different areas that affect education.  I was in Strasbourg last week and we spoke much about online communication and cybersecurity.  With the permission of the delegation, I would be delighted to be able to bring this project to the attention of my colleagues and the secretariat so we can have a discussion with colleagues from Norway about the legislation and what difficulties they may have had.  I note from the presentation that the UK tried to do this but was not able to bring it through.  We must see what are the potential pitfalls.<\/p><p> The work done on body image and body shaming is very important.  Every political party has a think-in every year and I happen to be a member of the same party as Senator Casey.  Last year, after our think-in, an article was written that body-shamed and clothes-shamed a number of representatives, particularly women.  There were six women named in that article and I was one of them, and we were slagged about what we were wearing.  Some of the men, although they were not photographed, were mentioned as well.<\/p><p> A number of women contacted me afterwards because they felt it was a really bad message for young people and particularly young girls that politicians were being judged on what they wore as opposed to what they were saying or the key matters on which we were meeting.  I want to give the witnesses some time to respond on that.<\/p><p> I love that Ms Sheppard finished by saying \"love who you are\" because it is such a strong message that cuts across everything.  It cuts across gender identity, ethnicity and all of that.  The projects that came in first, second and third place are really important.  They concerned food waste, mica and menstrual disorders.  We in the women's caucus have put much work into efforts against period poverty and it is in the programme for Government.  I hope measures against it will be introduced in September.<\/p><p> Generally speaking, this is a wonderful programme and I wish all the witnesses well.

I feel that at the end of the day, it is all just pushed into one exam.  We sit at our own desks with our own paper and we are marked on this one paper.

As a group, we can make our point.  If one person forgets something, the others can help out.  When we go in to sit a State exam, we are on our own.  Someone who is sick, for example with a headache, has to sit an exam that could be the difference between becoming a doctor or becoming a blocklayer.  The points we get can dictate the rest of our lives.  In Northern Ireland they have personal statements, where students can say how they are in communities.  We found with YSI that some of us like speaking in public but others do not.  Some people prefer the quiet approach.  I think the examination format for the leaving certificate, with everyone all by themselves, is very harsh.

The students decided who should lead the project, based on the merits of each individual.  Molly and Darragh have done a fantastic job in steering the class.  The students are clever.  They know each other's strengths.  Within our class we had individual groups working on design, logos and content for our school app and social media.  Working within groups allowed the students to work to their strengths.  Different people have different strengths.  An exam-based system only works for some people.  I am thinking of that famous cartoon where they have lots of different animals together and they tell them that success is getting to the top of a tree.  In the same group of animals there is a goldfish and a monkey.

I will go to the students first and maybe Ms Murphy will come in afterwards.  The committee has done a lot of module work on school bullying, including a report the witnesses might have seen, and on leaving certificate reform, as Senator O'Loughlin has mentioned.  The issue that came forward in both modules of work was social media and its effects on mental health, as Senator Casey has said.<\/p> <p>  We do not want to mention the dreaded word of suicide but we all know people who have died by suicide because of social media, secondary school students especially.  I have encountered it in my own constituency of Wexford.  We have had families communicating to this committee whose son or daughter died by suicide as a result of bullying on social media.  Did that form part of any of the research the witnesses are doing around social media?  There are a lot of people who do not want to talk about it, but I think it is so important that we talk about it and we make people aware that there is a lot of help out there.  There was an item on Ryan Tubridy's radio show this morning about a third year student at Maynooth University who committed suicide, although the show did not say it was because of social media or anything like that.  There is a lot of help out there but often people are afraid to go and ask for it, or maybe they are afraid it is not there.<\/p><p>Did that form part of our guests&rsquo; research?

In my opinion, if people get to the stage where they might need help, speaking to somebody, even once, to get it of their chest could make a big difference.  We recommend advertising it more.

I hope the committee will discuss this in September and visit the UK to look at the programme rolled out there in respect of therapeutic counsellors.  The therapeutic counsellor would be a person who is on-site in primary and post-primary schools so that a student does not have to make a phone call to get help.

We very rarely hear a conversation that does not start with, \"Did you see that online?\" or \"She said that online\".  Every conversation they have revolves around online media.  When something negative about them is put online, because their world is social media, their world crumbles down.  They do not have the sense of how transient and short-lived things are online that it will blow over in two or three days.  When you are in your world and something bad has been said about you online or a picture or post or whatever it is that has caused someone to go to that dark place, it seems like their entire world has turned against them.  The fact that it will blow over in two or three days and there will be another bikini thing or something to talk about down the line, the young people do not understand that.

It is lovely to have Young Social Innovators students from Col&aacute;iste Br&iacute;de here.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely understand and fully appreciate Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's motivation in bringing forward this Bill.  Equally, however, I am very conscious that schools have put a considerable amount of work, time, effort and energy into developing the new school admission policies, which have taken root in our schools only in the past academic year.  A key feature of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act is that where schools are not oversubscribed, they must accept all applicants.  The vast majority of our schools are not oversubscribed.  Equally, schools have the opportunity to opt out of the provision.  My view is that there is insufficient evidence available to us at this point to indicate that the provision this Bill proposes to delete poses difficulties for those seeking admission to schools where it is in use.  I note also that the pre-legislative scrutiny report of the committee recommends not only deletion but also the setting up of an expert group.  I believe that the establishment of an expert group to review the impact of the provision of the Act would be a useful first step.  I consider that a reasonable approach.  I therefore signal my intention to table on Report Stage an amendment to the Deputy's Bill which will establish an expert group to examine the impact of subsection 62(10)(b) on school admissions and provide a report detailing the expert group's findings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022062800002#A00500","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding the Minister's goodwill towards my motivation, I am crushingly disappointed by her attitude to the Bill and by the Department's response to the Bill.  It flies completely in the face of what the Minister is trying to do this week in respect of section 37A of the Education Act.  We are told to rush through legislation this week in order for it to be ready for September, yet we are told that schools cannot change their admissions policies for this September or even the following September.  The Minister tells me there is no evidence this provision has any effect.  Why is it there, then?  The very basis of the argument is that if even one child is disadvantaged by the provision, it needs to go.  I am blue in the face making the same argument over and over again but I will make it again.  This provision was inserted at the behest of those who are trying unfairly to keep an elitist bloodline running through certain schools' admissions policies, from grandfather to father to son or from grandmother to mother to daughter.  It is patently unfair on, for example, children of early school leavers, children whose parents are not from the area and, indeed, children whose parents are not from Ireland.  We can say all we want about Ukrainian students in this State, but I ask the Minister to imagine if even one Ukrainian was not able to access a second level school place on the basis of this provision because there are greater rights for those whose parents or grandparents went to the school in question.  The lack of energy or understanding on the part of the Department on this baffles me because there is no argument against what I and the committee and people such as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, who supported this Bill, are trying to achieve.  This provision should not have been put into law in the first place; it should not still be there.  I ask the Minister to imagine even one family in this State saying in years to come: \"We had hoped our child might be admitted to second level school A, but it was not possible because my parents did not go to school.\"  In a Republic, it should make us all deeply ashamed that such a provision exists.<\/p> <p>  I remember the previous debate we had on this in the D&aacute;il.  I walked into the Chamber and was excited as to what the Minister might provide.  I remember my first contribution being to the effect that I hoped she had come to the table with some level of understanding as to how we could collectively work together.  I was crushed by her presentation because I believe in these Houses of the Oireachtas and I believe there is no opposition, really, to what we are trying to achieve here.<\/p><p>Education is everything.  It is all that has benefited some families to break out of poverty.  Education is the only opportunity unless one's parents have money.  This is why it is so emotivel and so important.<\/p><p> I would ask the Minister to reconsider her position and the Department's position on this.  The Minister could easily row in behind this.  The provision could easily be deleted.  Every school in the country only has to change its enrolment policies for September 2023.  It is as simple as that.  One no longer gets to choose a child whose parents or grandparents went to this school over some other child.  It is as simple as that.<\/p><p> It is having an effect in areas that I represent or on parents who come to me from all over the country.  It is patently wrong and patently unfair.  The argument that we cannot be sure how many people are affected by it does not stack up.  It should not be there and it needs to go.<\/p><p> In summary, I have been leading this process.  I was delighted to be in the position to bring it forward.  The Department told me that the Minister would delay Second Stage for 12 months in order to do all the groundwork that needed to be done and I waited patiently from November 2020 to November 2021.  The Minister knows that is true.  We delayed the passing of Second Stage for 12 months.  We are in a position where the Minister comes back to this table and I am patiently waiting here for this Bill to be passed, but we want more reviews and we want to see how schools can have a number of admissions cycles to work through it.  What the Minister is doing is wrong.  The Minister knows it is wrong.  The Department knows its wrong.  I do not know what lobby group has such a hold over the Department that this needs to stay.  I can imagine who they are.<\/p><p> On this issue, the Minister needs to change her position.  The Minister needs to row in behind the Bill.  This section of the Act needs to be deleted.  We could all go back to normal and look children in the eye in September 2023 and say that it does not matter who one's parents or grandparents are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022062800002#A00600","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I reiterate my support for this legislation.  I commend Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on his work in relation to it.<\/p> <p>  We had pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation.  There is no coherent argument against it.  There is no argument that ultimately holds any water.<\/p> <p>  On the argument around most of the schools being undersubscribed, the problem, as with anything, in relation to admissions and who is admitted will only arise when a school is oversubscribed.  It is for that reason we have regulations as such.  It is for that reason we have admissions policies.  If no school was oversubscribed, we would not need admissions policies at all and every child would simply have a place.<\/p> <p>  The circumstances in which this applies - maybe in most schools it is not an issue because they are not oversubscribed - arise in the schools which are oversubscribed.  There are parts of the country where there is severe competition for school places in areas where there is a large young population.  In parts of Cork, much of Dublin, Kildare, parts of Wicklow and parts of County Meath there is a significant young population.  In those places, what the current legislation allows for is that where there are a limited number of places and there is a decision to be made between a child who lives 15 miles away but whose father or mother attended the school and a child who lives five doors away, it is the child who lives 15 miles away who will be preferred.  That is objectively true under the current proposal.  It provides that a school takes up the scope and the powers that it has to put in place such an admissions policy.  That being the case, that is the child who will be preferred.  That should not be acceptable to us in any way.<\/p> <p>  It is perfectly reasonable, in terms of families and their arrangements, etc., that preference is given to siblings.  That is a reasonable proposition, but in relation to parents, and even grandparents, one is potentially disadvantaging the local child.  It is the local child who should be at the centre of any decisions made on admissions.  Every child should be in a position to attend his or her local school provided that there are adequate spaces and if there are not, decisions about who gets in need to be made on a fair basis.  It is not a fair basis to prioritise those whose parents or grandparents attended.  One will continue to have a school tradition because many families will still live in the local community and many children will attend the school their parents and grandparents attended; the traditions, the culture and the history of the school can continue in that way, but it should not be at the expense of the child who lives five doors away from the school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022062800002#B00200","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank both Deputies.

I recall with great warmth the visit here recently, which was friendly and warm.  I appreciate that the colleagues of committee members came to support us in our darkest hour.  The situation in Ukraine is very difficult.  We continue our struggle despite the fact that on the ground we are outgunned and outnumbered by the evil empire, Russia, which is trying to destroy us.  Russia's ultimate goal is to erase Ukraine from the political map.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to express my deepest gratitude to members and their colleagues for Ireland's support for Ukraine's candidacy for the European Union.  To us, Ireland plays the role of advocate, strong supporter and ally.  We really appreciate Ireland's help and support.  We feel it.  When the Irish representatives came to Kyiv. they mentioned the phrase by the American President John F. Kennedy who, in 1963 addressed the Irish Parliament and said that countries should not be neutral when there is a struggle between liberty and tyranny.  I see that Ireland is not neutral.  Ireland is on the side of liberty, freedom, and understands that Ukraine nowadays is defending not only itself but the freedom and democracy of all of Europe.  Russia openly states that it is waging war not only against Ukraine but against the West.  For instance Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said this openly.  Russia perceives this aggressive war as a war against the whole of Western civilisation and democracy.  Russia is waging war in the territory of Ukraine but at the same time, it is waging war in a hybrid manner against all democratic states of Europe and global democracies.  I would like to thank Ireland again for its support of our EU candidacy because it is extremely important for us.  For us it is also a matter of our security.  We made a choice to become part of the European Union and we are paying a very heavy price.<\/p><p>We have already paid a heavy price.  Russia wants to subjugate Ukraine because we want to be part of the European Union.  It is one of the primary reasons for the war raged by Russia against Ukraine.  We want to be part of Europe.  I ask Ireland to continue to be our advocate and supporter on our road to fully fledged membership of the European Union.  I understand it might be a difficult road.  We are committed to reforms and we are conducting reforms in Ukraine.  We are conducting them in the very difficult conditions of war.  You can imagine how difficult it is to conduct economic and political reform when you are fighting for your survival, struggling to survive.  Nevertheless this is what we are doing and we hope you can help us make this way to membership as short as possible.  It will help us a lot and I am sure it will allow us to defend ourselves more effectively and to stop Russian aggression.  Being a part of the European Union, being part of this space of freedom, democracy, economic development and prosperity will help because behind each member state is the collective force of the full Union.  There is collective solidarity and this is one of the reasons why we want to join the European Union as soon as possible.  I ask you to please continue to support us.<\/p><p> The second thing I would like to mention is that two days ago, Russia hit a civilian residential area in Kyiv, which is not far from where I am.  I was awoken by the sound of explosions at 6 a.m. and then I started to count the explosions. There was a very strong second explosion and then a third and a fourth.  Later, I realised from the news that there were people injured and one person killed in the residential house hit by Russians.  This house is basically on the same street as I live on, downtown and very close to my place.  Yesterday we had another horrendous, disgraceful and absolutely inhumane act of state terror when Russian missiles hit a shopping mall in Kremenchuk.  We are still counting the dead.  We already know several dozen people were killed and many, including children, were injured.  I would like to mention that since 24 February, Russian forces have already killed 340 children.  This means that each day since then, Russia has killed several Ukrainian children.  This horror can not be described in words.  I ask your Parliament to adopt a resolution to recognise Russia as a terrorist state.  Russia is not waging war against the Ukrainian army, it is waging war against the Ukrainian civilian population.  It is deliberately targeting civilian objects and civilians and this is happening every day.  According to the office of our general prosecutor, Russia commits several thousand war crimes every day.  Russia not only commits crimes like war crimes and crimes against humanity, but general overarching crime which also includes genocide against Ukraine.  We are grateful for recognition of Russian crimes as genocide.  It is important because it is the truth and it should be known all over the world.  In the near future, the State Department in the United States will decide on whether to recognise Russia as a sponsor of terrorism.  It is important in terms of sanctions and I ask my Irish colleagues and friends to support and to help to persuade our American friends to do this as soon as possible.<\/p><p> My final point is that we need to continue to make sanctions tougher in order to stop Russian aggression.  We also need to introduce so-called secondary sanctions against those countries which are trying to help Russia right now to avoid sanctions.  I ask that Ireland continues to support us.  I thank the committee members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oleksandr Merezhko","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Merezhko.

Our top priority right now to survive is weapons.  We need heavy weapons, especially multiple launch rocket systems, MLRS, high mobility artillery rocket systems, HIMARS, and long-range artillery.  It is crucial because we are outgunned and outnumbered by Russia, which uses heavy artillery.  Russia uses jets first, then heavy shelling, bombardments by artillery, then mortars, then tanks and only after that does it use infantry.<\/p> <p>The Russian technique is to completely destroy everything in front of their troops by using artillery and then they move in.  They move in gradually, sometimes they might move 1 km or 2 km but it is a tactic of total destruction.  This is also about our casualties, of course.  We need to help our soldiers to survive and our civilians, who are also being targeted.  This is why we desperately need heavy weaponry.  I understand there are countries which might not have what we need but we appreciate every effort, including financial support, which allows us to obtain heavy weaponry.  As far as I know, we have only 10% of what we need right now.  We need to reach parity in terms of heavy weaponry with Russia.  Otherwise, we will have many casualties.  <\/p> <p>  Grain is another serious problem because Russia is blackmailing the world.<\/p><p>It is trying to take hostage the whole Continent and the many countries that depend on food, grain and wheat produced in Ukraine.  As we know, Ukraine is one of the bread baskets of the world.  Russia is doing this deliberately.  It is deliberately blockading our ports and is not allowing our grain to be exported.  Russia and Putin understand that their approach allows them to blackmail the whole world and to demand the lifting of sanctions.  On the other hand, Russia is using that approach to economically destroy Ukraine.  What is the way out of this difficult situation?  I do not know right now.  I know that we are considering several options.  One is de-blockading our ports and escorting-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062800002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oleksandr Merezhko","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1656370800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Another option, which may be complementary or additional, is to transport grain using railroads, for instance.  However, we should be very careful about that approach because Russia is deliberately targeting our civilian infrastructure.  That might create problems.  We should do everything we can because it is a matter of the food security of the whole world.  This crime does not have a name but it is considered to be a serious war crime.<\/p> <p>  Russia has done this before in the history of Ukraine.  There was the Holodomor of the 1930s - the great famine in Ukraine.  Ireland understands well the meaning of a great famine.  Russia has already used these tactics to stifle any opposition in Ukraine and to destroy the Ukrainian population.  Russia is continuing to do it.  It is stealing our grain in the occupied territories.  It is trying to sell in the market this stolen Ukrainian grain.  It is trying to create another great famine for Ukraine and for the whole world.  That is why we see the continuous pattern of Russian criminal behaviour against Ukraine and the whole world.  Russia's criminal pattern continues.<\/p> <p>  What might the situation be in two or three months?  The next weeks and months might be crucial.  It is difficult for our army to hold out and to continue to defend us because it is hair-raising.  It has been truly heroic defence.  Of course, it is difficult to keep defending when there are casualties and brutal shelling, and when your enemy has superiority in its heavy weaponry and number of personnel.  The committee can imagine how difficult it is.  We count on our resistance every day, and every day is an heroic day for Ukrainians.  I am sure that Russians will never be able to occupy most of the territory of Ukraine for a very simple reason, that is, we are defending our homes and families.  We have no choice.  Surrender is not an option for us.  We should defend no matter what, and we are doing so.  However, it is difficult and without the support of the civilised democratic world, it will be very difficult.<\/p> <p>  I hope that in two months' time Russia will be exhausted.  We can already see certain signs of that.  It has defaulted on its debt, for example.  If we get what we were promised in heavy weaponry, the situation might change crucially.  In some areas, despite the preponderance of the Russian military, our army continues to find success in counterattacks and counteroffensives against Russian troops and is liberating our territory.  Of course, the committee will understand that to fight against an enemy that has such a preponderance of military personnel is extremely difficult.  That is why it is difficult for me to foresee what the situation will be in two months.<\/p> <p>  I am certain of one thing, which is, we will never surrender.  Russia will not be able to take over big Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv, Odessa and Kyiv.  The Russians were defeated in Kyiv and Kharkiv.  These cities are like bastions.  They will never be taken or occupied by Russia.  At the same time, the situation is very dangerous.  We keep fighting.  I am sure that, strategically, Putin has already lost.  It is a matter of time until Ukraine will emerge victorious but to do that and to save lives, we need help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oleksandr Merezhko"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Merezhko for taking the time to come and talk to us today.  I am sure life in Ukraine is anything but pleasant at the moment.  He made the point that Ukraine is fighting the war of the West.  I sometimes wonder if Ukrainians feel they are left isolated with lots of promises that do not necessarily manifest themselves in hardware on the ground, for want of a better phrase.  My colleague, Deputy Berry, spoke about weapons.  It is a matter of some concern to me that we have weapons here that we could send to Ukraine, a fellow neutral country, if we want to claim the neutrality tag.  Neutrality did not do much for the Ukrainians when Putin decided to attack.<\/p> <p>  I am wondering about a few things other than weapons that we might be able to send.  Vehicles, for example, might be an option.  I understand Ukraine is having difficulty in moving people around the place now so vehicles would be, I assume, important.  I and my colleague, Deputy Barry, have often spoken about the fact that we have a number of naval ships that are about to decommissioned.  We do not think they are necessarily suitable for the Black Sea but we believe they would be suitable for Ukrainian naval crews to maintain their skills and train on.  We wonder if they would be of any value.<\/p> <p>  With infrastructure being destroyed throughout, in particular, eastern and southern Ukraine, how is Ukraine's stock of Bailey bridges and the like in order to replace bridges that have been taken out?  Does Ukraine have Bailey bridges, or similar bridges that can be quickly erected, available?<\/p> <p>  I watched a piece on television in Ireland last night.  The commentator, who was speaking on behalf of Ukraine, was a commander on the ground.  He was explaining that many of his experienced soldiers, men and women, had been wounded or fatally wounded, and that he was now using what might be regarded as the second line reserve, who are not as professional as the soldiers he has had under his command for many years.  Is Ukraine experiencing difficulty with respect to the loss of life of its best qualified?  There were many questions there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062800002#D00400","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

One of our colleagues from Ireland who recently visited Kyiv used very wise words.  He said that words are empty and that what really matters are deeds.  I understand that the Russian war against Ukraine has shown us who are our true friends and who are unreliable or sometimes reluctant partners.  There are states, unfortunately, which could be true European leaders and provide us with all necessary help but they are not doing it or they are dragging their feet on the delivery of supplies by making promises.<\/p><p>To tell the truth, I am bitterly disappointed in these big countries, unfortunately.  They have damaged their own credibility by promising to do something.  Maybe they do not want to understand that each day of our resistance costs us lots of lives of our soldiers and civilians.  Each day of delay is translated into terrible grief for the families of the people of our soldiers who were killed or injured.  This makes it a very emotional and painful issue to me.<\/p><p> On the other hand, there are countries such as the United States which proved to be a reliable friend and partner.  It understands our situation and delivered weapons within one day.  They help us.  The countries which support us wholeheartedly are not countries who need to be persuaded and where military aid has to be squeezed out of them.  They are countries who have come to us and asked us \"What can we do for you?\"  Among these countries is the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Ireland.  These are our reliable friends.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, sometimes other countries are hesitant or less than enthusiastic, if I might put it that way.  There are countries that can do a lot and which can really help us.  They have the capabilities, economic and militarily, but for some reason they do not.  I do not know how to explain this.  Maybe there are politicians in those countries who are not eager to provide us with military help in the hope Russia will break us and we will have to agree to the ultimatum and demands of Russia and the governments will return to business as usual with Russia.  They will continue to buy Russian gas and Russian oil.  Maybe Russia has politicians in those countries and maybe they are influential enough, unfortunately.<\/p><p> On neutrality, I quoted Kennedy.  I heard a phrase from one of the Irish colleagues that there is no neutrality in the face of struggle between evil and freedom.  When you give weapons to a victim of aggression and help to defend the victim of aggression, it is a very noble thing.  This is what humanity and conscience is about.  There can be no neutrality.  When you see a hooligan killing an innocent person, there should not be any neutrality.  The committee will excuse me for using this metaphor, but in international relations it also happens.<\/p><p> On vehicles and ships, one of my colleagues was in the United States talking to one of the governors.  They asked what they should ask the Government for to help the Ukraine army.  I sent the message to my colleague who is more knowledgeable.  He gave me a simple, one-word answer to what the army needed: everything.  It is true.  We are grateful for every kind of help and support.  It means a lot to us because we are in a situation where everything can be helpful to withstand this enormous pressure of Russian aggression.  Of course, we are grateful for every kind of support.<\/p><p> On bridges, I am not knowledgeable for these kinds of things but I live in Kyiv and I have spent all these days there from the 24th.  Especially at the beginning, my concern was that the bridges were blown up around Kyiv and I was afraid of a blockade and that the city might be starved to death.  But then the bridges were restored very quickly.  I am not a specialist or an engineer but I saw they were restored very quickly, perhaps with makeshift bridges.  We need these kinds of temporary bridges which help us bring food, necessary resources and so on.<\/p><p> On how we are coping with the loss of lives, it is a problem.  When you are fighting against the second biggest army in the world, the best and most experienced soldiers sometimes have to sacrifice their lives.  It is a problem for us.  Every person to lose their life is a huge tragedy, not only for the family and loved ones but also for the whole country.  Yesterday, the shopping mall was hit.  Watching the footage was really heartbreaking.  We have to live in this.  We are peaceful people and we want this war to end as soon as possible but there are certain red lines.  The problem is at what cost.  For us, the red lines are our territorial integrity, our freedom and our right to choose to be part of the European family.  It is also about our security.  What can stop the war and prevent future loss of life?  Only heavy weapons.  Heavy weaponry is the best kind of humanitarian aid.  For us it is also a humanitarian issue.  Putin only understands a language of strength.  The more we are protected and the more heavy weaponry we have, the more effectively we defend ourselves and the fewer casualties there will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062800002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oleksandr Merezhko","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Merezhko.  <i>Slava Ukraini<\/i>.

I thank the members for the invitation to meet with the joint sub-committee to provide an update on the Linn Dara CAMHS service.  I am joined by my colleagues, Brendan Doody, Mary O'Kelly and Kevin Brady.<\/p> <p>  I will provide an overview of the HSE Linn Dara service.  CAMHS provides specialist mental health service to those aged up to 18 years, who have reached the threshold for a diagnosis of moderate to severe mental health disorder that requires the input of a consultant-led multidisciplinary mental health team.  CAMHS inpatient units offer assessment and treatment to children and adolescents up to the age of 18, with severe and often complex mental health difficulties.  For those aged over 18, general adult community teams and inpatient units provide these services.  Approximately 2% of the under-18 population will require a CAMHS intervention at any given time.<\/p> <p>  Linn Dara CAMHS in Dublin south, Kildare and west Wicklow provides the following services: community mental health teams; a community eating disorder service; Linn Dara approved centre, inpatient unit; ADMiRE-ADHD pathway; consultation and liaison psychiatry at the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght; and two mental health intellectual disability teams for mental health of intellectual disability services.<\/p> <p>  In line with the HSE CAMHS operational guide 2019, the Linn Dara approved centre provides acute, emergency and specialist inpatient child and adolescent mental health services and treatment on a tertiary basis for children and adolescents with severe and complex mental illness.  The approved centre is registered, regulated and inspected by the Mental Health Commission and subject to regulatory inspection in relation to care and treatment, facilities and premises, staffing and governance.<\/p> <p>  The Linn Dara approved centre is a 24-bedded unit, which is configured into three wards - Rowan, Oak and Hazel.  The Rowan and Hazel wards both consist of 11 individual beds and the Oak ward has two beds, which provide high dependency and care.  The Linn Dara approved centre provides services on a regional and national remit.  Our primary catchment area is community healthcare organisations 6, 7 and 8.  Linn Dara also works with the other specialist inpatient mental health services to provide services on a national basis as the need arises and where clinically appropriate.  The 24 beds in the Linn Dara approved centre are as follows: two high-dependency CAMHS beds, eight specialist eating disorder CAMHS beds and 14 acute or emergency CAMHS beds.<\/p> <p>  The Linn Dara approved centre provides eight specialist eating disorder beds, SEDBs, to level 4 care and treatment for children and adolescents with severe and complex eating disorders.  Level 4 in the HSE model of care for eating disorders is classified as the most intensive treatment setting.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the service developments at Linn Dara CAMHS.  The Linn Dara community eating disorder service was officially launched in September 2019.<\/p><p>It was the first Irish community-based dedicated eating disorder service for children and young people under the age of 18.  The team operates at levels 2, 3 and 4 of the stepped model of care, providing specialised outpatient, day patient care and support to people with eating disorders with an enhanced range of treatment options.<\/p><p> The ADMiRE ADHD pathway, which stands for assessment, diagnosis, management initiation, research and education, is the first public specialist service for children and adolescents with ADHD in Ireland.  Set up in September 2018 in south Dublin Linn Dara CAMHS, the primary goal was to reduce waiting times and provide early access to evidence-based assessment and management for young people with ADHD.<\/p><p> On the Kildare and west Wicklow community CAMHS team, in 2021 Linn Dara established a new community CAMHS team based in the Athy primary care centre serving south Kildare and south-west Wicklow, bringing the number of community CAMHS teams in Kildare and west Wicklow to a total of five.  Linn Dara has also established two specialist teams to deliver specialist mental health service to the mental health intellectual disability, MHID, community across the CHO and continues to develop this service through the national clinical programme.<\/p><p> Regarding new development posts, building on existing services and investments in CAMHS, in 2022 Linn Dara was allocated an additional &euro;950,000 to recruit nine new additional posts across the service, with recruitment currently ongoing.  These posts were targeted at the further development of the ADMiRE ADHD team and the community teams in Kildare and west Wicklow.<\/p><p> There are challenges in this area.  The Linn Dara approved centre treats complex and high-dependency cases that require intensive input from experienced and specialist staff.  Nursing posts account for more than 75% of the multidisciplinary staffing complement of an inpatient service.  The ability of the service to provide the necessary standards of quality care on a sustainable basis for patients over a 24-7 cycle depends on the necessary nursing staffing being in place.  Unfortunately, due to the level of current and projected core HSE nursing staff vacancies, the service was left with no choice but to reduce the number of operational beds on a temporary basis.  Extensive efforts continue, both nationally and internationally, to recruit nurses to these vacant posts.  This temporary reduction in bed capacity is being done strictly on the basis that the beds that will remain operational are available with a safe and sustainable staffing ratio, on a 24-7 basis.<\/p><p> Post Covid, there has been an increase in referrals to both to community and inpatient services within CAMHS.  Such an increase in referrals will have an impact on the level of service delivery, with the likelihood of increased waiting lists.  The response of CAMHS to the public health emergency has brought about some benefits, such as a rapid adoption and effective use of telehealth and video-enabled care.  It also created a public discourse about the importance of mental health to personal and societal well-being, thereby strengthening the case for continued investment in CAMHS and service developments to meet these increasing demands.<\/p><p> Since opening in December 2015, Linn Dara has continued to develop a number of services, as I have outlined, using models of care supported by clinical evidence through the national clinical programmes.  Notwithstanding the improvements, we are very aware of the continued need to further develop services and deal with identified challenges, including staffing vacancies, which impact on service delivery.  We will continue to work with all stakeholders in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022062800002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their contributions and the work they do on behalf of the people of Ireland.

There has been a huge increase in the number of people presenting with eating disorders specifically.  The vast majority of eating disorders are treated in the community and a small number will require inpatient admission.  As one would expect, one of the reasons for inpatient admission is that treatment in the community has not been effective.  Young people who are admitted will be admitted because they require the treatment package that can be delivered in an inpatient setting.  Some young people will re-present, given the severity of their conditions.  The children who will be admitted are more likely to have severe and chronic disorders.

When I asked a parliamentary question, the reply I received &ndash; it was actually signed by Mr. Ryan &ndash; stated that 49 children had been admitted to Merlin Park or Linn Dara in 2021 but that, in the same period, 115 children whose primary presentations were for eating disorders had been admitted to non-eating disorder inpatient public acute mental health facilities.  I have spoken to parents whose children are going through this process.  Their children are brought in and are not getting the specialist treatment and food intake supervision that they need.  All that seems to be done for them is to increase their body mass indices, at which point they are released, but it is a vicious circle, with them going back in and back out again.  While I welcome that there were places for 49 children to be admitted to specialist eating disorder units, there were another 115 children who needed that specialist help but were not getting it.<\/p><p>Is anything being done to address that?

The challenge is that there has been a very significant increase in demand over the last few years, as Dr. Doody mentioned earlier.  We are running to catch up.  A few years ago there was significant criticism of the practice of transferring young people abroad for the treatment of eating disorders, in particular.  I do not think anybody has been treated abroad in the last three years, which is a significant improvement.  That does not mean we are meeting the demand that is there at the moment.  Dr. Doody might speak to that issue.  It is about the journey we are on, particularly in relation to community care for patients with eating disorders and inpatient care.

We have eight eating disorder beds.  Obviously, that is a finite resource in respect of the number of young people we can admit.  Due to the fact the beds are specialist eating disorder beds and that we also offer the option of nasogastric, NG, feeding, we are able to admit young people who are much more unwell from paediatric ward settings.  We can treat them in a service where they are getting more than just the nutritional treatment, but also all of the other therapeutic interventions and the comprehensive therapeutic care package.  The team assesses all children with eating disorders who are referred to the service.  We make an assessment and prioritise the young people who we feel require and would benefit from inpatient care.  Given that we now have a specialist eating disorder community service, there may some cases where the needs of the young person can be met by that service.  We talked about the number of referrals earlier.  Looking at the figures from the community eating disorder team, the number of children that the community eating disorder team is referring on for inpatient admission is usually less than five per year.  The national clinical programme is about the need to provide specialist services in the community to enable parents to access specialist treatment in the community such that their child does not require to be admitted to hospital or an inpatient CAMHS setting.  On the one had, thinking back, when A Vision for Change was launched all those years ago there was a view that nationally, all we would require would be four inpatient beds for eating disorders.  Looking at what has happened over the last few years, we recognised the increased demand for the services, but we did not anticipate the degree to which the demand would explode.  We are obviously, in a sense, trying to catch up with something that is increasing.  It is important that we take a whole-system approach, particularly given the fact that the majority of young people with eating disorders can be treated successfully in the community.  Those specialist services need to be there.  The fact we have that specialist community service in Linn Dara is really positive.  It enables the young people and families to access specialist treatment at a community level, without having to wait for it.  That reduces the likelihood of negative outcomes.  We know that the longer an eating disorder persists, the more likely it is to become chronic.  The young people who are more likely to require inpatient treatment are those who have a disorder that persists.  In other words, the key is being able to access the specialist treatment in a timely fashion in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022062800002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan Doody"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I also want to raise the issue of the referrals to CAMHS that are not accepted.

Part of that is about defining what it provides as a service, and part of it is about the difficulty people have in saying CAMHS does not meet their needs.  We acknowledge that.

We are saying that the 2% Dr. Doody mentioned earlier - internationally it is normally 2% to 3% - who require CAMHS may fall outside of it but that does not mean they do not need services.

Children are not referred without a need.  A question arises when CAMHS believes that need does not fall within its acceptance criteria.  For families, that does not mean a child does not have a need that needs to be met by services.  The reasons community CAMHS will not accept a referral are that the young person's presentation is such that he or she does not require the accessing of specialist mental health services, or the child's needs primarily require other interventions, as the Deputy said, with regard to disability services.  He specifically mentioned children with autism.<\/p> <p>  Again, the Deputy is correct that if children have a neurodevelopmental disorder, that does not mean they cannot have a mental health problem as well.  It is about steps with us.  We have looked at forums, which the chief officer can also talk about, regarding how we as a much broader HSE service - we are one part of a service - integrate the various components of HSE service work more closely together such that families do not feel, as the Deputy said, they have slipped between the gaps of two services.  Some of that is about recognising that these children have needs.  We then need to look at resourcing primary care, which we also talk about.  Sometimes the issue can be one of gaps in primary care, for example, if there is not adequate resourcing of primary care psychology services.  Young people are then referred to a specialist service, when their need would be much better met at a lower or primary care level.  It is something within the CHO area for which there is an acknowledgement of how the wider and broader range of HSE services meet the needs of this group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022062800002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan Doody"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Quite a number of the questions I wanted to ask have been very comprehensively covered.

We talk about young people, for example, with eating disorders, for whom, clearly, the primary goal of inpatient is weight restoration and normalisation of dietary intake such that the young person is able to function and return to be with their family and in the community.  In a sense, when it comes to a clear outcome, that would be the target for a young person with an eating disorder.<\/p> <p>  All young people who are admitted will have care plans, which identify the goals of treatment and admission.  These are updated on a regular basis.  During the admission, the team will work closely with the community service to which the young person will return to on discharge.  That is very important because the inpatient setting is very intensive and stepping down to a community setting can at times be both daunting and challenging, that is, going from a very intensive service to a community service.  Again, it is very much about identifying what additional supports will facilitate and allow for that transition.  That transition obviously takes working with the young person, the family, but also the services in the community.  Are there additional supports that can be provided within the service that the young person is attending? <\/p> <p>  With regard to the young person reintegrating, our school is also a very important part of our service.  The Linn Dara schools will link with the young person&rsquo;s school to make sure that young person has a smooth transition back into his or her school and assess if a different type of schooling is required.  We also run a kind of a transition school programme.  Young people can step down within our educational programme.

Obviously if you look back, in 2010 more young people were being admitted to adult units than to child units.  As a percentage of admissions it is now down to 7% of admissions to HSE.  There was a total of 361 admissions in 2021 and 27 were admitted to adult units.  Of those, 16 subsequently transferred to CAMHS units.  If, as Jim has said, we have the national tele-call - if a young person is admitted to an adult unit they are seen and assessed and what we find is on average a young person is three or four days in that adult setting and then either transferred to a CAMHS unit or discharged.  Last year, 60% of those admitted to an adult unit were subsequently transferred to a CAMHS unit and again the average age was 17 and a half years.  The vast majority of these young people are actually aged 17 years.  Although it is 7% of admissions if you look at actual bed days it is much smaller than that.  Clearly, one would like to reduce this as much as possible.  However, I do not think it is realistic as in a crisis situation admission to an adult unit may be in the young person's best interest but again, if that occurs it should be for the minimum amount of time and the young person should be transferred as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  Within our particular primary catchment area we have had very few admissions to adult units in the past two and a half years.  However, again the focus should be not only on reducing the number of admissions but also ensuring if an admission occurs the young person is assessed, triaged and transferred if that is appropriate and if they are not, that they are discharged, so it is not that young people are spending extended periods of time in adult units.

We have done a few things over recent years.  There is an increasing demand for health services generally, and our ability to meet that demand has to be met in different ways.  One of the things we have done in mental health is around e-health and e-mental health, and that is a way in which we can reduce the number of young people or adults who need to go up the line.<\/p><p>Under the tiered model of care, we are trying to have as many people as possible seen at the lower level.  Taking youth mental health as an example, we have a service agreement with the likes of Jigsaw, Turn To Me, MyMind, SpunOut, etc.  All these organisations are able to pivot very quickly.  They can upscale their operations.  That is an attractive way for young people to access services when traditionally they might have come to mental health services.  We have attempted to take that approach over recent years, and mental health was one of the initiators of that approach.  It has made a big difference.  The numbers attending Jigsaw are increasing significantly.  It has the same issues that we have about providing bricks and mortar services but it is able to upscale its online service much quicker because people can work from home and work more flexible hours, as we mentioned earlier.  We must do a combination of things.  We must ensure our secondary and tertiary care services are delivered by professionally qualified and appropriate staff.  We must reduce the numbers moving up the system through our services and by working with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, which have a significant role to play.<\/p><p> I worked for an NGO in Tallaght as a youth worker years ago.  Treatment from an NGO makes a considerable difference because young people are in their own communities and within their own settings.  We are trying to reduce the numbers of people moving up the system.  On the point Ms O'Kelly made earlier, we will have to look at some way of trying to incentivise some services.  Other people will come in here and say we are not prioritising their area.  We are in competition with the likes of enhanced community care.  \"Competition\" is not the right word.  Citizens need more services and we are trying to deliver them.  The way in which we provide services must include face-to-face consultations but the other ways of doing it online will make a difference.  Rather than seeing those alternatives as less positive, we should instead be saying how much more positive they are.  We have many examples of that.  Some young people much prefer texting and online consultations to face-to-face consultations.  Rather than seeing that as a problem, we should see it as a benefit and take advantage of social media and different ways to try to deliver services.  We are not going to be able to deliver services for everybody in every part of the country in the manner people might have thought we could.  Consultants in more peripheral areas of the country find it difficult.  South Kerry was mentioned earlier in that regard.  It is more difficult to get consultants in such areas.   However, remote consultation works quite well.<\/p><p> A combination of approaches is required.  There is no silver bullet.  We need to prioritise certain of our services and that is why we have found the need to prioritise the 2% of young people who require secondary care and those types of services.  Those are the sickest young people we have from a mental health perspective.  I do not believe there is any one solution because if there were, somebody else would have thought of it before me.  We must continue to do those type of things.  It is about trying to broaden the way in which we deliver services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022062800002#S01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":342,"content":"<p>One thing we would like to be able to look at it, which we have discussed in the CHO, is growing our own.  We are a population of more than 700,000 and a large part of the area is socially deprived.  Families are striving hard with children in secondary education.  The first academic primary care centre in the country is in the Russell Centre, Tallaght, which Deputy Ward visited recently.  Trinity College Dublin is its academic partner.  One of the pieces we would like to look at is being able to grow our own within our population.  There is an anchor of people who live in the area.  We had that discussion.  There are people who live in the area and who are passionate about working in their local communities.  That is definitely something to consider from a national point of view.  Deputy Ward will be sick of hearing me say this but we must consider being able to assist people with accommodation and a weighting in addition to basic pay.  We need to recognise that we are comparable to international cities in expenditure.  London and other European cities have a weighting on top of basic pay for people who live in areas where rent and mortgage repayments are higher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022062800002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":343,"content":"<p>From my experience with the RISE Foundation, I totally agree with regard to online services.  We deal with families who are impacted because someone they love has an addiction problem.  An awful lot of family members come to the RISE Foundation with mental health issues.  Initially, we would not have thought online consultations would have worked but they are actually working better from a therapeutic point of view.  The foundation has fully qualified therapists and the service is working better from a therapeutic point of view, whether it is one to one, a group dynamic or aftercare.  It is definitely working, which was a real eye-opener for us, and it expands our services countrywide.  People do not have to travel from Donegal anymore, for example.  They can avail of our services in their homes now.  We find that very beneficial.  It is one of the ways forward but, obviously, it does not suit everyone.<\/p> <p>  More and more people are being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.  This is an area in which I have a specific interest.  Many of these diagnoses are of adults who suffered greatly in educational or workplace settings because their needs were not recognised.  This definitely demonstrates the importance of early diagnosis.  Will the witnesses tell me a little more about the assessment, diagnosis, management initiation, research and education, ADMIRE, ADHD pathway?  What level of demand is there for this service and is it adequately resourced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022062800002#U00100","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>When we looked at our services in our base in Cherry Orchard, Dublin, we developed the ADMIRE pathway because of the need to provide a pathway with a robust and evidence-based assessment and treatment process.  It is about how we improve the service and, following the programmatic approach, assess children in a comprehensive, effective and efficient manner to ensure a diagnosis is made and treatment is initiated.  We found that we often do well in the diagnosis service, but the quality of aftercare and treatment, which will often include medication, needs to be looked at and optimised.<\/p> <p>  The pathway, which is linked academically with Trinity College Dublin and is led by Professor Jane McGrath, is new and innovative and looks at taking the best from models abroad as to how to deliver for this group of children.  A diagnosis of ADHD for children and families can be life changing.  It gives families an understanding that their child's difficulties are something over which the child does not necessarily have full control.  The thing about ADHD is that it is not just a condition.  If left untreated, the outcomes for young people going from childhood to adulthood are not good.  Children with ADHD often have other difficulties that need to be picked up on as well.<\/p> <p>  Our pathway has won a number of awards.  For families, the link between academic and research has been very important.  When we were allocating a new development post, we saw that we needed to develop and strengthen the ADHD pathway team further because of the level of demand and throughput.  As a service, the pathway has been developing and putting together assessment packages that will be widely available.  Professor McGrath has received a lot of interest from services around the country as to what they can learn in regard to providing the best possible assessment and treatment for this group.<\/p> <p>  Children with ADHD make up a significant proportion of those who attend CAMHS services.  It is important we optimise the diagnosis, treatment and aftercare.  As was pointed out, it is often the case that when parents attend services with their children that they recognise they had those difficulties when they were a child.<\/p><p>We now need to develop services for adults because we have children who are being diagnosed and treated reaching their 18th birthday but where are the adult services to take them on?  That is one group.  You could say the young people are graduating.  There are also adults who, for the first time, are realising they need access to a treatment service.  The need to develop this has been recognised within the clinical programmes.  Once upon a time there was a belief ADHD was just a condition of childhood and that when you reached adulthood you grew out of it.  For a proportion it lessens in adulthood but for some their difficulties continue into adulthood and there is a need to not only diagnose it but also treat appropriately.  That is something for the national clinical programme and Mr. Ryan can perhaps talk about the development of services for adults.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022062800002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan Doody","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Just to add to that, we have recently received an additional five posts for the development of an adult ADHD team as well.

You can imagine what it would be like for a family that has a child who is suicidal or who has an eating disorder.  How can families be supported while they are waiting for that service?

When a referral comes in, it is triaged.  It is not the case that everyone goes to the back of the queue.  Urgent cases are prioritised.  A child who is suicidal or a child with a serious eating disorder absolutely would be prioritised.  The concern about children who just meet the threshold is that a young person's presentation may not be seen as being as severe or as acute.  In other words, the concern is that the priority cases will forever jump to the top of the queue.  As for those on waiting lists, things change and families are encouraged to make contact and to speak to the team involved.  The Chairman talked about eating disorders, for example.  Currently, in our community specialist eating disorder service there are 15 on a waiting list, but 13 of those have an appointment and are seen in a very timely fashion.  The children who have that more acute presentation will be seen.  Sometimes the children waiting are those whose presentation is not as severe or as acute.  The case is made that if the children are waiting, things will deteriorate because they are not getting intervention.  That is a very valid point.  When our overall number of referrals are climbing and climbing and the complexity of the cases attending or being referred is increasing, we have to look at how we, as a service, meet the needs of all the young people who are referred.  It is challenging.  The children with more acute or severe presentation are seen and prioritised.  All referrals are prioritised, and those with the greatest need will be prioritised to be seen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022062800002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan Doody"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I have one more question.

What we are about is how we help young people to achieve their full potential.  It is important that if children have conditions such as ADHD, they are detected, diagnosed and treated.

These relate to sections 11 and 16 and the requirement for the form of the application to be prescribed by way of regulation.  It is proposed to remove this requirement and to allow the Garda Commissioner to determine this.  This is because the form will be closely linked to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, form, which is subject to changes from time to time.  It would be too difficult to make regulations each time there are changes to the PIAB form.<\/p> <p>  Department officials are also examining whether a small technical amendment may be required in section 2(2) due to the likely commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.

A number of difficulties have arisen in this regard due to the status of civilian staff as civil servants.  The interaction between this scheme and existing occupational injuries schemes and supports that already apply to them is not straightforward.  To attempt to extend the scheme now will delay the passage of the Bill significantly.

I understand that the committee wishes to focus upon the Draft Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2022-2042, which I will refer to as the draft transport strategy.  To assist me in dealing with members' subsequent questions, I am joined by Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy chief executive with the NTA.  As the committee will be aware, the NTA published the draft transport strategy for public review and feedback in November of last year, with the period for submissions running until 10 January last.  The NTA received 1,020 submissions in response to this consultation process.<\/p><p>The main issues raised, in no particular order, were as follows: ambition and delivery timelines; public consultation and engagement; details of the cycle network plan; fare structure on commuter rail services; Navan rail line and the Dunsany rewilding project; MetroLink and Charlemont station; metro to south-west Dublin; BusConnects network and core bus corridors; details of the DART+ project; delivery of DART+ tunnel; extension of DART+ services to commuter towns; new rail stations; accessibility and catering for disabled people; safety and security of the transport system; equality in transport; and enforcement of traffic laws.  Beyond these 16 main issues, which covered the vast majority of representations made, there were a large number of other matters raised across the spectrum of transport and planning themes.<\/p><p> All the submissions were carefully reviewed and considered.  Arising from this process a number of changes have been made to the draft transport strategy.  While a considerable number of amendments have been incorporated, many of these are minor in nature and, overall, the amendments have not altered the fundamental features of the transport strategy.  It is also worth noting that a considerable number of the submissions raised items that are more appropriately dealt with at the project development level, rather than at the strategy level.  Many of the changes which have been made are in the nature of clarifications, making clearer the intent of the particular measure proposed.  In other cases additional measures have been added, such as requiring sustainable transport to be a critical consideration in the site selection process for new schools.<\/p><p> Various additions and changes have been made to the cycle network proposals, informed by issues identified in submissions.  Other sections of the draft transport strategy were expanded to take account of feedback received, such as the section on equality in transport which has received further elaboration.  The draft transport strategy was also updated to take account of additional transport policies, such as the national sustainable mobility policy which was published earlier this year.  In addition, an explicit provision has been included requiring the NTA to prepare and publish a demand management scheme in accordance with the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, within two years of the adoption of the strategy, to ensure the achievement of the transport emissions target for 2030.  In accordance with the relevant legislation, the draft transport strategy has been now been forwarded to the Minister for Transport for his consideration and determination.  We look forward to the outcome of the process and the subsequent progression of the various proposals set out in the draft transport strategy. <\/p><p> That concludes my introductory statement.  I trust that I can answer any queries that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Graham.

That is my understanding, and my questions will all relate to the document provided to us.  I thank Ms Graham and Mr. Creegan for attending the meeting.  They have always been very generous with their time to members and we appreciate that.<\/p> <p>  I will move to the document that was presented to us.  The first item I wish to raise is the timelines for projects.  Depending on the answer we could make a recommendation to the Minister.  We need very clear and consistent timelines for transport projects.  When the draft strategy was produced there was some confusion and I believe a press release was issued by the NTA clarifying the greater Dublin area, GDA, strategy proposals.  The public and public representatives expect to have clear and realistic timelines for projects.  We have fallen foul of unrealistic timelines in the past.  As well as realistic and clear timelines, there are the different stages within the timelines for the delivery of a project.  For example, where there is a project to be completed by 2040 or 2030, what has to be set out is what the different stages would likely be, such as design, planning, compulsory purchase order, CPO, processes and so forth, so we have a clear breakdown of the different stages within a timeline, the reasons those timelines exist and the rationale behind apportioning two years for planning or two years for design or whatever it may be.  Also, I suggest that a document such as this should suggest ways in which those timelines may be reduced, for example, parallel processes within a project.<\/p> <p>  There is a section which commits to decide and provide.  It is an improvement on the predict and provide model.  We often look at these projects and say that when we have reached saturation point, for example, on buses, then we will update the rail system, knowing full well that people prefer to travel by rail.  If we went with the decide and provide method, we would probably decide that we are going to put in rail before we wait to exhaust the current transport proposals that are in place.  It is a build-it-and-they-will-come scenario.  I realise the NTA has to support its decisions with evidence and research and that it is public money and must go through a public spending process, but we know from many projects that when it gets built, it gets used and that the use might not be completely apparent or obvious when one builds it.  The Phoenix Park tunnel link, for example, reached very high capacity, much higher than we expected.  Even on the western rail corridor the numbers just shot up.  I would like Ms Graham to comment on the decide and provide aspect because the NTA seems to commit to that, but then it seems to rely on the predict and provide methodology.<\/p> <p>  The climate emissions target in it is set for 2042.  We raised this previously when the draft strategy was in place.  I am sorry, Chairman, these may not necessarily be questions, but they are points that I would like to have recorded that we could pass to the Minister.  This target is set for 2042.  It sets out the emissions from transport in the GDA to be below one 1 megatonne equivalent of CO2 by 2042.  However, we do not have information on what emissions reductions would be achieved by 2030, which is a Government marker in time when we want a 51% reduction in emissions.  That is not clear to me in this.  In addition, it does not set out clear scenarios.  We will have to cut emissions by 51% across all sectors.  There are a number of ways of doing that, whatever way one is going to slice the sectoral pie or within those sectors themselves.  What would be helpful would be the scenarios that we could suggest or choose to give a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030, and to design a range of options.  Those who decide what options to go with can choose from those options.  Regardless of what suite of measures they may choose in terms of public transport, active transport, demand management or whatever it might be, they could rely on the fact that they can choose the right range of options.  It is much like what one does in energy retrofit of a home.  One is given a range of options which will give the energy cut.  That is what we need to do in terms of emissions.<\/p> <p>  Regarding how the DTA assesses a project, that is, the way the DTA calculates a project, assesses whether it is going to be successful or deliverable or whether it should invest in it, it appears to focus a lot on time-based savings.  In other words, somebody takes a car journey and the journey takes the person 30 or 40 minutes whereas the alternative might be a ten-minute walk and a 30-minute, 35-minute or 40-minute bus service.  Then, through BusConnects or other improvements, that bus service becomes more reliable with a faster journey time, and measures we might put in place, such as with BusConnects in Dublin, where we might restrict or reduce car accessibility through an area, the car journey time becomes less favourable and the bus and walking time remains consistent.  Does the NTA assess projects on the basis of the cumulative impact of measures that we take?<\/p> <p>  There is a section on page 172 on roads.  It suggests a link road, the M3 to the M4, parallel to the M50 - I think it is the M50 over-bridge at Liffey Valley - as a parallel or alternative route to cater for accidents or blockages on the M50.<\/p><p>It is my understanding that the link road was removed from the county development plans of both local authorities but the NTA has still included it in this draft strategy.  Why is that the case?  I know the reasoning for it but I believe it was removed from both county development plans, although I may be corrected on that point.  The proposed road goes through some sensitive areas, which is concerning.  Would that road only be used in the event the M50 was blocked?  What stops us from inducing demand onto that road if we provide it?  In taking traffic from the M50, that road could become just as full and busy as other roads.<\/p><p> Part of the text of the strategy relates to home zones.  I cannot find the relevant notes but from memory, the draft strategy refers to the vulnerability of users, including children walking to school, cyclists and pedestrians.  The text of the 2021 draft states, \"A Home Zone is [a] street or group of streets designed to meet the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, children and residents and where the dominance of the car is reduced.\"  It is stated on page 181 of the final draft that a home zone is a street or group of streets designed to balance the needs of pedestrians, cyclists and children with those of motorists.  That is a retrograde definition.  I prefer the text in the 2021 draft and suggest we keep that definition of home zones.<\/p><p> The section on school site selection was also amended.  The 2021 draft included stronger wording.  It stated, \"In the site selection process for new schools sustainable transport shall be a critical consideration.\"  I do not need to read it out; our guests are familiar with the text.  What was produced in the later document is weaker.  I suggest we keep the original drafting of the school site selection definition for school placement.<\/p><p> On the freight section, is there mention of how we would support rail freight connection in Dublin and the conflict that arose in Dublin Port last year when rail freight seemed to be sidelined?  Has that been analysed sufficiently?  What is required in Dublin Port to maintain rail freight connectivity?  I will return to the issue of freight.  Will I have a chance to come back in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062800002#C00300","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I suggest we go with initial slots of ten minutes.

I saw the NTA respond to some of those issues on RT&Eacute;'s \"Prime Time\" last week.  There are a couple of specific issues I wish to raise.  The NTA has done this review of maximum fares, which will kick in during August.  Ms Graham indicated that there will be a recruitment campaign.  However, I hear very clearly from those in the taxi industry that there are issues related to the ten-year rule and the number of vehicles, more than 5,000, that will be off the road at the end of the year.  The transferability of plates and how it is impacting people who might be eager to transfer their licences is also an issue.  Is the NTA looking at either of those areas?  Will Ms Graham speak to those points?<\/p> <p>  Public transport providers are eager to take on additional 24-7 routes.  Does the NTA have any immediate plans in that regard?

This was an attempt to protect and retain as many drivers and vehicles within the industry as possible.  We still need to focus on maintaining the fleet operating in the market in good condition to ensure quality, however.  That is something we continue to do.  We do not believe that there are significant barriers to entering the small public service vehicle, SPSV, market in Ireland, particularly for the last two decades.  There is no cap on the number of SPSV drivers or the number of licences issued.  Any person or vehicle meeting the prescribed criteria, which we believe are reasonable, may be licensed to provide SPSV services.<\/p> <p>  In 2011, there was a widespread Government and stakeholder review of the taxi industry.  That was at the height of the recession.  Even then, the maximum age limits for vehicles were considered in depth and subject to full public consultation.  In that same year, given the importance of the matter to the industry, we carried out a separate public consultation on vehicle standards with an emphasis on the question of maximum age limits, which was included in the overall review.  The review found that the vehicle age limit for standard taxis and hackneys should be less than ten years and that the limit for wheelchair-accessible vehicles, WAVs, should be less than 15.  This means that, when a standard taxi or hackney reaches its tenth birthday, it must be replaced with a younger vehicle.  However, this replacement does not have to be brand new.  Most vehicle licence holders tend to choose a replacement vehicle that is three to five years old.  Data from before the pandemic show that 51% of SPSVs were to be five years old or younger at the end of 2021.  This proportion has fallen to 35%.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to international comparators, the age limits that apply to SPSVs in different jurisdictions vary but Ireland is on the end of the scale that allows for older vehicles.  In the UK, local authorities usually apply either an age limit or an emissions standard.  This age limit rarely exceeds ten years for saloon vehicles.  Where emissions standards apply, diesel vehicles usually must meet or exceed the Euro 6 standard while petrol vehicles must meet or exceed the Euro 4 standard.  In most regions in continental Europe, age limits lower than ten years apply.  A limit of seven years is common in France and Belgium.  We therefore think it is reasonable to ask the industry to return to a limit of ten years on the age of vehicles.<\/p> <p>  The taxi industry has always raised the issue of transferability.  It is possible to identify a family member to whom a vehicle licence can be transferred on the death of the holder.  We are not looking at any other transferability measures at this time.<\/p> <p>  On public transport, we have always wanted to extend public transport services, particularly in our cities, and to offer a 24-hour service, seven days a week, across key routes in the city.  As part of the roll-out of BusConnects, we have put a number of such services in place.  Even in advance of this roll-out, we had a number of 24-hour services in operation.  These have proven to be very popular.  We want to extend those as much as possible but whether we can make those increases and alleviate the problems customers and the people of Dublin and our other cities are experiencing at peak times, that is, the two hours on Friday and Saturday night when demand is at its highest, will come down to driver resource availability and funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I will come in again later but for now I will finish on these points on the ten-year rule.

The availability of electric vehicles at this time is also an issue.  We know there are supply chain issues.  There is a strong argument to be made for an extension.

I will leave the question of BusConnects and additional routes for that meeting.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on taxis for both the CEO and the deputy CEO.  I do not believe taxi drivers and organisations are of the view that the NTA is on their side and is protecting them.  There is obviously a dearth of taxis at the moment.  Will the witnesses briefly outline the impact of the Covid pandemic because it is clear that many taxis did not return?  Coming home from Croke Park the other night, I hailed a taxi and then had to hail a second taxi.  The driver would only take cash, by the way.  I only had plastic on me.  The witnesses might comment on that.  As a punter and a real supporter of taxis as public transport, I find that unacceptable.  I also want to represent very strongly the concerns and anxiety of taxi drivers, particularly with regard to what are known internationally as ride-sharing services.  The most popular of these is Uber.  These are not regulated.  Given the shortage of taxis, which has a significant impact on consumers travelling in and out of cities from a safety perspective, without mentioning the movement perspective, I would hope that the NTA shares my view that this is not something we should enter into with our eyes shut.  Taxis are regulated.  There is a certain amount of vetting and other things that people have to go through.  New apps allow people to know who the driver is and provide a record of the journey for them and for the driver, which provides security for people who might feel vulnerable using this aspect of public transport.<\/p><p>What are the NTA's plans around the shortage of taxis?  I am not sure that I favour the ride-sharing model.  It is a kind of free-for-all thing.  On the ten-year element, in the past two years of Covid when I have requested assistance or remuneration for taxi drivers I have found the NTA challenging enough to deal with in that respect and in communication.  The NTA has the right and entitlement to rebut that.  That was the kind of feeling I had.  It was very difficult to get answers from the NTA and particularly around taxi concerns.<\/p><p> I took a taxi recently.  The taxi driver had bought a brand-new electric car.  It is not hybrid, it was just electric.  The taxi driver was sharing it with another member of the family.  He said, \"We are guinea pigs and it is running 24 hours a day.\"  It is saving them &euro;250 per month.  The drivers are very pro that and they are very thankful and grateful for the considerable grant but they did have to top it up with a credit union loan.  I have made this point previously in the D&aacute;il Chamber and it applies also to many energy and retrofitting schemes, including much that is in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, space.  The taxi driver told me that they went to the garage they purchased the car from.  Say, for example, the car cost &euro;50,000 and with the grant it cost &euro;30,000: &euro;50,000 is unaffordable to them but &euro;30,000 might have been affordable.  The garage charged them &euro;30,000 for the car and the garage pursued the grant.  I do not believe it is widely known that this is allowable.  Suddenly it makes a new electric car much more affordable because a person can pay for it without the grant included.  It can reduce the price for an electric car for taxi driving from &euro;40,000 to &euro;28,000 or from &euro;50,000 to &euro;30,000.  Is that practice widespread?  Clearly, it is allowed.  Has it been advertised among taxi drivers that if they have X amount they do not need to borrow it and that the garage will pursue the grant?  It makes it much more affordable for taxi drivers.  I would welcome the NTA's comments on that.<\/p><p> My next question is, very respectfully, directed at the Chairman. For a number of months the metro to south-west group has sought a brief meeting with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  The group represents close to 40 residents associations.  The group wants to make a short 30 minute pitch.  They made a pitch to Oireachtas Members in the audio visual room, which was facilitated by Senator Seery Kearney.  They also made a pitch to the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary group for Dublin.  They just keep getting acknowledgements but time is running out.  I appeal to the Chairman's very good nature to facilitate this if possible before that the D&aacute;il recess.  It is actually coming to a critical time.  They all know that a metro to south-west is not going to be built tomorrow, and that some of them will never see the sod turned on it.  As a strategic piece of infrastructure they, and I as their public representative, want the National Transport Authority to look at it and take them more seriously.  They have built up quite a body of work on this and especially around where the metro coming from the north will stop in the city.  The committee is familiar with this.  The group's argument is that it goes on to Charlemont and then there is the possibility of it turning south west and serving areas such as Rathmines, Harold's Cross, Terenure, Templeogue, Rathfarnham, Knocklyon, Firhouse and maybe connecting with Tallaght; it becomes a forlorn prospect because of the direction of the boring machine.  There are plenty of issues on the table.  Will the Chairman be able to respond to that request?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062800002#E00500","speaker":"1572","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":413,"content":"<p>It is something we collectively look at as a committee.

On 4 May, in reply to a question from Deputy Steven Matthews, Mr. Creegan stated that for the NTA to look at transport initiatives they must be within the transport plan.  Arising from that I want to look at the transport provisions within the plan.  Section 12 of the plan sets out all the really big ticket items such as the MetroLink to the airport and to Lucan-Poolbeg, and the second line to Bray.  There is no provision in it for the south-west city.  The most recent census figures for those areas show: the south-west inner city population is 49,000; the Rathmines and Terenure population is 42,000; the Crumlin and Kimmage population is 41,500; the Templeogue and Rathfarnham area population is 43,000; the Ballyboden and Firhouse area population is 42,700; and in Tallaght the population is nearly 68,000 people.  There is a great anxiety, which has already been articulated by Deputy Lahart, that a metro to south-west gets put into this plan as an addendum.  We can put forward what we would really love to be put in as a paragraph.  Like Deputy Lahart, I implore this committee to exercise its power under section 12 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act to make recommendations to the Minister: that metro to south-west be included; that we have an overturning of the feasibility study, which was inadequate; that there is a proper and fully comprehensive feasibility study put in for the inclusion of metro to south-west; and that this be included in this plan.<\/p> <p>  On top of these figures, the city edge development is being talked about.  That is planned to be in place in ten years, which will add another 75,000 to 85,000 people resident there.  The NTA has already acknowledged that it may need two Luas lines for that area.  Within that, there are planned disruptions in the construction of BusConnects, which is reasonable and required to deliver on that.  There will also be Luas construction on the same streets that will have just been set up and disrupted over a number of years.  There is also potentially other forward planning for the likes of a metro to south-west, or otherwise.  It makes much more sense to have a comprehensive overview of all of these provisions for the south-west area of the city.  I would strongly ask that we would engage in that and to include it so the NTA can consider a metro to south-west in some form or other, even if it is in forward planning.  Otherwise, this is going to be kicked down the road.  It does not make sense to move ahead with other provisions when there is a very comprehensive possible solution here that should be included.<\/p> <p>  Attendant to that, I ask that the NTA comment on and reply, hopefully positively, to my next question.  In early June, subject to a motion from Councillor Anne Feeney in Dublin City Council, an invitation was issued to the NTA to come into the council to discuss the issue of the MetroLink Charlemont terminus and the significant impact it has for commuters in the area and future transport needs.  That was unanimously approved by the councillors.  I ask that the NTA would reply positively to that invitation.<\/p> <p> I apologise that I missed the NTA's opening statements as I was at another meeting.  The draft plan was published in November.  We are here now and there have been thousands of submissions in the meantime.  The NTA encouraged those submissions, for which I am very grateful.  Can the NTA give us a summary of what has changed on foot of those submissions?  What changes have been put in place because of those particular submissions?  I would really appreciate that.<\/p> <p>  A Deputy referred to timelines.  Within that, I note the original timeline for BusConnects was for six applications by the end of June.<\/p><p>There were only two.  What is the timeline now for BusConnects?  How can that be delivered so that we have a definitive future plan and idea?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062800002#F00400","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I still start with the questions from Deputy Matthews and ask Mr. Creegan to answer those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":418,"content":"<p>How did the witnesses wish to proceed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062800002#G00300","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":419,"content":"<p>It is up to the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062800002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":420,"content":"<p>Is Ms Graham happy to allow further speakers in?

One relates to the road objective in chapter 13, which outlines the strategic importance of the M50.  An area between the N4 and N3, close to the toll bridge, is regarded as having inadequate resilience.  The plan states: \"The NTA, in collaboration with TII and the relevant local authorities, will seek the development and construction of an appropriate road link between the N3 and N4 national roads, which can provide a satisfactory alternative in the event of incidents arising on the M50 between Junctions 6 and 7.\"  The problem is that it will not only be used for that.  Eleven possible routes have been identified.  Eight go through Liffey Valley, which is a special amenity area.  One, which was formerly identified in the Fingal county development plan and the Kildare development plan, was removed in the review of the development plan following significant involvement of local communities.  St. Catherine's Park and Lucan Demesne is a relatively recent development, being approximately 30 years old.  The land was purchased by the State and jointly developed by three local authorities.  The communities on either side raised funds for playgrounds and other amenities.<\/p> <p>  The Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly submitted concerns, citing climate action as an issue, about the development of new roads in the Liffey Valley area.  Councillors removed the indicative line from the Kildare and Fingal county development plans in 2017.  A third world war would erupt if there was an intention to take away a park that people feel invested in and that is heavily used.  A road there would bisect the park and make it unusable.  There are 11 possible locations, but none of them is easy.<\/p> <p>  The second issue I wish to raise relates to timelines and low-hanging fruit.  DART+ is to be extended to Kilcock.  It is described as a new station west of Maynooth.  In fact, there will be a depot 350 m east of Kilcock.  Rail will be laid all the way up to that depot.  The only thing that will not be available when the depot is developed is a place for people to access the train.  That is a very short distance.  There is a project under way with a railway audit and separate process.  This could be combined with a small extension under a different process, which it could be done in conjunction with.  It would connect quite a sizable town that has developed on both the Meath and Kildare side.<\/p> <p>  There is confusion about whether the station 1.1 km west of the existing station in Sallins is a new station or additional to the existing one.  Clarity on that would be useful.  The population in the area of Naas, Sallins, Kill and Johnstown in 2016 was in excess of 42,000.  One would wish to keep that traffic out of the city.  It is a commuter area.  There is a fair argument to be made for an extension to Newbridge too.  It is 24 miles, or 39 km, from Dublin.  In 2016, it had a population of 22,000.  People drive to the Sallins station and park their cars there.  The matter requires consideration.<\/p> <p>  I have raised the DART tunnel since the 1990s.  A timeline is essential if we are going to have a networked service.  The Phoenix Park tunnel is useful but it has limitations.<\/p> <p>  Regarding BusConnects, railways will be key, but the workhorse of the public transport system is bus services because they are much more permeable.  A combination of both is important.  There is an issue relating to reliability of bus services, whether Go-Ahead, Bus &Eacute;ireann or Dublin Bus.  People will not use public transport to go to work or wherever else they want to go if they feel they cannot get back.  There is a significant issue at the moment.  I know it is an operational issue rather than strategic.  If there is to be a significant investment, it has to be reliable.  I know I keep annoying the NTA about this.  I experienced one of the first BusConnects routes and there are problems.  It is not working in some locations, though it is working well in other areas.  Lessons can be learned from the roll-outs and how quickly aspects that are not working can be rectified.  The witnesses know about the issues I have raised with them on a number of occasions.<\/p> <p>  The population of County Kildare is now 246,000.  It greatly exceeds the population of Limerick but it tends not to be noticed because it does not have a city in the middle.  There are many commuters.  County Meath has the same issue.  They are rapidly growing areas.  When the Dublin Transportation Initiative was embarked on all those years ago, the population of Kildare was half its current size.  Not having a consolidation in the centre was not an ideal spatial scenario.  The reality is that it is there and has to be provided for.  Much additional traffic is being generated by the growth in population.<\/p> <p>  The Sallins bypass is a great benefit to Sallins but it has had knock-on consequences on towns such as Clane.  AA Roadwatch now mentions traffic jams in places that did not have them previously, where the Sallins bypass and the roads from it, or the roads to Maynooth, are acting as a national secondary route more than anything else.  That requires additional consideration because it has already manifested.<\/p><p>As we are looking at a strategy with a 20-year horizon, consideration must be given and factored in at this point as to how it can be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062800002#G01000","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I wish to pick up on an issue raised by what Deputy Catherine Murphy described about the Sallins bypass and the knock-on effect with the issue in Clane.  It proves that when we build these roads and bypasses, they just beget more roads and more bypasses, so we need to think differently about transport.  I welcome the NTA's strategy for the GDA.  There is different thinking in it around transport and a lot of good stuff in there.<\/p> <p>  My reason for popping down to the committee was to ask the officials about the gap between the emissions targets we have nationally and the gap in the GDA strategy currently.  I think the latter is a 35% cut by 2030, so there is still a significant gap.  I was chairing the climate committee earlier and we had officials in from the Department of Transport.  They were not really able to tell me whether they had appropriately or adequately modelled for, or considered, the potential for electric bike uptake to meet the ambitious emissions reduction targets.  We know from quite recent research from UCC that 40% of all our transport emissions are caused by private car journeys of up to 8 km.  Many of those in the upper end of that range, say 4 km to 8 km, might be cyclable but they are certainly doable and comfortable by electric bike.  Has the modelling that underpins the GDA strategy considered the potential for very ambitious uptake of electric bikes?  We are seeing across Europe and the world that where safe networks are provided, people are using e-bikes for those mid-range journeys.  Is that part of the answer to filling that gap?  I am not a member of this committee but should it be recommending to the Minister that he explore all possibilities around electric bikes and do all we can do as a Government and a State to facilitate their uptake and usage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062800002#H00500","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":431,"content":"<p>First, I endorse the remarks of my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, about metro south west.  We have had much engagement from members of that group and principals in that area who are articulating strong views.  The officials have received a couple of emails, as we have as correspondence, from that committee around the whole Dublin transport authority and Dublin transport plan.  I welcome Ms Graham and Mr. Creegan once again.  They seem to be permanent fixtures at our committee.  They could both take up residence here, no bother at all.  They may be surprised that I, a Cork person, am speaking on Dublin but I have a number of points I want to raise on behalf of Councillor Joe Neville, who has engaged extensively with me on the matter, as well as Councillor P&aacute;draig McEvoy, to which I will come back in a second.<\/p> <p>  In a manner similar to Deputy Catherine Murphy, Councillor Neville has expressed concerns on the issue of St. Catherine's Park.  The Deputy is correct the three local authorities took a deliberate stance on that development and I support the remarks she made.  I thank Councillor Neville for his engagement with me.  The concerns he has raised are articulated in the context of the previous plans and references to putting a road through the park.  There is genuine concern at a residential level and at a local authority level because St. Catherine's Park is a special area of conservation in the Liffey Valley area.  As the officials will know from the remarks this evening and their own extensive deliberations, it is bordering counties Kildare and Dublin and everybody is concerned that we should not allow it to happen.  Councillor McEvoy is a member of the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, EMRA.  It met yesterday and considered the NTA transport strategy for consistency and has put forward amendments around the \"Measure ROAD8\" proposal.<\/p> <p>  In the context of what has been said today, I wish to articulate on behalf of Councillors Neville and McEvoy that neither Kildare nor Fingal county councils supported a roadway development between the N3 and N4 across the Liffey Valley in their county development plans.  The objective was not added and was removed from the respective plans.  The big thing with the NTA's draft transport strategy for the GDA is it has an objective in Measure ROAD8 to develop a new road as a resilience alternative to closure of the M50 between junctions 6 and 7.  We have done much work on the committee on changing speed limits on the M50 already but the EMRA continues to have concerns.  Deputy Catherine Murphy rightly made reference to climate action in the context of the development of a new road but the concerns expressed to both Councillors Neville and McEvoy rest with the county development plan going back as far as 2017.  There is an issue around the transport strategy, given the climate emergency, with additional road development. There is the matter of recommending alternative studies be undertaken if we are talking about reducing car journeys and movement and the whole issue around Measure ROAD8 remaining in the latest draft of the transport strategy.  As a committee, and with the NTA, it is about having the Department and the Minister give their attention to the real concerns of local communities.  To be fair, both Councillors Neville and McEvoy are outstanding public representatives who rarely engage in terms of the level of concern around this piece of work.  I ask that the NTA, in the context of the proposals, give consideration to the full range of options and that it would either engage with the councillors in question or meet the EMRA as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>  As we have heard not just today but on an ongoing basis, it is important to getting it right that there be consultation and co-ordination.  There has been on the draft.

It is important to say at the outset that, in terms of our legislation, we have two related documents that get produced.  One is a transport strategy that takes a look at what needs to be done over the next 20 years.  As soon as that is adopted, we are required within nine months of that to have completed what is called an implementation plan, which takes the first slice of six years and provides more detail in that time period about how we are going to deliver the strategy over that period.  That is the place to put in the type of details the Deputy was referring to, in order to give greater detail on what is happening in the first six years.  At the end of that six years we have to do a new implementation plan covering the next six years, and so on.<\/p><p>We have shaped the strategy in the way we have done knowing that we need to do this separate implementation plan immediately once it is adopted.  It must focus on delivery.<\/p><p> We have put in a commitment that decide and provide is much better than predict and provide.  Transport must be policy-led as opposed to purely demand-led - certainly in terms of cars.  We think we have used that tool correctly.  By predict and provide, we do not mean that we look at what the State is like 30 years from now and decide we need to provide it but that we make sure we are providing something that will last for a reasonable design life, for example at least 15 or 20 years.  In the case of all the BusConnects corridors, we are comfortable they can cater for the next 15 or 20 years.  Members will have seen in the strategy that we believe we need to transition to light rail lines or something else at a point in time.  That is part of the decide and provide scenario.  <\/p><p> Emissions reductions are set out in the transport strategy.  In 2018, the geotechnical design report calculation had about 3.2 million megatonnes equivalent of CO2.  We did a calculation to find out what it would be if it was business as usual by 2030 taking account of various other things and we got 3.4 megatonnes.  The strategy infrastructure and services measures, the planned electrification under the Government's plan and the biofuels transition only reduce it to 2 megatonnes.  I am overcomplicating that.  The target we should have by 2030 is 1.6 megatonnes.  Everything in the strategy only gets us to 2 megatonnes so there is a shortfall of 0.4 of a megatonne.  It does not look like a lot when you put a decimal point in front of it but it is actually quite hard to achieve it.  We set out three scenarios in the strategy about how it could be achieved.  Some of them are outside our ambit like fuel pricing.  In theory, we could electrify further if that was possible and that would deal with it.  The third approach was to do more demand management measures, be they parking restrictions, tolling, low-emissions zoning or congestion charging.  In the strategy, we committed to using one of the tools in our legislation, which is the tool to do a demand management scheme.  Within two years of adopting the strategy we will produce a demand scheme, the objective of which is to set out clearly how we will bridge that gap to get down to the 2030 target.<\/p><p> I will finish off by saying that we think we have done all the positive things we can do to deliver the change that is required.  The cycling infrastructure is the right infrastructure and the bus infrastructure is the right infrastructure along with rail and Luas.  All that can be done by 2030 will be done.  After that, it is more on the minus side where we are going to have to put in more parking restraint, some additional charging in some places and so on.  The strategy does all the infrastructure and services sides that are needed.  The demand management scheme will have to set out what additional measures are required to meet that target but that is the objective.<\/p><p> The N3 to N4 road link was mentioned by several members.  We included it because we think it is the right thing to do.  That is why we put it in the strategy.  We think there is a case for requiring that road link for the resilience of the M50.  If the old West Link Bridge collapsed on the M50, there would be no good alternative and it is the only segment of the M50 where you do not have a reasonable alternative so it is a significant issue from a resilience point of view.  We also think there is orbital movement that needs to be catered for in the growing areas of Kildare that is not currently catered for.  We are not saying the road needs to go through St. Catherine's Park.  At least 11 options have been identified so far.  It will be a matter for whoever is taking the project forward to tease their way through those options and come up with the best option.  Nowhere in our strategy are we proposing to go through St. Catherine's Park.  Of the 11 options, from memory, I think only two involve going through the park.  There were a number going east and west of that.<\/p><p> Regarding home zone change, we got feedback on the strategy and took on board what we felt was appropriate.  We got some feedback in that area.  The main change involves the word \"meet\".  I think we used the word \"balance\" and instead of changing the word \"car dominance\", we just said \"motor vehicles\".  I do not have it in front of me but it is something like that.  I take the point.  The original wording might look better.  I do not think there is much difference between the two.  I would be happy with either of them.  <\/p><p> We got feedback on school site selection.  I thought we ended up with quite strong language saying that in selecting the site for a school, you must take account of the sustainable transport needs to serve that school.  That is in there as a measure.  That is something that has troubled us for a long time.  Schools are being built in places where we are finding it very difficult to put in the type of connections that are needed to make it sustainable.<\/p><p> We recognise and committed in several places that rail freight will have to increase.  It is definitely going to be part of the tools to meet the climate change target.  I am not familiar with the issue in Dublin Port so there are probably details that are beyond what should be in the strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062800002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656370800,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Regarding assessing a project and focusing on time-based savings, that is a methodology we are obliged to follow because it is the methodology set out by the Department.

At the moment, the methodology is as set out so we are obliged to follow that at this time.<\/p> <p>  I think we responded to Deputy O'Rourke's questions.  Obviously, we will respond further if there is any further follow-up.  Deputy Lahart also looked at the taxi industry.  I will give some facts and figures regarding where we are in terms of the numbers of vehicles in the industry post Covid.  We are down about 11% in terms of vehicle licences from pre-Covid.  Out of that, there are a number of inactive vehicle licences so there are about 3,200 that could return to the industry in the next 24 months post expiry - they remain connected to the industry and we hope to see as many of them as possible coming back to the industry.  The number of those who are available to drive in Dublin has reduced by 5.5% since 2019.  We are undertaking a driver recruitment campaign to encourage new applicants to take up driver licences.  We hope that this campaign results in new driver licences, as was the case when we did a campaign a number of years ago, so that we can start building back up the sector post Covid.  There is no doubt that it is still having an impact on availability at those core hours on Friday and Saturday nights.<\/p> <p>  As to whether it would make any difference if we were to allow what we would consider a more deregulated market in terms of ride hailing, there is a misconception that the old-style Uber, which was what it was offering, still operates in the UK and western Europe.  This involved unlicensed drivers and unlicensed vehicles.  In fact, in the UK, the regulations have been changed to permit only police-vetted and licensed drivers to operate even for ride share in London.  The same is true for Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain and France and many cities further afield in which Uber operates.  Uber does not operate with unlicensed drivers in London.  It is regulated by Transport for London in the same way as any private hire offering.  Drivers must have a private hire vehicle driver licence from Transport for London.  We would suggest that this regulatory model would also be used in Ireland so that Garda-vetted drivers would be used in terms of Uber services.<\/p><p>That is currently the case with licensed taxi drivers.  We would encourage that this remain the case for vehicle licences going through the regulatory model as well as driver licences.<\/p><p> Deputy Lahart spoke about communication around electric vehicle grants.  We will ensure that we communicate more around the fact that we can pay the grant directly to the garage rather than the individual.  The Deputy made the case that this seemed much more affordable for the taxi industry.

A piece of work that we have done - I appreciate that not everyone agrees with it - indicates that metro south west does not stack up economically at the moment.  That may change.  The terminal point of the tunnel for the MetroLink, assuming it gets the go ahead and is built, is designed to facilitate a connection going either to the green line or to the south west.  Alternatively, it could head over to UCD slightly circuitously.  However, it most definitely facilitates a connection to metro south west, so it does not preclude such a connection in the slightest.  Some groups are concerned that, by bringing it to Charlemont, we are effectively trying to prevent it from going to the south west.  Absolutely not.  Equally, there is an idea that St. Stephen's Green is the better location, but it is not.  The location we have chosen allows the MetroLink to connect with the green line, if required in future, or into the south west, which is more likely.<\/p> <p>  In reviewing the strategy, which we have to do every six years, we have given a commitment - it is on page 143 of the strategy - that we will assess the requirement to provide additional metro lines in the greater Dublin area based on the updated forecast for travel and demands, emerging significant changes in line use, etc., including previously considered options for extending MetroLink southwards towards UCD, along the existing green line or towards south-west Dublin.  We have committed in the strategy to re-examining the matter at the next review, which will be six years from now.

When we test with and without the DART tunnel in place, there are about 10,000 additional trips due to the tunnel.  The tunnel will have lots of people coming through it but they come off the Phoenix Park tunnel link, in the main, and off the bus system.  Because the Phoenix Park tunnel link is open, the case for that DART underground is not immediately strong.  As we say in the strategy, we think it will be required in the future and we think the line should be preserved and the issue should be revisited and reviewed.  When we analyse it in depth, that is what we are getting, although that is different from the situation six or seven years ago, before the Phoenix Park tunnel link was opened.

We are seeing a reduction in kilometres operated of an order that is not acceptable at the moment and we are not happy with the level of lost kilometres, which is impacting on the reliability of the services.  It is an operational issue.  We are finding that driver absences are at a level that, even post Covid, we do not feel is acceptable, and it is impacting on the delivery of services.<\/p> <p>  Driver recruitment is also an issue during this period of effective full employment in Ireland at the moment.  All operators are finding it difficult to recruit drivers and the attrition rate for drivers in our bus operators is also very high.  All of this is impacting on reliability and we have a number of actions with the operators to try to improve the recruitment timeline for drivers, but we are also looking at our service levels and seeing whether there are places - the Deputy already has identified some for us - where we might move services from one alignment to another to improve the reliability of those services.  Even during the summer months, where the demand is not as high as it would be in September, we might reduce services to improve the reliability, given our operators are struggling with driver resources.  That is an issue we are tackling with our operators at the moment.  The contracts are structured such that they are not paid for services they do not operate, which we thought would be a sufficiently strong incentive to ensure we would get that level of performance, but at the moment, unfortunately, they are all struggling in this space.  We have to apologise to our customers because the service is not at the level of reliability at which we want it to be.<\/p> <p>  On the delivery of the C spine of BusConnects, Deputy Catherine Murphy asked us to look at the lessons to be learned, which we will do, and we will also look at how quickly we can rectify aspects of the services.  In terms of the underlying growth in passenger numbers that we have seen over the implementation of the C spine, it has grown by 11% to 12% above what would be a normal growth and recovery after Covid.

Much of what I would have liked to have said about the strategy I have told them in previous meetings.  No doubt Deputy Lahart and Senator Seery Kearney have articulated very strongly the metro south west proposal which I have seen.  I live in Dublin Rathdown.  I have mentioned the upgrade of the existing green line Luas to our guests before, from Charlemont onwards, although it is not part of this strategy.  I do not want to see it being shelved or relegated any further.  I would like to see it come back at some point or other versions via UCD and potentially the eastern bypass corridor, which I will return to.  In this strategy the NTA is talking about an extension of the green line to Bray.  What is happening in Cherrywood and in Sandyford is very substantial.  That line is under enormous pressure.  I take on board all the points about increasing capacity, the length of carriages and increasing the frequency but the green line is a very popular line.  All Luas lines are very popular.  They are like magnets.  They suck people in because they are so reliable that people are willing to walk or use other ways of getting to those lines because they know they do not have to worry about timetables or it being every half hour because it is just so frequent.  They are brilliant but we do not want them to kill themselves by being so popular that they are impossible to use.  There were people getting on at Dundrum, going up to Kilmacud to cross the tracks and come back into town because they just could not get on at Dundrum to head towards town prior to the pandemic.  I know that happened and I am sure our guests did too.  I do not want to see metro south west replace it.  There is space for both metro south west and a green line upgrade or a version of the green line upgrade.  In terms of the green line being extended to Bray, it is already under pressure.  Cherrywood is only starting to take off and it is not remotely close to its capacity.  Sandyford has endless amounts of potential.  That is before we even mention Dundrum and all the places around it, including Goatstown and all the other areas.  I could not sit here without mentioning that the green line needs attention, watching and managing.  I accept people might look at this strategy and say it is 2022 to 2042 but we had a strategy from 2016 to 2035 six years ago.  It is not that we lock this in now and we never touch it again until 2042.  As was pointed out by the NTA, the strategy is a six-year rolling review.  It is effectively a living document that gets tweaked and adjusted based on populations, growth, development plans and all the other things.  That is important.  People might say that we are stuck with this until 2042.  Where will we all be, if we are lucky enough to be here at all, in 20 years' time?<\/p> <p>  I was at an event earlier in Cabinteely.  I cycled out there and the whole way back in.  Here I am now and I will cycle home later.  I am doing my bit for active travel as best I can.  I have the best, most secure car park in Ireland on this campus but I know that many people, particularly with the better bikes people have been getting on the cycle to work scheme and so on, are deterred from cycling by the uncertainty that if they lock their bike to a Sheffield stand, or other type of railing or fence, that it will be there when they come back.  That is a huge problem.  There is reference to secure parking but I do not know how that mechanism works.  I do not know how it works in other countries.  The weather is not the barrier for a lot of cyclists - it is not the barrier for me because it is not as wet as we might think - but rather if I go to the cinema or a meal will the bike still be there when I return.  In many relatively safe places people's bikes go missing; they are stolen.  Many more safer places are needed whether they are guarded, locked in a bike-locker type system or in car parks where a credit card or swipe card is needed to get in or out.  It is really important that we give people fewer reasons to not use the bike.  I probably went for 20 years without being on a bike but am back on one for the last ten.  People will realise how quick it is to get into town or to go from A to B on a bike and that is before we even talk about electric bikes, which I kind of feel is slightly cheating but are a real solution for many people and which takes up much less road space than anything else.  <\/p> <p>  Many people will have been to places such as Vienna or Prague where there are huge amounts of civic space.  That is not entirely the NTA's remit but it has invested in improving the civic space and public realm generally.  The more attractive it is made for cyclists then the more people will shift to it.  That does not mean you need to make it less attractive for cars, although there is an element of that.  They will move because it is good for their health and their pocket.  As petrol gets more expensive, the less you have to buy the better.  I am not asking people to cycle in from Maynooth, although I know some people do but there are many journeys that people make in the urban area.  I was a councillor for Stillorgan for 12 and a half years and I know that many people make a lot of journeys that are less than 2 km or 3 km that they could probably do far more quickly cycling when you factor in getting to the car, congestion, parking and walking to where you are going.  This is a strategy and it is a high-level document and I accept that.  I accept many of the points that were made that the public submissions were more operational than strategy but you need to get the small stuff right and you need to have people on board.  With BusConnects, people must understand it better.  My part of south Dublin has not seen too much of it yet.  I think people are willing to embrace it but they need to understand that it will not make their system worse and that it is designed to make their system better.  People are fearful of change but then all of a sudden there is a sense that it is fine.  There was a big hoo-ha about the number 10 bus being gone and becoming the number 39A.  People moved on.  There is fear of change so the communications strategy is important.  <\/p> <p>  I mentioned the metro.  I am sorry that the green line is being not moved on.  I make the point again about the eastern bypass corridor.  The proposal for the motorway is gone, that is understood - there is a very significant reservation that cannot be lost or built on because that will never come back - but whether it is a Luas, a linear park with a cycle way or whatever, there are lots of opportunities there.  The trip generator is between Sandyford, Dundrum town centre, across to UCD, RT&Eacute;, St. Vincent's hospital right down to the DART line.  They are enormous trip generators.  There should also be an off-road route.  Other countries have done it and we are trying to do it with greenways, although they have been more tourism greenway.<\/p> <p>  I met people from D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council some weeks ago and I am not overly convinced that Mount Anville Road is the best road in the world to put a dedicated path on because the gradient is so steep.  Maybe it will work for electric bikes but I know if I was going to go from UCD to Goatstown I would not climb Mount Anville Road to do it.  I would go another way that would get me from A to B but without that gradient.  There is an opportunity along that eastern bypass corridor with less of a gradient and I would like the NTA to talk to the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council about this.  There is also the bit heading towards the city but the bit I am talking about is all in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  There is scope there for a very high-quality off-road linear park with a pedestrian walkway and a cycleway.  There is so much traffic and trip generators, particularly to UCD.  It is an enormous generator of traffic.<\/p><p>It is also an enormous generator of parking difficulties around the campus and on all of the neighbouring estates on every side of the campus, including the Blackrock, Clonskeagh and Roebuck Road sides, and even towards Donnybrook.  Anything that could make it easier to get to those places must be done.<\/p><p> RT&Eacute; is a very significant employer.  There are around 20,000 students and 5,000 or 6,000 staff at UCD.  We must make it easier to get to and from the campus and connect it up, mainly by cycling if that can be done.  A bus corridor or Luas line would be a good idea.  We have talked about that a little.  There is scope for the green line extension to be brought up to the eastern bypass corridor and along the dual carriageway, up from the DART and on to Sandyford.  Currently, the biggest generator of Luas traffic is Sandyford, as the witnesses will acknowledge.  Cherrywood will be similar to Sandyford both in terms of residential population and business.  It will create more traffic towards Bray.  I was asked by councillors in south Dublin and Greystones about building a twin track on the line between Bray and Greystones.  I spoke to Deputy Matthews about it, who said it was not possible from an engineering perspective.  Maybe that is case, or maybe not.  Councillor Jim Gildea contacted me about it and there was a meeting of the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly yesterday to discuss the issue.  I was the first chair of the assembly a long time ago, so I am familiar with the work it does on regional and spatial economic strategies.  If there was a possibility to introduce a twin track on that line, it would be helpful.  If not, the issue deserves attention.  We are trying to get people to move from aviation travel to travelling by boat and using Rosslare Port.  The better that railway line is and the greater the frequency of trains, the greater the modal shift will be.<\/p><p> I apologise for giving the witnesses a long spiel.  I ask them to respond to the points I have made as best they can.  The strategy is a 236-page document.  There is a lot of good stuff in it.  I believe there is a reference in it to the option of introducing metro south west or something else.  I would prefer to see metro south west and something else.  It looks like it is being presented as an \"or\" scenario.  I would like to see all of the projects progressing, the extension of the green line in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062800002#M00500","speaker":"1696","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Following up on Senator Horkan's point, Councillor Jim Gildea also contacted me about the Bray to Greystones railway line.  My understanding is that the line as far as Bray is a double line and from Bray to Greystones and onwards, it is a single line.  Once again, the most important question is why a double line was not considered.  Is the NTA going to have a feasibility study of the plan?<\/p> <p>  I do not know if my next point was raised earlier.  Councillor Sharon Tolan has highlighted the issue of fair fares and the 90-minute fare.  I ask the witnesses to address why an extension of the application of the fare outside Dublin was not considered.  I think some were asking for it to be extended for travel as far as Drogheda.  That particular issue has been raised in numerous areas.  In my capacity as a Deputy representing Limerick city, I must highlight that the Minister for Transport wrote to the NTA about the draft Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy, LSMATS.  Did he do anything similar with the greater Dublin area strategy?

I will continue from where I left off and acknowledge there are some positive freight measures.  I got caught up discussing rail freight and I want to discuss the last mile of freight or cargo delivery.  The strategy suggests that we should examine the feasibility of how we introduce those, which not only cuts down on emissions but improves road safety.  We should go further by identifying and tackling the barriers, and develop the incentives to have low-emissions cargo-bike-type freight last mile delivery.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is parking charges, which is quite extensively mentioned both in this and the previous document.  We know that low parking charges or free parking at workplaces and shopping centres encourage people to drive.  How does the NTA assess the benefits and where is the best place to introduce them?  <\/p> <p>  The Safe Routes to School programme is very positive and I know from the document that it was introduced in 2021.  Has the NTA identified the barriers to creating safe routes to school?  The strategy mentions: \"To accelerate the delivery of walking and cycling infrastructure\".  The delivery of safe cycling infrastructure encourages uptake and creates a safe route to school, not just cycling infrastructure, which we know has been quite poor in the past and, therefore, it is about creating segregated safe routes as much as possible.<\/p> <p>  I will review some of the answers.  I raised the issue of the timeframe and the witnesses said that in nine months there will be an implementation plan that sets out a six-year timeframe and give more detail on the delivery of projects.  How does the NTA decide what goes into the six-year plan?  Is that information set out anywhere?  What influences the authority's decision?  Is it emissions reduction, a modal shift or what gives the best return?  Is the information on the best return used by the authority to decide what to introduce first?  2030 is not far away and is getting closer the whole time but transport emissions are not reducing.  That aspect must be a guiding principle when it comes to the deciding the timeframe.  Similarly, with decide and provide.  There is induced demand when a road is built and it fills up with cars but the same is true for public or active transport.  As we have seen in many places, when infrastructure is built, demand is induced and it fills up pretty quickly.  It is difficult to accurately work out what is going to happen but we have seen enough examples to say that if infrastructure is built, people will use it.<\/p> <p>  On a further emissions reduction of 0.4 MtCO2eq, the witnesses mentioned that there are demand management measures required to reach the target of zero emissions.  After two years of the plan being passed and published, the NTA will introduce demand management measures to reduce the 0.4 MtCO2eq but how long will it take to introduce the measures?  I ask because these measures are critical but will not happen for two years, 2030 is looming and we will probably be into the next term of government.<\/p> <p>  Reference has been made to orbital movements for the N3 and N4 national roads.  I gather from what the witnesses have said that the measure facilitates car orbital movements.  Essentially, it is a road that will create more car use in the area.  If we have learned one thing from the way that we build roads is that they fill up with cars.  I understand why the NTA feels that there is a possible weak link on the M50 at the Liffey Valley Bridge and that traffic would be in chaos if an incident were to happen.  If that link road were to be used purely for public transport or active travel links and in the event that an incident happened on the M50, we could probably consider it more favourably but at the moment it is not something that I would favour or see as being required because it facilitates more car usage.<\/p> <p>  On page 136, there is a map of regional bus corridors and I think that the regional bus corridor ends where the page ends.  Where exactly does the regional bus corridor end or was it simply a case of fitting the map nicely on the page?  We talked about the Bray to Greystones rail service.  For years, I tried to get an assessment done in order to improve rail services or have electrified rail services to Wicklow but it was never in the strategy so it could not be accounted for in an N11 roads assessment.  Again, does the regional bus corridor go further than what is displayed on the map?  Is the map for indicative purposes or can one rely on it to show the actual bus corridor?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Leddin asked a question about electric bikes.  Of course, electric bikes will play a role but we need to reduce our long distance journeys by providing bus and rail services.  In addition, a high percentage of car journeys last between 4 km and 8 km.<\/p><p>We have made it convenient for people to jump in a car and to drive those short distances.  We must make it much more convenient and safer, in the context of e-bikes and scooters, for people to have the choice to go on safe infrastructure.  That is where we will get that modal shift.  We must assess what road infrastructure and road allocation will be required to put in that safe infrastructure to facilitate people to travel safely.  If we do that, then people will use those forms of transport.  It is a recommendation I suggest as well.  As Senator Horkan said, there is some good stuff in this document.  I wish we had seen something like this 20 years ago and that we could have implemented it.  We would be refining it even further now.  It is a very good document, though, and I thank the witnesses for presenting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062800002#O02300","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>Will Ms Graham deal with the issue of fairer fares and the distances involved?

The NTA has to do calculations on that but that scenario may arise.  How is the NTA continually reviewing this?  Will it review transferability or the ten-year rule?

There is no doubt that the drivers in the industry are not attracted to operate at night time between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m.  The maximum fare proposal that has been approved is set out to incentivise that by providing they will be paid at a higher rate for operating at peak hours, which are 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.  We hope that will encourage more drivers to operate at that time.  A number of supports are available for entrants to the industry.  We provide grants for the provision and conversion of vehicles to be wheelchair-accessible and now the e-SPSV grant as well.<\/p> <p>  On the public transport side, we are committed to providing additional bus services which operate on a 24-7 basis.  Our operators are struggling to provide the services they are contracted to operate at the moment.<\/p><p>While we can try to do as much as possible with the resources that are available to see if we can extend the working hours of our public transport services, we must be realistic about what driver resource is available to be able to do those additional 24-7 services.  However, they are built into the improvements in BusConnects.  One more 24-hour service was put in place recently, the N4, and there will be additional services provided this year.  We said we would look at the Nitelink bus services to see if we could extend them and have them operating more frequently.  We are also looking at the fares charged on Nitelink to see if we can encourage more usage of those services.  We will do as much as we can on the public transport side to provide for additional service and to provide for that additional demand as we grow and encourage the taxi market to grow and recover post Covid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062800002#Q02800","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656370800,"counter":625,"content":"<p>What timeline does the NRA envisage for the public transport piece and the taxi piece?
