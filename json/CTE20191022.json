Our guests have been invited to this meeting to update the committee on the progress of the plan, Harnessing Ireland's Ocean Wealth - An Integrated Marine Plan for Ireland.  The plan sets out two targets, namely, to exceed &euro;6.4 billion per annum in turnover from the maritime sector by 2020 and to double the sector's contribution to 2.4% of GDP per annum by 2030.  We have been made aware that since publication of the plan, two reports of interest were published this year.  Those are Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth: A Review of Progress 2018 and Ireland's Ocean Economy.  I understand that our guests will brief on these reports as well.

As mentioned by the Chairman, I am accompanied by Dr. Paul Connolly, the recently appointed chief executive office of the Marine Institute and colleagues from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Housing, Planning and Local Government and Communications, Climate Action and Environment, who represent some of the Departments who are on the MCG, which was established in 2009.  Dr. Connolly will also make some opening remarks.<\/p> <p>  The MCG is chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  However, given its cross-departmental nature, the Department of the Taoiseach has acted as convenor.  In addition to the relevant Departments, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Marine Institute also participate on the group.  The secretariat is provided by the MCG bureau in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  On the group&rsquo;s initiative there is also a marine affairs attach&eacute; based in Ireland&rsquo;s permanent representation in Brussels.  The attach&eacute; attends marine policy meetings and liaises with other EU member states, the European Commission and the European Parliament to influence policy on marine matters and to keep Departments informed of EU developments.  The marine attach&eacute; also partakes in MCG meetings. <\/p> <p>  The MCG provides a forum and focus for discussion and co-ordination of matters requiring interdepartmental action using a whole of Government approach.  It has led to some notable achievements in relation to collaboration, research and innovation in the marine area, including through Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth - An Integrated Marine Plan for Ireland, which was approved by Government and launched by the Taoiseach and the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in July 2012.  My colleague, Dr. Connolly, will take the committee through some of the achievements since the launch in his opening statement.<\/p> <p>  Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth sets out the Government&rsquo;s vision, high-level goals and key enabling actions to put in place the appropriate policy, governance and business climate to enable Ireland&rsquo;s marine potential to be realised.  It sets out ambitious targets for growing Ireland's marine economy, including as mentioned by the Chairman, to increase the turnover from our ocean economy to exceed &euro;6.4 billion by 2020 and to double the value of our ocean wealth to 2.4% of GDP by 2030.  The plan lays out a series of actions to be progressed by the relevant Departments and state agencies to help achieve these targets.<\/p> <p>  Since 2012, much of the work of the MCG at national level has been concerned with implementation of Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth by the relevant Departments and agencies.  Since 2014, the group has published a review of each year of progress, action by action, in respect of the implementation of the plan.  In addition, the group, through the Marine Institute, organises the Our Ocean Wealth Conference and the annual progress report which is published at the conference.  The conference brings together representatives from a wide range of relevant bodies, both public and private sector, to discuss marine related matters.  In tandem with the conference, the MCG has, since 2015, and again through the Marine Institute, organised SeaFest, Ireland&rsquo;s national annual maritime festival to involve the public more in marine matters and to showcase the extensive work that is being carried out in the sector.<\/p> <p>  The sixth annual review of progress of the plan was published in June 2019.  It provides an overview of the main activities across a range of actions undertaken by Departments and bodies in relation to the marine in 2018.   It also captures major deliverables for 2019.  Over the past seven years the plan has led to improved cross-Government communication and engagement, facilitating the delivery of economic, environmental and societal policies and plans in the marine area.  Key enabling architecture is also being put in place to further imbed this process, including, the national marine planning policy statement, the national marine planning framework, the Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2019 and the Marine Planning Development Management Bill 2019.<\/p> <p>  This months, the Government approved the publication of the marine planning policy statement, MPPS, which outlines a vision for the future development of the marine system, setting out overarching policies, principles and high-level priorities. The Government also approved the draft national marine planning framework, the forward planning system to manage Ireland&rsquo;s vast marine resource described in the policy statement.  Following an ongoing consultation period to the end of the year, preparation of the final framework will begin in early 2020.  It is intended that the final framework will be published in mid-2020 and it will provide strategic guidance for decision-makers across the marine space.  It is an important step for Ireland in realising the vision set out by Government in Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth.  The group also continues its cross-departmental work with a view to ensuring individual Departments and their associated agencies continue a coherent approach to policies and strategies that come within their remit in relation to the marine area.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to Dr. Connolly of the Marine Institute, who will set out in greater detail the progress made to date in the implementation of Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019102200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Shaw"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I, too, thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to brief the committee on progress in regard to Ireland's integrated marine plan, Harnessing Ireland's Ocean Wealth.  I will outline the key achievements since the launch of the Government&rsquo;s plan in 2012 and set the context of the plan in regard to the global ocean economy and the EU ocean economy.  The plan sets two ambitious economic targets, namely, to double the value of the ocean wealth to 2.4% of GDP by 2030 - we are now at 2.1% - and to increase the turnover of the ocean economy to exceed &euro;6.4 billion per annum by 2020, in respect of which we are now at &euro;6.2 billion.<\/p><p>The global ocean economy is composed of a diverse set of activities, which we have grouped into six categories.  The first is bioresources and food, which includes sea fisheries, aquaculture and seafood processing; energy, which includes offshore oil and gas exploration and production, marine renewables, offshore - wind, wave and tidal; tourism, which includes tourism and leisure activities; transport, which includes shipping, maritime transport, shipbuilding and maritime commerce; marine support activities and; high-tech products.<\/p><p> In terms of the global and European contexts, the global ocean economy accounts for the direct employment of approximately 31 million, of which fisheries accounts for 33%, and tourism for 25%.  The OECD estimates that the value of the global oceans economy is approximately US$1.5 trillion, approximately 2.5% of global gross value added, GVA.  The European Union produced its first report on the ocean economy in 2018 and the latest report produced this year reported that the most significant expansion and growth in the blue economy was in Malta and in Ireland.  The consensus is that there is a bright future for the blue economy.  The success is driven by many established and emerging innovative Irish businesses, facilitated by the ongoing work of the Marine Co-ordination Group.  The OECD has forecast that the global ocean economy will double in size by 2030 to &euro;3 trillion.  Many marine segments are set to grow fast in the world economy, including aquaculture, fish processing, offshore wind, and port activities.  Employment is set to reach 40 million, outpacing overall growth of the global labour force.  The high growth across ocean industries will encounter considerable challenges in relation to climate change, regulation and diverse demands on natural resources.  In terms of targets set out in Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth, as I stated previously, two ambitious targets were set by the Government.  They were to double the value of our ocean wealth to 2.4% of GDP by 2030 and to increase the turnover from the ocean economy to exceed &euro;6.4 billion by 2020.  The 2020 target of &euro;6.4 billion may be exceeded and we are moving in the right direction towards the 2030 target.<\/p><p> Detailed figures on Ireland's ocean economy are available in the Socio-Economic Marine Research Unit, SEMRU, report.  SEMRU is based in NUI Galway.  It produces a detailed report every year on the figures relating to the blue economy.  The latest report was published in June 2019 at SeaFest, which was held in Cork, and showed turnover to be &euro;6.23 billion, which is very close to our target for 2020 of &euro;6.4 billion.  In terms of trends from 2016 to 2018, we have had a 13% increase in turnover, an 11% increase in GVA and national growth is estimated at 10%.  There has been a 13% increase in employment.  The national employment growth rate is 3%, which means the marine sector is outpacing national employment growth.  Established sectors in the marine economy account for 93% of the ocean economy.  These sectors increased turnover by 12%.  In emerging sectors the turnover increased by 20%, which is 12% direct GVA.<\/p><p> I will go into a bit more detail from the SEMRU report on Ireland's ocean economy in relation to the general economy.  While growth in the Irish economy from 2014 to 2016 was approximately 16%, the ocean economy grew by 33%.  GVA growth rates in Ireland's ocean economy was 11%, while it was 10% in the normal economy in the same period.  In terms of the indirect impact, there is an indirect GVA of &euro;1.96 billion in 2018, giving a total GVA, direct and indirect, of &euro;4.19 billion, which represents 2% of GDP.  The next two figures really show what has been happening.  In terms of turnover, for every &euro;100 turnover in Ireland's ocean economy, a further &euro;78 is created in other sectors as a knock-on effect.  In terms of employment, for every 100 marine jobs a further 75 jobs are created indirectly in other parts of the Irish economy.  Established industries in Ireland's ocean economy account for 93% of total marine turnover.  This category is dominated by shipping and maritime transport, as well as tourism and leisure in marine and coastal areas.  Shipping and maritime transport continue to be the largest contributor in terms of turnover and value added.  Tourism and leisure is the largest contributor with regard to employment.<\/p><p> In emerging industries, marine advanced technology and marine commerce make the largest contribution in terms of turnover and value added.  Marine advanced technology products and services, along with the marine biotechnology sector, are also important players.  Full details of the trends and economic outlook for all the figures I have given, and additional detail, are provided in the NUI Galway report published in June 2019.<\/p><p> I will now move to another few important topics that are outlined in the document that was circulated.  The rural and regional significance of Ireland's ocean and coastal communities is well known.  Further research is under way in NUI Galway, funded by the Marine Institute.  We are looking further into the figures in that regard.  BIM has highlighted the importance of fishing and aquaculture to coastal fishing communities.  It will be an important aspect of marine planning into the future.<\/p><p> I will now refer to key cross-Government announcements and progress since the launch of Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth.  As mentioned in the opening statement, the implementation of Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth requires an integrated approach across the Government.  While individual Departments and agencies continue to implement and develop new policies and strategies that often transverse the marine, a number of specific integrated and cross-Government actions were identified in the plan.  Ms Maria Graham from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government can respond to any questions on the marine planning framework for Ireland.<\/p><p> I wish to pick three specific areas relating to the past seven years of Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth where there have been great strides forward.  The first is marine research and innovation.  Ireland's national marine research and innovation strategy was launched by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, in June 2017.  The strategy provides a framework for the funding of marine research that can be targeted most effectively to areas of strategic importance.  Key to implementation of the strategy is the establishment of cross-Government implementation structures.  All the agencies involved in funding the marine are coming together to discuss the strategic direction under the auspices of the marine research funders forum.  There is also the marine infrastructure providers forum.  All the available marine infrastructure in this country in the various universities and agencies is now discussed and catalogued.  That is very important for future marine research in terms of identifying gap areas.  Those fora, which were established in 2018 are facilitating co-operation and enhanced co-ordination between the national and regional research funding agencies.  Recent analysis on investment by the State and the EU that are aligned to the marine research and innovation strategy show that more than &euro;210 million has been awarded or won by the Irish marine research community.  That includes more than &euro;84 million from the EU research budgets, Horizon 2020 and INTERREG funding.  The State continues to invest in key national marine infrastructural investments.  Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, has invested in the MaREI research centre in Cork.  The national research vessel fleet will be augmented by a new vessel.  SFI has also invested in the national test facilities for marine renewable energy and seafood innovation as well as building capacity and capability in climate and ocean forecasting.<\/p><p>Following the publication of the marine co-ordination group development task force report in 2015, a number of targeted business development activities and cross-sectoral events and activities are being progressed.  These include promoting marine capabilities in Irish small and medium size enterprises, SMEs, as well as attracting new marine businesses to Ireland.  P&aacute;irc na Mara, a new marine innovation park under development in Cill Chiar&aacute;in in the Connemara Gaeltacht of County Galway, is an important multi-agency initiative led by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The master plan for P&aacute;irc na Mara will enable &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and its partners to develop an internationally recognised development facility that will act as a catalyst to co-ordinate and drive the growth of the marine sector and attract public and private sector investment in support of marine technology, innovation, commercialisation and business development.  Specifically, it will deliver infrastructure and services which will translate research, technology, development and innovation potential into new products and services, targeting new international markets, increasing levels of innovation, research, commercialisation and new enterprise formation. <\/p><p> On international collaboration, Ireland continues to be a strong influence in the development and implementation of EU maritime policy, strategies and programmes building on the existing relationships with the EU institutions such as the European Parliament, the European Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and European Commission services across a range of Directorates General.  Key to this work is the permanent diplomatic post dedicated to maritime affairs within Ireland's Permanent Representation to the European Union in Brussels. The Brussels-based maritime attach&eacute; role, working on behalf of the marine co-ordination group, ensures that Ireland is centrally placed to influence the development and implementation of maritime policy as well as promote and champion its national marine sector.<\/p><p> In recent years, Ireland has been central to the development and implementation of the EU Atlantic strategy and the associated action plan.  This includes the implementation of the Galway statement, which sees Ireland via the Marine Institute in a central co-ordinating role in supporting the Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance, which an alliance between the EU, US and Canada. <\/p><p> The United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030 will provide a common framework to ensure that ocean science can fully support countries' actions to sustainably manage the oceans and, more particularly, to achieve the agenda for sustainable development by 2030.  Planning and implementation of the decade is being co-ordinated by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, on which Ireland is represented by the Marine Institute.  The UN decade of the ocean, which will start in 2021, will look at the science for sustainable oceans.  It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to deliver scientific knowledge, foster technological innovation and build capacity to achieve the 2030 agenda and reverse the decline in ocean health.  That concludes my remarks on the statement on progress made on harnessing our ocean wealth and ancillary items relating to harnessing our ocean wealth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019102200002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their very detailed presentation regarding our ocean wealth and the work done with regard to it.  There was very little mention of climate change in it.  It was only mentioned three times.  Surely climate change will be a major factor in terms of what we do with our ocean wealth.  Where are the figures in the meetings and discussions?  How do the witnesses believe they can work as part of an overall Government plan?  Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth seems to be working and the climate change agenda could do with the same set-up that works so well with Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth.  How do the witnesses see this working?  It seems a bit tiresome to say this at this stage but what happens to our oceans will bring about a substantial change for the rest of the country and the rest of the world, regardless of what we do.  For this reason, we need to address it and factor it in to all aspects of government and everything government does.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Shaw spoke referred to the Marine Planning and Development Management Bill.  How is that working in co-ordination?  In terms of developing offshore wind energy in the Irish Sea, we need the foreshore development Bill to be passed.  It has been recognised for years that this legislation is needed.  What is happening with that?  What can the marine co-ordination group do to move it forward?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Beamish probably knows that a large number of Killybegs-based fishermen working in countries such as Germany and the UK on offshore facilities because they are highly qualified.  When the boats are tied up in Killybegs, they are away working in Europe, yet there is nowhere in Ireland for them to work.  We cannot harness our own expertise, including our boat-building expertise.  We cannot build our own boats that would facilitate these offshore wind energy developments.  This is something that could be done in Ireland because we have information, technology and boat-building facilities.  We should be gearing up for it.  We have the personnel, who are highly sought after in Europe, but there is no work for them here.  That is something we could gear up for.<\/p> <p>  Where is the fishing community factored in with regard to the overall wealth the witnesses say is generated?  How do the growth and wealth figures break down in terms of fishing and the marine?  I imagine a significant part of that is probably sea transport.

Now that the Government has a new climate action plan, many of the actions in it will probably feature more prominently in Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth.  It will be necessary to produce a new or updated plan because the existing one finishes in 2020.  I expect that climate action will feature prominently in the next round, perhaps more prominently than it features in the current version.  There are objectives in the forthcoming national marine planning framework that relate specifically to climate action.  Ms Graham can talk more about that planning framework and the Marine Planning and Development Management Bill.  Some of the heads of this Bill have been published while other heads to facilitate offshore wind energy will be published very shortly.  That work is well advanced and involves very intensive cross-departmental work to try to get the legislation over the line as quickly as possible.

As Mr. Shaw stated, it was recently finalised by the Government and will be published shortly.  One of the aspects of the statement is that marine planning will facilitate Ireland's transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy.  That is now one of our principles of marine planning.  The national marine planning framework is a way of bringing together everyone involved in the marine area to allow for the particular context in which planning happens in this area.  It is largely around co-existence.  It is not like land planning because there can be multiple uses in the same area.  One needs a framework for that collaboration.  We will publish it for consultation shortly.  A baseline report was produced and a marine advisory group established.  Its membership is quite diverse, with representation of energy, offshore and fishing interests, including the Killybegs Fishermens Organisation, such that we get the views of environmentalists and the tourism industry.  We are getting widespread input into the many uses of our marine resources.<\/p><p> The next level of implementation is having a planning system that works for consent within the marine area and that is where the replacement of the current foreshore arrangement comes into play.  As Mr. Shaw stated, we have been working intensively on that and have a legislative group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The consents largely fall between us and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.  In addition to giving consent for people to seek leave to undertake development activities, the anticipated regime will move the issue of consent to local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Local authorities, particularly those in coastal areas, have very much embraced it because, as Dr. Connolly stated, the marine economy is very important for rural and coastal locations.<\/p><p> As Mr. Shaw pointed out, the general scheme of the Bill, to the extent that it has been developed so far, is available on the website of the Department.  It is expected to undergo scrutiny at the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government in the near future.  There are several policy areas we are trying to conclude in order to have a fully formed discussion at that stage.  We are moving on apace with the Bill.  Its development also forms part of the climate action plan referred to by Mr. Shaw, particularly in terms of facilitating offshore renewable energy industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019102200002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>It will probably be the end of next year before the Bill is enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019102200002#O00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The drafting process is in train on the sections that have been published.

It will throw up considerable challenges.  For example, on seafood, we are witnessing changes in the distribution of fish stocks.  It could represent opportunities for new fish stocks coming in, but we do not know.  In that regard, we have set up new research to look at this more deeply, working closely with the industry.  Climate change is pivotal for the seafood sector.<\/p> <p>  We need to do more work in the context of climate action.  We need to look at the impacts of ocean acidification and temperature rises.  A far bigger issue is the prevalence of storm events and the impact that will have on coastal communities.  The ability of inshore fishermen to get out on the water will be reduced by storms.  We are doing is working with coastal communities on what they understand by climate change.  We have a project which links art and science because we found that coastal communities do not understand the concepts of climate change or adaptation.  They are confused by it all.

It was not an issue in the way it now is.  However, sustainability was, and always has been, a matter of concern.  Even the title of the integrated plan, Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth, shows it is underpinned by sustainability.  It was recognised that we were working towards Ireland trying to get more in terms of the marine, our understanding of marine resources, how we can manage them and what we can or cannot do.  That will be achieved by pulling together the various parts across the Government such that the whole adds up to more than the sum of the parts.  One of the underpinnings of the review of Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth was an attempt to better understand what we have.  The major integrated mapping for the sustainable development of Ireland's marine resource, INFOMAR, project which is mapping the seabed has been going on for many years and continues to receive funding.  A world-leading map has been developed of our resources.  That did not exist before this project, which ran in parallel with the harnessing our ocean wealth review.  We have carried out a variety of research projects to better understand our marine resources and how the marine functions because we cannot do anything on climate change unless we understand how it is going.<\/p> <p>  We developed the Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance because we cannot understand the Atlantic on our own.  Alliances were built with Canada, the United States and other EU member states in order to try to improve the total understanding of the mechanism of the Atlantic, which is vital to everything on this island.  The language was not about climate change but, rather, sustainability and researching and understanding the resource and its dynamics.  All of the fisheries research that has been done through the years has helped us to understand how to sustainably harvest that resource, but it has also given us indicators of climate change - canaries in the mine - which can be used to see how things are changing in the ocean as well as for managing the fisheries resources.  We have biological indicators of what is changing.  All of that provides a very strong bedrock for moving to climate action.<\/p><p>The work that has been done will provide a very strong foundation for the next phase of climate action and sustainable management of the resource.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019102200002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cecil Beamish","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Can we expect to see the language changing in the next plan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019102200002#P00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I want to add a specific piece to the response.

The issue with aquaculture is that the European Court of Justice ruled against Ireland.  Most aquaculture takes place in Natura 2000 sites and Ireland had a broad negative judgment against it regarding licensed activities in Natura 2000 sites that covered aquaculture.  The challenge was that no future licences could issue until a mechanism could be built to allow for compliant licensing with the Natura directives.  This required the gathering of data sets in a variety of environmental factors, such as mapping and the identification of scientific interest in Natura 2000 sites.  In many cases, this involves multi-year data on birds, mammals and other migratory elements operating in Natura 2000 sites.  No further licences could issue.  Detailed negotiations with the Commission went on for a long time on retaining the aquaculture in those Natura 2000 sites while the machinery and data were built up.  National legislation was put in place to allow the continuation on the existing licences of the aquaculture activities in those areas, pending a determination on future licence obligations.<\/p> <p>  A major data gathering exercise went on over three or four years in all of those areas and the National Parks and Wildlife Service identified the specific scientific interests in those Natura 2000 areas that were to be protected.  In 2012 and 2013, the first of the licences began to be produced in a way that met the compliance requirements for the Natura 2000 directives.  At that point the Minister committed, following a review of aquaculture licensing, to clear the backlog on the bulk of aquaculture licensing by the end of this year.  At this point, approximately 900 ministerial licence determinations have been made.  Last year, the Minister committed to making 300 licence determinations and he delivered these.  This is also the target for this year.  By the end of this year, all of the backlog on shellfish aquaculture licensing should be cleared.  There will always be new licences coming in but the backlog has built up as a result of the European Court of Justice judgment will be effectively cleared.<\/p> <p>  With regard to salmon farming, the salmon farming operators, who are much smaller in number, are working on environmental impact statements, which are an EU legal requirement before the licensing process can be advanced.  The main operators have asked for more time to complete these statements.<\/p><p>The main operators wanted the original deadlines to be extended so that they could get the environmental impact statements, EISs, completed.  It has been a long story.  It has meant that those who were operating could continue to operate within the terms of their licences.  However, the shellfish operators have now been determined, and their applications have been granted, not granted or amended.  By the end of this year, we hope that this will be a historical discussion.<\/p><p> The Department produced a national strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture development, setting targets out to 2023.  There is a seafood development programme in which there is a whole series of schemes to assist aquaculture development, and elements of shellfish aquaculture have been developing quite quickly.  It has to be done in a sustainable way, however, taking account of all the other users and interested parties because it is State property that is being provided to these farms.

It is tremendous for employment and is perhaps the only significant employer in the Fanad area.  Like other public representatives, I attended the company's 40th anniversary dinner last Saturday night.  The frustration among many of the workers is palpable in regard to the failure of the sector to develop and expand in regard to new licences and new capacity.  I was talking to some long-standing employees who have been there over 30 years and they recalled that, back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when they started working, some 6,000 tonnes of produce from the north Donegal area was being exported per year, whereas the figure nationally this year is around 6,000 tonnes.

I apologise to Mr. Shaw and Mr. Finucane who have heard this rant before.<\/p> <p>  I will specifically focus on the issue of offshore renewable energy and the potential off our coast.  Ireland has about 900,000 km2 of territorial waters, ten times the size of the island of Ireland.  In that territory, we have some of the best offshore renewable energy resources in the world.  The current Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has set a target of achieving 70% renewable electricity on our grid by 2030 which is a phenomenal ask.  The practical reality of that is that we have two options.  We either double the size of every single wind turbine in the country and double the number of wind farms on the island which covers about 0.3% of the total territory of Ireland and shoehorn massive wind farms and turbines into a very small area, particularly across the middle of the country, or we fully exploit the renewable energy we have off our coast.  <\/p> <p>  I ask Ms Graham where we are on putting a planning structure in place.  She says that she expects to have the legislation published by the end of the year.  Is that the maritime area and foreshore amendment Bill?  How confident is Ms Graham that we will have that?  The difficulty is that we have heard for the last five or six years that this was imminent, it would happen shortly, publication was moving along, yet here we are.  We are still waiting for a consent process to be put in place.  Until we have a consent process, it will be very hard to exploit the potential.  <\/p> <p>  For context, the potential of renewable energy off our coast, according to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is 50GW.  That is enough to supply France and Austria combined, let alone this small island.  There are great opportunities to reduce our carbon impact dramatically while also significantly reducing the cost of electricity to Irish consumers.  Unlike land-based wind turbines, the Irish taxpayers fully own the resource off our coast.  By optioning that we have the opportunity to fully exploit it in the interest of the country as a whole.  Does it not make more sense to establish an offshore renewable development authority which would drive this whole area in a fully co-ordinated national plan that would range in responsibility from research and development through to supply chain development and the commercial deployment of floating wind turbines off the coast?  That would have an impact on climate and the environment but would also put infrastructure in place and ensure that Ireland becomes the focal point for innovation and job creation in this sector, rather than importing constructed wind turbines from another part of Europe.  We have a golden opportunity to exploit that now.  We have some very fine ports.  My colleague, Deputy Harty, will discuss the opportunity in the Shannon estuary.  Unless we are prepared to fully exploit it, I am concerned that all we are doing is putting in place a planning authorisation mechanism which will facilitate international companies coming here and offshoring profits that should be held by the Irish taxpayer.  That is a big concern which many communities in my part of the country have about wind farms, leaving aside their appearance and the noise factor.  It is a fact that the profits are leaving the country and are not remaining in the communities.<\/p> <p>  In her presentation, Ms Graham said the planning consent process will move the decision making to local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I have great concerns about that.  Are we asking, say, Leitrim County Council to take responsibility for the offshore renewable resources it will have planning authorisation for while Donegal will have a significant amount, as will Mayo, Sligo and down along the coast?  One cannot have an inconsistency from Cork County Council to Leitrim County Council in terms of fully exploiting this.  There must be a standard position across the country.  It cannot be down to the particular view taken by a planner in Mayo County Council compared to one in Clare County Council.  That cannot be allowed to happen if we are going to fully exploit this.  A single authority must make the approval on this, whether it is An Bord Plean&aacute;la or some other body, not the individual local authorities.  We have already seen the difficulties in consistency across the country and we cannot have that in our offshore process.  I ask Ms Graham to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Finucane.  Where is the Atlantic marine energy test site off the Mayo coast at currently?  There were plans to look at installing floating wind turbines at that test site.  Has any progress been made?  To my knowledge, the only commercial deployment of floating wind turbines to date has been in Highwind in Scotland.  We have great opportunity here.  There have been some preliminary discussions about deployment off the west coast but are there any plans for this at the test site in Belmullet to see what opportunity we have with this?<\/p><p>Are there any plans to deploy them off the west coast at that test site in Belmullet to see what opportunity we have there?<\/p><p> On climate action, there are some things we can do well and there are others we will struggle with.  We are a small island off the coast of Europe.  Transport will be challenging and we are technology takers in that area.  Agriculture is another area.  The green agenda is trying to sacrifice the most carbon-efficient exporting country in Europe for beef, because beef farming makes up a big proportion of our overall emissions in Ireland.  We are probably one of the most carbon-efficient beef exporters in the world, and yet we are trying to sacrifice that industry, where we can offset a lot of our emissions with renewable energy.  We could supply that renewable energy to meet the targets and needs of Ireland as well as supplying a substantial amount of that energy into the European Union to reduce the overall carbon footprint right across Europe.  The potential is there but we must get the planning process in place quickly.  It has taken us six to seven years to get this far.  We need to see movements in months and weeks rather than in another six or seven years because the horse will have bolted at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019102200002#U00600","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned that when legislation was originally conceived of in this area, it was called the maritime area and foreshore (amendment) Bill.  It had a long and torturous process of development in terms of the legislative process within the planning framework.  A lot of planning and housing legislation had to be developed at the time and that also probably coincided with a period where the offshore renewable energy market was not developing in technological and financial capacity.  While we were taking applications within the foreshore current regime, they were not really being progressed.  We got to a stage of having a near final text around 2017.  That was subject to considerable legal scrutiny that brought up a number of issues.<\/p> <p>  At this standpoint looking back at it, I mention the complexities of developing in the marine space.  There are three different zones, namely, the foreshore - the 12 mile limit, the exclusive economic zone, and the continental shelf, all of which have different rules under the law of the sea.  One must look at legislation that dates from 1933 and at the raft of environmental legislation and other legislation that has developed in the interim.  In essence, the legal advice said we need to go back to first principles and see what we need to do.  That is what we have done and in so doing, our initial aim was to look at a level of streamlining within the maritime area and foreshore (amendment) Bill that involved coastal local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la and eliminated the duplication of environmental assessments.<\/p> <p>  Our ambition in streamlining is now much stronger.  We are looking at ensuring that, for the customers of this planning regime, there is a single common and consistent form of consent for dealing with offshore renewable energy or with other forms of development in the area.  That should be plan led rather than development led because we found, particularly with offshore developments, that we would have applications for an area which essentially froze that area if they did not go ahead.  It stopped other people who had the finances and the capacity to do it from looking from the same area.<\/p> <p>  A number of things are important in that context.  The work we have done has been a joint enterprise that is driven by the immediacy of needing to deal with offshore renewable energy in a climate action perspective.  That work has been done in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and with the benefit of the Department of An Taoiseach taking a strong role with the legislation.  In framing this and working on it, we have the advantage of looking at the marine spatial planning directive that has come out in the meantime, and we are implementing that through the national marine planning framework.  We have produced a planning policy statement that talks about the need to have a forward planning aspect and a development management aspect to our marine planning framework.  There have been revisions to the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive and there is a recast renewable energy directive.  We have had to take all of those things on board.<\/p> <p>  The Bill is now called the marine planning and development management Bill.  It has a section in it that covers the planning framework, similar to what we have on land with the national planning framework, NPF.  That section deals with how that forward planning aspect is done and then it deals with the issue of consent, of which the central piece is that central government will say, whether the development is for offshore renewable energy or otherwise, that it consents to the application to the development body, be that to the local authorities or to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I will come back to that element of it.  That consent to apply for planning permission is time-bound.  Then it comes back to the contracts because for any foreshore consent to apply, there are finances that come back to the State associated with giving out the leases involved.<\/p> <p>  That is the concept.  Drafting is ongoing and the general scheme has been published.  There are a number of policy areas we are working on and finalising.  Our target within the climate action plan is to have that Bill published by the end of the year.  The general scheme is available on our website.  We have to time the different pieces of the Bill around the pre-legislative scrutiny and then we will finalise the drafting.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy makes important points on the implementation of it and on the role of local authorities.  On larger components, we would see it as strategic infrastructure.  The board would directly deal with larger infrastructure projects.  Even with the other components, many of these things are in a new area, even marine spatial planning.  We have been talking to some of the universities because it is a developing skill as well.  We need to make sure there are shared resources.  Not only is consistency an issue, but there must be an availability of the appropriate resources within local authorities and within the board to roll out this regime.  Local authorities would look to share resources on a regional level.<\/p> <p>  The other component within the legislation is that we can produce statutory planning guidance in the same ways we can do on the terrestrial side.  For particular sectors, that would allow us to put in guidance, by which local authorities would have to be involved if necessary.  We would imagine the larger infrastructure projects would go the board.<\/p> <p>  I refer to enforcement.  Clearly, there is a loop that has to come in terms of ensuring we have a capacity to enforce it.  That is also dealt with in our planning policy statement in terms of the need for stronger enforcement within the marine area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019102200002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>On the climate action plan, as the Deputy said, it sets out a target for decarbonising our renewable electricity by aiming at achieving 70% renewable electricity by 2030.  While the plan looks at increasing the amount of wind capacity onshore, it also includes a significant offshore target.  There would be a minimum of 3.5 GW, which is 3,500 MW, of offshore development required to deliver that 2030 figure.  As the Deputy pointed out, it is getting more difficult to get planning consents and public community support for onshore projects.  As we find it increasingly difficult to deliver significant megawatts onshore, the amount of capacity we generate offshore is likely to go ahead at that target.<\/p><p>I think we are going to see a minimum of 3,500 MW delivered offshore by 2030.<\/p><p> Offshore projects require extensive economies of scale.  By their nature, they are big projects.  As Ms Graham pointed out, they are strategic infrastructure developments.  The minimum figure for a commercial offshore wind farm is likely to be several hundred megawatts.  An investment profile of 3,500 MW in the sea by 2030 envisages an overall minimum investment, including in the grid, of probably &euro;8 billion to &euro;10 billion by the time it is built.  This is a significant overall investment in Irish waters over a decade.<\/p><p> What are we likely to see in local communities?  Projects of this scale are big developments.  Typically, they tend to be too big, even for the big European infrastructure companies to build on their own.  Typically, we see such projects being built by a consortium of two or three companies.  Developments in the Irish market typically involve big European partners coming in as partners of Irish development companies.  We are likely to see a mix of developers.  Given the scale of investment, the expertise involved and the technical challenge in delivering, these big companies bring considerable experience.  Some have been involved in the offshore wind energy industry for a decade.  Considerable experience has been gained in markets throughout Europe.<\/p><p> We are working closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to ensure offshore renewable energy will feature front and centre in the planning structures in place.  It is a key cornerstone of freeing up that investment profile and allowing the projects to proceed.<\/p><p> We are also conscious of the fact that decarbonising our electricity supply means coming off coal at Moneypoint by 2025.  We will be coming off peat in the coming years too.  As a result, all of that capacity has to be dealt with.  The big offshore projects are important for us in the light of our ambitions.

That is vital to ensure they will benefit the economy.<\/p> <p>  Ms Graham made the point that in the past certain areas were frozen because development had not taken place.  Is Ms Graham concerned that we are still giving out exploration licences for areas off the coast and that it could have an impact in the development of renewable energy resources in the future?  We may find ourselves in the bizarre position of having to buy back these licences in order that we will not impede the development of potential offshore renewable resources.<\/p> <p>  Ms Graham made reference to planning guidance.

It is a challenge to achieve a figure of 2.5 gigawatts for offshore renewables.  If we do not achieve it, it will leave communities throughout the country that already have wind farms at a serious disadvantage.  They are likely to see a doubling in size of existing wind turbines.  It is unfair that they should have to carry the can for the failure to develop offshore renewable resources.

Seven or eight member states have shown that it is possible to develop offshore wind farms.  There is no valid reason, in the coming decade, we cannot proceed with that level of growth.  It is something we are confident we can do.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about demand targets.  He is correct in saying there is growth in demand forecast from economic factors such as data centres but also from demographics.

Certainly, it has been built into our calculations.  We are looking at demand.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about data centres.  They also provide a valuable service.  They constitute a baseload requirement for electricity at night-time.  It is typically at night-time that much of our wind energy is produced and we have challenges in curtailing and constraining it.  The data centres provide a valuable service in balancing demand.  The challenge for us in taking on big amounts in terms of intermittency is really at evening peak time.  It is in the three hours between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.that the demand for electricity is at its highest.  That is when the challenge presents.

Following Deputy Naughten's questions, my question concerns offshore marine renewable energy development, particularly at Moneypoint power station.  As we know, Moneypoint must cease operating by 2025.  It has already almost ceased electricity production except in exceptional circumstances.  There will be job losses at Moneypoint.  The workforce is being reduced by 50% as we speak.  A &euro;5 million just transition proposal has been included in this year's budget.  It targets the peat-burning stations in the midlands.  The Taoiseach confirmed to me this afternoon that there will be a similar fund for Moneypoint, hopefully in the near future.  Given our target of 70% dependence on renewable energy by 2030, the potential for that offshore wind development in Moneypoint is substantial.  It has two things going for it.  It has one of the deepest seaports in Europe and it also has the transmission infrastructure with two 400 MW lines radiating across the country.<\/p> <p>  Ms Graham mentioned strategic marine activity zones.  Does she see Moneypoint as one such potential zone?  It combines potential wind energy generation off the coast of Clare, tidal potential in the River Shannon, wave energy potential and the necessary infrastructure.  It also has the port.  The port would be very important if Moneypoint was designated as a centre for wind energy research and development.  There is great potential for Moneypoint to be used as a place to manufacture wind turbines rather than importing them.  As it is a port, it could also be used as to service wind turbines off the west coast.  As I say, the transmission potential is already there.  I think Moneypoint produces 900 MW per year.  Where does Ms Graham see Moneypoint fitting into the strategic development of offshore wind? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019102200002#X00700","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>To clarify, I am dealing with the planning framework that facilitates that.

It is already suffering from reduced running in the market, largely due to the price of carbon and the emissions trading system, ETS, which is making coal uncompetitive in the wholesale market.  There are just transition proposals in place.  As the Deputy notes, the budget outlined one for the midlands.  Ireland was accepted as a member of the European coal transition platform earlier this summer.  We are in the process of engaging actively with several Directorates General of the European Commission to set up the EU country team which will engage with different Departments and local authorities in Ireland to assist with planning the just transition process.<\/p> <p>  The target is 70% dependence on renewable energy by 2030.  There is certainly potential for future generation at the Moneypoint site.  The company is looking at options for the future development of the site.  It has huge advantages.  The two 400 MW lines are by far the biggest lines crossing the country.  They are very valuable. <\/p> <p>  The existing offshore fixed-pile turbine technology is likely to develop on the east coast because of the depth of the water.  They are traditionally the most competitive technologies.  At present they are typically deployed in waters of up to 50 m in depth.  The west coast is likely to see the next wave of offshore technology, the floating turbines Deputy Naughten referred to earlier.  They can operate in deeper waters and with much larger individual turbines.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Harty asked about the capacity to develop a manufacturing centre for turbines.  The necessary land is certainly there, but whether to do so would be a commercial decision for a company.  I should point out that turbine manufacturers have struggled to find the scale to operate even in bigger markets such as the UK.  It would be economically challenging to manufacture turbines at Moneypoint.  There are certainly terrific research and development opportunities there given the range of opportunities for tidal technology, particularly wave energy and floating offshore platforms on the west coast.  Using the capacity there for research is certainly one option.  The ESB, which currently operates Moneypoint, operated WestWave, a big wave energy research project in that area until several years ago.  There is some relevant experience on the site or very near to it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019102200002#X00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Finucane"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>What capacity issues emerged in the UK?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019102200002#X01000","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>They concerned the economies of scale required to keep a turbine blade factory going 365 days a year, even with a market as large as the UK.

It was of concern to the committee that, in speaking to the young people about the roads that they took in consideration of apprenticeships and skills, apprenticeships were lacking a parity of esteem with third level universities and colleges.  This is something we had come across before so we thought it was important to look at that, have a discussion and see how, as a committee, we can help and what recommendations we can make to the Minister to ensure that apprenticeships and skills are taken seriously.<\/p> <p>  I know that Senator Ruane has left to speak in the Seanad so I was given apologies on her behalf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019102200002#G00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>She will be back in three or four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019102200002#G00300","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p><p>I welcome Mr. Andrew Brownlee, chief executive office of SOLAS, who was with us on the day representatives from WorldSkills were before the committee.

I know the committee is very interested in apprenticeship and has been a consistent supporter of its promotion and expansion. I also note the publication of the report last month by the committee on the uptake of apprenticeships and traineeships.<br\/><br\/>As the committee is aware, SOLAS is an agency of the Department of Education and Skills with responsibility for funding, planning and co-ordinating further education and training in Ireland.  We also have statutory responsibility for the national apprenticeship system which spans further and higher education, as well as supporting further education and training provided by sixteen education and training boards, ETBs, around the country.  As we enter the final quarter of 2019, we are almost four years into a five-year action plan to expand national apprenticeship provision and to establish apprenticeships as a major route to skills development in Ireland.  The committee will be aware that the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship 2016-2020, set a cumulative target of 31,000 apprentice registrations by the end of 2020, along with annual registration targets and targets for new apprenticeship programme development.  In May of this year, a review of progress on the action plan got under way, with the aim of developing a new action plan post 2020.  Employers were the first stakeholder group who were met at a dedicated session hosted by the Apprenticeship Council in May 2019 with the Minister of State with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor, in attendance. The note of this meeting is attached with this statement for the information of the committee.  Each of the action points from this meeting is being implemented.<br\/><br\/>Since 2016, there has been a cumulative total of 18,763 apprentice registrations.  Fifty-four apprenticeship programmes are now operational, which is more than double the number of programmes four years ago.  Apprenticeships span 12 industry areas, including information and computer technology, ICT, finance, engineering, logistics and supply chain, biopharma, auctioneering, construction, motor mechanics, electrical, hairdressing, retail and hospitality.  The 54 programmes lead to a range of awards on the National Framework of Qualifications, NFQ, from level 5 to level 9.  The number of registrations on craft apprenticeships has continued to increase in 2019 and forecasts are strong for 2020, particularly in the construction-related areas of electrical, plumbing, carpentry and joinery.<br\/><br\/>Despite this growth in registrations and the number of participating employers, the committee will be aware that the take-up of new apprenticeship opportunities by employers has been slower than envisaged.  Nevertheless, the numbers of employers hiring apprentices on the new apprenticeship programmes is increasing with a total of 540 employers in 2018 compared to 947 as of September 2019.  A further 23 new apprenticeship programmes are in development and are due to be launched in 2020.  These new programmes will include training for the occupations of recruitment executive, sales specialists, advanced healthcare assistant and quantity surveyor, and will lead to awards at levels 5 to 10 on the NFQ.  Table 3 in the appendix lists the apprenticeships in development and the planned date for their launch.<br\/><br\/>To support apprenticeship expansion, the Government, assisted by additional contributions from employers to the National Training Fund, has committed additional resources to apprenticeship, where &euro;27 million has been signalled for budget 2020, a tangible commitment at a time when the uncertainty around Brexit has required diversion of substantial resources to help Ireland manage the coming months and when there are many competing demands for investment in education and training.<br\/><br\/>Two key events for apprenticeship in Ireland in 2019 were Ireland Skills Live, which took place in the RDS in March 2019, and the WorldSkills competition, which took place in Kazan in August 2019.  Both were highly successful, with Ireland Skills Live putting apprenticeship and skills development on the map nationally in a way that had not been done before.  Through close collaboration, Generation Apprenticeship and Ireland Skills Live succeeded in creating a powerful and coherent message about the opportunities in apprenticeship and work-based learning for school leavers, parents, teachers and older learners, including career changers.  Ireland brought home 12 awards from the 2019 WorldSkills competition, which resulted in the country being placed tenth in the world, out of 64 countries.  Planning is now under way for Ireland Skills Live 2020.<br\/><br\/>The national Apprenticeship Council, which is chaired by Mr. Pat O&rsquo;Doherty, chief executive of ESB, has been steering the expansion project and overseeing initiatives to support the uptake of apprenticeships by both employers and potential apprentices since late 2014.  The council comprises industry and social partner representatives, the Department of Education and Skills, SOLAS, the HEA, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI,  and the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA.<br\/><br\/>As noted by the committee in its report and recommendations, promotion of apprenticeship opportunities to employers to encourage wider take-up is a key focus for the council in 2019.  To support this, the strategic communications campaign, namely, Generation Apprenticeship, has been stepped up.  As well as strong branding, public relations, online and media campaigns across print, online, TV, radio and social media by all partners around the country, this campaign also features an innovative Generation Apprenticeship team competition for apprentices where, through creation of a six-foot, three-dimensional &quot;A&quot;, they showcase the leadership, teamwork, creativity and problem-solving skills, as well as the technical skills developed via apprenticeship.  Following two years of the competition,16 of these six-foot &quot;A&quot;s are on display in high-profile locations around the country.<br\/><br\/>To engage in a novel way with second level students, and in particular transition year learners, the Generation Apprenticeship competition is expanding this year to second level schools, Youthreach and community training centres.  There is extensive and broad-based participation across the country, with guidance counsellors and teachers of all subject areas getting involved with learner teams.  Generation Apprenticeship has a particular employer focus in 2019, with a target of 1,500 new apprenticeship employers by year-end.  A national employer ambassadors initiative is under way, to which 28 employers have signed up.  On 26 September in the Aviva Stadium, a large-scale showcase of apprenticeship opportunities and an apprentice employer fair, with over 500 people in attendance, took place.<br\/><br\/>The focus on employers stems from the awareness the Apprenticeship Council has of the challenge to grow the numbers of employers involved in apprenticeship programmes introduced since 2016.  In these new programmes, the number of potential apprentices applying for apprenticeships is far higher than the number of employers available to employ them.  For example, in the case of the tech apprenticeships during 2019, there were more than 1,500 applications for 34 apprentice jobs in the Civil Service.  In the case of accounting technicians apprenticeship, each year there has been on average three applications for every available job.<br\/><br\/>To enhance the visibility and accessibility of apprenticeship job vacancies, and to assist small companies to advertise apprenticeship jobs to a wide audience, an apprenticeship jobs platform was launched on <i>www.apprenticeship.ie<\/i>in April 2019.  The platform enables approved apprenticeship employers to post apprenticeship jobs for free.  It also provides employer access to a range of data and information on their current apprentices that previously was only available via letter and the post.  The platform is building traction month-on-month, with 388 employers now registered on the site and 74 job vacancies posted to date in 2019.  <br\/><br\/>The technology underpinning the national apprenticeship system is being transformed, with an online facility for approval of new apprenticeship employers due to be launched in October 2019, followed by an online facility for registration of apprentices in early 2020.  These will modernise and streamline the core administrative processes that underpin apprenticeship, which has been flagged in the report.<br\/><br\/>National apprenticeships play an important role in driving and promoting sustainability and helping to halt climate change.  Updated apprenticeship curricula in construction-related areas in particular include content, skills development, materials and technologies that are climate-friendly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019102200002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Brownlee"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I have given Mr. Brownlee three-times the amount of time allotted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019102200002#H00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Alongside the review of progress since 2016 and planning post 2020, a priority area for progress over the next 15 months in apprenticeship expansion is to secure a much broader base of employers using apprenticeships as a pipeline of talent.

I was told I have six minutes and I will try to keep it within that timeline.<\/p><p>I thank the committee for its invitation.  I am here to talk about the role of guidance counsellors in schools in promoting apprenticeships as a viable route to further education and training.  I am delighted to have the opportunity, in the words of Tracy Chapman, to &ldquo;tell it like it is.&rdquo;  In last decade industry has not engaged with guidance counsellors in the way it used to in the past.  In sharp contrast, all colleges provide comprehensive information on their courses for our members annually.  Thanks to an IGC initiative and the labour market stakeholders who answered our call last year, guidance counsellors are knowledgeable about skill shortages and new initiatives in the area of apprenticeships and traineeships.<br\/><br\/>During the review of guidance l was surprised to hear stakeholders criticise our members for not promoting apprenticeships.  I knew a lot of good work was happening on the ground but also recognised that our members had been under a lot of pressure since the cuts in 2012 when we had lost 25% of our guidance allocation.  In the autumn of 2018 I reached out to our labour market stakeholders and approached SOLAS, with a view to joining forces to deliver continuous professional development, CPD, programmes to over 1,300 guidance counsellors nationwide.  Ms Maria Walsh from SOLAS was instrumental in helping me to kick-start my vision to bring labour market information on CPD to guidance counsellors.  I invited the major labour market stakeholders in Ireland to collaborate with the IGC to deliver a joint CPD initiative focused on skill shortages and new initiatives in the area of apprenticeships and traineeships.  The up-to-date CPD programme was developed by the IGC in collaboration with SOLAS, Future Skills, the institutes of technology, all education and training boards, ETBs, local employers and apprenticeship providers, including the Electricity Supply Board, ESB; the Construction Industry Federation, CIF; Accounting Technicians Ireland, ATI, and CareersPortal.  These eight labour market stakeholders have travelled the length and breadth of the country to deliver the CPD programme to our members.  We have nine branches complete and the remaining seven are booked for this year.  The tenth, in Kilkenny, is taking place today.  Thanks to this CPD programme, guidance counsellors in all 16 branches will ultimately be equipped with cutting-edge information on labour market skill shortages, apprenticeships and traineeships.  The information is bespoke to each individual IGC branch.  It is in PowerPoint presentation form and can be communicated to students through one-to-one appointments, in class and to parents during annual presentations.  Furthermore, at CPD events, guidance counsellors are afforded the opportunity to network with labour market stakeholders and invite them to their schools to deliver careers talks and to liaise with local employers to set up appropriate work placements for their students.  Already, participating apprenticeship providers have reported that they are visiting schools more frequently at the invitation of the guidance counsellors who attended the CPD programme.  Guidance counsellors are once again knowledgeable about skill shortages.  The remaining obstacles facing guidance counsellors who wish to acquaint their students about the advantages of pursuing apprenticeships are a lack of time, inadequate access and parental prejudice.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of time, the ICG argues that for students who are predominantly kinaesthetic learners, the traditional learning experience which still dominates second level education can be soul destroying.  These students typically excel in hands-on, practical learning.  If they become switched off at school and have no one to join the dots for them, they are in danger of not signing up for apprenticeships.  In many schools the guidance counsellor&rsquo;s first opportunity to interact with students on an individual basis is in fifth year but by then it is too late to retain or influence disenchanted students.  We need timely, one-to-one access to students to identify potential apprenticeships at the very latest by third year but ideally in first year.  For this to happen, we need a return to the ex-quota guidance allocation system and the pre-2012 circular on allocations.  We also need a guidance allocation ring-fenced for apprenticeships that will enable us to adequately support new apprenticeships and traineeships.  We are spread too thinly, with 64% of our members dealing with mental health issues on a daily basis.  The 2019 action plan for education committed to reintroducing and enhancing guidance counselling in second level schools.  When will the Department deliver on this promise?<br\/><br\/>The Adult Education Guidance Association, AEGA, called for a suitable process for adult learners to sign up to an apprenticeship in its Future and Emerging Technologies, FET, submission.  In the evaluations of the national roll-out of labour market information on CPD our members are calling for a full day of CPD on an annual basis.  Last year the four managerial bodies demonstrated their support by releasing our members for one full day to attend the prototype of the CPD programme in Combilift, County Monaghan.  The event was attended by guidance counsellors who had travelled from the four corners of the country.  It is our further recommendation that time be allotted at future IGC labour market information CPD events to present to parents and communicate to them the wide range of apprenticeships available, with almost 60 currently on offer.  We also want to explain to parents how apprentices earn as they learn, how much they earn, that apprenticeships suit smart people, that there are eight learning styles and that different apprenticeships suit different students.  It is also important for parents to know that apprentices go to college as part of their training and can proceed to level nine courses if they demonstrate the ability and interest to do so.<br\/><br\/>At a recent ETB conference I flagged an input on apprenticeships for the National Parents Council Post Primary, NCPPP, in which it was very interested.  The de-stigmatising of apprenticeships is essential to ensure buy-in from parents.  Our members are frustrated because they are identifying potential apprentices in school and bringing in employers to address them at career events only to find that some parents are preventing their children from attending the talks.  Can we work together to facilitate a space in which qualified apprentices can describe their positive experiences directly to parents? <br\/><br\/>I draw attention to some of  the IGC's recommendations. <b><\/b>We need practical support from policy makers to put in place the scaffolding to support the IGC's labour market information on CPD in order that it will continue after my term of office ends.  A more structured policy-driven approach is needed to ensure students will be accessing good quality, appropriate and safe work experience that is meaningful and focused on skills attainment during senior cycle in second level schools.  Incentives such as the provision of tax breaks could be used to encourage small employers to take on apprentices.  <br\/><br\/>I will finish by again quoting Tracy Chapman: &ldquo;What breaks your heart, What keeps you awake at night, What makes you want to break down and cry.&rdquo;  For over 1,300 guidance counsellors, it is to walk past students who need their guidance counselling expertise on their way to teach French or business, to have the skills and the smarts to solve their problems and not be allocated adequate time to do the job they are qualified and have been trained to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019102200002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Beatrice Dooley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dooley.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019102200002#J00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I apologise, but I must leave to vote in the Seanad.

As a former secondary school teacher, I am very interested in this issue.  I worked in a DEIS school which offered a leaving certificate applied programme to children who were very suited to apprenticeships.  Sometimes I believe the success that can lie ahead for those who pursue apprenticeships is not widely known and that that message is not being delivered.  Instead of saying students can do this instead of going there, we need to tell them that there is a really successful path ahead for them if they pursue it.  Encouragement is needed.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. Brownlee and probably obvious, given that I am a Green Party Deputy.  I am particularly aware of the need for an increase in the number of apprenticeships in retrofitting, energy efficiency measures and so on.  There is a huge body of work to be done to bring our homes up to the standards required, make them warmer, healthier and improve our quality of life.  As things stand, it is my understanding a lot of the training in retrofitting and renovation and acquiring energy efficiency skills happens outside Ireland.  Last week I was chatting to a housing expert who emphasised two very interesting points about the lack of skills training in Ireland.  He said that with the revisions to the leaving certificate construction studies course, many students on leaving school who had taken the course were particularly well equipped to deal with many of the newer, greener aspects of construction than people who had been working in the area for decades.  He also said that, fundamentally, the big thing that was missing in incentivising students to pursue green skills apprenticeships was job certainty once they finished their studies.  While I welcome the focus on sustainability across all aspects of apprenticeships, what actions can be taken in particular areas such as retrofitting and renovation to encourage more participation and a greater uptake?<\/p><p>Currently, building standards are abysmal, under-regulated and under-inspected.  There is a severe lack of trained professionals to do the work required.  What supports are needed from across Government, not just from the Department of Education and Skills but also from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, to ensure that we will be in a position to provide these skills and encourage people to pick them up?<br\/><br\/>I was delighted to see an almost tenfold increase in the number of women taking up apprenticeships since 2016.  It is fantastic to see that because we need to ensure diverse engagement with apprenticeship.  I was here for the WorldSkills event a few weeks ago.  The committee was delighted to see it.  They are such fine young ambassadors and are so successful on that world stage for us.  It is inspirational when they come here.  I was fascinated by some of the roles.  There was one young lady in freight forwarding and logistics.  She mentioned that she would never have come across the role as a possible job if she had not accidentally stumbled across it.  How do we highlight the broad range of apprenticeships that are available, particularly the more unusual ones?<br\/><br\/>My next question is for both SOLAS and the IGC.  The IGC emphasised the need to have contact with students earlier than during the second half of secondary school.  Is there a value in having apprenticeship engagement in the earlier part of secondary school or even in primary school, not just with students but with parents?  The stigma in this regard has to be broken down with parents as well.  Should we be reaching into primary schools?<br\/><br\/>In the context of the restoration of <i>ex quota<\/i>guidance provision, I witnessed the impact that had in our schools and have consistently called for it to be restored.  On the WorldSkills event, for the IGC, they are such fine young ambassadors for our country and in motivating and encouraging people to pursue apprenticeships.  How can we effectively deliver that information to the students in our schools?  Anyone who heard their stories would consider pursuing it.  What sort of engagement would be possible?  It would be lovely to put them on a road show but they have their own jobs so it is hard to do that.  It is even difficult to get them here for the committee for that one day.  Is there some way of working with schools, for example through video presentations, or to have one of those brilliant young ambassadors mentoring a class or having engagement with classes?  Is that being pursued?<br\/><br\/>On the IGC and green apprenticeships, from the point of view of a guidance counsellor, how do we encourage more uptake of green skills?  Are there any concrete plans or considerations given to how the IGC could engage with green apprenticeships?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019102200002#J00400","speaker":"1242","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I have a few questions and observations also.  On SOLAS, has the increase in the national training fund resulted in more vocal feedback and involvement from employers in respect of training needs?  As was stated, the 2020 target for apprenticeship registrations is 31,000 and currently only half of that number are registered.  What is SOLAS planning to do to meet the target?  The take-up of new apprenticeship opportunities by employers has been slower than envisaged, which is a problem that has to be addressed.  What ideas does SOLAS have in that regard?  I agree with my colleague on the age that a young person starts engaging in terms of looking at their career path.  Fifth year is definitely too late.<\/p> <p>  I am hosting a public meeting tonight in Newbridge on career options for young people.  Megan Yeates, the young lady who won the gold medal for freight forwarding, will be speaking at it.  Schools from all around Kildare are coming to.  Like my colleague, I felt she was such an ambassador for skills.  I engaged with her after that meeting and she said she would be willing to talk to schools.  I am really looking forward to hearing her again.  I have somebody speaking about apprenticeships and a career guidance teacher as well.<\/p> <p>  Ms Dooley was talking about the lack of engagement with industry.  How is she proposing to reinstate that engagement?  Is her organisation consulted on plans with State organisations such as SOLAS in terms of moving them forward?  Ms Dooley mentioned that she was surprised at some of the criticism.  Very genuinely as a committee, the engagement we had was very clear and was not isolated, so we felt it was important to address it, not to hide behind it.  Ms Dooley was talking also about working together to facilitate a space where qualified apprentices can describe their positive experiences directly to parents.  That is very important and it is something I am hoping for tonight because it is for parents as well as for the young people, the students from transition year and up.  There is an onus on schools and career guidance teachers to do that.  To be fair, many of them are.  Coincidentally, I was in a school in Newbridge, the Patrician secondary school, for a different reason two weeks ago.  There was a trade fair there and there was quite an emphasis on apprenticeships, which was really good.  Sometimes I get the sense that it is down to the individual career guidance teacher to show leadership on that.  Certainly, when we were discussing this as a committee, we felt that there needed to be a more co-ordinated national response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019102200002#K00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Someone, I cannot remember who it was, stated in one of the newspapers that nobody should recommend an apprenticeship until the middle and professional classes and the politicians start deciding their children should pursue them.  That is a good point.  I am aware that the Institute of Guidance Counsellors is working very closely with the organisations.  That is important and in fairness to Ms Dooley and her team, they are making great efforts to continue to adapt what they do.  I am not asking them to change what they do or to be different as guidance counsellors.  We do not want that.  We want them to do what they are doing and to continue to adapt to changing circumstances.<\/p> <p>  It is worthwhile to reiterate that under the confidence and supply agreement, our priority really was to increase the number of guidance counsellors.  There were a few in the Department at the time who held a view that was certainly expressed to me, maybe not on the floor of the D&aacute;il but privately by a politician, that business people should be in schools teaching kids about business, careers and all that.  I have no difficulty with that but it has to be done at the behest of a qualified guidance counsellor.  It is really important that they work together and that guidance counsellors continue with the mission they have, which is a mission of education, rather than simply a mission of career progression.  They are educators first and foremost and are guidance counsellors in the context of education.  Education is very broad.  We want to emphasise the importance of apprenticeships; I want that as much as anyone and have written a policy document on it.  However, it is one aspect of education.<\/p> <p>  Some people are looking to the examples of Germany and Switzerland where there are a large number of apprentices in training courses and so on.  They are completely different systems.  I am also afraid on the other hand of some people using apprenticeships as a way to reduce pressure on the third-level system.  That is the wrong approach.  We cannot push apprenticeships with the message that a large proportion of students are not going to get the traditional third-level education that previous generations have felt entitled to.  Apprenticeship must be recognised as an equal partner in the education system.  The qualifications apprentices get may be on a par with the equivalent level in academia but that really means nothing until society knows it and it is up to us to continue to press the point home.  The guidance counsellors are to the fore in that regard but it is really the parents and society in general that have to change mindsets.<\/p><p>When our friends in the media, who are, I am sure, hanging on every word of the committee, publish league tables of schools based on where students go to college, it should be recognised in large print at the top that they do not include apprenticeships, which are at the same level as the university degrees on which schools are ranked.  Such tables do not include people who go back to college later either.  I have no difficulty with people examining ratings to see where kids are going, but it is important to know that these tables do not show the full picture.  It is up to all of us to press that point home.  The organisations present do that together.  It is the mission of SOLAS, but the educational mission of members of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors must also be much broader than a focus on careers only.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019102200002#K00300","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Deputy Catherine Martin asked about how we deliver information on apprenticeships to schools.  We deliver such information through classes in schools.  Most schools have a timetabled class in this regard for at least one of the years in the senior cycle.  In some schools, students in junior classes may also take a module.  It varies from school to school.  In some schools, such as my own, there is a timetabled class in both transition year and sixth year.  There are also sessions where counsellors meet students one to one.  We are guidance counsellors and our work is holistic.  We look at personal, educational, and vocational guidance.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked how we can get the message out.  We organise events such as career days in schools.  One of the very rich developments that has arisen from our wonderful engagement with SOLAS is that we are now interfacing with labour market stakeholders for the first time in ten years.  My colleagues tell me there was great engagement with Con Power and the Confederation of Irish Industries in the 1980s.  It was before my time but it seems to have gone by the wayside.  We are starting from scratch again and it is working very well.What I am hoping will grow out of what I am doing with labour market-related continuing professional development, CPD, is that, when my term is over - I have a two-year term with one year left to run - the scaffolding will be set and that we will have support from policymakers so that this can become an annual event.  <br\/><br\/>We evaluated the eight sessions we had last year and our members are calling for us to run them every year.  They would like a full day; we currently have two hours.  We have five sessions of CPD a year.  I am trying to ensure that at least one session will be set aside for labour market information.  Our members would like a full day.  We would like parents to have input.  We would love these labour market stakeholders to speak to parents for an hour or an hour and a half in the late afternoon when people are on their way back from work, with a focus on stigmatised routes so as to destigmatise apprenticeships, traineeship and the further education and training, FET, courses.  I am afraid these courses are in the same bucket.  People do not necessarily see their value.  We spend a lot of time getting that message across.  One third of students in my school take the FET route.  <br\/><br\/>I work in a girls' school, so two students a year may take up apprenticeships.  One of my great frustrations is that, when I have all of these very cool links with industry and the apprenticeship providers who come into my school, there may be five speakers from the Construction Industry Federation present and I have to strong-arm girls into the talk, which is embarrassing.  In their aptitude testing, I identified 12 or so girls for whom apprenticeships would be perfect but when they went home to their parents and had a conversation about it, they were told they would not be taking up apprenticeships and were not allowed to go to the talk.  I am not here to bad-mouth parents, but there is a lot of fear out there.  I also saw this in my colleagues after the crash.  <br\/><br\/>Some of the young people who were before the committee previously were in their early 20s, so they have not experienced what we are doing.  We started this in December of last year, so the initiative is not even a year old yet.  It is in its embryo stage.  Those young people may not have experienced that for a number of reasons.  We experienced cuts in 2012 and lost a quarter of our hours.  Industry was not as involved with us at that time as it had been in the past.  I do not know why, but it was not.  It is now, which is good.  <br\/><br\/>On the Deputy's suggestion regarding video, this is happening.  There is a great deal of good, rich information on careers on the <i>careersportal.ie<\/i>website.  There are videos of people talking about their jobs.  That works quite well.  What I would love to see more of, and what works well in my school, is past pupils being brought in for a careers day because teenagers like to hear from people of their own age group.  They are more interested in their own age group.  I am a fossil to them.  Anybody over 30 is a fossil, a dinosaur, and irrelevant.  Speakers need to be young as teenagers listen more to young people.  They connect more and use the same language and vernacular.  That works well.  I would like that model in every school in Ireland.  It is not in place because we do not have the resources.  <br\/><br\/>At the moment, 27% of guidance counsellor activities are carried out by people who are not qualified or by people who are sourced externally.  That is a lot of people.  In addition, 64% of our members spend time dealing with mental health issues every day and two thirds of members are, for long periods, dealing with issues that should be referred but there is nowhere to refer them.  We have many different balls in the air.  We are very committed to apprenticeships.  Our concern and our challenge is time.  We are trying to get all the messages out.  The other challenge relates to changing the culture.  SOLAS gets this.  It takes a good five years to change a culture.  It will take a while to bring all of the guidance counsellors and parents on board.  The older generation of guidance counsellors were a little bit afraid after the crash in the construction industry.  They had experience of sending young people into apprenticeships only for their employers to lose their businesses.  These young people then did not get to finish and this frightened the counsellors.  We are providing the education.  We are educating the guidance counsellors.  What we need from policymakers is a structure to keep this going if we are moved out of our roles.  It should not depend on personalities and whether there is someone who is interested.  It should just be the way it is.<br\/><br\/>I hope I have addressed how we are engaging with labour market stakeholders.  I sent an invitation to all labour market stakeholders and eight came back to me.  I am going with the energy and working with the people who are interested in working with me.  If others want to come on board, they are welcome.  If anybody offering apprenticeships in green sectors is interested into coming into one of our 16 branches and addressing our members, they are more than welcome to do so.  That is the way in because they then maintain contact with not only our members who work in schools, but those working in youth and adult services and prison services.  Those guidance counsellors will then invite these people back to meet their students and to address them at career events.  <br\/><br\/>There is a lot of work to be done in respect of parents.  We can help with that work, but we need a bit more help.  We meet every year group in schools and we present to the parents of most year groups in the course of the year.  We are somewhat unique in that respect.  We need a bit of support from somebody in industry, SOLAS, the ETBs, or somewhere else.  The Deputy mentioned young apprentices.  Every school in the country has them.  Can we tap into the apprentices who attended our schools and ask them to come back and talk to the parents?  There is a man in DIT, Mr. Mark Deegan, who has a very interesting PowerPoint presentation that shows how much apprentices earn.  If parents were shown how much apprentices earn in their first year - I believe they start at &euro;6 an hour and it goes up to &euro;15 or &euro;30-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019102200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Beatrice Dooley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":184,"content":"<p>By the fourth year, some of them earn between &euro;400 and &euro;600 a week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019102200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary-Liz Trant"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I walk by building sites on my way to school and I see very nice cars.

I am in a school of 620 and to organise an event at which approximately 40 will speak - each student has the option to attend six talks - takes me three weeks of evening and weekend work.

We launched a major campaign last week that attracted a lot of traction and interest.  Building recognition that there are lots of further education and training options for young people and adult learners is the way to build parity of esteem regarding apprenticeships.  This links to the question on green skills.  Dr. Trant will talk about what we are doing in terms of developing curricula in apprenticeships to meet green skills.  There are a lot of FET courses which focus on green and sustainable skills.  The nearly zero-energy buildings, NZEBs, initiative is led by Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board.  We are hoping to mainstream it across the country.  It is about developing skills in retrofitting buildings and such things.

Some employers are not as up to date but if they take on apprentices and the programme has green skills as a core part of what is required, it will help move it along.<\/p> <p>  There has been a conversation about stand-alone retrofitting apprenticeships and we are looking at short courses and traineeships in this area, as well as NZEB skills, to mainstream the programmes.  The apprenticeship council is very open to looking at a dedicated apprenticeship in this whole area and any assistance or guidance would be welcome as to how we can build on the core skills in the mainstream apprenticeship programmes.  Working with Ms Dooley and guidance counsellors, we have a competition at second level with a sustainability theme and 130 toolboxes are going out at the end of this week with landfill materials.  Schools and teams are going to be working with Youthreach and community training centres to build a letter \"A\" out of landfill materials, which have been given to us by ten big construction companies.  The 15 and 16 year olds have really tuned into the climate sustainability message.

I am accompanied by Mr. John Spain, chair of PII's planning and development committee.  PII is an independent and inclusive representative organisation for all subsectors of the Irish property industry.  Membership of the organisation is open to all professional firms across the property industry.<\/p> <p>  PII views the SHD process as a key part of its planning system and recommends that consideration be given to making it a permanent feature.  Whereas the supply of new homes has improved, it remains below estimated levels of new household formation.  The scheme has contributed greatly to speeding up decision-making processes on major housing developments at a time of major shortages in housing supply in Dublin and around the country.  Up to the end of June, out of the 71 applications decided by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, 49 cases of permission have been granted, leaving an approval rate of just under 70%.  This has resulted in 11,388 housing units being approved, comprising 7,038 apartments and 4,350 houses, together with 7,981 student bed spaces.<\/p> <p>  Given the very significant increase in large-scale housing planning applications since the scheme was introduced in 2017, we expect to see a commensurate increase in construction activity over the next 12 months, feeding through to a further significant increase in new housing completions over the next few years.  The SHD process has been particularly successful in encouraging apartment developments in the more central areas of our cities, which will greatly assist in regeneration and result in a more sustainable pattern of housing provision, reducing the dependence on car-based, low-density housing in peripheral locations.  This is particularly important if we are to achieve the Government's climate change objectives as they relate to urban development.  Much of this increase in activity is funded by overseas investors, who find the certainty of the timescale for decisions on strategic housing development applications particularly encouraging.<\/p> <p>  There is inevitably a time lag between a grant of permission and commencement of construction.  This applies to cases of strategic housing development permission just as it does to standard planning permission.  There are a number of reasons for this time lag, including the need to obtain compliance approval from the local authority with respect to pre-commencement conditions, the need to agree Part V social housing provision details and the need to agree water and drainage details with Irish Water.<\/p><p>In some cases, commencement is dependent on upgrades to local infrastructure by Irish Water or the local authority.  In other cases, amendments to elements of the scheme are required prior to commencement due to changing market requirements or it can take time to finalise funding arrangements for construction.  Typically, it may take six months or more to get responses from a local authority to pre-commencement compliance submissions.  The time lag between permission being granted and commencement of construction may be anything from six months to two years for these reasons.<\/p><p> As part of PII&rsquo;s submission to the SHD review, we made several recommendations aimed at improving the efficiency and impact of the scheme.  In light of time constraints, I will list only these recommendations, but we are happy to discuss them in more detail.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be permitted to request further information where the only alternative is a refusal of permission and the potential reason or reasons for refusal are capable of being addressed by further information.  Further information is permitted in strategic infrastructure development applications and is often requested. The occasional use of similar provisions in normal planning appeals under section 132 of the Planning and Development Act has proven very effective.<\/p><p> A higher proportion of commercial use to complement residential use should be allowed, especially for larger schemes.  Additional resources should be allocated to Irish Water to reduce the length of time it takes to produce documentation.  Prescribed bodies should be required to engage at pre-application stage.  The requirement to refer to material contravention in notices and on the application form should be removed.  It would be of great assistance to applicants if there were more specific comments in An Bord Plean&aacute;la opinions at pre-application stage in respect of what is or is not considered acceptable and what changes may be required to make a scheme acceptable.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be encouraged to review its approach to requiring a minimum density level for SHD sites.  The SHD system should move fully online and a section of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be dedicated to SHD applications.<\/p><p> There is a need for clarity on the procedure for amendment applications to approved SHD schemes.  Amendment applications are best dealt with by local planning authorities.  Resourcing and capacity at local authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la levels should be reviewed.  The SHD process should be optional for applicants.  There is a need to clarify the treatment of SHD applications in strategic development zone planning scheme areas.<\/p><p> We are happy to discuss our recommendations to the SHD review in more detail with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear.  I am joined by Dr. Conor Norton, vice president of the Irish Planning Institute.  We will do all we can to assist the committee regarding the views of planners on the strategic housing development review.  The Irish Planning Institute is the all-island professional body representing planners engaged in physical and environmental planning.  Our mission is to advance planning in the interest of the common good by serving, improving and promoting the planning profession.  We are the largest professional membership body for spatial planners operating on the island of Ireland.  Our members work across the planning system, including in planning consultancies, for developers, and in planning authorities, semi-State organisations, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and central government.  We are a broad church of professional planners and our membership has developed great collective expertise through its interactions with various stages of the strategic housing development process.<\/p> <p>  As our members work across the planning system, the views they represented to us are quite diverse.  The institute has long argued in favour of the principle of subsidiarity in planning such that, insofar as practicable, local planning decisions should be made by competent authorities at local level.  However, the institute acknowledges and supports the overall purpose of strategic housing development to accelerate the delivery of much-needed housing in accordance with the principles and objectives contained in Rebuilding Ireland and as a temporary measure.  More than 16,172 housing units and 7,573 units of student accommodation have been granted permission through this process by An Bord Plean&aacute;la since SHD was rolled out.  This is a considerable achievement.  Despite the changes facilitated in the planning system and increasing numbers of planning applications, the institute shares the concerns of many present that figures for building on the ground remain modest.<\/p><p>There are, of course, numerous hurdles developers have to jump after planning permission has been granted before they can actually start building.  The post-permission period is increasingly more complex, with numerous compliance conditions that must be fulfilled on each site before construction can start.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Planning Institute, IPI, has consistently argued that local authority planning departments are not adequately resourced to carry out their range of functions and responsibilities.  We have pointed to areas where problems still exist in terms of process.  We have suggested, for example, greater resourcing for matters of compliance with conditions of permission, and we have suggested to the strategic housing development review group that these compliance certificates could be secured if necessary from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As with all permissions, delay can still result from the judicial review processes post permission.<br\/><br\/>Delivery is critical, and it must be driven at local level.  At our recent autumn planning conference I called for planner-led delivery teams to be created in all local authorities to bring forward urban regeneration in urban centres, to engage in active land management, and to assist in unlocking strategic lands where planning permissions have been granted.<br\/><br\/>In summary, I would like to highlight here today, as I have on other occasions, that the successful roll out of strategic housing development shows that planning <i>per se<\/i>is not the roadblock to delivery of housing.  Our membership is anxious to avoid a scenario where planning permissions granted under the strategic housing development process will be used by developers or speculators to increase the value of land rather than the delivery of housing.  We very much want to be part of the solution in working with other professions in the construction sector to deliver the housing our citizens so badly need.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to come before the committee today.  We will endeavour to respond to all of the committee's questions.  If there is any additional information required arising from this meeting, we will be pleased to provide that information in a prompt manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Corr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Corr.

I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to appear before the committee to discuss the important work of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the context of the strategic housing development, SHD, review, and to respond to any questions the committee may have of SHD.<\/p> <p>  I am deputy chair of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and chair of the strategic housing division.  I am joined by Ms Rachel Kenny, director of planning operations.  With the Chairman's indulgence, I may ask her to address some of the issues raised, as she may be more familiar with such matters.<\/p> <p>  The board undertakes a critical role in considering and determining strategic housing development proposals, and we remain committed to delivering decisions as quickly and effectively as possible.  The strategic housing development legislation has been in operation for just over two years, since July 2017.  In that time a total of just over 100 cases have been decided, two thirds of which were decided in the past nine months.  All cases have been decided within the mandatory timelines provided for, which is 16 weeks, except for two cases, where oral hearings were held.  The board has also issued opinions on approximately 230 pre-application consultations, again within the nine-week period provided for in the legislation.<\/p> <p>  The role of the board is not merely to deal with cases as expeditiously as possible but also to promote the principles of proper planning and sustainable development.  The national planning framework and the emerging regional spatial and economic strategies, as well as the various section 28 ministerial guidelines published over the past decade, set a clear priority for appropriate development in the right locations to facilitate the sustainable and orderly growth of our cities, towns and rural hinterlands.  The board has a clear role in implementing such policies through the processing of case decisions.<\/p> <p>  In a constantly evolving and more complex legislative and legal context, where environmental issues and public participation are to the fore, it is also crucial that the board has all the information it needs to make sound decisions and gives people time to feed in their views on proposals during the deliberative process, reflecting our core principles of integrity, independence and fair-mindedness.<\/p> <p>  I will give the committee a little background on the strategic housing development division.  The board was, on commencement of the legislation, provided with ten additional staff across planning inspectorate and administration, although during 2019 this was increased to 17 staff.<\/p><p>Four board members are assigned to the SHD division of the board, which is chaired by myself, and the members of this division are required to prioritise these cases, as is the case with all large-scale housing appeals that come to us.  The board&rsquo;s performance in relation to strategic housing developments has been very strong.  The board, as I have already mentioned, has decided more than 100 cases, with 67 of these being a decision to grant and 34 to refuse.  As of 30 September, approximately 16,500 residential units have been permitted and 7,500 student bed spaces.  Pre-application consultation requests considered to date account for approximately 63,000 residential units and approximately 12,000 student bed spaces, so we anticipate significant and ongoing applications.  However, it is not a rubber-stamping exercise.  To date, approximately 5,460 residential units and approximately 1,360 student bed spaces have been refused consent.  The board remains committed to the right developments in the right locations.<\/p><p> The board acknowledges the appointment of an independent panel to undertake a review of the performance, operation and structure of strategic housing development provisions.

To say there was an avalanche of telephone calls and emails would be an understatement.  Local communities feel disenfranchised by the SHD process and politicians - national and local - feel disenfranchised.  Planners also, who are members of the Irish Planning Institute, have expressed concern.  Its submission on 16 July was its initial submission and the nuances are slightly different now in terms of where it stands on the SHD.  It was an excellent submission and I spoke to a number of planners across the 30 or so local authorities, who all agreed.  They are under-resourced and under pressure and many of them are disillusioned and thinking of getting out.  As Mr. Corr said, his membership comprises people who sit on local authorities and who work in State agencies, in An Bord Plean&aacute;la and in Mr. Duffy's organisation.  It is a very impressive body of people who have a track record of delivering and they are saying \"Enough is enough; it has got to stop.\"<\/p> <p>  I will cut to the chase and say it has failed the planning system.  Subsidiarity means making decisions within communities and if the witnesses are telling this committee that this is a major infringement of the Aarhus Convention and undermines citizens' ability to make their views known in the planning process, we have to do something.  I do not want this to be a box-ticking exercise.  The witnesses have set out their credentials well but I will focus on the IPI as I have taken the trouble to look at its track record and to talk to its membership across the sector.  What is the IPI's stance on the removal of the right to a third party appeal?  What is the stance of An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  It is important that local authorities are acknowledged as the best-placed people to make decisions.<\/p><p>I am not talking about councillors.  I am talking about the unique relationship between councils, which have local knowledge, and expert planners who have trained in and have knowledge of planning matters.  I want to hear what the witnesses have to say about that.<\/p><p> On the overall process, is it right that An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be judge and jury in a case?  I note that the IPI strongly advocates the need for additional resources for local authorities to allow them to get on with their work.  There was some suggestion regarding other groups and the establishment of a special planning and environment law court was also mentioned.  Will the witnesses comment on that?  It is wholly wrong and inappropriate that citizens are forced to take costly judicial reviews because this has an impact on communities and individuals.  I know a man in one local authority area who is representing himself in a case as a lay litigant.  I am familiar with communities in Dublin that are literally broke because they have initiated judicial processes and then some people have decided they cannot proceed with a case or put their homes on the line.  That is an important issue.<\/p><p> The IPI talks about the introduction of a site value tax for sites that receive permission via the strategic housing development process.  Will the witnesses clarify that?  I would like to hear their comments on it because it is a very important issue.<\/p><p> In respect of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, there is much criticism of its website and the system it has in place.  An applicant can put up a map, plans and a photomontage as he or she sees fit and advocate for his or her own planning application.  In some cases, after the event, councillors cannot get access to application.  I want to hear the board's view on all of that in terms of access to this information, particularly its websites.<\/p><p> We know there are issues with requests for further information and the mechanisms involved in that.  There are serious concerns about that, abuses of the system and the way it which it prolongs the process.  This is meant to be fast-track planning but I do not believe that is the case.<\/p><p> The strategic housing development process disenfranchises communities.  It is not right or proper.  It needs to cease, not next year or the year after that.  It was a temporary measure, which has failed and did not deliver homes.  It may have delivered student accommodation and in other areas but it has not delivered on the key objective of the Rebuilding Ireland programme, namely, to deliver homes.  The most important comment I am hearing from local councillors and planners is that they are demoralised.  They feel disenfranchised, as do communities.  The SHD process is an attack on a sustainable, consultative planning process.  There can be no place in a democracy for having proper open, transparent planning done by an elite group in Marlborough Street.  The system is not engaging with those who are elected by the people to represent them.  The citizens have the right to engage in the planning process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#H00200","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Hyde to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#J00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>On the technical issue around websites, the board agrees with the Senator that all of that information should be on a centralised website.

Strategic infrastructure has been in place since 2007.  This has allowed for direct applications to the board in respect of strategic infrastructure.  The temporary emergency legislation which has been introduced for strategic housing is just that, namely, it is temporary.  This legislation is not meant to disenfranchise anyone, rather it is designed to allow for speedier delivery.  There are two stages to the process, namely, the pre-application and application stages.  The planning authority has ample opportunity at the pre-application stage to get its issues on the agenda for input.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hyde","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I understand Senator Boyhan's frustration.  We have received similar feedback from our membership throughout the country.  We carried out our own research some time ago and it uncovered that we needed in excess of 100 additional planners of all grades, which is a significant number.  That needs to be addressed at local level.  I will not reiterate what my colleague Mr. Hyde said, but we are aware that this system is not popular, due to the process involved which has no appeal mechanism.  However, we also acknowledge that this is a temporary measure that is in response to a housing crisis.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the judicial review.  It is expensive, and is not an appeal in its own right.  It is a review of the process undertaken and is extremely expensive.  We referred in our submission to a commercial court which would listen to judicial reviews of planning decisions as a more accessible mechanism which would not cost as much as the High Court for individuals or community groups wishing to have the process reviewed.<\/p> <p>  As stated earlier, local authorities are best placed to deal with these issues.  We agree on that.  They are best placed to make these decisions, which is why we want them adequately resourced.  When compliances come to them after an SHD permission, they should not be holding up development by taking a number of weeks to come to a conclusion which would allow development to take place.  We advocate a use it or lose it policy.  Landowners or developers should not be able to speculate on their SHDs.  This also relates to the Senator's comments on the site value tax, which we see as one measure in a number that would ensure delivery of housing into the system.

There is a pre-application process with the local authority.  That is taken very seriously by applicants.  It might often involve two, three, four or more pre-application meetings with the local authority planning officers.  It is important to seek to resolve all issues insofar as possible prior even to getting involved with the pre-application process with the board.  In our experience, applicants seek to address fully the planning issues and concerns raised by the planning authority and, in that regard, also have regard to the development plan made by the elected members, the local area plans and so on.  Those issues and concerns must be addressed in the context of Government policy.<\/p> <p>  We have seen Government policy move on significantly in the past two years with the national planning framework, the regional spatial and economic strategy and so on.  Development plans are now going through a review process to reflect that.  The local authority input remains very important pre-application.  As Mr. Hyde referenced, there is involvement with the board at the pre-application stage.  It attends the tripartite meeting, makes an initial report to the board and also submits a report to the board on the application.  That report is an important part of the process and, in our experience, is given serious consideration by the board.  That is the reason the pre-application process for the local authority is so important.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, in terms of third-party appeal rights, the decision is made by the board in those cases.  In strategic housing developments, the decision is also made by the board.  All third-party ownership parties have the opportunity to make observations to the board, and those observations are an important part of the process.  It is a faster and more efficient way to get to the end of the decision-making process and one that has proved effective in terms of encouraging much-needed investment in housing planning applications leading on to housing development.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Corr mentioned, there have been concerns about the delivery rates of permissions.  We referred to a time lag.  One way to try to speed up that process would be to commence the provisions of the 2018 Planning and Development (Amendment) Act, which provide for a strict time limit for deciding on compliance applications.  We would urge the commencement of those provisions, which are on the Statute Book but have not been commenced, as a matter of urgency.  That requires the resourcing at local authority level, to which Mr. Corr referred.<\/p> <p>  I will make a final comment in respect of websites.  We agree it would be beneficial, and I am pleased to hear that the board is putting in place, a system whereby the application is hosted on the board's rather than on the applicant's website.  That is part of our submission on that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of further information, we note that the board has held focused oral hearings on two strategic housing applications relatively recently.

Following a two-year period, this is our first opportunity to discuss the strategic housing development review, SHDR.  It is critical that we get down to the nuts and bolts of the practical operation of this process.  I will start by making some general statements.  It is the consultation and the community involvement process relating to strategic housing developments, SHDs, with which I have a problem.  I am not being critical but trying to be as practical as possible.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example of that from last week when the committee was discussing the Land Development Agency, LDA.  It concerns local area plans.  In Wicklow, a number of local area plans were adopted in 2006 but were not reviewed after the six-year period because of the economic crash.  They were meant to be reviewed in 2018 but they were not reviewed because of the publication of the national planning framework.  We then had to hold off for the regional strategic plan and now must wait for a county development plan, following which the authority's local area plan can be decided.  A period of up to 21 years will have elapsed before the community will have a direct involvement in the way their community develops.<\/p><p>That is my fundamental problem with the SHDs.  They now have the remit of national policy to force 35 houses to the hectare in small towns where that is completely inappropriate.  The only vehicle a community has in that case is judicial review, which is unaffordable.  Regarding the board, Mr. Hyde said in his opening statement that public participation would be to the fore.  However, that is not the case with regard to whether SHDs are in line with local area and county plans.  It might be so with regard to national plans, but not with any plan below that level.  From a transparency perspective, I have a fundamental problem with SHDs.  If local area plans were in line, that community involvement would have been there.  However, it is not.<\/p><p> The approval of 67 of a total of 101 SHD applications is almost being promoted here today as a success.  It is a failure when 34 of 101 applications are not approved in a process that has to go through pre-planning with the relevant local authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There are two consultations and then a final application is submitted to the board.  Mr. Hyde said in response to Senator Boyhan that there was no need for further information, which would delay the process.  In that case, how did 34 of 101 applications fail?  Was the principle of the application at fault?  If the principle was not at fault, it was a minor issue which could easily have been dealt with by way of further information or a planning clarification.  We are being told 67 approvals is a success in a process that was meant to streamline this.  It is a failure that 34 applications failed and, as such, I question the assertion that further information is not needed.  That is to state clearly that the application should never have been submitted.  Is there, therefore, an issue with the pre-planning consultation with the local authority and the board?  There was room in the legislation for either the board or the applicant to request a second meeting to discuss issues.  Has such a second meeting ever been requested by a developer or the board given the failure rate of more than 30%?<\/p><p> Has any material contravention been invoked in relation to the applications which have gone through so far?  We are all here to try to get the system working but the frustration is beginning to come.  One or two of the witnesses might have said that.  It is not necessarily the planning system that is the roadblock.  It is what takes place after an application has gone through the system.  I am hearing anecdotally that there are serious issues in relation to Irish Water and getting information from the company in order to proceed on site.  To get planning permission and then to have to wait two years to get on site is ridiculous.  The waiting time is between six months and two years.  At this stage, I wonder whether these issues should have been gone through by the time the final planning permission is granted.  Of the 67 applications that were granted, one wonders how many of the sites have been flipped and sold on the market for a higher value.  This is where there might be an opportunity to ensure a developer makes a greater commitment to the planning system in having to engage in compliance, commit to Part V and obtain permission from Irish Water before obtaining planning permission.  That would put us all in a position to say there is nothing to delay the development of the site.  At the moment, however, we are issuing planning permission before all of these other issues have been dealt with.  It is not necessarily a failure of the SHDs, but rather of the whole planning system which needs to be developed.<\/p><p>Regarding maximum densities, it goes back to the consultation process with communities.  In some of our towns, they are not fit for purpose.  Apartments must be included to achieve the target of 35 homes per hectare in respect of complying with public and private open space.  It is not viable any other way.  Apartments are not suitable in many of our smaller towns yet these national guidelines are being applied.  I have probably gone way over time.  I will come back in during the second round.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#L00300","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>We will come back to the Deputy in the second round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#N00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I will handle some questions while Ms Kenny will answer parts relating to the pre-application stage.  Regarding whether SHD could be perceived to be a failure in terms of the refusal rate of 34% in 100 cases, with the normal planning application process under section 34 of the Act before SHD was introduced, the refusal rate hovered around 50% so we feel the value in the process is that we have moved from a 50% refusal rate on appeal of similar cases dating back to 2005 to a rate of 34%.  I would not accept that this in itself is a failure.  It is not a rubber-stamping exercise.  It is very important that there is rigorous assessment of each and every case.  This is why the grant rate on applications is not 100%.<\/p> <p>  It would be fair to say that in some instances at the pre-application stage, the applicants are given opinions that the applications require further consideration.  In some of those instances, they applied without taking on board some of the recommendations made at the pre-application stage, which often led to a refusal.  Some of the refusals would relate to technical issues that could not be resolved by way of clarification or further information.  These things often involve environmental issues around appropriate assessment or environmental impact assessment and are simply not resolvable.  The best outcome is a refusal and a fresh application.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the density target of 35 homes per hectare in some of our smaller towns and villages referred to by Deputy Casey, the reality is that policy on density is set nationally and is a matter for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We implement national policy, as is our mandate.  It is not the case that we need to build apartments to achieve the target of 35 homes per hectare.  Based on international experience and what we have seen in some of our suburban areas, it is possible to achieve this density with duplexes or townhouses.  I will hand over to Ms Kenny, who will answer the questions about the pre-application process.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hyde"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":231,"content":"<p>The pre-application process plays a very important role and the planning authorities participate in that to a significant degree.  There has been a significant amount of pre-application consultation prior to it arriving at the board but when it comes to the board, we go through all of the issues not yet resolved by the planning authorities with the prospective applicant along with issues we feel ought to be considered to ensure that the correct and relevant amount of information, planning justification, etc., is submitted to us.  Most of the 230 pre-application cases would require further consideration.  Only a small number would have been considered to constitute a reasonable basis for the making of an application.  Most of the pre-application consultations that come in result in a further consideration request that lists the issues that require further consideration.  We are improving in terms of clarity regarding those issues to give as clear a direction as possible but as Mr. Hyde said, we do not predetermine applications.<\/p><p>It is very important that there is a distinction between the pre-application process and the application process.  We have different inspectors at pre-application stage versus application stage in order to ensure that the process is transparent and open and that everybody has a fair opportunity to influence and inform the consideration of an application so that third parties would have that same opportunity to engage with the reporting inspector at first hand.<\/p><p> We have had second pre-application consultation meetings.  That is possible.  In other instances where the matters would be so extensive, they come in and restart the process.  We have a second pre-application consultation where it is required and where somebody wants it, we will facilitate it.  That is always available.<\/p><p> In terms of the grant rate and whether it is successful, obviously it started off as a relatively new process.  We all had to get an understanding of where we were going in terms of the evolving planning policies that exist.  In recent times, if one looks at the first 2018 decisions versus the 2019 decisions, the grant rate would be slightly higher in 2019 - in the second half or second operational period of the strategic housing development, SHD - as we begin to learn and understand where we are going with that.  It is probably closer to 70% at present.  It could be higher but it depends on the applications coming in.  It is important that we had the opportunity not to rubber-stamp it to take into consideration all of the relevant information that comes in at application stage.  In terms of public participation in local democracy and the involvement of the planning authorities, it is important that the public knows that it can influence the board in the making of a decision.

They should be really but perhaps that is not why they are reviewed or renewed, and that under those circumstances fresh LAPs are required.<\/p> <p>  The density, if I can go back to that, can be achieved.

They are there for all applications.  The LAP update process will be addressed in the short term now that the regional strategies are in place.  Although the delay is regrettable, it is now being addressed.  LAPs will remain an important part of the process and the input of elected representatives to the make-up of those plans will also remain important.<\/p><p> The density policy is set by Government, not by the board, which just implements the policy.  There is room to provide a review of policy as it applies to smaller settlements and those that are more remote from major urban centres.  There are a lot of concerns about the viability of delivery of higher density schemes in some of these smaller settlements and more remote locations.  That must be considered further.<\/p><p> The 34% refusal rate is high.  Compared with all planning applications under the normal planning application process across the board, the local authority level refusal rate is 10%, for instance.  I welcome that the refusal rate appears to be falling somewhat more recently.  Our submission suggests several measures to address that and achieve a higher permission rate.  No one goes into this process other than to achieve a permission.  It is a very expensive, time-consuming process for applicants.  However, it shows that it is a very rigorous process for developers and is risky.  It also shows that the concerns raised by local authorities, planners and others making submissions and observations - third parties and statutory bodies - are taken very seriously and that has had a significant influence on that refusal rate.  There are measures that could go further to bring that down, including oral hearings, which we would welcome.  It has been used relatively recently.  We also suggest introducing provisions similar to section 132 provisions in normal applications in exceptional circumstances in those few cases where refusal could be avoided by further information.  That is an approach that is permitted.  Second meetings with the board in exceptional circumstances at pre-application stage and greater clarity, which we are seeing being given at pre-application stage in the board's opinions, are very welcome.<\/p><p> I agree on the serious issues about resourcing and timeliness of agreements with Irish Water.  That is an important matter that can be addressed to improve on delivery.  Of the approximately 67 permissions we examined, around a quarter - 16 - exceed where they are in implementation from a detailed knowledge of the situation on the ground.  The vast majority of those, 11 of the sample of 16, are at preliminary construction or full construction stages.  The sample is across the board geographically in the types of scheme and type of developer.  Three more recent permissions in the recent weeks are at compliance stage.  We anticipate 15 of the 16 being implemented in the short term.  All are likely to be implemented within the lifetime of the permissions, but the great majority will be implemented in the short term.  We are only beginning to see the feed through of a significant increase in construction rates following from the increase in planning applications and permissions being granted.  The system is delivering and will be seen to deliver very strongly over the next year or two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Spain","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I have a question for Mr. Corr and Dr. Duffy.

He said that the members of the Irish Planning Institute were anxious to avoid a scenario where planning permission granted under the strategic housing development process would be used by developers or speculators to increase the value of land rather than the delivery of houses.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Corr has pointed to a danger.  One does not point to a danger if the danger does not exist or if it is not a reality.  I know this is a reality.  I know there are developers submitting planning applications that are being fast-tracked.  The permission is being granted.  The value of the land increases and the land is sold on to make a quick buck.  The people who are losing out on that are, generally speaking, middle-income working people who are looking for an affordable home but who cannot get their hands on one.  That is unacceptable, disgraceful and a scandal.<br\/><br\/>I have my own opinion on this and I believe the scheme should be scrapped.  Presumably, Mr. Corr believes this is happening and that it is a factor.  Will he elaborate on how great a factor this is?  How significant is winning planning permission and then flipping the land - selling it on - as opposed to building the houses?  Does Mr. Corr reckon this accounts for a significant percentage or portion of those 9,500 houses that remained unbuilt when <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>reported on it in September?<br\/><br\/>My second question is for Dr. Duffy.  The same report indicated that there had been a survey of sorts conducted jointly by two universities, University College Dublin and Queen's University Belfast, into the origins of the scheme and the level of influence that developers might have had in shaping it.  One developer was quoted in the newspaper report.  References to &quot;him&quot; were references to the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Coveney.  He said, &quot;We gave him our recommendations and they took it lock, stock and barrel and stuck it into the new housing bill.&quot;  Effectively, what was being said was that the proposals from the developers were more or less 100% incorporated into the legislation that gave rise to this process.  Will Dr. Duffy comment on the UCD and Queen's University Belfast report and the quote and give his opinion on how accurate or otherwise it might be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#P00200","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>We will start with Mr. Corr, given that the majority of the questions were directly addressed to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#Q00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>In a nutshell, to address Deputy Barry's question, I do not have the statistics on how many sites would be permitted for the purpose of flipping on.

The home builders I have spoken to say their business model is to build houses.

In answering, I can only give the Deputy my understanding.  It is fair to say that, at the time, there was a recognition that there was a huge need to increase the supply of housing into the system.  PII, as a broad church for the property sector, representing all the different sub-sectors and being a policy-focused organisation, was looking at making recommendations to the Department or to Government as to how housing supply could be increased at that time.  All of those were published in various documents which are available on our website.<br\/><br\/>My understanding is that the fast-track planning process was one of the ideas.  It featured in our 2016 publication, Policy Reform to Increase the Delivery of New Housing, but it featured in a slightly different form to the one that was finally adopted in that the model we put forward included scope for requests for further clarification or further information.  I am not aware of the particular interview to which the Deputy referred.  As stated said, neither of us was involved in PII at the time.  It featured in our recommendations, although a slightly different form was eventually adopted by the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I have always been of the view that the purpose of the strategic housing developments was not in the first instance to speed up the planning process, and I will explain why in a moment.  Their primary purpose was to bypass democratically agreed city and county development plans.  There is a mounting body of evidence, to which I will come in a moment, which confirms this.  The difficulty is that the people who initiated the lobby for this change could not come out and say they wanted to undermine the democratically agreed city and county development plans, so it was framed as a matter of speeding up the process.  I absolutely accept that the planning process, as it was before the SHDs, was too slow.  This committee spent a very considerable amount of time examining the cause of that slowness.  It amounted to approximately 48 weeks for a large housing development, on the basis of the planning applications we were considering at that stage.  However, when the Department gave us a breakdown of pre-planning, formal planning application with the local authority, request for additional information and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the only part of the planning process that was happening quickly and in line with the statutory requirement was that undertaken by the local authorities.  Pre-planning had no statutory requirement and could go on for ages.  As for requests for additional information, it could take up to six months for industry to get back to the local authorities.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la, because of a lack of adequate resourcing, was not meeting its time guidelines.  If the primary objective had been to improve the efficiency of the process, there were very simple solutions: have statutory timeframes for pre-planning and additional information and give An Bord Plean&aacute;la the resources to carry out the reviews.  The same timeline could have been met.  It is not 16 weeks at present, in fairness, because one must count in the time from when the additional engagement with the local authority happens right through to the formal application and onwards.  The timeline is approximately 22 weeks or something.  However, An Bord Plean&aacute;la could have achieved this without bypassing the local authorities.<\/p><p>This is a really important point that has not been properly explored here: why would An Bord Plean&aacute;la want to bypass the city and county development plans?  There is a difference legally in what An Bord Plean&aacute;la must do.  The legislation states that it must have regard to the city and county development plans, whereas local authorities must comply with them.  That is a big difference.  One official in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government once said to me that part of the purpose of this legislation was to get around the &quot;eccentricities&quot; of the city and county development plans.  In the research Deputy Barry quoted from UCD and Queen's University one developer, not PII, talked about the ridiculous &quot;rubbish&quot; that democratically elected members sought to put into their city and county development plans.  We need to be honest here: this is not about efficiency; it is about a policy agenda that was led by industry and which the Minister of the day and some of his officials swallowed lock, stock and barrel.<\/p><p>What have been the outcomes of this two years on?  Killian Woods from <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>has done incredible work spreadsheeting all the SHDs.  He has told us that of the 15,000 units approved, 10,000 have not commenced, and that of the 64 schemes, 41 do not even have commencement notices.  These figures were correct at the time he wrote.  We have been told there are many reasons a development might be delayed going on site, and that is true.  However, one can have a commencement notice and still be negotiating, for example, one's water infrastructure with Irish Water or one's Part V commitments.  Therefore, most of the reasons Dr. Duffy's submission gives for the delay are in fact things that happen in parallel with, not before, a commencement notice.  I am sure some of these developments are for legitimate reasons taking time, but I am also absolutely certain, since we know some of the companies that have these planning permissions, that they are stalling on developments for market and business reasons, not because of the kinds of delays Dr. Duffy talked about.  The research, which I commend to all members of the committee, was done by Mick Lennon and Richard Waldron from UCD and Queen's University, respectively.  They interviewed 39 participants involved in this legislation off the record.  They are really interesting interviews.  Those interviewed, including politicians and representatives from some of the organisations here today, spoke openly and frankly.  When one reads it, it is pretty definitive that the account I am giving is what was actually taking place.  We need a little honesty about the process.  If the purpose of this was to speed up the delivery of homes, it has not worked.  We have not seen a dramatic increase in the delivery of homes.  Yes, we have seen an increase in the number of planning permissions, and that is fine, but we could have dealt with that in another way.<\/p><p>My first question is to Dr. Duffy.  Notwithstanding the fact that he was not there at the early stages of the SHDs, is it not the case that one of the objectives of his organisation was to bypass the democratically agreed city and county development plans and have this go directly to the board?<\/p><p>While he might not have been interviewed for the research, I know Dr. Duffy is an assiduous reader of this type of material.  I have no doubt, therefore, that he will have read this piece of research.  Do the comments attributed to his organisation reflect its thinking in this regard?  Regardless of whether Dr. Duffy was the person involved at the time, are these comments an accurate depiction of what PII was involved in during the lobbying?  Is it not the case that some developers are clearly abusing this process?  They have benefited from fast-track planning and are abusing it.  <\/p><p> My next questions are more general and for the representatives from other organisations.  I hope the SHDs do not continue and I hope the Minister also takes that view.  If they do, however, do we not need some mechanism to be able to independently monitor what happens post planning permission?  I refer to ensuring there is no abuse of the system.  I will give an example.  A significant number of SHD planning permissions are being sold.  Do we not need to assess whether those sales are legitimate or speculative?  If they are speculative, do we not need to withdraw planning permission to protect the integrity of the system?  Would it be a good idea to have that kind of mechanism?  <\/p><p> I pose this question to the representatives from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in light of the system possibly continuing.  There is a four-week turnaround from publication to submission of opinions and this process involves very large, complex files.  They are so large and indepth, in fact, that when I go onto the SHD website it is almost impossible to download many of the files and print them off.  Is four weeks enough time for genuine members of the public, who are not part of culture of reckless objecting, to engage in the planning process to try to improve developments?  Is the present online interface sufficient?  Are there not better ways to ensure that we can end up with better developments through a proper consultative process?  I have not objected to a single large development in my constituency.  I would, however, like to have opportunities to engage, if we are going to have large developments, to ensure those developments have proper traffic management, amenities and green space.  Elected representatives should be doing that, but the process at the moment makes it very difficult for us to engage properly in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#S00100","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin.

Do the witnesses agree that this access to the Minister, where the PII met him six or seven times in six or seven weeks from 8 p.m. until midnight, was unprecedented for a specific group?  Were all of the meetings held in the Department?  Were other meetings held in other places in Dublin?  Were all of the meetings logged in the lobbying register? <\/p><p>We supported this Act initially because we were told by stakeholders that the planning process was one of the main blocks to delivering housing.  I was interested to hear Mr. Corr say that planning is not a roadblock for housing delivery.<\/p><p>Mr. Corr also called for adequately resourced local authorities, and I agree with him on that.  I will talk to him about how those development teams work.<\/p><p> An Bord Plean&aacute;la is charged, first, with dealing with the applications.  Last year, approximately 18,000 homes were constructed.  This might not be a question for the board, but how many homes do Mr. Corr, Dr. Norton, Mr. Spain and Dr. Duffy believe will be delivered this year?  What increase will there be on last year and do they believe any increase is attributable to the new planning process that has been put in place?  My understanding from representatives of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and others who have appeared before this committee is that the original target of 25,000 for this year will not be met and that it will be closer to 20,000 or 21,000.  It is a major concern that in a situation where there is a new process that is supposed to be delivering housing - I agree with Mr. Hyde on that - we are not seeing that delivery.<\/p><p> What have we given up instead?  We have given up an input from communities into the planning process.  That is what I hear on the ground when communities have applications foisted upon them.  This week, coincidentally, I was in Rush to listen to members of a community on a SHD application that has been made.  It is an increase on the original one and they feel that aside from making a submission to the board, with all due respect to the board, they do not have a process that enables them to discuss it with their councillors.  When this was introduced, the then new Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, sent a circular to all local authorities stating that members were not allowed to call planning files to public meetings at the county council.  Not only did we have a situation where there was a roadmap for going over the local authorities and allowing An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the legislation to disregard a development plan, a master plan or a local area plan, we were also taking away any type of consultative power the local authority members had in each local authority to call planning files to meetings and to raise points on behalf of communities.<\/p><p> I say that as somebody who rarely objects to things.  However, when one sees some of the applications that are going to the board, one can understand the concerns of communities.  Even the councillors they elect do not have a say at a formal public council meeting and can only make submissions to the plan.  Has this increased housing delivery in real terms?  Can it be attributed to SHD?  I do not believe so.  We need properly resourced local authorities that have the know-how to make those decisions at local authority level.  It is reverting to what we had previously, because I do not see the evidence when there are 15,000 permissions granted and approximately 5,000 of the permissions granted have been started, but 10,000 have not.<\/p><p> I also have a question on reapplications.  These are applications that come to the board that already have planning permission for lands, such as the Chivers site in Coolock and the like, where there is a change from housing developments or homes to intensifying and increasing the density on particular sites.  Does the board keep an eye on applications that go to it for lands that already have a live planning application?  If that is tracked, one will potentially see where sites are being flipped and where new applications are going to the board just to increase the value of a site but not to deliver homes on the ground.  A number of examples have been outlined.  I see it in my area of Dublin Fingal, which is a very active county where over 82 sites are open.  My concern is that through this process we are allowing people to flip sites and increase value.<\/p><p> Does Mr. Corr see this legislation as having brought about a substantial increase in the build-to-rent developments that we see in urban areas, in particular?  I look at certain applications and where people are looking to get their foot on the ladder the permissions being sought and granted for swathes of our towns and cities are for build-to-rent only.  We need to have more regard for housing mix.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#V00500","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#X00100","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I will conclude now.

Strategic housing development applications only form a small component of the different types of housing applications that go before the planning authorities or before An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The process is only for developments of 100 units or more.  In the two years in which it has been in operation, only 100 applications have been decided upon.

I will begin by setting out what the experience has been as a result of two very important initiatives relating to the planning process and the delivery of housing supply.  The review of the apartment guidelines has been instrumental in leading to a switch from a tendency towards peripheral housing estate-type development to a much greater emphasis on increasing the proportion of housing coming forward that is in more central urban areas in apartment-type developments.  This switch and the strategic housing process have led to a significant increase in investment and interest in housing development.  Many international investment funds are looking carefully at Ireland and putting a lot of money into the Irish housing system.  This money is going into planning applications and into delivery.  We are seeing a follow-through.  They are not spending money to speculate.  They are spending money to deliver the product on the ground.  We are now moving very much into the delivery phase.  I think we will see that coming forward on the ground.<\/p> <p>  I referred earlier to some examples of cases we have looked at.  It is the case that some sites are sold on after planning permission is obtained.  That is part of the funding process.  In two of the sample cases we have looked at, sites were sold on to fund development.  Those schemes are now going on site or are on site.  In all types of housing applications, including SHD applications, amended applications come forward as developers seek to respond to changes in market requirements.  Again, that helps the delivery process.  The combination of those two measures has been highly successful in levering in funds for housing supply and delivery.  I believe we will see the benefits of that coming through very strongly over the next year or two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#Z00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Spain"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":305,"content":"<p>As Senator Murnane O'Connor is a member of the committee, she can go next if she wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#Z00900","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

We have made our submissions, etc., on the basis of the recommendations made in Rebuilding Ireland, especially those relating to fast-tracking SHD.  In essence, we have not supported them but at this point we are seeking to be pragmatic.  It is now October 2019 and there is a proposal to extend the process for two years.  From a planning point of view, two years is very short-term.  We support it as an emergency measure but it is certainly not in line with our overall policy on the planning system.<\/p><p> Having said that, it is important to put some things into context.  The Irish Planning Institute and other parties really need to look at the planning system, especially the balance between the national, regional and local levels.  In recent times there has been considerable development at national level, and much of it has been positive.  I have in mind the national planning framework, the developing of planning guidelines, as referred to earlier, the Office of the Planning Regulator and the Land Development Agency.  Many of these developments are positive.  We need to work with them and develop them.  They will have a positive impact on the planning system.<\/p><p> On the other hand, we need to look at local level, as we mentioned earlier.  Expanding the resources and capabilities of local government and local planning authorities to enable them to carry out their planning functions is critical.  This means not only increasing the numbers of people in planning authorities but looking at the expertise that is there as well, especially in the context of the issues relating to delivery and development.  As planners we need to be far more engaged with the idea of delivery.  We need to see ourselves as partners in the development process as well, rather than leaving it at the planning permission stage, etc.  We need to look at our planning system.<\/p><p> As was mentioned earlier, good development management decisions cannot be made if good plans are not in place.  We need to put more emphasis on good local area plans and good development plans and so forth.  Other possibilities need to be explored outside this context.  SHD is really an issue within the planning system.  We could look down the line at the role of the regional assemblies, the regional spatial and economic strategies and the strategic plans at that level and their role in this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#AA01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor Norton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Is it just the application process?

It is a complex issue.  One point about the planning system is that it is inter-related.  The processes of plan-making, policies at national level, appeals, decision-making and delivery are closely related to each other.  I do not think anyone can simplistically take one aspect of the planning system and see it as solving a particular issue.  The roots of some of the problems in development management lie perhaps in the nature or robustness of the plan that sits behind it.  I do not believe that there is any one aspect of the planning system that operates in isolation.  Most people are familiar with permissions.  That is a real part of the planning process but many of the problems in the process go back to the plan-making process.  Perhaps the plans are not prescriptive or flexible enough.  Perhaps they could be out of date.  There are many areas affecting the delivery or ultimate outcomes.  There is no one thing.  That is why I am suggesting that we may need to take a more holistic view of the planning system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor Norton"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Norton.

There is experience of relying on a previous assessment of an application.  In contrast, under the SHD process, the local authorities meet the board at the tri-party meeting at the pre-application stage.

I am grateful for the insight into some of the mysteries of An Bord Plean&aacute;la - they are mysteries to the public in terms of how it works.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has made some decisions that have had a positive impact and I will discuss these briefly.  However, others defy logic.  I am keen to impress a message on all the contributors to take away today.  None of them mentioned quality of life or the families, couples and individuals involved.  Many in my constituency are in their mid-20s or mid-30s and have returned home to live with their parents - who were not expecting that to happen - in order to save to purchase homes.  They have discovered many of the planning applications in the constituency are build-to-rent.  We do not seem to pay any attention to the struggles and challenges that people face.  It is all very technical, cold and sterile language.  What we are about really is the provision of homes.  I will say a little more about that.<\/p> <p>  As my colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, stated, we supported the SHD process on the basis that it would put homes into play more quickly.  As a long-standing local authority member for close to 20 years, I have views on that.  It is an imperfect system.  We know that of the 16,000 odd units granted permission under the SHD process, some 6,000 odd have been constructed.  The experience in my constituency is that this process has not delivered homes.  It has delivered housing units, if it has delivered anything at all.  However, co-living, student accommodation and build-to-rent applications are predominately the nature of the applications that have been made.  We need to bring the human element back into this.<\/p><p>Rents for modest homes in different parts of my constituency start at &euro;2,000 and rise.  Of course, it is in a developer's interests and in the interests of speculators to build to rent.  The equivalent mortgage is between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,100.  I know of multiple examples of constituents who have managed to comply with Central Bank rules and who may have been paying &euro;1,800 or &euro;1,900 per month for rent.  Then they succeeded in getting a mortgage because they had a substantial down payment or deposit with the banks.  They found they were paying &euro;1,050 to &euro;1,100 per month for the mortgage, saving &euro;700 or &euro;800 and increasing disposable income.<\/p><p> An Bord Plean&aacute;la must listen to this.  We are talking about people's lives.  It is not a question of units, construction or speculation.  It is the biggest investment for these people in their lifetime.  Most of the witnesses look close to my age.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs to bring some humanity to the decisions it is making.  It needs to understand there are people behind this.<\/p><p> Constituents of mine include parents in their mid-60s who were looking forward to retirement.  They do not begrudge their adult children coming home but it was not what they anticipated.  Since their children cannot afford rents, they are coming home.  One mother told me her son was coming home and she did not know what he was doing but he had come home to reflect on whether to save or leave.  It is very much in the hands of the designers, planners, overseers and implementers to come up with ideas and practical plans for people rather than for speculators, builders or developers.  It should be for the end users, the people who are going to make their lives in these places.<\/p><p> There are several specific issues I want to raise relating to my constituency that concern planning applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#CC00600","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>The Deputy is already over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#DD00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I will make it quick.  Reference was made to local area plans.  I have a specific question relating to Citywest.  What if the local area plan is hopelessly out of date?  In the Citywest area there was a local area plan dating from 2012.  It never envisaged the density that has been applied for under the strategic housing development process.  Now we have multiple planning applications for high-density apartments that are built to rent.  One particular application related to Tallaght.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la dismissed it and said there was no context.  The board explained that if it granted permission, there would be development by stealth.  I would like to see the board look at Citywest and put it to South Dublin County Council that the 2012 local area plan for Fortunestown is hopelessly out of date and needs to be updated quickly.  Planning applications are going in for all the amenity land that was outlined in that local area plan.  The amenities envisaged under the 2012 plan are hopelessly outdated too.<\/p> <p>  No reference has been made to amenities today.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la may say it is not within the board's remit.  If an application is lodged and it doubles, triples or quadruples what was envisaged in the local area plan, then the decision-makers must look at doubling and tripling the amenities and obliging developers to provide amenities.<\/p> <p>  The same goes for the Scholarstown area.  The only reason people knew that a strategic housing development was being lodged for potentially more than 600 units, 500 of which are build to rent, in a settled mature residential area is that that pre-planning request appeared online by accident.<\/p> <p>  The main issues I have with the strategic housing development process are the lack of visibility and democratic input, aside from writing a letter.  There is no forwards and backwards with officials like this or like we used to have at planning meetings in the local authority.<\/p> <p>  The deputations said the local authorities were highly involved in the process, and I take that point.  The local council may be closely and intimately involved in a detailed way, but local councillors are not and they represent the democratic mandate.  This all seems to the public to be invisible.  There is a complete lack of transparency.  Decisions are made without any apparent context.  I will leave the deputations with three messages and I thank them for their forbearance.<\/p><p>We are talking about people.  The witnesses have not mentioned people and in their commentary regarding increases in density, they did not mention amenities.  People and amenities do not appear to be on their minds at all.  People in mature residential areas will justifiably question what is in this for them.  Many of them have lived in these areas for years and made their homes in them.  I am speaking not about new urban areas, but mature residential areas in which people are used to a quality of life and a particular way of living.  They will have this imposed on them without any consideration of their needs in the context of the desire to expand densities in their living space.  I wish I had more time because there is a lot more I would like to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#DD00300","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Hyde to respond first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#EE00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to our opening statement.

Planning often is about trade-offs.  I am encouraged to note that practice is improving in some areas, particularly around plan-making.  Good local plans are informed by good principles of place-making and the application of key skills such as urban design.  In recent times, we have seen very good examples of this.  It is only in this way that we will get the proper development management outcomes.  The plan is extremely important.  We often forget about that.

We must remember that nobody in this House had a democratic right to vote on the framework.  There was no democratic input into the national planning framework.  We are now asking communities that have not had their local area plans reviewed for many years - Newtownmountkennedy, for example, has not had a review for 20 years - to accept that they have no right of appeal when an SHD application is made.  All they can do is make a submission.  It is unfair because no community can afford a judicial review.

Our communities are our heart.  If we do not bring them with us, we are wasting our time.  This is a reflection on the process, rather than on the board itself.<\/p> <p>  I would like to mention a few specifics.  We spoke earlier about the second round of consultation.  I want to tease this out.  I have to say I still consider 36% as a failure.  Are the witnesses telling us that these developers were informed at the end of the second part of the public consultation process - I am not talking about the part with the local authorities - that they would be wasting their time in the absence of serious significant information, such as an environmental impact assessment?  If, as it seems, the developers proceeded to submit an application directly to the board, can they be said to be serious about delivering homes or are they merely interested in getting planning permission to flip the land?<\/p> <p>  I ask for the indulgence of the Chair because I have been sitting here since this morning.  I think I am entitled to a bit more than two minutes.  Having spent three years on the whole housing issue, I keep coming back to the question of local democracy.  I am increasingly of the opinion that local authorities, local area plans and county development plans need to be taken to another level completely.  Local area plans and county development plans set out how communities will be delivered and what type of infrastructure is needed.  As somebody said here a week ago, there is a need for 3D planning that allows people to see how their communities will develop.  That would allow us to start penalising developers who do not deliver.  The infrastructure, the zoned land, the densities and the height are there.  Too many unknowns are going into the SHDs.  People have no input into them.<\/p> <p>  We all want to see planning working.  We all want to see homes delivered.  That is our purpose here.  To be quite honest, I do not know whether the SHD process has delivered that at the end of the day.  Ms Kenny said there has been an increase of 16% from the normal process.  The success rate or approval rating for what has been put in has increased from 50% to 67%.  I do not think that is a good return in light of the effort that has been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#GG00300","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":348,"content":"<p>The Deputy has spoken for more than four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#GG00400","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":349,"content":"<p>On public information and IT, the board appeared before the committee and stated that it would upgrade its website.

Will they indicate how many of them are members of the IPI?  I am somewhat disappointed with Mr. Corr because I have picked up mixed messages from him in the context of his written submission to the committee versus his oral contributions during the meeting.  I get a sense of milk and water, although I do not mean that disrespectfully, as to how he made his case for IPI members, some of whom I know personally.  Each guest might identify whether he or she is a member of the IPI because some members are observing the meeting.  I am disappointed because what Mr. Corr has told the committee is not altogether consistent with what other members of the organisation have told me.<\/p> <p>  I stated earlier that the centralisation of planning function is fundamentally at odds with the principles of subsidiarity.  The IPI cannot, therefore, stand over any extension of the time for SHD.  Let us remember, we are discussing a review of the SHD process.<\/p> <p>  Where does each member of the committee stand?  In a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer, are they in support of an extension of SHD for a further two years?<\/p> <p>  I asked a question earlier but did not get a response.  I would be particularly interested in Mr. Spain's and Dr. Duffy's responses.  I would like a specific, focused answer on the introduction of a land value tax for sites that have received permission via SHD.  I doubt PII's members want it and, therefore, Mr. Spain and Dr. Duffy might believe they are unable to respond.  Nevertheless, I ask the question on behalf of the committee and would like a response today.<\/p> <p>  SHD should be scrapped.  It is an affront to democracy and to the democratic planning process.  It does not permit elected representatives on local councils throughout the country participate in the development of sustainable communities or represent their constituents or their people.  That is fundamentally wrong and runs deeply contrary to the Aarhus Convention.  I will challenge it and, leaving the meeting with more resolve, I undertake to engage with the Green Party, which is very much to the fore of the political movement in the House, as well as in Europe, in the run-up to a general election.  We need to examine whether the Houses of the Oireachtas support something that is at variance with the Aarhus Convention.  I believe that it is at variance and we Members need to get political about it.  We must mobilise our communities and say enough is enough.  We live in a Republic, with a capital R, and in a democracy, with a capital D, and we must respect and allow our public and local representatives to engage, but this is an affront to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#HH00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Let us remember that SHDs exist because the Oireachtas voted for them, although I voted against them.  I say that only in deference to our guests.<\/p> <p>  To return to what Mr. Corr said earlier, I believe we do need cheerleaders for local authorities, which were wrongly blamed for the delays in the planning process even though they were due to the design of the planning process, which is a central government matter.  Industry, too, had a responsibility in respect of its engagement with the process.<\/p><p>Not all of us who object to SHDs are opposed to increased densities.  I am a strong advocate of increased densities in urban centres.  I live in the suburbs and believe there is a role for increased densities in the urban cores of suburbs, a position I will defend even if I lose votes over it.  Nevertheless, it concerns me sometimes that any politician who wishes to engage in the planning process through third party submissions and appeals is automatically branded as nimbyistic.  While I do not mean that anyone at the meeting has suggested that, it is part of the public debate.  Many of us, in advocating for increased density, also want to ensure there is adequate infrastructure, public transport and so on.  The difficulty is that while the board or planning authority can make a decision on the plan, it cannot control whether adequate investment in public transport, amenities and so on will follow.  I wish to defend the rights of members of the public and politicians to engage in the process because that is important.<\/p><p> I challenge Mr. Spain on one point.  He is correct that the SHDs and the new apartment design guidelines have increased the level of investment in the sector, but they have also reduced standards.  The new apartment design standards will significantly reduce the size of apartments, including for families.  I am not against build-to-rent in principle but there is increased flexibility for more studio apartments, for example, and there will be increased numbers of smaller apartments in areas where they are not needed.  In the urban centre of Dublin, for instance, what are needed are more two and three-bedroom apartments to allow families live there for life, rather than small apartments.<\/p><p> I return to the legal difference between the planning authority and the board in respect of county development plans.  It is important we understand the matter.  Am I correct that the board has to have regard for the development plan only when a planning authority has to comply with it?  For example, in the controversial case of St. Anne's Park, a city manager can oppose the proposition but the board can approve it because there is a legal difference in respect of the approach.  Will Ms Kenny confirm that?<\/p><p> I asked Mr. Corr a question and it may have slipped his mind.  If SHDs are to continue, although I would prefer if they did not, are there mechanisms we could put in place to monitor them independently, in order that the kinds of abuses about which some of us are concerned could be identified and teased out?<\/p><p> Finally, I turn to Dr. Duffy.  If fast-tracking applications is the only measure that concerns him in respect of this issue, rather than undermining the city and county development plans - I will take him at his word in that regard - I presume he would have no difficulty with local authorities being given the primary responsibility to make such decisions if the same period, namely, the all-in 22 to 24 weeks that is currently dealt with under SHDs, was dealt with by local authorities.  I presume that the problem is with the 22 or 24-week period rather than whether it is the local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la that makes the primary decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#HH00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I have concerns that in the past two years, there have been 100 cases.  Sixty-seven were granted and 34 were refused.  There is a housing crisis and the reason the committee invited the board to appear before it was to sort out issues.  We all agree on the need for proper planning but there cannot be a system where 67 cases are granted and 34 refused when the board is the body that exists to try to work with the system.  It was a big let-down.  I live in County Carlow, which is classed as rural Ireland, and we need houses to be built.  Given that the board deals with planning and housing, I am sure that it understands the need for local authorities to build houses.  I hope that, following the process, there will be some sort of recognition that we need to fast-track housing applications and build houses.  Recently, as our guests have probably encountered, local authorities seem to use more approved housing bodies, which have become very important.  Will our guests comment on that?<\/p> <p>  My greatest concern, which was raised, is that the issue relates to people's quality of life and their home.  One's home is like one's castle.

This is a really important point.<\/p> <p>  I shall now ask questions because that is what the Chairman wants me to do.  My first is for the representatives of the IPI.  I am not asking Mr. Hyde to repeat himself.  He stated very clearly that planning is not the major cause of delay; rather, it is not moving on planning permission given.  Mr. Hyde made two points of note, one being on development teams and active land management.  I am not asking him to repeat anything but I wonder whether he has anything more to say about the active plan-management proposals.  On the use-it-or-lose-it element, Mr. Corr stated that, in addition to the vacant site levy, other measures could possibly be introduced that would address this element of the delay.  While I agree we absolutely need houses, we also need to deal with where the delays are rather than where they are not.  That is an important point.<\/p> <p>  My other questions are for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  One follows on from what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said about having regard to development plans versus complying with them.  Could Ms Kenny outline how she balances the provisions of development plans and area plans with Government policy, which is clearly supportive of this particular measure?  How does she make the judgment in her decisions?<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to the point made by Deputy Darragh O'Brien on applications that are changed.  How many approvals have been superseded by new proposals?  I have an email from a Dublin councillor on an application for a shared-living development.

It is impossible to say 30% this way or 50% that way.  Each proposal is examined on its merits.  The board cannot control the proposals submitted to it.  We can give advice but it is up to the individual applicants to make applications that they regard as fitting and to push the boundaries as much as they believe is appropriate.  There will always be issues outside their control, particularly regarding environmental or infrastructural deficits.  We cannot always control these.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point regarding the legal difference between the board and the planning authority in terms of development plans, a planning authority cannot materially contravene its own plan without going through a specific process relating to material contravention.  If it submits an application that it supports and gets three quarters of the councillors to vote in favour of it, then it can do so.  Therefore, there is a mechanism for the planning authorities to grant permission for developments that materially contravene their plans.  It is just a different process than the one the board goes through.  There are often nuances within a local area plan.  The planning authorities interpret them as they do but they will not materially contravene a plan without going through the process.  It is available to them, however, so they can materially contravene their own plans.<\/p> <p>  Equally, the board can materially contravene a plan only if it has regard to the provisions regarding inconsistencies or ambiguities in a development plan, a local area plan, national policy or the changing circumstances in the specific environment.

On monitoring outputs in this process, it may be useful to have a qualitative analysis of some of the outputs of strategic housing development if it is to continue.  The SHD regulations came into effect in July 2017.

As I stated, we wish to be pragmatic about this and supportive of initiatives made within the context of a larger review of the planning system which may be needed.<\/p><p>The more specific issue of active land management was raised.  Planners have a particular role in that regard in terms of planning and getting more engaged with its delivery aspect.  There are some examples of good practice evolving around the country although they have not been codified.  Active land management is probably all about understanding in a better way what sort of land is available, its ownership and the level of activity on it, such as whether it is inactive or undeveloped.  On a deeper level, consideration could be given to the reasons land is inactive or underdeveloped and seeking to understand that on a site by site or parcel by parcel basis.  Further, one could identify strategies for individual parcels of land within a larger area-based approach.  IPI members have asked us to provide continuing professional development training on that on and we are working on a programme for planners in the area of active land management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#MM00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor Norton","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I am probably unique among the witnesses in that I am not a member of the Irish Planning Institute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#NN00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>There you go, Senator Boyhan.

We will meet representatives from Pavee Point, the National Traveller Women's Forum, Minc&eacute;ir Whiden, the Kilmallock Traveller Women&rsquo;s Group and the Traveller Primary Health Care Project, and officials from the Department of Health.  I welcome Ms Brigid Quirke, Pavee Point; Ms Maria Joyce, National Traveller Women's Forum; Ms Kathleen Sherlock, Minc&eacute;ir Whidden; Ms Nora Mooney, Kilmallock Traveller Women&rsquo;s Group; Ms Missie Collins, Traveller Primary Health Care Project; and Mr. Jim Walsh, principal officer, and Ms. Dairearca N&iacute; N&eacute;ill, assistant principal officer, from the drugs policy and social inclusion unit of the Department of Health.<\/p><p>We will hear of the gross and stark health inequalities that affect Travellers' health.  The figures for life expectancy are mentioned in so many submissions, with a life expectancy of 66 years for Traveller men, which is 15 years less than the average, and 12 years less than average for Traveller women.  Traveller babies are 3.6 times more likely to die in infancy than among the mainstream population and Traveller mortality in general is 3.5 times higher.  In recent weeks, we have had the stark figures on suicide rates, which, of course, are part of health.  Today, we are focusing on health more generally and we will move now to hear the submissions.  As there are many witnesses, we will be strict about the five-minute rule because if some take seven minutes, the person at the end gets squeezed, which is not particularly fair.  The clerk will remind us at the four-minute mark that the speaker has one minute left.  It is very important that members have a chance to put questions to the witnesses and have a proper discussion and debate about this very important and stark set of health inequalities and disparities around Traveller health.<\/p><p>In accordance with procedures, I am required to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

We must start the submission, as we always do, by stating the obvious: the Traveller community is in crisis.  The evidence is there for everyone to see.  The Traveller community is at the top of every negative statistic and the bottom of every positive outcome in Irish society, whether education, employment, health, life expectancy, mental health, addiction and now the escalating suicide rates.  The fact is that we are haemorrhaging people through chronic illness, ill health, addiction and now suicide.  The underlying causes are poverty and poor living conditions, social isolation and exclusion.  We in the Travelling community are losing our ability to cope and to endure.  We are dealing with layers upon layers of grief.  For decades the Traveller community has experienced unrelenting anti-Traveller bias and racism.  We are the most disadvantaged, discriminated against and marginalised community within Irish society.  Urgent action is needed to turn these challenges around.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Traveller population is currently fewer than 40,000.  Today we are talking about the inequalities in Traveller health and mental health and the actions needed to address these inequalities.  In doing so we cannot leave out the factors that contribute to the crisis in Traveller health and mental health.  This is a crisis in Traveller accommodation, poor educational attainment among the Traveller community and high levels of unemployment, social exclusion and anti-Traveller bias and racism.  These issues are interlinked and negatively impact Traveller health and well-being.  To resolve the crisis and the destruction we are witnessing within the Travelling community, we must understand their interconnectivity and take a holistic approach in addressing each of these issues.  These are not insurmountable issues to fix.  With commitment and resolution they can be fixed, and we will be a better people and a better country for it.  The neglect and inequality the Traveller community and pockets of deprived, long-term disadvantaged communities throughout Ireland have experienced and endured are a stain on the character of the nation and must be put right.  Ireland is only a small country but we stand proud with the nations around the world for the contributions our country has made on the world stage.  We must, however, address the internal challenges and support the people our nation has left behind for far too long.  Successive Governments have failed to put in place decisive actions to resolve the inequalities which exist within our country and which have allowed so many of our people to be left behind, doing the best they can and trying to survive in conditions and with challenges that in many cases are hard to imagine in a first-world country such as Ireland.  Sadly, too often the contributions made by individuals from the Traveller community and disadvantaged communities throughout Ireland that have made our nation what it is have been forgotten or underappreciated.<\/p> <p>  As a nation we cannot continue to blame people and communities for the marginalised, disadvantaged and deprived situations they were born into and are trying to survive in.  It is time to reach out and pull up the citizens of our nation that have been left behind.  We are not a problem people.  We are not problem communities.  We are people and communities with problems that are the direct result of generational poverty and exclusion.  We need help and support to overcome the challenges our communities are facing, decisive Government actions and the implementation of equality-based policies to address these inequalities and challenges.<\/p> <p>  I will outline some statistics relating to the Travelling community.  Life expectancy for Traveller men is 15 years younger than in wider society, for Traveller women 11 years younger.  Our infant mortality rate is 3.7% higher than that of the general population.  Suicide among Travelling men is just under seven times higher and now accounts for the deaths of 11% of Travellers annually.  We currently have no statistics on the suicide rate among Travelling women, but this has become a very worrying trend in recent years.<\/p><p>A number of young Travellers, boys and girls, have also committed suicide.<\/p><p> I will outline some of our key recommendations.  A national Traveller action plan should be published and implemented urgently.  This should include the establishment of an institutional mechanism, within the HSE and the Department of Health, to drive delivery and implementation.  This must be inclusive of clear targets, indicators and outcomes, timeframes and budgets.  Sl&aacute;intecare also recommends access to universal free general  practitioner, GP, healthcare within the next five years.  We recommend that Travellers be prioritised and fast-tracked in this process.  We further recommend, with immediate effect, that all Traveller employment and primary healthcare projects are entitled to medical care similar to disability, community services programmes and community employment schemes.  This would involve in the region of 300 medical cards.<\/p><p> Traveller-specific infrastructure, including Traveller health and primary healthcare projects, should be protected and receive increased resources for their expansion and development in line with the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  It is important that health reforms do not undermine the work in progress of the Traveller health units, THUs, given their institutional knowledge and impact on the ground.  It must also be ensured that clear budgets are allocated and protected to address Traveller health and inequalities.<\/p><p> Finally, a national Traveller suicide intervention and prevention strategy needs to be implemented urgently.  Some of the statistics that we do not have-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen Sherlock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":528,"content":"<p>Ms Sherlock has reached the end of her allotted time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#E00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I will finish there.

We have provided a comprehensive submission, which will serve as a reference document, and we are also available if the members of the committee require any further information.  We will give a quick overview of the issues involved and leave time for discussion at the end, as we feel that is the best use of time.  We would like to highlight the key issues in the area of Traveller health, including the poor health status of Travellers, the impact of broader social determinants, to which Ms Sherlock referred, the positive developments that have occurred and the need for investment in a strategic and co-ordinated response to address these Traveller health issues.<\/p> <p>  I will now contextualise Traveller health within the broader social determinants.  There is a need to recognise the causal pathways, which include discrimination, education, employment and accommodation.  If we are to realistically address Traveller health inequalities, we need a whole-of-Government approach in addressing these determinants.  We commend the work of the committee to date in exploring these issues and recommend that other thematic sessions should include questions on their impact on Travellers' health.<\/p> <p>  Next year will mark a decade since the publication of the comprehensive all-Ireland Traveller health study.  That took three and a half years to complete, cost taxpayers &euro;1.3 million and involved a concerted effort between Traveller organisations, Traveller peer researchers from primary healthcare projects and researchers in UCD.  The study yielded an unprecedented participation rate of 80%, an exceptional response.  The evidence of the study, which we keep highlighting, showed that Travellers have the lowest life expectancy of any group in Ireland.  Overall life expectancy for Travellers is 66, with Traveller men living some 15 years less and Traveller women some 11 years less than their counterparts.<\/p> <p>  In addition to those statistics on infant mortality and overall mortality, it is important to note that the study suggested that institutional discrimination does exist within the health services.  Less than half of all Travellers had complete trust in health professionals compared with trust levels in the general population, according to a study.  More than half of Travellers were concerned about the quality of care they receive when they engage with the service.  Some 40% of Travellers reported discrimination in accessing health services.  This was supported by almost 70% of the service providers, who agreed that their services discriminated against Travellers.  Services providers were also interviewed in the study to determine what they felt were the issues.<\/p> <p>  We know from the study that Travellers are dying from the same causes as the general population.  They are not dying of any exotic illnesses particular to Travellers, they are dying of heart disease, cancer, respiratory disease and suicide.   They are, however, dying in far greater numbers across all ages.  If this was any other group in Irish society, it would be seen as a national crisis.<\/p><p>However, as our colleagues have pointed out, the findings of the study have been largely ignored.  When they were published in 2010, we were told no action could be taken as there were no resources available due to the recession.  Despite the recovery, we still have no action and Traveller health continues to deteriorate.  We believe it is not prioritised within the Department, or within Government, and we require leadership and urgent action.<br\/><br\/>It would be remiss not to acknowledge that some very positive developments have occurred in the past 20 years, in particular the development of a strong Traveller health infrastructure at national, regional and local level.  I refer also to the establishment of the National Traveller Health Advisory Committee.  That was a structure within the Department of Health that represented Travellers, the HSE and the Department.  It was responsible for the development of Traveller health policy and it had oversight of the Traveller health budget.  Its achievements include the publication of the Traveller health strategy in 2002, the piloting of the ethnic identifier, which has now been rolled out, and the groundbreaking All-Ireland Traveller Health Study.<br\/><br\/>We acknowledge that the committee heard last week that the National Traveller Health Advisory Committee was reviewed and that a recommendation was made to disband the group.  However, that was not the case and, in its absence, there are no representative mechanisms to drive a response to the detailed findings.  As we said, we have a lot of evidence and many strategies; we need an implementation plan.<br\/><br\/>We are awaiting the establishment of an essential structure to monitor Traveller health policy and mainstream Traveller health across the Department in line with the commitments in the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS.<br\/><br\/>At regional level, we have the Traveller health units, which are partnership structures between HSE and local Traveller groups coterminous with the original health boards, through which Traveller health issues are highlighted and mainstreamed into regional health service provision.<br\/><br\/>In addition to national and regional structures, the Primary Health Care for Travellers projects at local level, which have been acknowledged as the cornerstone on which health services are delivered effectively to Travellers, were clearly reflected in the All Ireland Traveller Health Study, with 83% of Travellers receiving health information from the primary healthcare projects.  There is also a higher uptake of cervical screening and breast cancer screening in areas where the projects exist.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, this Traveller health infrastructure has weakened due to lack of investment in the past ten years, leading to the closure of a number of these essential projects.<br\/><br\/>There has been disproportionate disinvestment in Traveller health which pre-dated austerity.  This was when the budget was transferred from the Department to the local health structure.  This was identified in 2009 to the Joint Committee on Health and Children in which we highlighted that in 2007, &euro;1 million was allocated for Traveller health developments, of which &euro;100,000 was allocated towards the All Ireland Traveller Health Study, with the remainder put towards balancing the HSE budget.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, in 2008, a further &euro;1 million was allocated to Traveller health developments.  The HSE introduced a stipulation that one could only spend in 2008 what one spent in 2007, therefore, once again, &euro;900,000 of the Traveller health budget went to balancing the HSE budget.  Of a potential &euro;2 million for Traveller health development funding, given Traveller health status, the All Ireland Traveller Health Study and the significant needs, &euro;1.8 million was used to balance the HSE books.  We believe this reflects a lack of prioritisation of Traveller health and a disregard for Traveller health inequalities.  Traveller health has not received any new development funding from the Department of Health.  There has been once-off funding and money given towards the employment of mental health workers locally.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the commitment in Action 73 of the NTRIS to develop a detailed action plan with clear targets, indicators, timeframes and resources.  A robust consultation process produced the first draft of the action plan, which totally ignored some of the recommendations from the consultation process.  While we would like to acknowledge the HSE's commitment to revise the plan, there is a need to ensure that the revised plan includes the establishment of a new institutional mechanism under the aegis of the Department of Health and the HSE to drive the implementation of the plan.  <br\/><br\/>Our recommendations are the same as those of my colleagues from Minc&eacute;ir Whiden.  The need for ethnic equality monitoring is the last one.  We need to roll out the ethnic identifier across all health and social care administrative systems.  We require that to monitor access, participation and outcomes in terms of all services for Travellers.  This will provide an evidence base to inform Traveller health policy and service utilisation in the future.  It would also help to target and ensure more effectiveness and efficiency in the health service.  It will also ensure that under section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014 there will be a statutory requirement on public health bodies which are mandated to take proactive steps to assess equality and eliminate discrimination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Brigid Quirke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Quirke.

This is not new information and it should definitely not be this difficult to have our community's issues heard and acted upon.<\/p> <p>  In our written submission we have raised many issues and put forward recommendations, but for today I just want to emphasise one issue, namely, that the current national health structures and very limited policy implementation that has taken place for the advancement of Traveller and Traveller women's health have failed to have any meaningful long-term impact overall.  Achievements have been made locally and regionally by Travellers and Traveller organisations, including primary healthcare projects, but we should also recognise the contributions made by individual healthcare and HSE professionals.  However, while the Department of Health continues to behave like an absentee landlord, ignoring the need for structural and institutional changes in the health service's thinking and practice, we will progress no further.<\/p> <p>  As our submission points out, the studies and research have been done, and the findings, as the committee has heard from Kathleen and Brigid, are stark and shocking, yet there has been no targeted strategy or action plan put in place to address the health inequalities for Travellers since Traveller Health: A National Strategy 2002-2005 and the national intercultural strategy over a five-year period, which ended in 2012.  Health issues for Travellers have been excluded entirely from all mainstream health related strategies, including the current Healthy Ireland framework.  I suggest that members google the document.  There are two references to other strategies within it with regard to Travellers.  The only direction that the Department of Health appears to want to go down is to pigeonhole all matters concerning Traveller health into social inclusion.  This is not the answer, and again the question has to be asked how long more we have to wait for the Department of Health to meet its own policy commitments to Travellers.  We need implementation.<\/p> <p>  Nine years after the launch of the all-Ireland Traveller health study in 2010, as Brigid has said, there is still no Department lead and there are no personnel with a brief on Traveller policy within the Department of Health.  It has been more than two years since a commitment was made to develop and implement a detailed national Traveller action plan based on the findings of this study using a social determinant approach.  Yet as has been said, Travellers continue to die from cancer, heart disease and other preventable conditions, including death by suicide, in greater numbers than the majority population.  Of course we cannot demonstrate that with hard data because there is still no desegregated data collection across all of the health systems in Ireland, and I will say that that suits the Department in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Regional Traveller health units are under-resourced and their funding has not been ring-fenced for Traveller health.  Despite underspends in some Traveller health budgets, the HSE in some regions made cuts to key services for Travellers under cost-saving measures, reducing the hours of Traveller community health workers and other supports.  In one region the Traveller health unit has not met, despite efforts by Traveller groups in the area to make it happen.  There also needs to be more accountability and transparency within the health system in relation to Traveller health budgets.  In addition to this, the national Traveller health advisory committee, which was the driver behind the all-Ireland Traveller health study, has not been convened since 2012, despite repeated calls by Traveller organisations.  Members will have heard Brigid say at a previous meeting that it was a recommendation that it would not continue to meet.  That was misleading to this committee.  That was not the case<\/p> <p>  In 2017, we saw the launch of the national Traveller health-Roma inclusion strategy, with a range of actions on health.  We are still awaiting the long-promised national Traveller action plan from the Department of Health.  Another commitment was also made by the Department to review and improve existing arrangements for engagement between Traveller organisations, the HSE and the Department of Health.  In May 2018, the Department, the HSE and organisations participated in a workshop where our views and position were made very clear around a number of issues, including the effect of monitoring and implementation of Traveller policy, the need for institutional mechanisms representative of all stakeholders to drive the implementation, and dedicated resources - financial and personnel.  These issues and other issues are being raised continually by all stakeholders with little response from the Department of Health.  A draft of the national Traveller health action plan was circulated for feedback in March 2019.<\/p><p>The draft document was inadequate and demonstrated the lack of attention and commitment the Department of Health has given to addressing the health inequalities of Travellers.  The repeated request is that the Department of Health urgently address the issues we have raised here today by finalising and, more importantly, implementing a holistic and gender responsive national Traveller health action plan which will deliver, hopefully, real change in health outcomes for Travellers.  An independent implementation body must be established and much have ring-fenced budgets in order to drive delivery and implementation.  There are more recommendations in our submission but I will not go through them now.<\/p><p> The issue is implementation.  The studies, statistics and evidence are available.  Travellers are dying in greater numbers and at earlier ages than is the case in the majority population.  How much more of that evidence is required before there is action?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I am a Traveller from Kilmallock in east County Limerick.  I am married with two children, one in secondary school and one in preschool.  I represent Travellers in east Limerick on the HSE Traveller health unit and I am chairperson of the Kilmallock Traveller Women's Group, which was formed in April 2017.  It is a lively, vibrant group that is ready to stand up and be counted.  We are committed to working towards changing outcomes for Travellers.  It is a mixed age group made up of grandmothers, mothers and young single women.  In the short period since it was established, the group has also set up Kilmallock Traveller Men's Group.  Ours is a voluntary group with no staff.  We are dependent on volunteers.  We are supported by Ballyhoura Development and receive funding from the HSE Traveller health unit for our group activities.  We appreciate the opportunity to attend this meeting so members can hear about the situation in which we find ourselves in east Limerick.<\/p> <p>  Recently, an assessment examining the health needs of Travellers in east Limerick was carried out by Ballyhoura Development.  I was the Traveller representative on the steering group for the project.  This was the first meaningful engagement with the Traveller community in east Limerick.  The methodology used to conduct the research was peer-led, which meant that members of the Traveller community were employed directly to carry out the survey.  I am proud of the work the team of peer researchers completed.  The outcomes from the report are not just findings, but our real life health issues which are not being addressed in a way that supports change for us.  In this day and age and in this country, can one believe that only 29 out of 424 Traveller individuals in east Limerick are over 50 years of age?  Worse, only three are over 65 years of age.  One of them is my father.  It frightens me to think that I might not see 50 years of age and that I am much less likely to reach the age of 65 years.  For how long do the members of the committee expect to live?  I am due to retire in 23 years' time.  Our recent assessment demonstrates that I will more than likely not be around for this.  It appears there will be no need for the old age pension or the fair deal scheme for me.<\/p> <p>  I wondered how I might get the committee to understand where we are coming from and how our health issues impact on our lives and those of our children.  Now that we have completed the assessment we realise its seriousness and the time limits in which we must achieve change.  The stereotype of Travellers has led to discrimination in all sectors, including education.  My experience of education was not positive at the start.  When I was in primary school, I was automatically segregated into a remedial class, without reason or assessment but simply because I am a Traveller.  I often spent hours in the playground singing instead of being in class learning, which I was well capable of.  It is no wonder that we are such good singers today, or is that another stereotype?<\/p> <p>  It was only when I was old enough to realise that I was being treated differently and told my mother that the situation changed.  It was because of my mother's belief in my ability and her perseverance that I was eventually integrated back into the regular class.  Since then I have completed secondary and third level education.  I am forever grateful for my mother's intuition, but 30 years later I find myself doing the same thing for my children.  What has improved?  I know from the personal experience of my immediate family that the low expectation of Travellers to perform well in education continues, along with segregation and discrimination.  If we cannot change this discrimination in primary school, where can we change it?<\/p> <p>  Do members realise that 48% of my community in east Limerick live in mobile homes or trailers?  While I am lucky to have my house, and the mortgage to go with it, some of my family have been on a council housing waiting list for more than 16 years.  That is 16 years of living in damp, mouldy, overcrowded conditions.  Is it any wonder that our life expectancy is so low?<\/p> <p>  Some 80% of Travellers are unemployed compared to 5% of the general population.<\/p><p>We need meaningful employment opportunities for Travellers.  I want to be able to ask my children what they would like to be when they grow up and to know there are no barriers preventing them from realising their dreams.  <\/p><p> I cannot leave today without mentioning mental health and how the conditions and situations in which we find ourselves are impacting on our mental health.  Every day, I see how mental health issues affect the people I love and care for.  How many family and friends do members think I have lost?  How long could they hold the weight of these factors on their shoulders?  None of these issues is standalone.  They are all interlinked and contribute to the multiple layers of disadvantage continuously experienced by my community.  What can we do about it?  Where is the innovation and the new ways of thinking, for example, Traveller-led methodologies across all sectors, including housing, education and health?  This means that models similar to primary healthcare projects are applied across other sectors, specifically education and housing.  We know this way of working achieves great results.  For example, the assessment carried out in east Limerick identified 113% more Travellers than the census in 2016 identified.  Ours is one of the best educated countries in the world.  Why are we continuously using one-trick pony solutions when it comes to Traveller welfare?  In east Limerick we are already on the brink of losing our oldest generation.  We need support and resources to bring about change for our community.  The first step for east Limerick is the establishment of a Traveller health primary healthcare team.  While we have received a commitment in principle from the HSE, time is running out.  Do I not deserve to be around to see my grandchildren grow up?  We see ourselves as advocates for our community and we already bear the weight of our community on our shoulders.  It is up to us to find the solutions, be the listeners, make the connections and find the words to help but we cannot do this without the support of this committee.

It is a great honour.  I must start at the very beginning, when the primary healthcare project started.  I was one of the people who approached the health board back in the 1990s.  It was 1992, I believe.  There were about 14 people sitting at the table.  When I said that we needed primary healthcare for Travellers, I was told that it would not work.  When I asked why, I was told that it would mean Travellers going out, talking to Travellers and moreover, Travellers are not educated, cannot drive and cannot do this, that and the other.  I said that our need was greater than ever.  We did not win that day but when I was coming away from the table, I said that I would be back.  Back I went to a member of staff.  He said, \"You're not giving up Missie, are you?\" and I said no, that I was not giving up.  He agreed to a pilot for nine months.  I asked if he could do a little more than that and he asked me what I meant.  I asked him to come to the steering group meetings so that he would know how the project was going and he did.<\/p> <p>  In the beginning we visited 85 families.  Now we are visiting 300 families.  We devised our own questionnaire, went through it with them and found out all of their needs.  Then we took that back to Pavee Point and to the health providers and services there.  At that time, three needs came out of the process, namely, a well woman clinic for our women, a hearing test for the children and a dental service.  One of the aims of the project is to try to close the gaps in the health service.  That went on and we got all of the answers there and it went very well.<\/p><p>We were able to take some of our women over to the Well Woman where some of them with breast cancer were caught in time.  We saved the lives of some of our women.  Some of them are living in the programme today.  <\/p><p> As part of the programme, we mapped out the provisions for children out on the sites, who would then go for their hearing and other tests.  Those of us involved in this programme attended meetings with the top officials in the Department of Health and Children.  I thought it was great for me to be able to sit at meetings with the higher up bodies who need to give the Travellers support.  We lobbied for a health strategy for Travellers and it took many hours over a nine year period of sitting round the table at meetings in the Department of Health and Children.  There were 27 recommendations in the health strategy for Travellers, one of which was for an All Ireland Traveller Health Study to be carried out by Travellers for Travellers from one end of Ireland to the other.  I have to say that is the greatest piece of work we did.  We got all the information, and one thing that we counted as a good outcome, is when the health providers and services were upfront and stated that they did discriminate against Travellers.  The former Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney, was the then Minister when I launched the All Ireland Traveller Health Study.  I held that report over my head and I was proud to do so.  I believed that the recommendations of that report would be implemented but I was very disappointed that it did not happen.  I always say to myself: \"Where is that All Ireland Traveller Health Study report now?  What shelf is it on in the Department of Health?\"<\/p><p> The report compiled the statistics on the life expectancy of Travellers, and I know at first hand about life expectancy because I lost my husband when he was a young man.  I have lost brothers and sisters when they were young people.  There is nobody who can tell me about life expectancy better than what I know from my experience.  Things will have to change.  Travellers' health is at crisis point.  We want a commitment on services for Travellers.  Since 1994 I have been chasing Ministers for Health and I have met them.  I gave a former Minister, Mary Harney a fright when I followed her out.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Harris is a very nice man and he promised me that the Traveller Accommodation Programme, TAP, meetings would come under the Department of Health.  Who is blocking this happening?  Is it the Department of Health that is blocking it?  I get angry and I have to say what is on my mind.   I want that meeting to happen again.  We should be sitting at that table.   <\/p><p> The Traveller primary care workers only work for 12 hours a week, yet some of our women have lost their medical cards because their income was a couple of euros above the limit.  Seeing that Travellers have very poor health, all Travellers should be entitled to hold their medical cards.  If there are full-time jobs for younger Traveller women, they should get them because the primary health care projects are the greatest thing that ever happened for Travellers.  <\/p><p> I do not think there is much more for me to say because others have said it, but I repeat that I would like medical cards to be issued to young Travellers.  Let me add that the Minister of State is accompanied by officials from many agencies, who all have a role to play in improving Travellers' health.<\/p><p>There is a broader picture to it.  The determinants of health are discrimination, bad living conditions, unemployment and education.  These are the four that come up.  I know that from visiting the sites, seeing young mothers and old people.  We only have a fistful of old people &ndash; seven - over the age of 80.  I live in group housing and seven young men out of the 50 houses have died.  We have hardly any men left.  It has to change for us and change fast.  When I meet a Minister or someone from one of the bodies, there is no use in him promising me to try to change it.  It has to happen for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Missie Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571698800,"counter":544,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":545,"content":"<p>Thank you, Missie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#L00300","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":546,"content":"<p>It is all right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Missie Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":547,"content":"<p>That definitely deserved a round of applause.

I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Dairearca N&iacute; N&eacute;ill, who is the assistant principal officer with specific responsibility for Traveller health matters.<\/p> <p>  I am relatively new to the post but I come with much understanding of Traveller and inequality issues, having worked with the Combat Poverty Agency and the social inclusion division of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I have much understanding of the issues and concerns raised by the previous speakers this morning.<\/p> <p>  The all-Ireland Traveller health study was an initiative of the Department of Health, which also funded it.  It reflected a concern about the health status of Travellers.  We have heard many of the figures.  Travellers have more illnesses and die younger.  They are at greater risk of substance misuse and mental health problems.  The all-Ireland Traveller health study highlighted that these health inequalities are rooted in the social determinants of health which encompass accommodation, education, employment and discrimination.  There is great acceptance of this, at least in the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Health provides funding of &euro;10 million a year to the HSE for initiatives specifically targeting the improvement of health outcomes for the Traveller community.  Other funding is provided by other sources, including the mental health budget from the social inclusion programme.  A further &euro;500,000 funding is provided through the Dormant Accounts Fund.  As the HSE will attend the committee at a later stage, I will not go into the detail as to how these resources are spent in supporting primary healthcare initiatives.  We must acknowledge, however, that the model of work developed through those primary healthcare initiatives highlighted here.  This model of peer working and engagement with Travellers should be used across our public services.  Much credit is due to those who have been pioneering those initiatives.  It is part of our delivery of health services.<\/p> <p>  I want to focus on some examples of health policy at national level which support the Traveller community and illustrate the challenges in meeting the health needs of Travellers.<\/p><p>The first is the national positive ageing strategy.  As we have heard, ageing is a key issue for Traveller health.  The most recent figures we have are for 2018 and indicate that 3% of Travellers were aged over 65, compared with 13% of the general population.  It is clear that Travellers die younger.  A particular issue in addressing positive ageing for Travellers in the strategy is the lack of disaggregated data on ethic status, which are required to monitor and address their health needs.  That issue has been highlighted at the committee.  To address this deficit, the healthy and positive ageing initiative developed a bespoke set of 14 indicators of positive ageing for Travellers which was published in May following extensive consultation with members of the Traveller community.  There are two interesting elements to the indicators developed.  First, the threshold for positive ageing was reduced from 50 years to 40 years, reflecting the fact that Travellers die up to ten years younger than the general population.  Second, they took on board very specific issues regarding Traveller accommodation which may not affect the rest of the population.  We drew up customised indicators to monitor positive ageing for the Traveller population.  This reflects a commitment in the national positive ageing strategy to change mindsets, promote social inclusion and pay particular attention to the needs of marginalised groups.  <\/p><p> The second example to which I wish to refer is the national drugs strategy, an area for which I am responsible within the Department.  The use and misuse of drugs and alcohol is an important concern for the Traveller population.  More than 300 Travellers were treated for problem drug use in 2017, which represents 3.7% of all those attending for treatment and indicates that Travellers are five times more likely to receive such treatment compared with the general population.  One of the actions of the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, is to improve access to addiction services for people from the Traveller community who use drugs.  There are particular challenges in engaging Travellers in drug services and these arise from the stigma associated with drug use among the Traveller community, especially among males.  My written submission outlines some initiatives by task forces in particular to try to engage in a culturally appropriate way with Travellers facing addiction issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":550,"content":"<p>Mr. Walsh has had five minutes.

One of the main actions in the strategy is to develop and implement a detailed action plan to address specific health needs of Travellers using a social determinants approach.  A draft is in circulation.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, are very engaged on the issue and supportive of the health action plan.  I strongly agree with the earlier comments that we need implementation, a monitored action plan and clear outcomes from it.<\/p> <p>  The Department is committed to ongoing engagement with Traveller organisations on Traveller health issues.  In 2018, my unit convened a workshop on Traveller health which brought together relevant units of the Department, the HSE and Traveller organisations to take stock of where we are in terms of Traveller health issues.  There are many examples within the Department of health structures with Traveller representation and I make reference to these in my written submission.  In line with action 74 of the national Traveller and Roma integration strategy, the Department and the HSE will review arrangements for engagement with Traveller organisations to support the Traveller health action plan.  We are committed to hosting a seminar in the Department with key officials to look at the health action plan when it is finalised and to participate in any new structures proposed under the plan.  The Department is committed to improving the health status of Travellers.  However, many of the levers to achieve this objective lie outside the remit of the Department of Health.  The Department will continue to engage with the steering committee of the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy and with Traveller organisations to improve health services for Travellers and to address the social determinants of health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":552,"content":"<p>First of all I must say thank you to Missie.  Sometimes I fear that I am becoming desensitised to trauma, pain and struggle.  I definitely had this challenged in me just there.  I was definitely re-energised in listening, supporting and continuing that fight she has long been fighting.  Hopefully we can play a part and see through all of the work the witnesses have been doing for all of these years.<\/p><p>Because we keep having the intersection between education, accommodation and so on, and given the role Jim is in now, would it not make sense to remove all criteria for everything when there is a health crisis and a crisis of the Travelling community?  This would mean removing the criteria for housing and for medical cards and for literally every barrier that exists until it is corrected and until Travellers are living longer.  One cannot positively age in a caravan that is full of mould and cannot be adapted, where there cannot be a shower chair or all of the things our older population needs to positively age at home.<\/p><p>When I first started to engage with Pavee Point around education and addiction back in 2010, the number of Travellers was at 52,000.  Drug use was not a feature 15 years ago when I first started working in the drug sector.  A very small number of Travellers were using, or in chaotic substance abuse, at that stage.  At the time a woman from Pavee Point told me that because of the age discrepancy in life expectancy Travellers would never usually enter the nursing home or home help system.  How can we support Travellers to be able to care for their loved ones within their communities when they are facing illnesses?<\/p><p>In nursing homes, doctors are paid a higher amount to visit the elderly in nursing homes - I can be corrected on this and the Minister of State might know - than they are in the homeless sector where there is also an ageing population, as with the Traveller population, that is ageing at 45 and 50 years of age due to life conditions.  Do we need to look at the pension packages provided when someone enters a nursing home and make these packages accessible across the board to people living in the homeless sector and to people in the Traveller community who would not usually end up there?  Perhaps I am wrong about the numbers of Travellers who end up in nursing homes but I know that the woman said they generally tend to care for those people at home.  Because a Traveller's life expectancy is much shorter the length of that care is probably much shorter.  Could we look at nursing home types of care and how it could be implemented into the Traveller community in the context of the benefits of nursing home care along with the pension packages and the pension ages, and recognise that a pensioner exists at a much earlier stage among the Traveller community?  What kinds of supports would this bring if it was an official recognition?<\/p><p>My main point is the question around mobile health units.  Those who need healthcare the most are often the least likely to receive it.  There are mobile health units used by the homeless sector and the Roma community in rural parts of Ireland where it is harder to get access to healthcare.  Is there a benefit to mobile healthcare units being Traveller specific and where we could make sure that healthcare and primary healthcare gets directly into Traveller communities?<\/p><p>On the implementation of everything we have spoken of at this committee, would it make sense to have a Traveller-led taskforce within the Department of Health to make sure the implementation happens so that Travellers are leading that change and that charge rather than just being consulted in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>way?  How quickly could we get things done if the groups and organisations we see coming in to this committee were actually part of a taskforce within the Department?<\/p><p>How can we remove the criteria and barriers?  I am talking about education and the leaving certificate points systems with regard to removing every single criteria there is for Travellers, and removing application forms and prescriptions.  I propose removing all of that until Travellers are in a position where they can live full lives and reach their full potential.<\/p><p>Life expectancy for Travellers has decreased dramatically.  It is policy that has killed the Traveller community, rather than bad health outcomes or education.  We need to remove the policy implications so that Travellers can access all the things they need to access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#N00100","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>The question calls for urgent radical action to remove all barriers and incentivise getting health to people where it is most needed, in the form of mobile health units, and for a Traveller-led task force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#O00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>They are very good points.

This could also be applied in policy with access to home-care services and I will inquire about this when I go back.  I am not sure if nursing home care is the right model of care and other people will be better qualified to answer that than I.

We engaged in a review process in good faith but the disbandment of the committee was based on the fact that key stakeholders, in health and other areas, did not engage with it to the necessary level.  We were blindsided, however, by what followed and we did not even receive the review until 2018, despite the fact that it had started in 2012.  There has been a study but the Department of Health still does not have an action plan or an implementation plan.<\/p><p>Some work has been done on a plan, but it is inadequate.  More work needs to be done in this regard.<\/p><p> Mr. Walsh spoke about an upcoming space, workshop or seminar within the Department of Health in respect of the action plan and where it stands.  I would like to think that key stakeholders such as Travellers will be engaged in that process.  When we gave our feedback on the initial draft, we said we felt it was inadequate.  I do not want to keep repeating myself when I say that the Department of Health has responsibilities in this regard.  There is evidence from various studies.  We need more desegregated data.  The Department needs to implement the findings of its studies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I would take guidance on the mobile health units from the Traveller representatives.

The key gap is the lack of a Traveller health action plan.  We are working towards filling this massive gap.  This is being driven by the HSE, which is in charge of health services.

Concepts like the positive duty and the ethnic identifier need to be considered as part of a targeted primary healthcare project.

If Mr. Walsh thinks primary healthcare projects are good, he needs to ensure that there is investment in them.

I do not want to patronise anyone and I do not want to make any promises to anyone.  We need to identify where the barriers and the blockages lie.  We all have responsibilities.

The witnesses have also identified a lack of funding.<\/p><p> I will focus on the silo system in Irish public life, that is, the Department of Health versus other Departments.  Mr. Walsh has said that the Department has certain responsibilities, but it cannot reach into other Departments.  That is partly our problem.  How can we cross-cut Departments in order for them to come together to provide a package that improves healthcare for the Traveller community?  I would like the committee to focus on that issue and I ask the Chairman to note it for future meetings.  We must tackle that silo mentality.  Even in the Department of Health itself, there are silos within silos.  We have identified a specific cohort of a community with unacceptable levels of mortality.  Some provision is made in the general populace provision, the national drug strategy, or through care of the aged.  This specific cohort needs specific attention and additional resources.  The findings and studies are there, and we need a clear action plan to address them.  I understand that the Department only has so much funding with which to work, but if there is a lack of funding, we need to specifically prioritise that funding and use it where it can have the greatest impact, whether that is addressing suicide among the Traveller community, drug abuse, care of the elderly, or resources.  Let us make a start and provide the additional resources somewhere.  I would be interested to hear from Ms Collins, who mentioned that she started lobbying for primary healthcare back in 1992.  That project started out with 85 families, and is now up to nearly 400.  Where is that initiative now?  Has it been expanded?

However, findings clearly show that mortality rates among this community are far higher than the general populace, and that needs an extraordinary response.  Politicians need to step up, and the Department must prioritise this.  Let us hear where we should make a start.  Not everything can be funded, and I do not expect that on day one, but even if there was an incremental approach, starting next year, we could increase the funding for primary care for Travellers.  That alone would send the message that we are making progress.  However, if we do not get additional resources, we have a long way to go.

There have been significant cuts to the overall Traveller health budget since 2008, with the onset of the recession.<\/p><p>This meant that meant Travellers experienced a double impact in the specific cuts to the Traveller health budget and the overall cuts in the area.  It is good to hear Mr. Walsh refer to the primary healthcare programmes but they have been significantly affected by cuts in recent years.  Even though there were some areas under the regions where there was underspending in Traveller health budgets, cuts were still made to services, including Traveller primary healthcare programmes, as a cost-saving measure.  As Traveller health budgets were not ring-fenced, they were sucked into the bigger black hole with regard to overall health budgets.  One useful thing this committee could do would be to look at those budgets from the Department of Health to the HSE to determine how much is ring-fenced and how much is not spent on what is intended initially in respect of Traveller health.<\/p><p> There is an absolute need for targeted initiatives, not outside of the mainstream and not segregated provision.  Primary healthcare is one model of that but there are other pieces of work that must be done.  However, no new moneys are coming into Traveller health and that is where things get stuck.  This is not just about money.  While money is, of course, significant and important, that leadership which was referred to where we have a shift in positive policy is not there.  We still have the ingrained negative policy superimposed here.  The reality is that change is not coming as swiftly as needed.<\/p><p> Ireland should be ashamed of itself.  I cannot put it strongly enough.  Ireland should be ashamed that, notwithstanding the statistics that have been set out here today and included in all of the submissions, there is still no real action on the change needed to ensure we do not continue to have these same conversations in ten or 20 years' time and that our grandchildren and great grandchildren will not have to deal with the same kinds of health issues and shortened lifespans heard about across the board today.  Ireland should be ashamed of itself when it comes to Traveller health.  While the wider determinants are there, it is always something else that is the reason we cannot implement what we have.  A number of Departments, whether it relates to accommodation, health or education, are not accepting responsibility for the fact that they need to put the resources in and implement the policies and strategies they have.  They need to roll out concrete work, including on disaggregated data, to monitor effectively and ensure there are real outcomes for Travellers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#Q01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I have a quick follow-up question on the action plan.

That senior person is now pulling the plan together with Traveller input and we hope to see it by the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  I agree completely on the silo system.  I refer to the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy led by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton.  The strategy is important because it involves a whole-of-Government approach and brings all the actors together, including Departments and Travellers.  Within that, we have over 30 actions, including actions to reduce the health inequalities experienced by Travellers and Roma.  There is a very good plan of action there and we could get more traction on that, especially with regard to the social determinants of health.  In the context of silos within silos, however, we need to be careful.<\/p><p>If we look at the &euro;10 million - the pot of money we have - we can see that more than &euro;17 billion is going into the health system, so Travellers' needs need to be prioritised across the system.<\/p><p> Something in my paper that I did not get a chance to talk about is the idea of proportionate univeralism.  Mental health, which has &euro;1 billion, is a very good example.  They need to prioritise and I think they are doing so.  That is where there are lot of resources.  We can look at other examples across the system as well.  The &euro;10 million we have is focused on primary care, particularly initiatives with Travellers.  That is really important and we need to grow it and reverse the cuts that took place.  The action plan will provide a clear mandate as to what is required.  The Department and the Minister are committed to giving leadership to implement and fund that plan.  We need a roadmap.

It seems that one of the major problems is getting people to avail of services.  One of the major challenges I see all the time is the bureaucratic barriers to accessing services.  Applying for a medical card for anybody is a very difficult task because the amount of paperwork needed for even the simplest application is incredible, so think of the barrier for somebody who finds reading and writing difficult.  We need to cut to the chase and say that there are significant barriers to accessing mainstream services and we need to simplify that.  I listened with interest to what my Senator colleague said.  I do not know whether it is as simple as ensuring everything is accessed through an ethnic identifier but something must happen to make access easier.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' views on that.<\/p> <p>  Is there a committee within the Department that monitors the &euro;10 million and do Travellers sit on that committee?  The reason I ask this question is because, especially in times of financial pressure, people in organisations are geniuses at manipulating money.  One concern I have is that some of that &euro;10 million is being used as replacement money.  It is being spent on Travellers but in a way that replaces money that should be have been spent on Travellers as members of society anyway.  In other words, is it truly additional or did the Department, during the bad times, start using it to replace other moneys and services, counting it as Traveller services because a Traveller availed of a mainstream service he or she should have received anyway?  I have seen this happen.  There is need for close monitoring of that.<\/p> <p>  If the witnesses from the Department think I am being suspicious, I have seen a lot of things happen in times of pressure.  The argument will be made.  I will give a concrete example.  I introduced CL&Aacute;R, which was a scheme for very specific geographic areas.  The next thing that happened was that all sorts of services, including hospitals, that were way outside these areas were telling me that they provided services to the people within the areas and were asking for some of that money.  Therefore, we need a monitoring committee that would include the people receiving the service to make sure the &euro;10 million is really an extra &euro;10 million on top of the normal services all of us as citizens are invited to avail of.  I would be interested in finding out what structures have been put place by the Department to monitor that spend.  I trust everybody and I trust nobody.  I think everybody needs to be monitored.  Will the witnesses give us the 2008 budget compared with what is available - the &euro;10 million mentioned here?<\/p><p> There is another issue that I am concerned about.  In one way, I laud that they are trying to help the Travellers at 40 because they are aged ten years beyond a person of 50 in the settled community but a more fundamental issue that we must keep coming back to is, why are they ten years older at 40 than the settled population at 50.  It comes back to what all the statistics tell us.  All the statistics show that people who are unemployed, in bad housing, etc. go to doctors more, go to hospitals more, get ill more often and die much younger, and that most of our health outcomes as a society are not a reflection on the health service in the first place.  The biggest determinant of outcomes is not the health service in the first place.  Many in the so-called middle classes go to the doctor less, take less medicine and live much longer.  The reason is a thing called \"lifestyle\".  What determines lifestyle?  One hundred and fifty years ago, the biggest killers were water-borne diseases.  Thankfully, we eliminated those more or less in the western world.  That is lifestyle rather than pure medicine.  We are still bad at housing.  We are still bad at unemployment.  There is good data in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the effect of unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#S00300","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I am anxious to hear from the other two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#T00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Point taken.

In that way, we can measure the forced lifestyle situation and its effect on people's health.

We all agree with that.  We know that we cannot separate the living conditions from opportunities.  There are the living conditions, the social exclusion and the lack of employment.  These all impact upon health.  We all know we cannot separate that.<\/p> <p>  At present, to answer Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question on the study, it is too soon yet to be able to do a study because the vast majority of Travellers who are getting educated now were getting educated and having opportunities within the past 20 years.  I grew up with three grandparents.  We all know many children who are growing up without any grandparent at all, and some of them are growing up without a father.<\/p> <p>  I want to come back a little, if I can, to mental health and addiction.  Much of the time, we talk about addiction and suicide as if it is something that is endemic within the Traveller community.  The reality is these are new phenomena.  They are environmental factors.  Travellers are not becoming addicted or having health issues for the most part because they are predisposed to that.  They are managing situations or unable to manage situations.  When we look at how to address it, I must come at it from where we are when we are meeting Travellers.  My friends here are better at the statistics on it than I am.<\/p><p>We are meeting Travellers who are crying out for help, perhaps for someone in their family who has a mental health issue and is threatening suicide.  When they look for help or support it is not there.  Therefore, one thing we have recommended is a national mental health strategy.  We must look at delivering very quickly on an action plan or plans which reduce Traveller deaths.  I do not know how many Travellers have died since we first looked for a national action plan on Traveller health.  I am not sure how many Travellers will die before we get an action plan.  The people we are losing are not statistics; they are our fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, cousins and children, and this has an impact.  <\/p><p> We need a national strategy that will deliver services when Travellers are crying out looking for supports around mental health.

I welcome Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's point about more monitoring around the budget.  Looking back historically, as Ms Collins has done, the Traveller health advisory committee had a role overseeing the Traveller budget.  There was a structure.  We monitored the Traveller budget, there was accountability, and we could call the health boards to come before us to explain what had been spent and how they had spent their money.  Since that committee was disbanded, we have had no input into the Traveller health budget.  That is why we want to bring back the structure.<\/p> <p>  Senator Coffey has gone but I wish to clarify a couple of things.  Ms Collins spoke on the Traveller primary healthcare project.  A Traveller heath strategy between 2000 and 2005 was produced by the Traveller health advisory committee.  Primary healthcare was seen as an excellent model and was piloted by Pavee Point.  That was regarded as a cornerstone which would be rolled out.  They rolled out 40 primary healthcare projects, there were eight Traveller health units, a Traveller health advisory committee and we had a Traveller health strategy.  We were in a very good place, things were very positive and Travellers were included at all levels.  We were told that there were no clear targets in the strategy because we had no data, so we lobbied to be able to collect the data.  We were promised that after the data had been produced, we would get a new Traveller health strategy with clear actions from the Department of Health and a defined and protected budget.  A study was done in 2010.  As Mr. Walsh said, the Department co-funded it with the HSE and the Department of Health in the North, as it was an all-Ireland body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#V00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Brigid Quirke"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":607,"content":"<p>That was nine years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#V00800","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Yes, we got the funding to do it in 2007, but it took from the 2002 strategy to 2007 to get the study done.

When we got it, it was put on a shelf.  Now the push is for the action plan.  The Department was committed to producing a Traveller health strategy but it has not done so.  It is wrong to suggest that it is waiting for the action plan.  The only reason we are getting an action plan is the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, which is a European initiative, not a national initiative.  Europe told Ireland it must produce a strategy for Travellers and Roma, and within that we got the action plan.

It is a good question.  Other countries in Europe have had State-imposed ethnic identifiers, but in our case it was Traveller groups lobbying the State to get an ethnic identifier.  We need to be very clear that there needs to be good practice and codes of practice developed, and proper training.  We have been doing work with different Departments; we have it in the national drug treatment service and in some of the hospitals.  We go in and train people and a code of practice is developed.  When we piloted the first question in Tallaght hospital people felt that nobody would engage but once we explained to Travellers that it is for their benefit and that the data are disaggregated and de-identified - and therefore anonymised - and once we explain that it is really to monitor where exactly the blocks are in access, participation and outcomes for services, we actually and surprisingly had 100% response.  It was important.  In the past people have asked Traveller-specific questions, which is much more likely to discriminate.  If, however, one asks the question in the context of everybody having to identify their ethnicity - and it is important that it comes with a code of practice and clear guidelines on how it is used to inform policy - the data can be disaggregated and given back to front-line workers to encourage people.  It is a bit like how the information is used in the census and how we now know how many are going to school and taking part in education, and Travellers can see the benefit of that.  Women in east Limerick found that there were more than 100% of the Travellers there that they knew of, which meant that the need for public services was being underestimated.  Initially in 2006 the census said there were 24,000.  In the study we found 40,000.

What is on that piece of paper, and I will only call it a piece of paper, has to be done for Travellers' health.  Our people are dying at very young ages every day of the week.  There are crises with regard to our children and mental health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#Y00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Missie Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I will ask some very specific questions.  Mr. Walsh said he hopes to get the plan by Christmas.  A question ran through my mind: which Christmas?  When large bodies such as the HSE set out to draw up a plan, they go around all the different sections.  The slowest section holds up the other 99%.  Will Mr. Walsh ensure that whatever is drawn up by 23 December will be given to the Department?  If necessary, will the Department release the plan with blank pages, explaining that it is because some sections did not come up with their plans?  Will it go ahead with the rest, shaming the sections in question to get it done quickly?  In other sectors, I have seen years spent trying to get plans together and further years spent trying to get them implemented.  It is better to have a plan, even if it is not 100% complete on the first day, and to start implementing it immediately.  There can then be an improved second plan.  We can call this the first interim action plan.  Can we get this on the desk by 1 January 2020?  We need it urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#Y00700","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":643,"content":"<p>We are frustrated.  We want the plan.  Perhaps when the HSE is before the committee members can ask about it more specifically.  We have been told it will be ready in the fourth quarter.  That quarter has already started, so from our point of view the clock is ticking and we want to get the plan so we can move forward with regard to actions and resources.  Perhaps the committee can ask the HSE about this in a few weeks.  Like I have said, we want to be part of driving and implementing the plan.  It is an action in the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021.  We included this action.  It was not imposed by Europe.  The Department of Health and the HSE included that action in the strategy because it is our responsibility to address Traveller health issues as a priority.  The plan is there.  It is our responsibility to deliver on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#Y00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":644,"content":"<p>It was actually Traveller organisations that lobbied for the inclusion of health as a key piece in the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy because of the failed implementation of the previous strategy.  We lobbied for an implementation plan in one shape or another to be included in that strategy.  The Travellers who participated in the process lobbied incredibly hard for that.  The European dimension of the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy has brought a bit more pressure to bear so that there is at least a draft on the table.  There is a long way to go in this regard but it is misleading to say that this is not the context in which it is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#Y00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":645,"content":"<p>Ms Joyce has made her clarification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#Z00100","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":646,"content":"<p>People were asking about the differential in regard to mortality.

When we did the study we found there were 134 excess deaths, which means 134 more than would be expected if people had the same standard of living as the general population.  That is 134 years so over approximately nine years that would be 1,200 excess deaths among Travellers because nothing has happened.

We will have the HSE in and will be asking some hard questions of it.  I will ask the committee members if we can invite a Traveller health co-ordinator, Ms Deirdre O'Reilly, whose submission arrived late, to participate.  I presume that is okay.<\/p> <p>  It is impossible to sum up this issue.  It is about people's lives, including those of our witnesses' families and loved ones.  There is a sense that the crisis in health, including mental health, has been captured but largely ignored.  Mr. Thomas McCann mentioned a sense of difference.  An inadequate response was mentioned, as were inertia, inaction and a need for implementation to be evidenced.  I was shocked to hear that there are underspends in the area of Traveller health in addition to the underspends in Traveller accommodation.  I was not aware of that, but it seems to reflect a wider lack of urgency.  Where we need an extraordinary response, as Senator Coffey said, we are getting an inert response.  The word \"shame\" was used.  I certainly share that sentiment.  We will return to this topic again.  Ms Collins said that the Minister for Health made her some promises in respect of the re-establishment of structures.  We will look at that in our report.  There needs to be real and meaningful structures in the Department of Health, but also in the HSE because that is where the money is.  Questions need to be answered about the adequacy of the budget and about where the budget goes.  Perhaps additional resources are needed for targeted initiatives.  Tackling social determinants will solve health issues in the long run but we have a crisis here and now and it needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I will bring today's meeting to a close.
