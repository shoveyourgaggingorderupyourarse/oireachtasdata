I am accompanied by Mr. John Spain, chair of PII's planning and development committee.  PII is an independent and inclusive representative organisation for all subsectors of the Irish property industry.  Membership of the organisation is open to all professional firms across the property industry.<\/p> <p>  PII views the SHD process as a key part of its planning system and recommends that consideration be given to making it a permanent feature.  Whereas the supply of new homes has improved, it remains below estimated levels of new household formation.  The scheme has contributed greatly to speeding up decision-making processes on major housing developments at a time of major shortages in housing supply in Dublin and around the country.  Up to the end of June, out of the 71 applications decided by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, 49 cases of permission have been granted, leaving an approval rate of just under 70%.  This has resulted in 11,388 housing units being approved, comprising 7,038 apartments and 4,350 houses, together with 7,981 student bed spaces.<\/p> <p>  Given the very significant increase in large-scale housing planning applications since the scheme was introduced in 2017, we expect to see a commensurate increase in construction activity over the next 12 months, feeding through to a further significant increase in new housing completions over the next few years.  The SHD process has been particularly successful in encouraging apartment developments in the more central areas of our cities, which will greatly assist in regeneration and result in a more sustainable pattern of housing provision, reducing the dependence on car-based, low-density housing in peripheral locations.  This is particularly important if we are to achieve the Government's climate change objectives as they relate to urban development.  Much of this increase in activity is funded by overseas investors, who find the certainty of the timescale for decisions on strategic housing development applications particularly encouraging.<\/p> <p>  There is inevitably a time lag between a grant of permission and commencement of construction.  This applies to cases of strategic housing development permission just as it does to standard planning permission.  There are a number of reasons for this time lag, including the need to obtain compliance approval from the local authority with respect to pre-commencement conditions, the need to agree Part V social housing provision details and the need to agree water and drainage details with Irish Water.<\/p><p>In some cases, commencement is dependent on upgrades to local infrastructure by Irish Water or the local authority.  In other cases, amendments to elements of the scheme are required prior to commencement due to changing market requirements or it can take time to finalise funding arrangements for construction.  Typically, it may take six months or more to get responses from a local authority to pre-commencement compliance submissions.  The time lag between permission being granted and commencement of construction may be anything from six months to two years for these reasons.<\/p><p> As part of PII&rsquo;s submission to the SHD review, we made several recommendations aimed at improving the efficiency and impact of the scheme.  In light of time constraints, I will list only these recommendations, but we are happy to discuss them in more detail.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be permitted to request further information where the only alternative is a refusal of permission and the potential reason or reasons for refusal are capable of being addressed by further information.  Further information is permitted in strategic infrastructure development applications and is often requested. The occasional use of similar provisions in normal planning appeals under section 132 of the Planning and Development Act has proven very effective.<\/p><p> A higher proportion of commercial use to complement residential use should be allowed, especially for larger schemes.  Additional resources should be allocated to Irish Water to reduce the length of time it takes to produce documentation.  Prescribed bodies should be required to engage at pre-application stage.  The requirement to refer to material contravention in notices and on the application form should be removed.  It would be of great assistance to applicants if there were more specific comments in An Bord Plean&aacute;la opinions at pre-application stage in respect of what is or is not considered acceptable and what changes may be required to make a scheme acceptable.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be encouraged to review its approach to requiring a minimum density level for SHD sites.  The SHD system should move fully online and a section of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be dedicated to SHD applications.<\/p><p> There is a need for clarity on the procedure for amendment applications to approved SHD schemes.  Amendment applications are best dealt with by local planning authorities.  Resourcing and capacity at local authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la levels should be reviewed.  The SHD process should be optional for applicants.  There is a need to clarify the treatment of SHD applications in strategic development zone planning scheme areas.<\/p><p> We are happy to discuss our recommendations to the SHD review in more detail with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear.  I am joined by Dr. Conor Norton, vice president of the Irish Planning Institute.  We will do all we can to assist the committee regarding the views of planners on the strategic housing development review.  The Irish Planning Institute is the all-island professional body representing planners engaged in physical and environmental planning.  Our mission is to advance planning in the interest of the common good by serving, improving and promoting the planning profession.  We are the largest professional membership body for spatial planners operating on the island of Ireland.  Our members work across the planning system, including in planning consultancies, for developers, and in planning authorities, semi-State organisations, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and central government.  We are a broad church of professional planners and our membership has developed great collective expertise through its interactions with various stages of the strategic housing development process.<\/p> <p>  As our members work across the planning system, the views they represented to us are quite diverse.  The institute has long argued in favour of the principle of subsidiarity in planning such that, insofar as practicable, local planning decisions should be made by competent authorities at local level.  However, the institute acknowledges and supports the overall purpose of strategic housing development to accelerate the delivery of much-needed housing in accordance with the principles and objectives contained in Rebuilding Ireland and as a temporary measure.  More than 16,172 housing units and 7,573 units of student accommodation have been granted permission through this process by An Bord Plean&aacute;la since SHD was rolled out.  This is a considerable achievement.  Despite the changes facilitated in the planning system and increasing numbers of planning applications, the institute shares the concerns of many present that figures for building on the ground remain modest.<\/p><p>There are, of course, numerous hurdles developers have to jump after planning permission has been granted before they can actually start building.  The post-permission period is increasingly more complex, with numerous compliance conditions that must be fulfilled on each site before construction can start.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Planning Institute, IPI, has consistently argued that local authority planning departments are not adequately resourced to carry out their range of functions and responsibilities.  We have pointed to areas where problems still exist in terms of process.  We have suggested, for example, greater resourcing for matters of compliance with conditions of permission, and we have suggested to the strategic housing development review group that these compliance certificates could be secured if necessary from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As with all permissions, delay can still result from the judicial review processes post permission.<br\/><br\/>Delivery is critical, and it must be driven at local level.  At our recent autumn planning conference I called for planner-led delivery teams to be created in all local authorities to bring forward urban regeneration in urban centres, to engage in active land management, and to assist in unlocking strategic lands where planning permissions have been granted.<br\/><br\/>In summary, I would like to highlight here today, as I have on other occasions, that the successful roll out of strategic housing development shows that planning <i>per se<\/i>is not the roadblock to delivery of housing.  Our membership is anxious to avoid a scenario where planning permissions granted under the strategic housing development process will be used by developers or speculators to increase the value of land rather than the delivery of housing.  We very much want to be part of the solution in working with other professions in the construction sector to deliver the housing our citizens so badly need.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to come before the committee today.  We will endeavour to respond to all of the committee's questions.  If there is any additional information required arising from this meeting, we will be pleased to provide that information in a prompt manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Corr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Corr.

I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to appear before the committee to discuss the important work of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the context of the strategic housing development, SHD, review, and to respond to any questions the committee may have of SHD.<\/p> <p>  I am deputy chair of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and chair of the strategic housing division.  I am joined by Ms Rachel Kenny, director of planning operations.  With the Chairman's indulgence, I may ask her to address some of the issues raised, as she may be more familiar with such matters.<\/p> <p>  The board undertakes a critical role in considering and determining strategic housing development proposals, and we remain committed to delivering decisions as quickly and effectively as possible.  The strategic housing development legislation has been in operation for just over two years, since July 2017.  In that time a total of just over 100 cases have been decided, two thirds of which were decided in the past nine months.  All cases have been decided within the mandatory timelines provided for, which is 16 weeks, except for two cases, where oral hearings were held.  The board has also issued opinions on approximately 230 pre-application consultations, again within the nine-week period provided for in the legislation.<\/p> <p>  The role of the board is not merely to deal with cases as expeditiously as possible but also to promote the principles of proper planning and sustainable development.  The national planning framework and the emerging regional spatial and economic strategies, as well as the various section 28 ministerial guidelines published over the past decade, set a clear priority for appropriate development in the right locations to facilitate the sustainable and orderly growth of our cities, towns and rural hinterlands.  The board has a clear role in implementing such policies through the processing of case decisions.<\/p> <p>  In a constantly evolving and more complex legislative and legal context, where environmental issues and public participation are to the fore, it is also crucial that the board has all the information it needs to make sound decisions and gives people time to feed in their views on proposals during the deliberative process, reflecting our core principles of integrity, independence and fair-mindedness.<\/p> <p>  I will give the committee a little background on the strategic housing development division.  The board was, on commencement of the legislation, provided with ten additional staff across planning inspectorate and administration, although during 2019 this was increased to 17 staff.<\/p><p>Four board members are assigned to the SHD division of the board, which is chaired by myself, and the members of this division are required to prioritise these cases, as is the case with all large-scale housing appeals that come to us.  The board&rsquo;s performance in relation to strategic housing developments has been very strong.  The board, as I have already mentioned, has decided more than 100 cases, with 67 of these being a decision to grant and 34 to refuse.  As of 30 September, approximately 16,500 residential units have been permitted and 7,500 student bed spaces.  Pre-application consultation requests considered to date account for approximately 63,000 residential units and approximately 12,000 student bed spaces, so we anticipate significant and ongoing applications.  However, it is not a rubber-stamping exercise.  To date, approximately 5,460 residential units and approximately 1,360 student bed spaces have been refused consent.  The board remains committed to the right developments in the right locations.<\/p><p> The board acknowledges the appointment of an independent panel to undertake a review of the performance, operation and structure of strategic housing development provisions.  Representatives of the board have met with the independent review group to answer queries, provide statistical information and provide insight as required.  Rather than go into the detail of this now, as I am conscious that I am taking up members&rsquo; valuable time to raise specific issues, I will leave it there.  We are happy to take any questions and answer specific queries as they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hyde","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Yesterday, I took the time to contact councillors from all parties and none to tell them An Bord Plean&aacute;la was coming before the committee today, as has been customary for me since I became a member of this committee three and a half years ago.  To say there was an avalanche of telephone calls and emails would be an understatement.  Local communities feel disenfranchised by the SHD process and politicians - national and local - feel disenfranchised.  Planners also, who are members of the Irish Planning Institute, have expressed concern.  Its submission on 16 July was its initial submission and the nuances are slightly different now in terms of where it stands on the SHD.  It was an excellent submission and I spoke to a number of planners across the 30 or so local authorities, who all agreed.  They are under-resourced and under pressure and many of them are disillusioned and thinking of getting out.  As Mr. Corr said, his membership comprises people who sit on local authorities and who work in State agencies, in An Bord Plean&aacute;la and in Mr. Duffy's organisation.  It is a very impressive body of people who have a track record of delivering and they are saying \"Enough is enough; it has got to stop.\"<\/p> <p>  I will cut to the chase and say it has failed the planning system.  Subsidiarity means making decisions within communities and if the witnesses are telling this committee that this is a major infringement of the Aarhus Convention and undermines citizens' ability to make their views known in the planning process, we have to do something.  I do not want this to be a box-ticking exercise.  The witnesses have set out their credentials well but I will focus on the IPI as I have taken the trouble to look at its track record and to talk to its membership across the sector.  What is the IPI's stance on the removal of the right to a third party appeal?  What is the stance of An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  It is important that local authorities are acknowledged as the best-placed people to make decisions.<\/p><p>I am not talking about councillors.  I am talking about the unique relationship between councils, which have local knowledge, and expert planners who have trained in and have knowledge of planning matters.  I want to hear what the witnesses have to say about that.<\/p><p> On the overall process, is it right that An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be judge and jury in a case?  I note that the IPI strongly advocates the need for additional resources for local authorities to allow them to get on with their work.  There was some suggestion regarding other groups and the establishment of a special planning and environment law court was also mentioned.  Will the witnesses comment on that?  It is wholly wrong and inappropriate that citizens are forced to take costly judicial reviews because this has an impact on communities and individuals.  I know a man in one local authority area who is representing himself in a case as a lay litigant.  I am familiar with communities in Dublin that are literally broke because they have initiated judicial processes and then some people have decided they cannot proceed with a case or put their homes on the line.  That is an important issue.<\/p><p> The IPI talks about the introduction of a site value tax for sites that receive permission via the strategic housing development process.  Will the witnesses clarify that?  I would like to hear their comments on it because it is a very important issue.<\/p><p> In respect of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, there is much criticism of its website and the system it has in place.  An applicant can put up a map, plans and a photomontage as he or she sees fit and advocate for his or her own planning application.  In some cases, after the event, councillors cannot get access to application.  I want to hear the board's view on all of that in terms of access to this information, particularly its websites.<\/p><p> We know there are issues with requests for further information and the mechanisms involved in that.  There are serious concerns about that, abuses of the system and the way it which it prolongs the process.  This is meant to be fast-track planning but I do not believe that is the case.<\/p><p> The strategic housing development process disenfranchises communities.  It is not right or proper.  It needs to cease, not next year or the year after that.  It was a temporary measure, which has failed and did not deliver homes.  It may have delivered student accommodation and in other areas but it has not delivered on the key objective of the Rebuilding Ireland programme, namely, to deliver homes.  The most important comment I am hearing from local councillors and planners is that they are demoralised.  They feel disenfranchised, as do communities.  The SHD process is an attack on a sustainable, consultative planning process.  There can be no place in a democracy for having proper open, transparent planning done by an elite group in Marlborough Street.  The system is not engaging with those who are elected by the people to represent them.  The citizens have the right to engage in the planning process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#H00200","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Hyde to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#J00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>On the technical issue around websites, the board agrees with the Senator that all of that information should be on a centralised website.

We have held oral hearings on a number of occasions, including in two cases in respect of which certain technical issues could be addressed.  Otherwise, the quality and standard of the applications coming into us has meant that there has been no requirement for further information, and we do not think it would be beneficial.<\/p><p> Senator Boyhan made a point about An Bord Plean&aacute;la being the judge and jury.  Strategic infrastructure has been in place since 2007.  This has allowed for direct applications to the board in respect of strategic infrastructure.  The temporary emergency legislation which has been introduced for strategic housing is just that, namely, it is temporary.  This legislation is not meant to disenfranchise anyone, rather it is designed to allow for speedier delivery.  There are two stages to the process, namely, the pre-application and application stages.  The planning authority has ample opportunity at the pre-application stage to get its issues on the agenda for input.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hyde","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I understand Senator Boyhan's frustration.  We have received similar feedback from our membership throughout the country.  We carried out our own research some time ago and it uncovered that we needed in excess of 100 additional planners of all grades, which is a significant number.  That needs to be addressed at local level.  I will not reiterate what my colleague Mr. Hyde said, but we are aware that this system is not popular, due to the process involved which has no appeal mechanism.  However, we also acknowledge that this is a temporary measure that is in response to a housing crisis.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the judicial review.  It is expensive, and is not an appeal in its own right.  It is a review of the process undertaken and is extremely expensive.  We referred in our submission to a commercial court which would listen to judicial reviews of planning decisions as a more accessible mechanism which would not cost as much as the High Court for individuals or community groups wishing to have the process reviewed.<\/p> <p>  As stated earlier, local authorities are best placed to deal with these issues.  We agree on that.  They are best placed to make these decisions, which is why we want them adequately resourced.  When compliances come to them after an SHD permission, they should not be holding up development by taking a number of weeks to come to a conclusion which would allow development to take place.  We advocate a use it or lose it policy.  Landowners or developers should not be able to speculate on their SHDs.  This also relates to the Senator's comments on the site value tax, which we see as one measure in a number that would ensure delivery of housing into the system.

There is a pre-application process with the local authority.  That is taken very seriously by applicants.  It might often involve two, three, four or more pre-application meetings with the local authority planning officers.  It is important to seek to resolve all issues insofar as possible prior even to getting involved with the pre-application process with the board.  In our experience, applicants seek to address fully the planning issues and concerns raised by the planning authority and, in that regard, also have regard to the development plan made by the elected members, the local area plans and so on.  Those issues and concerns must be addressed in the context of Government policy.<\/p> <p>  We have seen Government policy move on significantly in the past two years with the national planning framework, the regional spatial and economic strategy and so on.  Development plans are now going through a review process to reflect that.  The local authority input remains very important pre-application.  As Mr. Hyde referenced, there is involvement with the board at the pre-application stage.  It attends the tripartite meeting, makes an initial report to the board and also submits a report to the board on the application.  That report is an important part of the process and, in our experience, is given serious consideration by the board.  That is the reason the pre-application process for the local authority is so important.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, in terms of third-party appeal rights, the decision is made by the board in those cases.  In strategic housing developments, the decision is also made by the board.  All third-party ownership parties have the opportunity to make observations to the board, and those observations are an important part of the process.  It is a faster and more efficient way to get to the end of the decision-making process and one that has proved effective in terms of encouraging much-needed investment in housing planning applications leading on to housing development.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Corr mentioned, there have been concerns about the delivery rates of permissions.  We referred to a time lag.  One way to try to speed up that process would be to commence the provisions of the 2018 Planning and Development (Amendment) Act, which provide for a strict time limit for deciding on compliance applications.  We would urge the commencement of those provisions, which are on the Statute Book but have not been commenced, as a matter of urgency.  That requires the resourcing at local authority level, to which Mr. Corr referred.<\/p> <p>  I will make a final comment in respect of websites.  We agree it would be beneficial, and I am pleased to hear that the board is putting in place, a system whereby the application is hosted on the board's rather than on the applicant's website.

I am not being critical but trying to be as practical as possible.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example of that from last week when the committee was discussing the Land Development Agency, LDA.  It concerns local area plans.  In Wicklow, a number of local area plans were adopted in 2006 but were not reviewed after the six-year period because of the economic crash.  They were meant to be reviewed in 2018 but they were not reviewed because of the publication of the national planning framework.  We then had to hold off for the regional strategic plan and now must wait for a county development plan, following which the authority's local area plan can be decided.  A period of up to 21 years will have elapsed before the community will have a direct involvement in the way their community develops.<\/p><p>That is my fundamental problem with the SHDs.  They now have the remit of national policy to force 35 houses to the hectare in small towns where that is completely inappropriate.  The only vehicle a community has in that case is judicial review, which is unaffordable.  Regarding the board, Mr. Hyde said in his opening statement that public participation would be to the fore.  However, that is not the case with regard to whether SHDs are in line with local area and county plans.  It might be so with regard to national plans, but not with any plan below that level.  From a transparency perspective, I have a fundamental problem with SHDs.  If local area plans were in line, that community involvement would have been there.  However, it is not.<\/p><p> The approval of 67 of a total of 101 SHD applications is almost being promoted here today as a success.  It is a failure when 34 of 101 applications are not approved in a process that has to go through pre-planning with the relevant local authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There are two consultations and then a final application is submitted to the board.  Mr. Hyde said in response to Senator Boyhan that there was no need for further information, which would delay the process.  In that case, how did 34 of 101 applications fail?  Was the principle of the application at fault?  If the principle was not at fault, it was a minor issue which could easily have been dealt with by way of further information or a planning clarification.  We are being told 67 approvals is a success in a process that was meant to streamline this.  It is a failure that 34 applications failed and, as such, I question the assertion that further information is not needed.  That is to state clearly that the application should never have been submitted.  Is there, therefore, an issue with the pre-planning consultation with the local authority and the board?  There was room in the legislation for either the board or the applicant to request a second meeting to discuss issues.  Has such a second meeting ever been requested by a developer or the board given the failure rate of more than 30%?<\/p><p> Has any material contravention been invoked in relation to the applications which have gone through so far?  We are all here to try to get the system working but the frustration is beginning to come.  One or two of the witnesses might have said that.  It is not necessarily the planning system that is the roadblock.  It is what takes place after an application has gone through the system.  I am hearing anecdotally that there are serious issues in relation to Irish Water and getting information from the company in order to proceed on site.  To get planning permission and then to have to wait two years to get on site is ridiculous.  The waiting time is between six months and two years.  At this stage, I wonder whether these issues should have been gone through by the time the final planning permission is granted.  Of the 67 applications that were granted, one wonders how many of the sites have been flipped and sold on the market for a higher value.  This is where there might be an opportunity to ensure a developer makes a greater commitment to the planning system in having to engage in compliance, commit to Part V and obtain permission from Irish Water before obtaining planning permission.  That would put us all in a position to say there is nothing to delay the development of the site.  At the moment, however, we are issuing planning permission before all of these other issues have been dealt with.  It is not necessarily a failure of the SHDs, but rather of the whole planning system which needs to be developed.<\/p><p>Regarding maximum densities, it goes back to the consultation process with communities.  In some of our towns, they are not fit for purpose.  Apartments must be included to achieve the target of 35 homes per hectare in respect of complying with public and private open space.  It is not viable any other way.  Apartments are not suitable in many of our smaller towns yet these national guidelines are being applied.  I have probably gone way over time.  I will come back in during the second round.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#L00300","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>We will come back to the Deputy in the second round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#N00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I will handle some questions while Ms Kenny will answer parts relating to the pre-application stage.  Regarding whether SHD could be perceived to be a failure in terms of the refusal rate of 34% in 100 cases, with the normal planning application process under section 34 of the Act before SHD was introduced, the refusal rate hovered around 50% so we feel the value in the process is that we have moved from a 50% refusal rate on appeal of similar cases dating back to 2005 to a rate of 34%.  I would not accept that this in itself is a failure.  It is not a rubber-stamping exercise.  It is very important that there is rigorous assessment of each and every case.  This is why the grant rate on applications is not 100%.<\/p> <p>  It would be fair to say that in some instances at the pre-application stage, the applicants are given opinions that the applications require further consideration.  In some of those instances, they applied without taking on board some of the recommendations made at the pre-application stage, which often led to a refusal.  Some of the refusals would relate to technical issues that could not be resolved by way of clarification or further information.  These things often involve environmental issues around appropriate assessment or environmental impact assessment and are simply not resolvable.  The best outcome is a refusal and a fresh application.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the density target of 35 homes per hectare in some of our smaller towns and villages referred to by Deputy Casey, the reality is that policy on density is set nationally and is a matter for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We implement national policy, as is our mandate.  It is not the case that we need to build apartments to achieve the target of 35 homes per hectare.  Based on international experience and what we have seen in some of our suburban areas, it is possible to achieve this density with duplexes or townhouses.  I will hand over to Ms Kenny, who will answer the questions about the pre-application process.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hyde"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The pre-application process plays a very important role and the planning authorities participate in that to a significant degree.  There has been a significant amount of pre-application consultation prior to it arriving at the board but when it comes to the board, we go through all of the issues not yet resolved by the planning authorities with the prospective applicant along with issues we feel ought to be considered to ensure that the correct and relevant amount of information, planning justification, etc., is submitted to us.  Most of the 230 pre-application cases would require further consideration.  Only a small number would have been considered to constitute a reasonable basis for the making of an application.  Most of the pre-application consultations that come in result in a further consideration request that lists the issues that require further consideration.  We are improving in terms of clarity regarding those issues to give as clear a direction as possible but as Mr. Hyde said, we do not predetermine applications.<\/p><p>It is very important that there is a distinction between the pre-application process and the application process.  We have different inspectors at pre-application stage versus application stage in order to ensure that the process is transparent and open and that everybody has a fair opportunity to influence and inform the consideration of an application so that third parties would have that same opportunity to engage with the reporting inspector at first hand.<\/p><p> We have had second pre-application consultation meetings.  That is possible.  In other instances where the matters would be so extensive, they come in and restart the process.  We have a second pre-application consultation where it is required and where somebody wants it, we will facilitate it.  That is always available.<\/p><p> In terms of the grant rate and whether it is successful, obviously it started off as a relatively new process.  We all had to get an understanding of where we were going in terms of the evolving planning policies that exist.  In recent times, if one looks at the first 2018 decisions versus the 2019 decisions, the grant rate would be slightly higher in 2019 - in the second half or second operational period of the strategic housing development, SHD - as we begin to learn and understand where we are going with that.  It is probably closer to 70% at present.  It could be higher but it depends on the applications coming in.  It is important that we had the opportunity not to rubber-stamp it to take into consideration all of the relevant information that comes in at application stage.  In terms of public participation in local democracy and the involvement of the planning authorities, it is important that the public knows that it can influence the board in the making of a decision.  It is a not a failure but a success that it is not 100%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kenny.

They should be really but perhaps that is not why they are reviewed or renewed, and that under those circumstances fresh LAPs are required.<\/p> <p>  The density, if I can go back to that, can be achieved.  It does not need to be apartment blocks in the areas on the outskirts of towns or anything like that.  Certainly, the density of 35 to the hectare can be achieved with terraces and duplexes.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what was mentioned, with the local authority and the public participation process, in the conclusion of our submission we urged the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to restore planning powers to local authorities for large-scale housing development on or before December 2021.

They are there for all applications.  The LAP update process will be addressed in the short term now that the regional strategies are in place.  Although the delay is regrettable, it is now being addressed.  LAPs will remain an important part of the process and the input of elected representatives to the make-up of those plans will also remain important.<\/p><p> The density policy is set by Government, not by the board, which just implements the policy.  There is room to provide a review of policy as it applies to smaller settlements and those that are more remote from major urban centres.  There are a lot of concerns about the viability of delivery of higher density schemes in some of these smaller settlements and more remote locations.  That must be considered further.<\/p><p> The 34% refusal rate is high.  Compared with all planning applications under the normal planning application process across the board, the local authority level refusal rate is 10%, for instance.  I welcome that the refusal rate appears to be falling somewhat more recently.  Our submission suggests several measures to address that and achieve a higher permission rate.  No one goes into this process other than to achieve a permission.  It is a very expensive, time-consuming process for applicants.  However, it shows that it is a very rigorous process for developers and is risky.  It also shows that the concerns raised by local authorities, planners and others making submissions and observations - third parties and statutory bodies - are taken very seriously and that has had a significant influence on that refusal rate.  There are measures that could go further to bring that down, including oral hearings, which we would welcome.  It has been used relatively recently.  We also suggest introducing provisions similar to section 132 provisions in normal applications in exceptional circumstances in those few cases where refusal could be avoided by further information.  That is an approach that is permitted.  Second meetings with the board in exceptional circumstances at pre-application stage and greater clarity, which we are seeing being given at pre-application stage in the board's opinions, are very welcome.<\/p><p> I agree on the serious issues about resourcing and timeliness of agreements with Irish Water.  That is an important matter that can be addressed to improve on delivery.  Of the approximately 67 permissions we examined, around a quarter - 16 - exceed where they are in implementation from a detailed knowledge of the situation on the ground.  The vast majority of those, 11 of the sample of 16, are at preliminary construction or full construction stages.  The sample is across the board geographically in the types of scheme and type of developer.  Three more recent permissions in the recent weeks are at compliance stage.  We anticipate 15 of the 16 being implemented in the short term.  All are likely to be implemented within the lifetime of the permissions, but the great majority will be implemented in the short term.  We are only beginning to see the feed through of a significant increase in construction rates following from the increase in planning applications and permissions being granted.  The system is delivering and will be seen to deliver very strongly over the next year or two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Spain","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I have a question for Mr. Corr and Dr. Duffy.  I will begin with Mr. Corr.  The whole purpose of SHD is to avoid delay, as Mr. Hyde told the committee.  For a system aimed at avoiding delay, it seems there are many delays.<\/p><p>In September, <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>reported that planning permission had been granted on a little more than 16,000 new homes.  The newspaper reported that in excess of 9,500 of these new homes remained unbuilt.<br\/><br\/>I listened carefully to Mr. Corr's introductory remarks.  One thing he said stood out.  He said that the members of the Irish Planning Institute were anxious to avoid a scenario where planning permission granted under the strategic housing development process would be used by developers or speculators to increase the value of land rather than the delivery of houses.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Corr has pointed to a danger.  One does not point to a danger if the danger does not exist or if it is not a reality.  I know this is a reality.  I know there are developers submitting planning applications that are being fast-tracked.  The permission is being granted.  The value of the land increases and the land is sold on to make a quick buck.  The people who are losing out on that are, generally speaking, middle-income working people who are looking for an affordable home but who cannot get their hands on one.  That is unacceptable, disgraceful and a scandal.<br\/><br\/>I have my own opinion on this and I believe the scheme should be scrapped.  Presumably, Mr. Corr believes this is happening and that it is a factor.  Will he elaborate on how great a factor this is?  How significant is winning planning permission and then flipping the land - selling it on - as opposed to building the houses?  Does Mr. Corr reckon this accounts for a significant percentage or portion of those 9,500 houses that remained unbuilt when <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>reported on it in September?<br\/><br\/>My second question is for Dr. Duffy.  The same report indicated that there had been a survey of sorts conducted jointly by two universities, University College Dublin and Queen's University Belfast, into the origins of the scheme and the level of influence that developers might have had in shaping it.  One developer was quoted in the newspaper report.  References to &quot;him&quot; were references to the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Coveney.  He said, &quot;We gave him our recommendations and they took it lock, stock and barrel and stuck it into the new housing bill.&quot;  Effectively, what was being said was that the proposals from the developers were more or less 100% incorporated into the legislation that gave rise to this process.  Will Dr. Duffy comment on the UCD and Queen's University Belfast report and the quote and give his opinion on how accurate or otherwise it might be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#P00200","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>We will start with Mr. Corr, given that the majority of the questions were directly addressed to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#Q00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>In a nutshell, to address Deputy Barry's question, I do not have the statistics on how many sites would be permitted for the purpose of flipping on.

There are myriad reasons that sites do not commence promptly after the companies involved get permission under the SHD process.  Even the previous process did not stop the practice of getting permission to increase the value on a site and sell it on.

In answering, I can only give the Deputy my understanding.  It is fair to say that, at the time, there was a recognition that there was a huge need to increase the supply of housing into the system.  PII, as a broad church for the property sector, representing all the different sub-sectors and being a policy-focused organisation, was looking at making recommendations to the Department or to Government as to how housing supply could be increased at that time.  All of those were published in various documents which are available on our website.<br\/><br\/>My understanding is that the fast-track planning process was one of the ideas.  It featured in our 2016 publication, Policy Reform to Increase the Delivery of New Housing, but it featured in a slightly different form to the one that was finally adopted in that the model we put forward included scope for requests for further clarification or further information.  I am not aware of the particular interview to which the Deputy referred.  As stated said, neither of us was involved in PII at the time.

I have always been of the view that the purpose of the strategic housing developments was not in the first instance to speed up the planning process, and I will explain why in a moment.  Their primary purpose was to bypass democratically agreed city and county development plans.  There is a mounting body of evidence, to which I will come in a moment, which confirms this.  The difficulty is that the people who initiated the lobby for this change could not come out and say they wanted to undermine the democratically agreed city and county development plans, so it was framed as a matter of speeding up the process.  I absolutely accept that the planning process, as it was before the SHDs, was too slow.  This committee spent a very considerable amount of time examining the cause of that slowness.  It amounted to approximately 48 weeks for a large housing development, on the basis of the planning applications we were considering at that stage.  However, when the Department gave us a breakdown of pre-planning, formal planning application with the local authority, request for additional information and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the only part of the planning process that was happening quickly and in line with the statutory requirement was that undertaken by the local authorities.  Pre-planning had no statutory requirement and could go on for ages.  As for requests for additional information, it could take up to six months for industry to get back to the local authorities.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la, because of a lack of adequate resourcing, was not meeting its time guidelines.  If the primary objective had been to improve the efficiency of the process, there were very simple solutions: have statutory timeframes for pre-planning and additional information and give An Bord Plean&aacute;la the resources to carry out the reviews.  The same timeline could have been met.  It is not 16 weeks at present, in fairness, because one must count in the time from when the additional engagement with the local authority happens right through to the formal application and onwards.  The timeline is approximately 22 weeks or something.  However, An Bord Plean&aacute;la could have achieved this without bypassing the local authorities.<\/p><p>This is a really important point that has not been properly explored here: why would An Bord Plean&aacute;la want to bypass the city and county development plans?  There is a difference legally in what An Bord Plean&aacute;la must do.  The legislation states that it must have regard to the city and county development plans, whereas local authorities must comply with them.  That is a big difference.  One official in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government once said to me that part of the purpose of this legislation was to get around the &quot;eccentricities&quot; of the city and county development plans.  In the research Deputy Barry quoted from UCD and Queen's University one developer, not PII, talked about the ridiculous &quot;rubbish&quot; that democratically elected members sought to put into their city and county development plans.  We need to be honest here: this is not about efficiency; it is about a policy agenda that was led by industry and which the Minister of the day and some of his officials swallowed lock, stock and barrel.<\/p><p>What have been the outcomes of this two years on?  Killian Woods from <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>has done incredible work spreadsheeting all the SHDs.  He has told us that of the 15,000 units approved, 10,000 have not commenced, and that of the 64 schemes, 41 do not even have commencement notices.  These figures were correct at the time he wrote.  We have been told there are many reasons a development might be delayed going on site, and that is true.  However, one can have a commencement notice and still be negotiating, for example, one's water infrastructure with Irish Water or one's Part V commitments.  Therefore, most of the reasons Dr. Duffy's submission gives for the delay are in fact things that happen in parallel with, not before, a commencement notice.  I am sure some of these developments are for legitimate reasons taking time, but I am also absolutely certain, since we know some of the companies that have these planning permissions, that they are stalling on developments for market and business reasons, not because of the kinds of delays Dr. Duffy talked about.  The research, which I commend to all members of the committee, was done by Mick Lennon and Richard Waldron from UCD and Queen's University, respectively.  They interviewed 39 participants involved in this legislation off the record.  They are really interesting interviews.  Those interviewed, including politicians and representatives from some of the organisations here today, spoke openly and frankly.  When one reads it, it is pretty definitive that the account I am giving is what was actually taking place.  We need a little honesty about the process.  If the purpose of this was to speed up the delivery of homes, it has not worked.  We have not seen a dramatic increase in the delivery of homes.  Yes, we have seen an increase in the number of planning permissions, and that is fine, but we could have dealt with that in another way.<\/p><p>My first question is to Dr. Duffy.  Notwithstanding the fact that he was not there at the early stages of the SHDs, is it not the case that one of the objectives of his organisation was to bypass the democratically agreed city and county development plans and have this go directly to the board?<\/p><p>While he might not have been interviewed for the research, I know Dr. Duffy is an assiduous reader of this type of material.  I have no doubt, therefore, that he will have read this piece of research.  Do the comments attributed to his organisation reflect its thinking in this regard?  Regardless of whether Dr. Duffy was the person involved at the time, are these comments an accurate depiction of what PII was involved in during the lobbying?  Is it not the case that some developers are clearly abusing this process?  They have benefited from fast-track planning and are abusing it.  <\/p><p> My next questions are more general and for the representatives from other organisations.  I hope the SHDs do not continue and I hope the Minister also takes that view.  If they do, however, do we not need some mechanism to be able to independently monitor what happens post planning permission?  I refer to ensuring there is no abuse of the system.  I will give an example.  A significant number of SHD planning permissions are being sold.  Do we not need to assess whether those sales are legitimate or speculative?  If they are speculative, do we not need to withdraw planning permission to protect the integrity of the system?  Would it be a good idea to have that kind of mechanism?  <\/p><p> I pose this question to the representatives from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in light of the system possibly continuing.  There is a four-week turnaround from publication to submission of opinions and this process involves very large, complex files.  They are so large and indepth, in fact, that when I go onto the SHD website it is almost impossible to download many of the files and print them off.  Is four weeks enough time for genuine members of the public, who are not part of culture of reckless objecting, to engage in the planning process to try to improve developments?  Is the present online interface sufficient?  Are there not better ways to ensure that we can end up with better developments through a proper consultative process?  I have not objected to a single large development in my constituency.  I would, however, like to have opportunities to engage, if we are going to have large developments, to ensure those developments have proper traffic management, amenities and green space.

As Mr. Hyde said, we are probably not determining a greater number under section 34 versus SHD.  I started my career in the local authority system and worked there for 20 years.  As such, I have huge respect for the planners and those who work in that system for local democracy.  Our intention has been to implement this with fairness, integrity and total respect for those within the planning authority system.  A planning authority has three opportunities to influence and shape the applications that come before the board.  These are the section 247 pre-application consultation, the pre-application consultation submitted under SHD, and the application stage itself.  They influence those stages very heavily.<\/p><p>At pre-application consultation stage, which is where I am often involved, all opinions that have been issued would reflect the views, concerns and requirements in terms of information, further justification and further changes that planning authorities would express at that meeting and which they have been unable to advance, even at the section 247 stage.  At application stage, we get a further planner's report and planning authority report, in terms of the chief executive's report, and a separate report from the elected members which also influences the determination.  For the most part, the board and the planning authorities remain largely consistent in their views in respect of the proposals that come before the board.  It is not the case that there is a 100% overturn rate and the planning authority recommends one thing but the board goes off in another direction.  At all stages, the planning authority has a major role to play and has a further role to play even after the development.  At no stage do we bypass or ignore.  We try to strike a balance bearing in mind that we are often bound by local area plans which, as Deputy Casey mentioned, could be 20 years out of date.

I apologise for my absence but I had to attend another meeting for a short time.<\/p><p>Some colleagues mentioned the work done by Killian Woods for <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>and also the academic report, De-democratising the Irish Planning System.  Is it fair to say that PII and the builders it represents had unprecedented access to the then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney?  According to one newspaper article:<\/p><blockquote>One PII member told the academics that then housing minister Simon Coveney heard one PII member discuss the fast-track concept in an interview on national radio, and rang him up.  The pair met four times over a six or seven-week period, locked in meetings from 8pm to midnight.<\/blockquote> <p>The PII member went through what his vision was for the Irish planning property system.  PII, as a group, had a vision for planning in Ireland and for changing the planning process.  Were the meetings with the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, arranged in a very short space of time?  Do the witnesses agree that this access to the Minister, where the PII met him six or seven times in six or seven weeks from 8 p.m. until midnight, was unprecedented for a specific group?  Were all of the meetings held in the Department?  Were other meetings held in other places in Dublin?  Were all of the meetings logged in the lobbying register? <\/p><p>We supported this Act initially because we were told by stakeholders that the planning process was one of the main blocks to delivering housing.  I was interested to hear Mr. Corr say that planning is not a roadblock for housing delivery.<\/p><p>Mr. Corr also called for adequately resourced local authorities, and I agree with him on that.  I will talk to him about how those development teams work.<\/p><p> An Bord Plean&aacute;la is charged, first, with dealing with the applications.  Last year, approximately 18,000 homes were constructed.  This might not be a question for the board, but how many homes do Mr. Corr, Dr. Norton, Mr. Spain and Dr. Duffy believe will be delivered this year?  What increase will there be on last year and do they believe any increase is attributable to the new planning process that has been put in place?  My understanding from representatives of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and others who have appeared before this committee is that the original target of 25,000 for this year will not be met and that it will be closer to 20,000 or 21,000.  It is a major concern that in a situation where there is a new process that is supposed to be delivering housing - I agree with Mr. Hyde on that - we are not seeing that delivery.<\/p><p> What have we given up instead?  We have given up an input from communities into the planning process.  That is what I hear on the ground when communities have applications foisted upon them.  This week, coincidentally, I was in Rush to listen to members of a community on a SHD application that has been made.  It is an increase on the original one and they feel that aside from making a submission to the board, with all due respect to the board, they do not have a process that enables them to discuss it with their councillors.  When this was introduced, the then new Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, sent a circular to all local authorities stating that members were not allowed to call planning files to public meetings at the county council.  Not only did we have a situation where there was a roadmap for going over the local authorities and allowing An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the legislation to disregard a development plan, a master plan or a local area plan, we were also taking away any type of consultative power the local authority members had in each local authority to call planning files to meetings and to raise points on behalf of communities.<\/p><p> I say that as somebody who rarely objects to things.  However, when one sees some of the applications that are going to the board, one can understand the concerns of communities.  Even the councillors they elect do not have a say at a formal public council meeting and can only make submissions to the plan.  Has this increased housing delivery in real terms?  Can it be attributed to SHD?  I do not believe so.  We need properly resourced local authorities that have the know-how to make those decisions at local authority level.  It is reverting to what we had previously, because I do not see the evidence when there are 15,000 permissions granted and approximately 5,000 of the permissions granted have been started, but 10,000 have not.<\/p><p> I also have a question on reapplications.  These are applications that come to the board that already have planning permission for lands, such as the Chivers site in Coolock and the like, where there is a change from housing developments or homes to intensifying and increasing the density on particular sites.  Does the board keep an eye on applications that go to it for lands that already have a live planning application?  If that is tracked, one will potentially see where sites are being flipped and where new applications are going to the board just to increase the value of a site but not to deliver homes on the ground.  A number of examples have been outlined.  I see it in my area of Dublin Fingal, which is a very active county where over 82 sites are open.  My concern is that through this process we are allowing people to flip sites and increase value.<\/p><p> Does Mr. Corr see this legislation as having brought about a substantial increase in the build-to-rent developments that we see in urban areas, in particular?  I look at certain applications and where people are looking to get their foot on the ladder the permissions being sought and granted for swathes of our towns and cities are for build-to-rent only.  We need to have more regard for housing mix.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#V00500","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#X00100","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I will conclude now.

Strategic housing development applications only form a small component of the different types of housing applications that go before the planning authorities or before An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The process is only for developments of 100 units or more.  In the two years in which it has been in operation, only 100 applications have been decided upon.

My understanding was that PII was developing policies to increase supply.  Some of these policies were mentioned in a radio interview.  Subsequently, there was contact between the Department and PII.  This was followed by meetings with the Minister at which all possible suggestions for increasing supply were covered.  Our recommendations were in our policy documents, which are publicly available.  Those documents were published at the time to feed into Rebuilding Ireland.  All meetings were put on the lobbying register.  In responding to the Deputy's question, I am going back to the records that are available.

I will begin by setting out what the experience has been as a result of two very important initiatives relating to the planning process and the delivery of housing supply.  The review of the apartment guidelines has been instrumental in leading to a switch from a tendency towards peripheral housing estate-type development to a much greater emphasis on increasing the proportion of housing coming forward that is in more central urban areas in apartment-type developments.  This switch and the strategic housing process have led to a significant increase in investment and interest in housing development.  Many international investment funds are looking carefully at Ireland and putting a lot of money into the Irish housing system.  This money is going into planning applications and into delivery.  We are seeing a follow-through.  They are not spending money to speculate.  They are spending money to deliver the product on the ground.  We are now moving very much into the delivery phase.  I think we will see that coming forward on the ground.<\/p> <p>  I referred earlier to some examples of cases we have looked at.  It is the case that some sites are sold on after planning permission is obtained.  That is part of the funding process.  In two of the sample cases we have looked at, sites were sold on to fund development.  Those schemes are now going on site or are on site.  In all types of housing applications, including SHD applications, amended applications come forward as developers seek to respond to changes in market requirements.  Again, that helps the delivery process.  The combination of those two measures has been highly successful in levering in funds for housing supply and delivery.  I believe we will see the benefits of that coming through very strongly over the next year or two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#Z00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Spain"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>As Senator Murnane O'Connor is a member of the committee, she can go next if she wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#Z00900","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

We have made our submissions, etc., on the basis of the recommendations made in Rebuilding Ireland, especially those relating to fast-tracking SHD.  In essence, we have not supported them but at this point we are seeking to be pragmatic.  It is now October 2019 and there is a proposal to extend the process for two years.  From a planning point of view, two years is very short-term.  We support it as an emergency measure but it is certainly not in line with our overall policy on the planning system.<\/p><p> Having said that, it is important to put some things into context.  The Irish Planning Institute and other parties really need to look at the planning system, especially the balance between the national, regional and local levels.  In recent times there has been considerable development at national level, and much of it has been positive.  I have in mind the national planning framework, the developing of planning guidelines, as referred to earlier, the Office of the Planning Regulator and the Land Development Agency.  Many of these developments are positive.  We need to work with them and develop them.  They will have a positive impact on the planning system.<\/p><p> On the other hand, we need to look at local level, as we mentioned earlier.  Expanding the resources and capabilities of local government and local planning authorities to enable them to carry out their planning functions is critical.  This means not only increasing the numbers of people in planning authorities but looking at the expertise that is there as well, especially in the context of the issues relating to delivery and development.  As planners we need to be far more engaged with the idea of delivery.  We need to see ourselves as partners in the development process as well, rather than leaving it at the planning permission stage, etc.  We need to look at our planning system.<\/p><p> As was mentioned earlier, good development management decisions cannot be made if good plans are not in place.  We need to put more emphasis on good local area plans and good development plans and so forth.  Other possibilities need to be explored outside this context.  SHD is really an issue within the planning system.

It is a complex issue.  One point about the planning system is that it is inter-related.  The processes of plan-making, policies at national level, appeals, decision-making and delivery are closely related to each other.  I do not think anyone can simplistically take one aspect of the planning system and see it as solving a particular issue.  The roots of some of the problems in development management lie perhaps in the nature or robustness of the plan that sits behind it.  I do not believe that there is any one aspect of the planning system that operates in isolation.  Most people are familiar with permissions.  That is a real part of the planning process but many of the problems in the process go back to the plan-making process.  Perhaps the plans are not prescriptive or flexible enough.  Perhaps they could be out of date.  There are many areas affecting the delivery or ultimate outcomes.  There is no one thing.

In fact, they may have more direct input to the decision-making process for strategic housing applications than for a standard appeal.  In fact, a third party puts in the appeal and the applicant responds.  There might be minimal input from the planning authority.  There is experience of relying on a previous assessment of an application.  In contrast, under the SHD process, the local authorities meet the board at the tri-party meeting at the pre-application stage.

I am grateful for the insight into some of the mysteries of An Bord Plean&aacute;la - they are mysteries to the public in terms of how it works.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has made some decisions that have had a positive impact and I will discuss these briefly.  However, others defy logic.  I am keen to impress a message on all the contributors to take away today.  None of them mentioned quality of life or the families, couples and individuals involved.  Many in my constituency are in their mid-20s or mid-30s and have returned home to live with their parents - who were not expecting that to happen - in order to save to purchase homes.  They have discovered many of the planning applications in the constituency are build-to-rent.  We do not seem to pay any attention to the struggles and challenges that people face.  It is all very technical, cold and sterile language.  What we are about really is the provision of homes.  I will say a little more about that.<\/p> <p>  As my colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, stated, we supported the SHD process on the basis that it would put homes into play more quickly.  As a long-standing local authority member for close to 20 years, I have views on that.  It is an imperfect system.  We know that of the 16,000 odd units granted permission under the SHD process, some 6,000 odd have been constructed.  The experience in my constituency is that this process has not delivered homes.  It has delivered housing units, if it has delivered anything at all.  However, co-living, student accommodation and build-to-rent applications are predominately the nature of the applications that have been made.  We need to bring the human element back into this.<\/p><p>Rents for modest homes in different parts of my constituency start at &euro;2,000 and rise.  Of course, it is in a developer's interests and in the interests of speculators to build to rent.  The equivalent mortgage is between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,100.  I know of multiple examples of constituents who have managed to comply with Central Bank rules and who may have been paying &euro;1,800 or &euro;1,900 per month for rent.  Then they succeeded in getting a mortgage because they had a substantial down payment or deposit with the banks.  They found they were paying &euro;1,050 to &euro;1,100 per month for the mortgage, saving &euro;700 or &euro;800 and increasing disposable income.<\/p><p> An Bord Plean&aacute;la must listen to this.  We are talking about people's lives.  It is not a question of units, construction or speculation.  It is the biggest investment for these people in their lifetime.  Most of the witnesses look close to my age.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs to bring some humanity to the decisions it is making.  It needs to understand there are people behind this.<\/p><p> Constituents of mine include parents in their mid-60s who were looking forward to retirement.  They do not begrudge their adult children coming home but it was not what they anticipated.  Since their children cannot afford rents, they are coming home.  One mother told me her son was coming home and she did not know what he was doing but he had come home to reflect on whether to save or leave.  It is very much in the hands of the designers, planners, overseers and implementers to come up with ideas and practical plans for people rather than for speculators, builders or developers.  It should be for the end users, the people who are going to make their lives in these places.<\/p><p> There are several specific issues I want to raise relating to my constituency that concern planning applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#CC00600","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>The Deputy is already over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#DD00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I will make it quick.

An Bord Plean&aacute;la dismissed it and said there was no context.  The board explained that if it granted permission, there would be development by stealth.  I would like to see the board look at Citywest and put it to South Dublin County Council that the 2012 local area plan for Fortunestown is hopelessly out of date and needs to be updated quickly.  Planning applications are going in for all the amenity land that was outlined in that local area plan.  The amenities envisaged under the 2012 plan are hopelessly outdated too.<\/p> <p>  No reference has been made to amenities today.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la may say it is not within the board's remit.  If an application is lodged and it doubles, triples or quadruples what was envisaged in the local area plan, then the decision-makers must look at doubling and tripling the amenities and obliging developers to provide amenities.<\/p> <p>  The same goes for the Scholarstown area.  The only reason people knew that a strategic housing development was being lodged for potentially more than 600 units, 500 of which are build to rent, in a settled mature residential area is that that pre-planning request appeared online by accident.<\/p> <p>  The main issues I have with the strategic housing development process are the lack of visibility and democratic input, aside from writing a letter.  There is no forwards and backwards with officials like this or like we used to have at planning meetings in the local authority.<\/p> <p>  The deputations said the local authorities were highly involved in the process, and I take that point.  The local council may be closely and intimately involved in a detailed way, but local councillors are not and they represent the democratic mandate.  This all seems to the public to be invisible.  There is a complete lack of transparency.  Decisions are made without any apparent context.  I will leave the deputations with three messages and I thank them for their forbearance.<\/p><p>We are talking about people.  The witnesses have not mentioned people and in their commentary regarding increases in density, they did not mention amenities.  People and amenities do not appear to be on their minds at all.  People in mature residential areas will justifiably question what is in this for them.  Many of them have lived in these areas for years and made their homes in them.  I am speaking not about new urban areas, but mature residential areas in which people are used to a quality of life and a particular way of living.  They will have this imposed on them without any consideration of their needs in the context of the desire to expand densities in their living space.  I wish I had more time because there is a lot more I would like to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#DD00300","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Hyde to respond first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#EE00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to our opening statement.

The coldness of the language is based on the fact that we are talking about processes.  Planners are driven around the idea of sustainable development, which, of course, we understand as having social, economic and environmental objectives.  Sometimes, it is a difficult balancing act.  Planning often is about trade-offs.  I am encouraged to note that practice is improving in some areas, particularly around plan-making.  Good local plans are informed by good principles of place-making and the application of key skills such as urban design.  In recent times, we have seen very good examples of this.  It is only in this way that we will get the proper development management outcomes.  The plan is extremely important.  We often forget about that.  Development management is ultimately based on good plans.  Obviously, there are other matters to consider, such as planning guidance, etc., but the planning guidance is integrated into good plan-making and that is a process in which there is consultation and the involvement of the community and local elected representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#FF00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor Norton"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Corr and Dr. Norton and I invite Mr. Spain and Dr. Duffy to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#FF00600","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I will make a few comments and Mr. Spain will respond to the policy issues.

As he said, this is not just about numbers, it is about quality in terms of sustainable housing development and what that means for people's lives.  In terms of the strategic housing development process, while the policy framework remains the same as for the standard application process, from the outset there has been more emphasis by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on qualitative issues and compliance with good planning practice, as set out in sustainable residential development guidelines.  We have seen some applications refused purely on grounds of the development not being of adequate quality in terms of design, layout and so on.<\/p><p>It is inevitable that there is a degree of friction as we move towards a system that involves densifying our urban areas.  We are seeing this friction, which is reflected in many of the comments we are hearing.  Many established urban areas consist predominantly of low-density two-storey housing.  We are introducing a greater variety of housing types.  Our efforts to introduce higher-density apartment schemes are causing friction with the established communities.  Such efforts are essential if we are to achieve our overall sustainable development objectives, such as the achievement of a more compact urban form and the maintenance of a more sustainable pattern of development which supports public transport and road facilities, etc.  That needs to be managed carefully.

All of the contributions we have heard contained references to the democratic process involved in the SHD process.  Most of us feel that what is happening is not adequate.  I do not think it is right.  It is not fair on communities.  We are governed by the national planning framework, which is a Government regulation.  We must remember that nobody in this House had a democratic right to vote on the framework.  There was no democratic input into the national planning framework.  We are now asking communities that have not had their local area plans reviewed for many years - Newtownmountkennedy, for example, has not had a review for 20 years - to accept that they have no right of appeal when an SHD application is made.  All they can do is make a submission.  It is unfair because no community can afford a judicial review.  This brings me back to the extent to which this whole process is subject to the democratic process.  I cannot support this whole process because it is fundamentally flawed.  Our communities are our heart.  If we do not bring them with us, we are wasting our time.  This is a reflection on the process, rather than on the board itself.<\/p> <p>  I would like to mention a few specifics.  We spoke earlier about the second round of consultation.  I want to tease this out.  I have to say I still consider 36% as a failure.  Are the witnesses telling us that these developers were informed at the end of the second part of the public consultation process - I am not talking about the part with the local authorities - that they would be wasting their time in the absence of serious significant information, such as an environmental impact assessment?  If, as it seems, the developers proceeded to submit an application directly to the board, can they be said to be serious about delivering homes or are they merely interested in getting planning permission to flip the land?<\/p> <p>  I ask for the indulgence of the Chair because I have been sitting here since this morning.  I think I am entitled to a bit more than two minutes.  Having spent three years on the whole housing issue, I keep coming back to the question of local democracy.  I am increasingly of the opinion that local authorities, local area plans and county development plans need to be taken to another level completely.  Local area plans and county development plans set out how communities will be delivered and what type of infrastructure is needed.  As somebody said here a week ago, there is a need for 3D planning that allows people to see how their communities will develop.  That would allow us to start penalising developers who do not deliver.  The infrastructure, the zoned land, the densities and the height are there.  Too many unknowns are going into the SHDs.  People have no input into them.<\/p> <p>  We all want to see planning working.  We all want to see homes delivered.  That is our purpose here.  To be quite honest, I do not know whether the SHD process has delivered that at the end of the day.  Ms Kenny said there has been an increase of 16% from the normal process.  The success rate or approval rating for what has been put in has increased from 50% to 67%.  I do not think that is a good return in light of the effort that has been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#GG00300","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":148,"content":"<p>The Deputy has spoken for more than four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#GG00400","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>On public information and IT, the board appeared before the committee and stated that it would upgrade its website.

Each guest might identify whether he or she is a member of the IPI because some members are observing the meeting.  I am disappointed because what Mr. Corr has told the committee is not altogether consistent with what other members of the organisation have told me.<\/p> <p>  I stated earlier that the centralisation of planning function is fundamentally at odds with the principles of subsidiarity.

Nevertheless, I ask the question on behalf of the committee and would like a response today.<\/p> <p>  SHD should be scrapped.  It is an affront to democracy and to the democratic planning process.  It does not permit elected representatives on local councils throughout the country participate in the development of sustainable communities or represent their constituents or their people.  That is fundamentally wrong and runs deeply contrary to the Aarhus Convention.  I will challenge it and, leaving the meeting with more resolve, I undertake to engage with the Green Party, which is very much to the fore of the political movement in the House, as well as in Europe, in the run-up to a general election.  We need to examine whether the Houses of the Oireachtas support something that is at variance with the Aarhus Convention.  I believe that it is at variance and we Members need to get political about it.  We must mobilise our communities and say enough is enough.  We live in a Republic, with a capital R, and in a democracy, with a capital D, and we must respect and allow our public and local representatives to engage, but this is an affront to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#HH00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Let us remember that SHDs exist because the Oireachtas voted for them, although I voted against them.  I say that only in deference to our guests.<\/p> <p>  To return to what Mr. Corr said earlier, I believe we do need cheerleaders for local authorities, which were wrongly blamed for the delays in the planning process even though they were due to the design of the planning process, which is a central government matter.  Industry, too, had a responsibility in respect of its engagement with the process.<\/p><p>Not all of us who object to SHDs are opposed to increased densities.  I am a strong advocate of increased densities in urban centres.  I live in the suburbs and believe there is a role for increased densities in the urban cores of suburbs, a position I will defend even if I lose votes over it.  Nevertheless, it concerns me sometimes that any politician who wishes to engage in the planning process through third party submissions and appeals is automatically branded as nimbyistic.  While I do not mean that anyone at the meeting has suggested that, it is part of the public debate.  Many of us, in advocating for increased density, also want to ensure there is adequate infrastructure, public transport and so on.  The difficulty is that while the board or planning authority can make a decision on the plan, it cannot control whether adequate investment in public transport, amenities and so on will follow.  I wish to defend the rights of members of the public and politicians to engage in the process because that is important.<\/p><p> I challenge Mr. Spain on one point.  He is correct that the SHDs and the new apartment design guidelines have increased the level of investment in the sector, but they have also reduced standards.  The new apartment design standards will significantly reduce the size of apartments, including for families.  I am not against build-to-rent in principle but there is increased flexibility for more studio apartments, for example, and there will be increased numbers of smaller apartments in areas where they are not needed.  In the urban centre of Dublin, for instance, what are needed are more two and three-bedroom apartments to allow families live there for life, rather than small apartments.<\/p><p> I return to the legal difference between the planning authority and the board in respect of county development plans.  It is important we understand the matter.  Am I correct that the board has to have regard for the development plan only when a planning authority has to comply with it?  For example, in the controversial case of St. Anne's Park, a city manager can oppose the proposition but the board can approve it because there is a legal difference in respect of the approach.  Will Ms Kenny confirm that?<\/p><p> I asked Mr. Corr a question and it may have slipped his mind.  If SHDs are to continue, although I would prefer if they did not, are there mechanisms we could put in place to monitor them independently, in order that the kinds of abuses about which some of us are concerned could be identified and teased out?<\/p><p> Finally, I turn to Dr. Duffy.  If fast-tracking applications is the only measure that concerns him in respect of this issue, rather than undermining the city and county development plans - I will take him at his word in that regard - I presume he would have no difficulty with local authorities being given the primary responsibility to make such decisions if the same period, namely, the all-in 22 to 24 weeks that is currently dealt with under SHDs, was dealt with by local authorities.  I presume that the problem is with the 22 or 24-week period rather than whether it is the local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la that makes the primary decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#HH00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I have concerns that in the past two years, there have been 100 cases.

It was a big let-down.  I live in County Carlow, which is classed as rural Ireland, and we need houses to be built.  Given that the board deals with planning and housing, I am sure that it understands the need for local authorities to build houses.

I am not asking him to repeat anything but I wonder whether he has anything more to say about the active plan-management proposals.  On the use-it-or-lose-it element, Mr. Corr stated that, in addition to the vacant site levy, other measures could possibly be introduced that would address this element of the delay.

That is an important point.<\/p> <p>  My other questions are for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

It is not to say we could not improve further; we most definitely could.

Under section 247, which relates to the planning authority, and in our own process, there should not be a rubber-stamping exercise.

We should not be looking for a rate of 100%.  The public should always feel it can influence the decision.

I hope the rate will be higher.  As I said at the outset, 100% are objected to and opposed by the elected representatives.  It is about balance.  We talked about that balance and the balance between local plans, national plans and national guidance, but there are also site-specific circumstances to be accounted for.  It is impossible to say 30% this way or 50% that way.  Each proposal is examined on its merits.  The board cannot control the proposals submitted to it.  We can give advice but it is up to the individual applicants to make applications that they regard as fitting and to push the boundaries as much as they believe is appropriate.  There will always be issues outside their control, particularly regarding environmental or infrastructural deficits.  We cannot always control these.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point regarding the legal difference between the board and the planning authority in terms of development plans, a planning authority cannot materially contravene its own plan without going through a specific process relating to material contravention.  If it submits an application that it supports and gets three quarters of the councillors to vote in favour of it, then it can do so.  Therefore, there is a mechanism for the planning authorities to grant permission for developments that materially contravene their plans.  It is just a different process than the one the board goes through.  There are often nuances within a local area plan.  The planning authorities interpret them as they do but they will not materially contravene a plan without going through the process.  It is available to them, however, so they can materially contravene their own plans.<\/p> <p>  Equally, the board can materially contravene a plan only if it has regard to the provisions regarding inconsistencies or ambiguities in a development plan, a local area plan, national policy or the changing circumstances in the specific environment.  Again, it has its own procedure.  In both instances, there is full transparency as to what is considered in materially contravening a plan.  I do not know whether that assists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#LL00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I shall proceed to Dr. Norton and Mr. Corr.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#LL00400","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Dr. Norton will respond later.

The Deputy probably made his points out of frustration.<\/p> <p>  If applicants do not take advice given or offered in respect of section 247 when submitting applications, they do so at their peril.<\/p><p>The IPI has made clear that it does not like SHD.  It exists and we must work with what we are given.  In our submission, we call for the powers to be returned to local authorities before December 2021.  We are practical about this matter.  We expect it to be extended and wish to have an input into it.  That is why we are calling for the powers to be brought back to local authorities by December 2021.<\/p><p> On Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question regarding the monitoring that can be implemented as part of the SHD included in this review, the board has its reporting mechanisms.  Again, this is temporary for two years.  As I stated, we do not want it to be as a permanent solution; we want the powers to be returned to local authorities.

The issues of quantity, timing and so on were raised, but what is often forgotten is the quality of decision making.  It is far more difficult to monitor the quality of outcomes in the planning process, particularly in development management.  On monitoring outputs in this process, it may be useful to have a qualitative analysis of some of the outputs of strategic housing development if it is to continue.  The SHD regulations came into effect in July 2017.  As Mr. Corr stated, we advocate that strategic housing development should be a temporary measure and that these functions should be returned to local authorities.  However, it is acknowledged in the conclusion that there is an understanding it is an emergency measure.  We suggest that if it is to continue to 2021 as suggested, the powers would revert to local planning authorities at that stage.  That is the view of the IPI.  As I stated, we wish to be pragmatic about this and supportive of initiatives made within the context of a larger review of the planning system which may be needed.<\/p><p>The more specific issue of active land management was raised.  Planners have a particular role in that regard in terms of planning and getting more engaged with its delivery aspect.  There are some examples of good practice evolving around the country although they have not been codified.  Active land management is probably all about understanding in a better way what sort of land is available, its ownership and the level of activity on it, such as whether it is inactive or undeveloped.  On a deeper level, consideration could be given to the reasons land is inactive or underdeveloped and seeking to understand that on a site by site or parcel by parcel basis.  Further, one could identify strategies for individual parcels of land within a larger area-based approach.  IPI members have asked us to provide continuing professional development training on that on and we are working on a programme for planners in the area of active land management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#MM00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor Norton","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I am probably unique among the witnesses in that I am not a member of the Irish Planning Institute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102200002#NN00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>There you go, Senator Boyhan.

The figures for life expectancy are mentioned in so many submissions, with a life expectancy of 66 years for Traveller men, which is 15 years less than the average, and 12 years less than average for Traveller women.  Traveller babies are 3.6 times more likely to die in infancy than among the mainstream population and Traveller mortality in general is 3.5 times higher.  In recent weeks, we have had the stark figures on suicide rates, which, of course, are part of health.  Today, we are focusing on health more generally and we will move now to hear the submissions.  As there are many witnesses, we will be strict about the five-minute rule because if some take seven minutes, the person at the end gets squeezed, which is not particularly fair.

We must start the submission, as we always do, by stating the obvious: the Traveller community is in crisis.  The evidence is there for everyone to see.  The Traveller community is at the top of every negative statistic and the bottom of every positive outcome in Irish society, whether education, employment, health, life expectancy, mental health, addiction and now the escalating suicide rates.  The fact is that we are haemorrhaging people through chronic illness, ill health, addiction and now suicide.  The underlying causes are poverty and poor living conditions, social isolation and exclusion.  We in the Travelling community are losing our ability to cope and to endure.  We are dealing with layers upon layers of grief.  For decades the Traveller community has experienced unrelenting anti-Traveller bias and racism.  We are the most disadvantaged, discriminated against and marginalised community within Irish society.  Urgent action is needed to turn these challenges around.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Traveller population is currently fewer than 40,000.  Today we are talking about the inequalities in Traveller health and mental health and the actions needed to address these inequalities.  In doing so we cannot leave out the factors that contribute to the crisis in Traveller health and mental health.  This is a crisis in Traveller accommodation, poor educational attainment among the Traveller community and high levels of unemployment, social exclusion and anti-Traveller bias and racism.  These issues are interlinked and negatively impact Traveller health and well-being.  To resolve the crisis and the destruction we are witnessing within the Travelling community, we must understand their interconnectivity and take a holistic approach in addressing each of these issues.  These are not insurmountable issues to fix.  With commitment and resolution they can be fixed, and we will be a better people and a better country for it.  The neglect and inequality the Traveller community and pockets of deprived, long-term disadvantaged communities throughout Ireland have experienced and endured are a stain on the character of the nation and must be put right.  Ireland is only a small country but we stand proud with the nations around the world for the contributions our country has made on the world stage.  We must, however, address the internal challenges and support the people our nation has left behind for far too long.  Successive Governments have failed to put in place decisive actions to resolve the inequalities which exist within our country and which have allowed so many of our people to be left behind, doing the best they can and trying to survive in conditions and with challenges that in many cases are hard to imagine in a first-world country such as Ireland.  Sadly, too often the contributions made by individuals from the Traveller community and disadvantaged communities throughout Ireland that have made our nation what it is have been forgotten or underappreciated.<\/p> <p>  As a nation we cannot continue to blame people and communities for the marginalised, disadvantaged and deprived situations they were born into and are trying to survive in.  It is time to reach out and pull up the citizens of our nation that have been left behind.  We are not a problem people.  We are not problem communities.  We are people and communities with problems that are the direct result of generational poverty and exclusion.  We need help and support to overcome the challenges our communities are facing, decisive Government actions and the implementation of equality-based policies to address these inequalities and challenges.<\/p> <p>  I will outline some statistics relating to the Travelling community.  Life expectancy for Traveller men is 15 years younger than in wider society, for Traveller women 11 years younger.  Our infant mortality rate is 3.7% higher than that of the general population.  Suicide among Travelling men is just under seven times higher and now accounts for the deaths of 11% of Travellers annually.  We currently have no statistics on the suicide rate among Travelling women, but this has become a very worrying trend in recent years.<\/p><p>A number of young Travellers, boys and girls, have also committed suicide.<\/p><p> I will outline some of our key recommendations.  A national Traveller action plan should be published and implemented urgently.  This should include the establishment of an institutional mechanism, within the HSE and the Department of Health, to drive delivery and implementation.  This must be inclusive of clear targets, indicators and outcomes, timeframes and budgets.  Sl&aacute;intecare also recommends access to universal free general  practitioner, GP, healthcare within the next five years.  We recommend that Travellers be prioritised and fast-tracked in this process.  We further recommend, with immediate effect, that all Traveller employment and primary healthcare projects are entitled to medical care similar to disability, community services programmes and community employment schemes.  This would involve in the region of 300 medical cards.<\/p><p> Traveller-specific infrastructure, including Traveller health and primary healthcare projects, should be protected and receive increased resources for their expansion and development in line with the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  It is important that health reforms do not undermine the work in progress of the Traveller health units, THUs, given their institutional knowledge and impact on the ground.  It must also be ensured that clear budgets are allocated and protected to address Traveller health and inequalities.<\/p><p> Finally, a national Traveller suicide intervention and prevention strategy needs to be implemented urgently.  Some of the statistics that we do not have-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen Sherlock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Ms Sherlock has reached the end of her allotted time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#E00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I will finish there.

We have provided a comprehensive submission, which will serve as a reference document, and we are also available if the members of the committee require any further information.  We will give a quick overview of the issues involved and leave time for discussion at the end, as we feel that is the best use of time.  We would like to highlight the key issues in the area of Traveller health, including the poor health status of Travellers, the impact of broader social determinants, to which Ms Sherlock referred, the positive developments that have occurred and the need for investment in a strategic and co-ordinated response to address these Traveller health issues.<\/p> <p>  I will now contextualise Traveller health within the broader social determinants.  There is a need to recognise the causal pathways, which include discrimination, education, employment and accommodation.  If we are to realistically address Traveller health inequalities, we need a whole-of-Government approach in addressing these determinants.  We commend the work of the committee to date in exploring these issues and recommend that other thematic sessions should include questions on their impact on Travellers' health.<\/p> <p>  Next year will mark a decade since the publication of the comprehensive all-Ireland Traveller health study.  That took three and a half years to complete, cost taxpayers &euro;1.3 million and involved a concerted effort between Traveller organisations, Traveller peer researchers from primary healthcare projects and researchers in UCD.  The study yielded an unprecedented participation rate of 80%, an exceptional response.  The evidence of the study, which we keep highlighting, showed that Travellers have the lowest life expectancy of any group in Ireland.  Overall life expectancy for Travellers is 66, with Traveller men living some 15 years less and Traveller women some 11 years less than their counterparts.<\/p> <p>  In addition to those statistics on infant mortality and overall mortality, it is important to note that the study suggested that institutional discrimination does exist within the health services.  Less than half of all Travellers had complete trust in health professionals compared with trust levels in the general population, according to a study.  More than half of Travellers were concerned about the quality of care they receive when they engage with the service.  Some 40% of Travellers reported discrimination in accessing health services.  This was supported by almost 70% of the service providers, who agreed that their services discriminated against Travellers.  Services providers were also interviewed in the study to determine what they felt were the issues.<\/p> <p>  We know from the study that Travellers are dying from the same causes as the general population.  They are not dying of any exotic illnesses particular to Travellers, they are dying of heart disease, cancer, respiratory disease and suicide.   They are, however, dying in far greater numbers across all ages.  If this was any other group in Irish society, it would be seen as a national crisis.<\/p><p>However, as our colleagues have pointed out, the findings of the study have been largely ignored.  When they were published in 2010, we were told no action could be taken as there were no resources available due to the recession.  Despite the recovery, we still have no action and Traveller health continues to deteriorate.  We believe it is not prioritised within the Department, or within Government, and we require leadership and urgent action.<br\/><br\/>It would be remiss not to acknowledge that some very positive developments have occurred in the past 20 years, in particular the development of a strong Traveller health infrastructure at national, regional and local level.  I refer also to the establishment of the National Traveller Health Advisory Committee.  That was a structure within the Department of Health that represented Travellers, the HSE and the Department.  It was responsible for the development of Traveller health policy and it had oversight of the Traveller health budget.  Its achievements include the publication of the Traveller health strategy in 2002, the piloting of the ethnic identifier, which has now been rolled out, and the groundbreaking All-Ireland Traveller Health Study.<br\/><br\/>We acknowledge that the committee heard last week that the National Traveller Health Advisory Committee was reviewed and that a recommendation was made to disband the group.  However, that was not the case and, in its absence, there are no representative mechanisms to drive a response to the detailed findings.  As we said, we have a lot of evidence and many strategies; we need an implementation plan.<br\/><br\/>We are awaiting the establishment of an essential structure to monitor Traveller health policy and mainstream Traveller health across the Department in line with the commitments in the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS.<br\/><br\/>At regional level, we have the Traveller health units, which are partnership structures between HSE and local Traveller groups coterminous with the original health boards, through which Traveller health issues are highlighted and mainstreamed into regional health service provision.<br\/><br\/>In addition to national and regional structures, the Primary Health Care for Travellers projects at local level, which have been acknowledged as the cornerstone on which health services are delivered effectively to Travellers, were clearly reflected in the All Ireland Traveller Health Study, with 83% of Travellers receiving health information from the primary healthcare projects.  There is also a higher uptake of cervical screening and breast cancer screening in areas where the projects exist.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, this Traveller health infrastructure has weakened due to lack of investment in the past ten years, leading to the closure of a number of these essential projects.<br\/><br\/>There has been disproportionate disinvestment in Traveller health which pre-dated austerity.  This was when the budget was transferred from the Department to the local health structure.  This was identified in 2009 to the Joint Committee on Health and Children in which we highlighted that in 2007, &euro;1 million was allocated for Traveller health developments, of which &euro;100,000 was allocated towards the All Ireland Traveller Health Study, with the remainder put towards balancing the HSE budget.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, in 2008, a further &euro;1 million was allocated to Traveller health developments.  The HSE introduced a stipulation that one could only spend in 2008 what one spent in 2007, therefore, once again, &euro;900,000 of the Traveller health budget went to balancing the HSE budget.  Of a potential &euro;2 million for Traveller health development funding, given Traveller health status, the All Ireland Traveller Health Study and the significant needs, &euro;1.8 million was used to balance the HSE books.  We believe this reflects a lack of prioritisation of Traveller health and a disregard for Traveller health inequalities.  Traveller health has not received any new development funding from the Department of Health.  There has been once-off funding and money given towards the employment of mental health workers locally.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the commitment in Action 73 of the NTRIS to develop a detailed action plan with clear targets, indicators, timeframes and resources.  A robust consultation process produced the first draft of the action plan, which totally ignored some of the recommendations from the consultation process.  While we would like to acknowledge the HSE's commitment to revise the plan, there is a need to ensure that the revised plan includes the establishment of a new institutional mechanism under the aegis of the Department of Health and the HSE to drive the implementation of the plan.  <br\/><br\/>Our recommendations are the same as those of my colleagues from Minc&eacute;ir Whiden.  The need for ethnic equality monitoring is the last one.  We need to roll out the ethnic identifier across all health and social care administrative systems.  We require that to monitor access, participation and outcomes in terms of all services for Travellers.  This will provide an evidence base to inform Traveller health policy and service utilisation in the future.  It would also help to target and ensure more effectiveness and efficiency in the health service.  It will also ensure that under section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014 there will be a statutory requirement on public health bodies which are mandated to take proactive steps to assess equality and eliminate discrimination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Brigid Quirke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Quirke.

This is not new information and it should definitely not be this difficult to have our community's issues heard and acted upon.<\/p> <p>  In our written submission we have raised many issues and put forward recommendations, but for today I just want to emphasise one issue, namely, that the current national health structures and very limited policy implementation that has taken place for the advancement of Traveller and Traveller women's health have failed to have any meaningful long-term impact overall.  Achievements have been made locally and regionally by Travellers and Traveller organisations, including primary healthcare projects, but we should also recognise the contributions made by individual healthcare and HSE professionals.  However, while the Department of Health continues to behave like an absentee landlord, ignoring the need for structural and institutional changes in the health service's thinking and practice, we will progress no further.<\/p> <p>  As our submission points out, the studies and research have been done, and the findings, as the committee has heard from Kathleen and Brigid, are stark and shocking, yet there has been no targeted strategy or action plan put in place to address the health inequalities for Travellers since Traveller Health: A National Strategy 2002-2005 and the national intercultural strategy over a five-year period, which ended in 2012.  Health issues for Travellers have been excluded entirely from all mainstream health related strategies, including the current Healthy Ireland framework.  I suggest that members google the document.  There are two references to other strategies within it with regard to Travellers.  The only direction that the Department of Health appears to want to go down is to pigeonhole all matters concerning Traveller health into social inclusion.  This is not the answer, and again the question has to be asked how long more we have to wait for the Department of Health to meet its own policy commitments to Travellers.  We need implementation.<\/p> <p>  Nine years after the launch of the all-Ireland Traveller health study in 2010, as Brigid has said, there is still no Department lead and there are no personnel with a brief on Traveller policy within the Department of Health.  It has been more than two years since a commitment was made to develop and implement a detailed national Traveller action plan based on the findings of this study using a social determinant approach.  Yet as has been said, Travellers continue to die from cancer, heart disease and other preventable conditions, including death by suicide, in greater numbers than the majority population.  Of course we cannot demonstrate that with hard data because there is still no desegregated data collection across all of the health systems in Ireland, and I will say that that suits the Department in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Regional Traveller health units are under-resourced and their funding has not been ring-fenced for Traveller health.  Despite underspends in some Traveller health budgets, the HSE in some regions made cuts to key services for Travellers under cost-saving measures, reducing the hours of Traveller community health workers and other supports.  In one region the Traveller health unit has not met, despite efforts by Traveller groups in the area to make it happen.  There also needs to be more accountability and transparency within the health system in relation to Traveller health budgets.  In addition to this, the national Traveller health advisory committee, which was the driver behind the all-Ireland Traveller health study, has not been convened since 2012, despite repeated calls by Traveller organisations.  Members will have heard Brigid say at a previous meeting that it was a recommendation that it would not continue to meet.  That was misleading to this committee.  That was not the case<\/p> <p>  In 2017, we saw the launch of the national Traveller health-Roma inclusion strategy, with a range of actions on health.  We are still awaiting the long-promised national Traveller action plan from the Department of Health.  Another commitment was also made by the Department to review and improve existing arrangements for engagement between Traveller organisations, the HSE and the Department of Health.  In May 2018, the Department, the HSE and organisations participated in a workshop where our views and position were made very clear around a number of issues, including the effect of monitoring and implementation of Traveller policy, the need for institutional mechanisms representative of all stakeholders to drive the implementation, and dedicated resources - financial and personnel.  These issues and other issues are being raised continually by all stakeholders with little response from the Department of Health.  A draft of the national Traveller health action plan was circulated for feedback in March 2019.<\/p><p>The draft document was inadequate and demonstrated the lack of attention and commitment the Department of Health has given to addressing the health inequalities of Travellers.  The repeated request is that the Department of Health urgently address the issues we have raised here today by finalising and, more importantly, implementing a holistic and gender responsive national Traveller health action plan which will deliver, hopefully, real change in health outcomes for Travellers.  An independent implementation body must be established and much have ring-fenced budgets in order to drive delivery and implementation.  There are more recommendations in our submission but I will not go through them now.<\/p><p> The issue is implementation.  The studies, statistics and evidence are available.  Travellers are dying in greater numbers and at earlier ages than is the case in the majority population.  How much more of that evidence is required before there is action?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I am a Traveller from Kilmallock in east County Limerick.  I am married with two children, one in secondary school and one in preschool.  I represent Travellers in east Limerick on the HSE Traveller health unit and I am chairperson of the Kilmallock Traveller Women's Group, which was formed in April 2017.  It is a lively, vibrant group that is ready to stand up and be counted.  We are committed to working towards changing outcomes for Travellers.  It is a mixed age group made up of grandmothers, mothers and young single women.  In the short period since it was established, the group has also set up Kilmallock Traveller Men's Group.  Ours is a voluntary group with no staff.  We are dependent on volunteers.  We are supported by Ballyhoura Development and receive funding from the HSE Traveller health unit for our group activities.  We appreciate the opportunity to attend this meeting so members can hear about the situation in which we find ourselves in east Limerick.<\/p> <p>  Recently, an assessment examining the health needs of Travellers in east Limerick was carried out by Ballyhoura Development.  I was the Traveller representative on the steering group for the project.  This was the first meaningful engagement with the Traveller community in east Limerick.  The methodology used to conduct the research was peer-led, which meant that members of the Traveller community were employed directly to carry out the survey.  I am proud of the work the team of peer researchers completed.  The outcomes from the report are not just findings, but our real life health issues which are not being addressed in a way that supports change for us.  In this day and age and in this country, can one believe that only 29 out of 424 Traveller individuals in east Limerick are over 50 years of age?  Worse, only three are over 65 years of age.  One of them is my father.  It frightens me to think that I might not see 50 years of age and that I am much less likely to reach the age of 65 years.  For how long do the members of the committee expect to live?  I am due to retire in 23 years' time.  Our recent assessment demonstrates that I will more than likely not be around for this.  It appears there will be no need for the old age pension or the fair deal scheme for me.<\/p> <p>  I wondered how I might get the committee to understand where we are coming from and how our health issues impact on our lives and those of our children.  Now that we have completed the assessment we realise its seriousness and the time limits in which we must achieve change.  The stereotype of Travellers has led to discrimination in all sectors, including education.  My experience of education was not positive at the start.  When I was in primary school, I was automatically segregated into a remedial class, without reason or assessment but simply because I am a Traveller.  I often spent hours in the playground singing instead of being in class learning, which I was well capable of.  It is no wonder that we are such good singers today, or is that another stereotype?<\/p> <p>  It was only when I was old enough to realise that I was being treated differently and told my mother that the situation changed.  It was because of my mother's belief in my ability and her perseverance that I was eventually integrated back into the regular class.  Since then I have completed secondary and third level education.  I am forever grateful for my mother's intuition, but 30 years later I find myself doing the same thing for my children.  What has improved?  I know from the personal experience of my immediate family that the low expectation of Travellers to perform well in education continues, along with segregation and discrimination.  If we cannot change this discrimination in primary school, where can we change it?<\/p> <p>  Do members realise that 48% of my community in east Limerick live in mobile homes or trailers?  While I am lucky to have my house, and the mortgage to go with it, some of my family have been on a council housing waiting list for more than 16 years.  That is 16 years of living in damp, mouldy, overcrowded conditions.  Is it any wonder that our life expectancy is so low?<\/p> <p>  Some 80% of Travellers are unemployed compared to 5% of the general population.<\/p><p>We need meaningful employment opportunities for Travellers.  I want to be able to ask my children what they would like to be when they grow up and to know there are no barriers preventing them from realising their dreams.  <\/p><p> I cannot leave today without mentioning mental health and how the conditions and situations in which we find ourselves are impacting on our mental health.  Every day, I see how mental health issues affect the people I love and care for.  How many family and friends do members think I have lost?  How long could they hold the weight of these factors on their shoulders?  None of these issues is standalone.  They are all interlinked and contribute to the multiple layers of disadvantage continuously experienced by my community.  What can we do about it?  Where is the innovation and the new ways of thinking, for example, Traveller-led methodologies across all sectors, including housing, education and health?  This means that models similar to primary healthcare projects are applied across other sectors, specifically education and housing.  We know this way of working achieves great results.  For example, the assessment carried out in east Limerick identified 113% more Travellers than the census in 2016 identified.  Ours is one of the best educated countries in the world.  Why are we continuously using one-trick pony solutions when it comes to Traveller welfare?  In east Limerick we are already on the brink of losing our oldest generation.  We need support and resources to bring about change for our community.  The first step for east Limerick is the establishment of a Traveller health primary healthcare team.  While we have received a commitment in principle from the HSE, time is running out.  Do I not deserve to be around to see my grandchildren grow up?  We see ourselves as advocates for our community and we already bear the weight of our community on our shoulders.  It is up to us to find the solutions, be the listeners, make the connections and find the words to help but we cannot do this without the support of this committee.

It is a great honour.  I must start at the very beginning, when the primary healthcare project started.  I was one of the people who approached the health board back in the 1990s.  It was 1992, I believe.  There were about 14 people sitting at the table.  When I said that we needed primary healthcare for Travellers, I was told that it would not work.  When I asked why, I was told that it would mean Travellers going out, talking to Travellers and moreover, Travellers are not educated, cannot drive and cannot do this, that and the other.  I said that our need was greater than ever.  We did not win that day but when I was coming away from the table, I said that I would be back.  Back I went to a member of staff.  He said, \"You're not giving up Missie, are you?\" and I said no, that I was not giving up.  He agreed to a pilot for nine months.  I asked if he could do a little more than that and he asked me what I meant.  I asked him to come to the steering group meetings so that he would know how the project was going and he did.<\/p> <p>  In the beginning we visited 85 families.  Now we are visiting 300 families.  We devised our own questionnaire, went through it with them and found out all of their needs.  Then we took that back to Pavee Point and to the health providers and services there.  At that time, three needs came out of the process, namely, a well woman clinic for our women, a hearing test for the children and a dental service.  One of the aims of the project is to try to close the gaps in the health service.  That went on and we got all of the answers there and it went very well.<\/p><p>We were able to take some of our women over to the Well Woman where some of them with breast cancer were caught in time.  We saved the lives of some of our women.  Some of them are living in the programme today.  <\/p><p> As part of the programme, we mapped out the provisions for children out on the sites, who would then go for their hearing and other tests.  Those of us involved in this programme attended meetings with the top officials in the Department of Health and Children.  I thought it was great for me to be able to sit at meetings with the higher up bodies who need to give the Travellers support.  We lobbied for a health strategy for Travellers and it took many hours over a nine year period of sitting round the table at meetings in the Department of Health and Children.  There were 27 recommendations in the health strategy for Travellers, one of which was for an All Ireland Traveller Health Study to be carried out by Travellers for Travellers from one end of Ireland to the other.  I have to say that is the greatest piece of work we did.  We got all the information, and one thing that we counted as a good outcome, is when the health providers and services were upfront and stated that they did discriminate against Travellers.  The former Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney, was the then Minister when I launched the All Ireland Traveller Health Study.  I held that report over my head and I was proud to do so.  I believed that the recommendations of that report would be implemented but I was very disappointed that it did not happen.  I always say to myself: \"Where is that All Ireland Traveller Health Study report now?  What shelf is it on in the Department of Health?\"<\/p><p> The report compiled the statistics on the life expectancy of Travellers, and I know at first hand about life expectancy because I lost my husband when he was a young man.  I have lost brothers and sisters when they were young people.  There is nobody who can tell me about life expectancy better than what I know from my experience.  Things will have to change.  Travellers' health is at crisis point.  We want a commitment on services for Travellers.  Since 1994 I have been chasing Ministers for Health and I have met them.  I gave a former Minister, Mary Harney a fright when I followed her out.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Harris is a very nice man and he promised me that the Traveller Accommodation Programme, TAP, meetings would come under the Department of Health.  Who is blocking this happening?  Is it the Department of Health that is blocking it?  I get angry and I have to say what is on my mind.   I want that meeting to happen again.  We should be sitting at that table.   <\/p><p> The Traveller primary care workers only work for 12 hours a week, yet some of our women have lost their medical cards because their income was a couple of euros above the limit.  Seeing that Travellers have very poor health, all Travellers should be entitled to hold their medical cards.  If there are full-time jobs for younger Traveller women, they should get them because the primary health care projects are the greatest thing that ever happened for Travellers.  <\/p><p> I do not think there is much more for me to say because others have said it, but I repeat that I would like medical cards to be issued to young Travellers.  Let me add that the Minister of State is accompanied by officials from many agencies, who all have a role to play in improving Travellers' health.<\/p><p>There is a broader picture to it.  The determinants of health are discrimination, bad living conditions, unemployment and education.  These are the four that come up.  I know that from visiting the sites, seeing young mothers and old people.  We only have a fistful of old people &ndash; seven - over the age of 80.  I live in group housing and seven young men out of the 50 houses have died.  We have hardly any men left.  It has to change for us and change fast.  When I meet a Minister or someone from one of the bodies, there is no use in him promising me to try to change it.  It has to happen for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Missie Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571698800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Thank you, Missie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#L00300","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":226,"content":"<p>It is all right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Missie Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>That definitely deserved a round of applause.

I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Dairearca N&iacute; N&eacute;ill, who is the assistant principal officer with specific responsibility for Traveller health matters.<\/p> <p>  I am relatively new to the post but I come with much understanding of Traveller and inequality issues, having worked with the Combat Poverty Agency and the social inclusion division of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I have much understanding of the issues and concerns raised by the previous speakers this morning.<\/p> <p>  The all-Ireland Traveller health study was an initiative of the Department of Health, which also funded it.  It reflected a concern about the health status of Travellers.  We have heard many of the figures.  Travellers have more illnesses and die younger.  They are at greater risk of substance misuse and mental health problems.  The all-Ireland Traveller health study highlighted that these health inequalities are rooted in the social determinants of health which encompass accommodation, education, employment and discrimination.  There is great acceptance of this, at least in the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Health provides funding of &euro;10 million a year to the HSE for initiatives specifically targeting the improvement of health outcomes for the Traveller community.  Other funding is provided by other sources, including the mental health budget from the social inclusion programme.  A further &euro;500,000 funding is provided through the Dormant Accounts Fund.  As the HSE will attend the committee at a later stage, I will not go into the detail as to how these resources are spent in supporting primary healthcare initiatives.  We must acknowledge, however, that the model of work developed through those primary healthcare initiatives highlighted here.  This model of peer working and engagement with Travellers should be used across our public services.  Much credit is due to those who have been pioneering those initiatives.  It is part of our delivery of health services.<\/p> <p>  I want to focus on some examples of health policy at national level which support the Traveller community and illustrate the challenges in meeting the health needs of Travellers.<\/p><p>The first is the national positive ageing strategy.  As we have heard, ageing is a key issue for Traveller health.  The most recent figures we have are for 2018 and indicate that 3% of Travellers were aged over 65, compared with 13% of the general population.  It is clear that Travellers die younger.  A particular issue in addressing positive ageing for Travellers in the strategy is the lack of disaggregated data on ethic status, which are required to monitor and address their health needs.  That issue has been highlighted at the committee.  To address this deficit, the healthy and positive ageing initiative developed a bespoke set of 14 indicators of positive ageing for Travellers which was published in May following extensive consultation with members of the Traveller community.  There are two interesting elements to the indicators developed.  First, the threshold for positive ageing was reduced from 50 years to 40 years, reflecting the fact that Travellers die up to ten years younger than the general population.  Second, they took on board very specific issues regarding Traveller accommodation which may not affect the rest of the population.  We drew up customised indicators to monitor positive ageing for the Traveller population.  This reflects a commitment in the national positive ageing strategy to change mindsets, promote social inclusion and pay particular attention to the needs of marginalised groups.  <\/p><p> The second example to which I wish to refer is the national drugs strategy, an area for which I am responsible within the Department.  The use and misuse of drugs and alcohol is an important concern for the Traveller population.  More than 300 Travellers were treated for problem drug use in 2017, which represents 3.7% of all those attending for treatment and indicates that Travellers are five times more likely to receive such treatment compared with the general population.  One of the actions of the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, is to improve access to addiction services for people from the Traveller community who use drugs.  There are particular challenges in engaging Travellers in drug services and these arise from the stigma associated with drug use among the Traveller community, especially among males.  My written submission outlines some initiatives by task forces in particular to try to engage in a culturally appropriate way with Travellers facing addiction issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Mr. Walsh has had five minutes.

One of the main actions in the strategy is to develop and implement a detailed action plan to address specific health needs of Travellers using a social determinants approach.  A draft is in circulation.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, are very engaged on the issue and supportive of the health action plan.  I strongly agree with the earlier comments that we need implementation, a monitored action plan and clear outcomes from it.<\/p> <p>  The Department is committed to ongoing engagement with Traveller organisations on Traveller health issues.  In 2018, my unit convened a workshop on Traveller health which brought together relevant units of the Department, the HSE and Traveller organisations to take stock of where we are in terms of Traveller health issues.  There are many examples within the Department of health structures with Traveller representation and I make reference to these in my written submission.  In line with action 74 of the national Traveller and Roma integration strategy, the Department and the HSE will review arrangements for engagement with Traveller organisations to support the Traveller health action plan.  We are committed to hosting a seminar in the Department with key officials to look at the health action plan when it is finalised and to participate in any new structures proposed under the plan.  The Department is committed to improving the health status of Travellers.  However, many of the levers to achieve this objective lie outside the remit of the Department of Health.  The Department will continue to engage with the steering committee of the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy and with Traveller organisations to improve health services for Travellers and to address the social determinants of health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>First of all I must say thank you to Missie.  Sometimes I fear that I am becoming desensitised to trauma, pain and struggle.  I definitely had this challenged in me just there.  I was definitely re-energised in listening, supporting and continuing that fight she has long been fighting.  Hopefully we can play a part and see through all of the work the witnesses have been doing for all of these years.<\/p><p>Because we keep having the intersection between education, accommodation and so on, and given the role Jim is in now, would it not make sense to remove all criteria for everything when there is a health crisis and a crisis of the Travelling community?  This would mean removing the criteria for housing and for medical cards and for literally every barrier that exists until it is corrected and until Travellers are living longer.  One cannot positively age in a caravan that is full of mould and cannot be adapted, where there cannot be a shower chair or all of the things our older population needs to positively age at home.<\/p><p>When I first started to engage with Pavee Point around education and addiction back in 2010, the number of Travellers was at 52,000.  Drug use was not a feature 15 years ago when I first started working in the drug sector.  A very small number of Travellers were using, or in chaotic substance abuse, at that stage.  At the time a woman from Pavee Point told me that because of the age discrepancy in life expectancy Travellers would never usually enter the nursing home or home help system.  How can we support Travellers to be able to care for their loved ones within their communities when they are facing illnesses?<\/p><p>In nursing homes, doctors are paid a higher amount to visit the elderly in nursing homes - I can be corrected on this and the Minister of State might know - than they are in the homeless sector where there is also an ageing population, as with the Traveller population, that is ageing at 45 and 50 years of age due to life conditions.  Do we need to look at the pension packages provided when someone enters a nursing home and make these packages accessible across the board to people living in the homeless sector and to people in the Traveller community who would not usually end up there?  Perhaps I am wrong about the numbers of Travellers who end up in nursing homes but I know that the woman said they generally tend to care for those people at home.  Because a Traveller's life expectancy is much shorter the length of that care is probably much shorter.  Could we look at nursing home types of care and how it could be implemented into the Traveller community in the context of the benefits of nursing home care along with the pension packages and the pension ages, and recognise that a pensioner exists at a much earlier stage among the Traveller community?  What kinds of supports would this bring if it was an official recognition?<\/p><p>My main point is the question around mobile health units.  Those who need healthcare the most are often the least likely to receive it.  There are mobile health units used by the homeless sector and the Roma community in rural parts of Ireland where it is harder to get access to healthcare.  Is there a benefit to mobile healthcare units being Traveller specific and where we could make sure that healthcare and primary healthcare gets directly into Traveller communities?<\/p><p>On the implementation of everything we have spoken of at this committee, would it make sense to have a Traveller-led taskforce within the Department of Health to make sure the implementation happens so that Travellers are leading that change and that charge rather than just being consulted in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>way?  How quickly could we get things done if the groups and organisations we see coming in to this committee were actually part of a taskforce within the Department?<\/p><p>How can we remove the criteria and barriers?  I am talking about education and the leaving certificate points systems with regard to removing every single criteria there is for Travellers, and removing application forms and prescriptions.  I propose removing all of that until Travellers are in a position where they can live full lives and reach their full potential.<\/p><p>Life expectancy for Travellers has decreased dramatically.  It is policy that has killed the Traveller community, rather than bad health outcomes or education.  We need to remove the policy implications so that Travellers can access all the things they need to access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#N00100","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":234,"content":"<p>The question calls for urgent radical action to remove all barriers and incentivise getting health to people where it is most needed, in the form of mobile health units, and for a Traveller-led task force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#O00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":235,"content":"<p>They are very good points.

In the context of home-care services, the fact that they have lowered the age threshold from 50 to 40 in the analysis of healthy ageing for Travellers is an acknowledgement of premature ageing among Travellers.  This could also be applied in policy with access to home-care services and I will inquire about this when I go back.  I am not sure if nursing home care is the right model of care and other people will be better qualified to answer that than I.  It may be that home-care packages are right because there is such a strong community focus.

They did the study, which came out of nine years of lobbying by the Traveller health advisory committee, which was almost disbanded as the study was being rolled out.  We engaged in a review process in good faith but the disbandment of the committee was based on the fact that key stakeholders, in health and other areas, did not engage with it to the necessary level.  We were blindsided, however, by what followed and we did not even receive the review until 2018, despite the fact that it had started in 2012.

The key gap is the lack of a Traveller health action plan.  We are working towards filling this massive gap.  This is being driven by the HSE, which is in charge of health services.

Concepts like the positive duty and the ethnic identifier need to be considered as part of a targeted primary healthcare project.

Mr. Walsh has said that the Department has certain responsibilities, but it cannot reach into other Departments.  That is partly our problem.  How can we cross-cut Departments in order for them to come together to provide a package that improves healthcare for the Traveller community?  I would like the committee to focus on that issue and I ask the Chairman to note it for future meetings.  We must tackle that silo mentality.  Even in the Department of Health itself, there are silos within silos.  We have identified a specific cohort of a community with unacceptable levels of mortality.  Some provision is made in the general populace provision, the national drug strategy, or through care of the aged.  This specific cohort needs specific attention and additional resources.  The findings and studies are there, and we need a clear action plan to address them.  I understand that the Department only has so much funding with which to work, but if there is a lack of funding, we need to specifically prioritise that funding and use it where it can have the greatest impact, whether that is addressing suicide among the Traveller community, drug abuse, care of the elderly, or resources.  Let us make a start and provide the additional resources somewhere.  I would be interested to hear from Ms Collins, who mentioned that she started lobbying for primary healthcare back in 1992.

However, findings clearly show that mortality rates among this community are far higher than the general populace, and that needs an extraordinary response.  Politicians need to step up, and the Department must prioritise this.  Let us hear where we should make a start.  Not everything can be funded, and I do not expect that on day one, but even if there was an incremental approach, starting next year, we could increase the funding for primary care for Travellers.  That alone would send the message that we are making progress.  However, if we do not get additional resources, we have a long way to go.

There have been significant cuts to the overall Traveller health budget since 2008, with the onset of the recession.<\/p><p>This meant that meant Travellers experienced a double impact in the specific cuts to the Traveller health budget and the overall cuts in the area.  It is good to hear Mr. Walsh refer to the primary healthcare programmes but they have been significantly affected by cuts in recent years.  Even though there were some areas under the regions where there was underspending in Traveller health budgets, cuts were still made to services, including Traveller primary healthcare programmes, as a cost-saving measure.  As Traveller health budgets were not ring-fenced, they were sucked into the bigger black hole with regard to overall health budgets.  One useful thing this committee could do would be to look at those budgets from the Department of Health to the HSE to determine how much is ring-fenced and how much is not spent on what is intended initially in respect of Traveller health.<\/p><p> There is an absolute need for targeted initiatives, not outside of the mainstream and not segregated provision.  Primary healthcare is one model of that but there are other pieces of work that must be done.  However, no new moneys are coming into Traveller health and that is where things get stuck.  This is not just about money.  While money is, of course, significant and important, that leadership which was referred to where we have a shift in positive policy is not there.  We still have the ingrained negative policy superimposed here.  The reality is that change is not coming as swiftly as needed.<\/p><p> Ireland should be ashamed of itself.  I cannot put it strongly enough.  Ireland should be ashamed that, notwithstanding the statistics that have been set out here today and included in all of the submissions, there is still no real action on the change needed to ensure we do not continue to have these same conversations in ten or 20 years' time and that our grandchildren and great grandchildren will not have to deal with the same kinds of health issues and shortened lifespans heard about across the board today.  Ireland should be ashamed of itself when it comes to Traveller health.  While the wider determinants are there, it is always something else that is the reason we cannot implement what we have.  A number of Departments, whether it relates to accommodation, health or education, are not accepting responsibility for the fact that they need to put the resources in and implement the policies and strategies they have.  They need to roll out concrete work, including on disaggregated data, to monitor effectively and ensure there are real outcomes for Travellers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#Q01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I have a quick follow-up question on the action plan.

That senior person is now pulling the plan together with Traveller input and we hope to see it by the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  I agree completely on the silo system.  I refer to the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy led by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton.  The strategy is important because it involves a whole-of-Government approach and brings all the actors together, including Departments and Travellers.  Within that, we have over 30 actions, including actions to reduce the health inequalities experienced by Travellers and Roma.  There is a very good plan of action there and we could get more traction on that, especially with regard to the social determinants of health.  In the context of silos within silos, however, we need to be careful.<\/p><p>If we look at the &euro;10 million - the pot of money we have - we can see that more than &euro;17 billion is going into the health system, so Travellers' needs need to be prioritised across the system.<\/p><p> Something in my paper that I did not get a chance to talk about is the idea of proportionate univeralism.  Mental health, which has &euro;1 billion, is a very good example.  They need to prioritise and I think they are doing so.  That is where there are lot of resources.  We can look at other examples across the system as well.  The &euro;10 million we have is focused on primary care, particularly initiatives with Travellers.  That is really important and we need to grow it and reverse the cuts that took place.  The action plan will provide a clear mandate as to what is required.  The Department and the Minister are committed to giving leadership to implement and fund that plan.  We need a roadmap.  Then the Department can be challenged about what it is doing to support that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Our committee is there to help with that leadership.

It seems that one of the major problems is getting people to avail of services.  One of the major challenges I see all the time is the bureaucratic barriers to accessing services.  Applying for a medical card for anybody is a very difficult task because the amount of paperwork needed for even the simplest application is incredible, so think of the barrier for somebody who finds reading and writing difficult.  We need to cut to the chase and say that there are significant barriers to accessing mainstream services and we need to simplify that.  I listened with interest to what my Senator colleague said.  I do not know whether it is as simple as ensuring everything is accessed through an ethnic identifier but something must happen to make access easier.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' views on that.<\/p> <p>  Is there a committee within the Department that monitors the &euro;10 million and do Travellers sit on that committee?  The reason I ask this question is because, especially in times of financial pressure, people in organisations are geniuses at manipulating money.  One concern I have is that some of that &euro;10 million is being used as replacement money.  It is being spent on Travellers but in a way that replaces money that should be have been spent on Travellers as members of society anyway.  In other words, is it truly additional or did the Department, during the bad times, start using it to replace other moneys and services, counting it as Traveller services because a Traveller availed of a mainstream service he or she should have received anyway?  I have seen this happen.  There is need for close monitoring of that.<\/p> <p>  If the witnesses from the Department think I am being suspicious, I have seen a lot of things happen in times of pressure.  The argument will be made.  I will give a concrete example.  I introduced CL&Aacute;R, which was a scheme for very specific geographic areas.  The next thing that happened was that all sorts of services, including hospitals, that were way outside these areas were telling me that they provided services to the people within the areas and were asking for some of that money.  Therefore, we need a monitoring committee that would include the people receiving the service to make sure the &euro;10 million is really an extra &euro;10 million on top of the normal services all of us as citizens are invited to avail of.  I would be interested in finding out what structures have been put place by the Department to monitor that spend.  I trust everybody and I trust nobody.  I think everybody needs to be monitored.  Will the witnesses give us the 2008 budget compared with what is available - the &euro;10 million mentioned here?<\/p><p> There is another issue that I am concerned about.  In one way, I laud that they are trying to help the Travellers at 40 because they are aged ten years beyond a person of 50 in the settled community but a more fundamental issue that we must keep coming back to is, why are they ten years older at 40 than the settled population at 50.  It comes back to what all the statistics tell us.  All the statistics show that people who are unemployed, in bad housing, etc. go to doctors more, go to hospitals more, get ill more often and die much younger, and that most of our health outcomes as a society are not a reflection on the health service in the first place.  The biggest determinant of outcomes is not the health service in the first place.  Many in the so-called middle classes go to the doctor less, take less medicine and live much longer.  The reason is a thing called \"lifestyle\".  What determines lifestyle?  One hundred and fifty years ago, the biggest killers were water-borne diseases.  Thankfully, we eliminated those more or less in the western world.  That is lifestyle rather than pure medicine.  We are still bad at housing.  We are still bad at unemployment.  There is good data in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the effect of unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#S00300","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I am anxious to hear from the other two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#T00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Point taken.

In that way, we can measure the forced lifestyle situation and its effect on people's health.

We all agree with that.  We know that we cannot separate the living conditions from opportunities.  There are the living conditions, the social exclusion and the lack of employment.  These all impact upon health.  We all know we cannot separate that.<\/p> <p>  At present, to answer Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question on the study, it is too soon yet to be able to do a study because the vast majority of Travellers who are getting educated now were getting educated and having opportunities within the past 20 years.  I grew up with three grandparents.  We all know many children who are growing up without any grandparent at all, and some of them are growing up without a father.<\/p> <p>  I want to come back a little, if I can, to mental health and addiction.  Much of the time, we talk about addiction and suicide as if it is something that is endemic within the Traveller community.  The reality is these are new phenomena.  They are environmental factors.  Travellers are not becoming addicted or having health issues for the most part because they are predisposed to that.  They are managing situations or unable to manage situations.  When we look at how to address it, I must come at it from where we are when we are meeting Travellers.  My friends here are better at the statistics on it than I am.<\/p><p>We are meeting Travellers who are crying out for help, perhaps for someone in their family who has a mental health issue and is threatening suicide.  When they look for help or support it is not there.  Therefore, one thing we have recommended is a national mental health strategy.  We must look at delivering very quickly on an action plan or plans which reduce Traveller deaths.  I do not know how many Travellers have died since we first looked for a national action plan on Traveller health.  I am not sure how many Travellers will die before we get an action plan.  The people we are losing are not statistics; they are our fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, cousins and children, and this has an impact.  <\/p><p> We need a national strategy that will deliver services when Travellers are crying out looking for supports around mental health.  We know of families who have looked for supports and found they were not there because it was out of hours, and the family member died within a few hours or days.  If a Traveller presents in a suicidal situation, he or she needs to be fast-tracked.  We cannot leave them out until the services are available next week; it must be dealt with immediately as an emergency service. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen Sherlock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I will call Ms Maria Joyce, Ms Brigid Quirke and Mr. Walsh before we take more questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#U00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>We really welcome the examination of the budgets, including what is there and what is new.

We monitored the Traveller budget, there was accountability, and we could call the health boards to come before us to explain what had been spent and how they had spent their money.  Since that committee was disbanded, we have had no input into the Traveller health budget.  That is why we want to bring back the structure.<\/p> <p>  Senator Coffey has gone but I wish to clarify a couple of things.  Ms Collins spoke on the Traveller primary healthcare project.  A Traveller heath strategy between 2000 and 2005 was produced by the Traveller health advisory committee.  Primary healthcare was seen as an excellent model and was piloted by Pavee Point.  That was regarded as a cornerstone which would be rolled out.  They rolled out 40 primary healthcare projects, there were eight Traveller health units, a Traveller health advisory committee and we had a Traveller health strategy.  We were in a very good place, things were very positive and Travellers were included at all levels.  We were told that there were no clear targets in the strategy because we had no data, so we lobbied to be able to collect the data.  We were promised that after the data had been produced, we would get a new Traveller health strategy with clear actions from the Department of Health and a defined and protected budget.  A study was done in 2010.

When we got it, it was put on a shelf.  Now the push is for the action plan.  The Department was committed to producing a Traveller health strategy but it has not done so.  It is wrong to suggest that it is waiting for the action plan.  The only reason we are getting an action plan is the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, which is a European initiative, not a national initiative.

It is a good question.  Other countries in Europe have had State-imposed ethnic identifiers, but in our case it was Traveller groups lobbying the State to get an ethnic identifier.  We need to be very clear that there needs to be good practice and codes of practice developed, and proper training.  We have been doing work with different Departments; we have it in the national drug treatment service and in some of the hospitals.  We go in and train people and a code of practice is developed.  When we piloted the first question in Tallaght hospital people felt that nobody would engage but once we explained to Travellers that it is for their benefit and that the data are disaggregated and de-identified - and therefore anonymised - and once we explain that it is really to monitor where exactly the blocks are in access, participation and outcomes for services, we actually and surprisingly had 100% response.  It was important.  In the past people have asked Traveller-specific questions, which is much more likely to discriminate.  If, however, one asks the question in the context of everybody having to identify their ethnicity - and it is important that it comes with a code of practice and clear guidelines on how it is used to inform policy - the data can be disaggregated and given back to front-line workers to encourage people.  It is a bit like how the information is used in the census and how we now know how many are going to school and taking part in education, and Travellers can see the benefit of that.  Women in east Limerick found that there were more than 100% of the Travellers there that they knew of, which meant that the need for public services was being underestimated.  Initially in 2006 the census said there were 24,000.  In the study we found 40,000.  If one wants to plan appropriate service then the data are needed, once it is filled in with the correct protections and codes of practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#W00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Brigid Quirke"},{"type":"speech","time":1571698800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>That is a good way of doing an ethnic identifier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019102200002#W00500","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571698800,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Absolutely.
