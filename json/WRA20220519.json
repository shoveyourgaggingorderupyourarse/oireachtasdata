This Programme has a strategic emphasis on attracting new fund managers to the Irish equity ecosystem and opening new pipelines for finance. It is a fund of funds, which is an indirect form of equity financing for SMEs. SMEs will not directly apply for funding through this programme. As the fund is at the processing stage, the information sought by the Deputy is not available.<\/p>  <p>  The programme, which is being managed by the European Investment Fund (EIF), will provide vital venture capital to innovative Irish companies at seed stage. This is an important step in developing and expanding the pool of private capital available to early-stage companies wanting to grow in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Totalling &euro;90 million, the programme is made up of a &euro;30 million contribution from my Department through our agency Enterprise Ireland (EI), whilst the EIF will match this investment by providing a further &euro;30 million. The Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) will co-invest a further &euro;30 million. This &euro;90 million, backed by these strong partners, will be an important cornerstone investment and will attract private co-investment.  <\/p>  <p>  Essentially, a pool of funding, drawn from multiple sources, provides capital for specialist fund managers, who will in turn then seek to invest that capital in SMEs, from areas that are often less well served across a variety of sectors and regions in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>The first call for expressions of interest from experienced fund managers was issued in February and closed on April 29th. It is expected that three to four successful funds will receive investment, and they will, in turn, invest in multiple SMEs from different sectors and regions across the State.<\/p>  <p>  The programme partners, EIF, EI, and ISIF, have been processing and screening the applications, in line with the programme&rsquo;s strategic goals. Once these are fully processed, the plan is to sign at least one fund before the end of 2022 with the remaining agreements to be signed in the first half of 2023. Once an agreement has been signed with a fund, the fund will then seek SME&rsquo;s in which to invest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900052#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freight Sector","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900052#WRA01000"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[25359\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900052#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the steps he is taking to decarbonise the freight sector as part of the Strategic Objective 2 of the recently published Mid-West Regional Enterprise Plan to decarbonise industry in the mid-west by developing the Shannon Estuary as a renewable energy hub; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1594","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>Advancing the transition to a low carbon economy is a policy priority for me and the Government.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has overseen the development of nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024, including for the Mid-West, which covers Counties Limerick, Clare, and Tipperary.<\/p>  <p>  I was very pleased to launch the Mid-West Plan with Ministers of State, English and Troy, in Nenagh on the 18th February and was impressed by the ambition of the Mid-West to be a leading sustainable and low carbon region.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I recently established the Shannon Estuary Economic Taskforce following a commitment in the Programme for Government.

While the ERP was developed in the context of a post-Pandemic Recovery, its actions are directly relevant to our response to the employment threats that may arise from the War in Ukraine and global inflation.  <\/p>  <p>  The ERP outlined supports to help businesses deal with the direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as setting out the Government&rsquo;s medium-term approach to creating the right environment for a jobs-led recovery and, crucially, to ensure that these jobs are more productive, innovative, resilient and in new areas of opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  Since the beginning of the pandemic, Government has invested heavily to help the sectors and workers most impacted by the pandemic and to stabilise the labour market. Schemes such as the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) were introduced to support the changing needs of industry through the various stages of the public health crisis, as well as to support industry through the transition back to the full reopening of the economy. Since its introduction, the EWSS, an economy-wide support for enterprise, has made &euro;6.7billion in payments to support over 50,000 employers and nearly three quarters of a million employees. Under the CRSS &euro;727million was paid to 25,700 businesses impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. As of the beginning of February 2022, over &euro;9.1billion had been paid out through the PUP.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, \"Pillar 3\" of the ERP outlines how the Government intends to rebuild sustainable enterprises as the economy recovers. The Plan adopts a two-pronged recovery approach to rebuilding sustainable enterprises - supporting the domestic SME sector, which is critical to broad-based jobs-led economic growth, whilst leveraging the enormous strength of the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) sector. It aims to create an environment for a jobs-led recovery through a focus on expanding sectors and by helping business become more resilient and agile.<\/p>  <p>  Projects funded under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) are integrated into the Economic Recovery Plan, and reinforce the Government&rsquo;s approach, which is focused on supporting recovery and job creation, advancing the green transition, and accelerating and expanding digital reforms and transformation.<\/p>  <p>  Progress on the wide range of deliverables and workstreams across the four pillars of the Economic Recovery Plan is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment with a high-level progress report due to be published in early June.  This Report will enable Government assess what further actions may be required and I will also remain engaged with the Enterprise community in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The latest iteration of the national employment strategy &ndash; Pathways to Work 2021-2025 &ndash; will help unemployed people get back into employment through intense activation, upskilling and reskilling opportunities, and engaging with employers. It will have an overall target of over 100,000 additional caseloads per year, by expanding the caseload capacity of the Public Employment Service, reducing the risk of labour market scarring and long-term unemployment. There will be a particular focus on youth unemployment and working intensively with young people at greater risk of long-term unemployment, in recognition of the disproportionate effect of the pandemic on young people.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the work already underway, the Government is looking to prepare for the economy of the future. On 1 March 2022, Government agreed to the development of a White Paper on Enterprise Policy in 2022, led by my Department.  The White Paper will set out set out an ambitious medium- to long-term direction for enterprise policy in response to challenges, opportunities and new drivers of growth catalysed by the Covid-19 pandemic, new economic and geopolitical realities, including the War in Ukraine and global inflation, and an increased urgency to accelerate the decarbonisation of industry.<\/p>  <p>  In so doing, the White Paper will articulate what needs to be done differently to realise this vision and to set out clearly the risks to be faced and the policy choices and trade-offs that will arise in order to maintain high-quality jobs, to protect the elements which make Ireland&rsquo;s economy globally attractive for investment and to ensure a competitive Irish economy into the future.<\/p>  <p>  The invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated the inflationary pressures that Ireland and other economies were already experiencing in the wake of the supply chain disruptions brought by the pandemic.  The war, and the necessary introduction of sanctions against Russia, is also disrupting supply chains and leading to large rises in international prices for energy, food and other commodities. The Government recognises the additional challenge these rising prices are bringing for households and businesses, as many are still trying to recover from the effects of COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  For example, the Government has already implemented several measures to help ease the impact on enterprises and households of energy price increases in the areas of temporary reductions in excise duties on petrol and diesel, particular supports for hauliers and supports for the agricultural sector.<\/p>  <p>  I convened a meeting of my Department's Enterprise Forum earlier this year to hear first-hand how the war in Ukraine is affecting businesses in Ireland. The three main issues raised at that meeting were difficulties in supply chains in Europe and around the world, recent increases in the cost of raw materials and foodstuffs, and energy security and prices.  Of course, all of these impacts could have employment implications and we remain engaged with the Enterprise community in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission launched a Temporary State Aid Crisis Framework for businesses affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This opens the way for Member States to consider if specific instruments might be needed in the near term, in order to help vulnerable but viable businesses to overcome the acute impacts of the current crisis.  As part of the Framework, access to low-cost loans and grants may be made available in order to meet liquidity needs and facilitate necessary investment.  This should also assist in mitigating the risks to jobs arising from the war in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  As I informed the House previously, there are already effective support schemes in place in response to Brexit and Covid-19.  The Government will consider whether, and to what degree, such schemes might be pivoted to firms impacted by the Ukraine crisis in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900053#WRB04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":80,"content":"<p>Question No. 37 answered with Question No. 6.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900053#WRB04700"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[24912\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900053#WRB04800","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the status of the online retail scheme; the amount of funding that has been allocated to the scheme since its inception; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>A new round of the Online Retail Scheme was opened for applications on 05 May and closes on 01 June 2022.

Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by my Department and of the relevant policy Departments, in this case the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  Changes to the employment permit occupations lists are made where there are no suitable Irish\/EEA nationals available, development opportunities are not undermined, genuine skills shortage exists rather than a recruitment or retention problem and Government education, training and economic development policies are supported. <\/p>  <p>  The lists are subject to bi-annual review to ensure their ongoing relevance to the State&rsquo;s human capital requirements. As part of this review process, the Department invites submissions from industry representatives and stakeholders. The submission process is an opportunity for stakeholders to provide evidence, additional information and potentially different perspectives on the nature and extent of skill shortages. Stakeholder submissions are a vital source of information, helping inform the Department&rsquo;s final assessment of the status of occupations.<\/p>  <p>  Speech and Language Therapists were removed from the Ineligible Occupations List as part of the outcome of the then review process finalised in June 2021, thereby providing access to General Employment Permits for non-EEA nationals wishing to take up employment in the State. <\/p>  <p>  The General Employment Permit is the primary vehicle used by the State to attract third country nationals in occupations with remuneration thresholds of generally &euro;30,000. In accordance with Employment Permit legislation, in order to ensure that job opportunities are made available to Irish and EEA nationals, employers must satisfy a Labour Market Needs Test before a General Employment Permit (GEP) can be issued to a non-EEA national.

This is damaging to the enterprise sector as the costs of doing business may rise too quickly for some firms to absorb, resulting in the closure of otherwise viable enterprises. Small, domestically-focused firms can also be negatively impacted by lower discretionary consumer spending, as Irish consumers are forced to allocate more of their household budget to cover higher energy prices. Many small businesses around the country are seeing their margins squeezed by the rising costs of doing business, and in particular the significant increases in energy costs. Ireland is highly import-dependent for its energy needs, importing over 70 per cent of the energy we use.  <\/p>  <p>  The rapid recovery in the domestic economy, along with rising energy prices, international supply chain bottlenecks and base effects relating to weak price trends in 2020, have been driving a rise in prices since mid-2021. Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine has sparked further energy price increases and brought unprecedented volatility to energy markets.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been helping to mitigate the effects of energy price increases but, unfortunately, cannot fully compensate people and businesses for the increases in cost.  The Government has approved a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel, and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil. For hauliers, a temporary grant scheme will provide a payment of &euro;100 per week to help mitigate the rising price of fuel. The scheme will operate for a period of eight weeks and is valued at &euro;18 million. The agriculture sector has been particularly impacted by inflation in the price of almost all farm input prices. The Government agreed a temporary, targeted intervention package for the tillage sector to the value of &euro;12.2 million in response to the impact on farming. The agriculture package will support the production of more native grain and protein crops, and crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser, which will contribute towards the expected deficit in these crops and help farmers to deal with challenges related to the availability and price of animal feed and fertilisers.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has established a new Energy Emergency Security Group chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to advise Government on how to respond to the developments in energy markets, to ensure that our emergency plans are up-to-date and to examine impacts on consumers including businesses. My Department is represented on this Group.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will keep the energy situation under close and active review, and we will continue to examine what measures are possible to manage the impact of rising energy prices for households and businesses. My Department is engaging with industry to understand the issues and the business impacts.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will explore what additional options to help businesses may be available based on the European Commission&rsquo;s Temporary State Aid Framework for businesses affected by the Ukraine crisis possibly by pivoting schemes that were put in place to deal with Brexit and Covid.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to take a holistic view of the enterprise ecosystem and ensure that areas such as adequate labour supply, appropriate skills base, adequate access to finance and historically non-competitive domestic markets are not overlooked when an acute issue such as the current surge in inflation arises.<\/p>  <p>  We must also be conscious of the extra costs Government is imposing on small businesses through initiatives such as Statutory Sick Pay and the living wage. These reforms are worthwhile but it's important we strike the right balance. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs to ensure that Ireland can attract and retain a talented workforce to meet the current and future skills needs of the economy. The Department of Finance continues to coordinate the Retail Banking Review to ensure that Ireland businesses have access to affordable financing. <\/p>  <p>  The National Competitiveness and Productivity Council is responsible for identifying the key competitiveness and productivity issues facing the Irish economy and offers recommendations on policy actions required to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position. In the NCPC&rsquo;s latest annual report, Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge, the Council recommended that the Government take action to ensure Ireland has a dynamic business environment, to boost productivity growth, and to deliver key housing and associated social and economic infrastructure, together with other critical infrastructure projects, in order to ensure a balanced and sustainable economic recovery. The Government is currently actioning these recommendations and we look forward to the Council&rsquo;s next annual report which is expected to be published in September 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900055#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Joint Labour Committees","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900055#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[25354\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900055#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will ensure that the decision to reduce the VAT rate for the hospitality sector to 9% until 2023 is conditional on obliging employers in this sector to engage in collective bargaining for pay rises through the Joint Labour Committees ensuring the benefits of the VAT cuts are shared with employees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1551","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>The conditions of the decision to announce an extension of the 9% Value Added Tax (VAT) rate for the tourism and hospitality industry are as outlined by Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe T.D. who is the Minister with responsibility for VAT.

The proposal aims to address the adverse environmental and human rights impacts arising from the operations of companies and those of their subsidiaries and value chains. There will be due diligence obligations on such companies and company directors, when fulfilling their duty to act in the best interest of the company, will be required to take into account the consequences of their decisions on sustainability matters, including, where applicable, human rights, climate change and environmental impacts. Larger companies will be required to adopt a plan to ensure that their business model and strategy is compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and the limiting of global warming to 1.5 &deg;C, in line with the Paris Agreement. The proposed Directive also requires companies to establish procedures to handle complaints from those adversely affected by company operations and from other key stakeholders. The proposal also provides for the designation of supervisory authorities at national level and a civil liability regime in relation to companies who fail to meet their obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is supportive of the objective of the proposed Directive which should promote responsible business conduct and we will seek to ensure that the proposals strike the right balance by providing effective protections whilst ensuring that the measures to be implemented by companies are clear, proportionate, and enforceable. It is important that measures such as those proposed are on a cross EU basis in recognition of the complex, international nature of many supply chains and to ensure harmonisation, promote policy coherence, and avoid the risk of fragmentation within the EU single market.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal contains a definition for stakeholder which is broadly defined and encompasses a company&rsquo;s employees, the employees of its subsidiaries, and other individuals, groups, communities or entities whose rights or interests are or could be affected by the products, services and operations of the company, its subsidiaries or its business relationships. My Department remains committed to ensuring the interests and rights of all stakeholders are protected under the proposals.<\/p>  <p>  Consideration of the proposals is at an early stage and is ongoing across EU Member States. My Department is engaging at EU working party level to clarify the practical implications for stakeholders.  Given the complexity of the issues being addressed, negotiations at EU level may well continue through the remainder of this year and into 2023. Decisions on how the proposals will be legislated for in an Irish context will be taken once the Directive has been finalised. <\/p>  <p>  I look forward to hearing the views of all those with an interest in the proposal. In this regard, I have recently met with the Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights and my officials have also met with key stakeholders including representatives of business and civil society organisations.

This programme is a fund of funds, which is an indirect form of equity financing for SMEs. SMEs will not directly apply for funding through this programme.<\/p>  <p>  The programme, which is being managed by the European Investment Fund (EIF), will provide vital venture capital to innovative Irish companies at seed stage and is an important step in developing and expanding the pool of private capital available to early-stage companies wanting to grow in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Totalling &euro;90 million, the programme is made up of a &euro;30 million contribution from the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment through its agency Enterprise Ireland (EI), whilst the EIF will match this investment by providing a further &euro;30 million. The Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) will co-invest a further &euro;30 million. This &euro;90 million, backed by these strong partners, will be an important cornerstone investment and will attract private co-investment.  <\/p>  <p>  Essentially, this programme is a pool of funding drawn from multiple sources, that provides capital for specialist fund managers, who will in turn then seek to invest that capital in SMEs from areas that are often less well served across a variety of sectors and regions in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>The first call for expressions of interest from experienced fund managers was issued in February and closed on April 29th. It is expected that three to four successful funds will receive investment, and they will, in turn, invest in multiple SMEs from different sectors and regions across the State.<\/p>  <p>  The programme partners, EIF, EI, and ISIF, have been processing and screening the applications, in line with the programme&rsquo;s strategic goals. Once these are fully processed, the plan is to sign at least one fund before the end of 2022 with the remaining agreements to be signed in the first half of 2023. It's not a question of SMEs applying directly to the Irish Innovation Seed Fund Programme. Once an agreement has been signed with a fund, the fund will then seek SMEs in which to invest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900055#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Wage","counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900055#WRD02100"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[25379\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900055#WRD02200","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the main challenges to be overcome in the development of a living wage; and if this concept includes terms of access to protection and services needed by those at work.","asker":"1549","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":167,"content":"<p>The Government has been clear that a legacy of the pandemic should be better pay, terms and conditions for everyone, but particularly those currently on low pay. We are committed, therefore, to honouring the programme for Government commitment to progressing a living wage over the lifetime of this Government.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, I asked the Low Pay Commission to examine the programme for Government commitment to progress a living wage over the lifetime of the Government and to make recommendations to me on how best we can achieve this commitment. There are many issues to consider in the move to a living wage, including the method for calculation and whether this should be done based on the basket of goods approach or as a percentage of the median wage. Other issues for consideration concern the impact the introduction of a living wage would have on the wage bill and also how it would interact with the existing tax-benefit system.<\/p>  <p>  To assist its work, the Low Pay Commission commissioned a team of researchers in NUI Maynooth to conduct research on the living wage. This research was to consider the policy, social and economic implications of a move to a living wage and the process by which Ireland could achieve it.<\/p>  <p>  The research was to also examine international evidence on living wages, the different calculation methods available, the policy implications of moving to a living wage and ultimately outline options for moving to a living wage in Ireland. I understand that in January of this year, the Low Pay Commission received the living wage supporting research report from the researchers at NUI Maynooth. The Commission met with the researchers at NUI Maynooth and also held a consultation with a number of stakeholders and representative groups with an interest in the progression to a living wage where the implications and challenges of moving to a living wage were discussed. <\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission submitted its Living Wage Report to me in March 2022, along with the accompanying research report from NUI Maynooth. While the report and its recommendations address issues such as the interaction with the existing tax-benefit system, I am still considering the next steps required in the progression to a living wage and intend to bring proposals to Government shortly, including the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s report and the accompanying research report. <\/p>  <p>  The move to introduce a living wage is just one of a number of measures aimed at ensuring work pays, particularly for those on low pay. The Pathways to Work 2021 - 2025 strategy which forms part of the national Economic Recovery Plan is also aimed at ensuring that work pays. As part of this strategy, each new jobseeker will be provided with access to a Benefit of Work statement using an online Benefit of Work calculator. This strategy builds on the Make Work Pay action plan contained in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (2015 - 2024). The introduction of the Statutory Sick Pay Scheme is another measure that will also help workers in this regard, along with the Right to Request Remote Work Bill which should reduce commuting costs for workers which for some may also act as a disincentive to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900055#WRD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900055#WRD02400"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[25016\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900055#WRD02500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if a minimum time can be achieved for the processing of applications for work permits for non-European Union workers particularly in the healthcare sector in which there are so many staff shortages; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":170,"content":"<p>The employment permits system is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and\/or labour shortages, in circumstances where there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.  The system is managed through the use of lists designating highly skilled and ineligible occupations.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic all employment permit applications for medical personnel have been expedited in order to assist the State to respond to the threat of Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  On 14 June 2021, following a review of the employment permit occupation lists, changes to the employment permit system were announced, to address skills and labour shortages in the healthcare and nursing home sector.  Following this review the occupation of Nursing Auxiliary or Assistant (Health Care Assistant) in hospital\/nursing home settings became eligible for an employment permit from that date.<\/p>  <p>  My Department experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year, impacting on processing times.  In 2021  27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  16,275 employment permits were issued in 2021, and a total of 17,968 applications processed. <\/p>  <p>  The increased demand was partially driven by the extension of categories of employment permits following the Review of the Occupational Lists in October 2021.  Processing times were also impacted as a result of the HSE cyber-attack which had a direct effect on employment permit applications associated with the July 2021 Doctors rotation, which had to be processed manually.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has since worked with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Justice to streamline and extend the time period for General Employment Permits (GEP) issued to doctors.  A new two-year multi-site GEP for Medical Doctors in Public hospitals and Public health facilities was introduced in respect of the January 2022 Doctors rotation.  This will result in significant benefits for applicants, as well as efficiencies for the Employment Permits Section, by eliminating the necessity to apply for additional employment permits when moving to a different Public hospital or Public health facility within this two year period.  This should see a substantial reduction in applications for the next Doctors rotation in July 2022<\/p>  <p>  My Department advise that any application for any employment permit should be submitted at least 12 weeks before the proposed employment start date.  However, my Department &amp;amp; I recognise the impact delays in the processing times for employment permits has for businesses and their workers.  An internal plan of action has been implemented which has increased resources and implemented more efficient methods of processing applications in the permits system.  The processing team has trebled in size and daily output has more than tripled compared to 2021 levels.<\/p>  <p>  Since the implementation of this plan, the Employment Permits Unit has made positive progress by reducing the number of applications awaiting processing from about 11,000 in January 2022 to about 6,000 today, despite further strong growth in demand in 2022.  As new Departmental staff were trained initially on Critical Skills Employment Permits applications, which include Doctors and Nurses roles, processing times have fallen from 21 weeks to 6 weeks for this cohort.

The Government has taken many steps to achieve this aim while also addressing the challenges that have arisen in relation to the cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland currently has one of the highest minimum wage rates in the EU. Of the 21 EU Member States that have national minimum wages, Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage in terms of gross monthly rates. When adjusted for purchasing power standards (PPS), Ireland ranks at sixth place. Since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission in 2015, Ireland&rsquo;s National Minimum Wage has increased from &euro;8.65 per hour to &euro;10.50 per hour between 2016 and 2022. This increase has resulted in a 21.4% increase in the National Minimum Wage. This compares with an increase in consumer prices of 7% in the six years to December 2021 so the National Minimum Wage has increased substantially in real terms over recent years.<\/p>  <p>Several measures have also been taken to help with recent increases in the cost of living. Budget 2022 contained a large range of measures to protect households from the rising cost of living, including a personal income tax package worth &euro;520 million and a social welfare package of over &euro;550 million. There were also increases in the allocation of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare to ensure childcare prices do not rise. The cost of the Drug Payment Scheme was reduced to &euro;80. The working family payment increase announced on Budget Day was brought forward from 1 June to 1 April, and a reduction in the rate of VAT on gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9% has also been introduced until the 31st   of October. A temporary 20% reduction in public transport fares applicable from April until the end of the year has also recently been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also acted quickly and decisively to introduce measures aimed at offsetting the increased cost of living for social welfare recipients. In March, a once-off lump sum of &euro;125 was paid to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment, at a cost of approximately &euro;49 million.  A further additional lump sum payment of &euro;100 is being paid to these households from this week &ndash; a payment equivalent to over 3 weeks additional Fuel Allowance &ndash; costing &euro;37 million. Taken together with the &euro;5 increase in Fuel Allowance announced as part of Budget 2022, this means that low-income households will see an increase of 55% in Fuel Allowance support provided during this fuel season compared to last season.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the effects of the pandemic, the Government also launched the Pathways to Work 2021 - 2025 strategy which is a key part of the national Economic Recovery Plan. This strategy includes employment advice and guidance, job matching, employment programmes, and opportunities for upskilling. In addition to reducing long-term unemployment and reducing the youth unemployment rate, this strategy also aims to improve labour market transitions and to ensure better labour market outcomes for all. As part of this strategy, each new jobseeker will be provided with access to a Benefit of Work statement using an online Benefit of Work calculator. This strategy builds on the Make Work Pay action plan contained in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (2015 - 2024).<\/p>  <p>  There is also a Programme for Government commitment to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government. One definition of a living wage is that it is &lsquo;the average gross salary which will enable full-time employed adults (without dependents) to afford a socially acceptable standard of living.&rsquo; This goes beyond the need for workers to earn just enough to cover their basic expenses and to make ends meet but would also enable them to participate and contribute more fully in society by having more discretionary income available to them.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, I asked the Low Pay Commission to examine the programme for Government commitment to progress a living wage over the lifetime of the Government and to make recommendations to me on how best we can achieve this commitment.<\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission submitted its Living Wage Report to me on 31 March 2021, along with the research report from NUI Maynooth.

We are committed, therefore, to honouring the programme for Government commitment to progressing a living wage over the lifetime of this Government.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, I asked the Low Pay Commission to examine the programme for Government commitment to progress a living wage over the lifetime of the Government and to make recommendations to me on how best we can achieve this commitment. Following this request, the Low Pay Commission commissioned a team of researchers in the National University of Ireland, NUI, Maynooth, to conduct research on the living wage. This research was to consider the policy, social and economic implications of a move to a living wage and the process by which Ireland could achieve it. The research was to also examine international evidence on living wages, different calculation methods available, the policy implications of moving to a living wage and ultimately outline options for moving to a living wage in Ireland. In January of this year, the Low Pay Commission received the living wage supporting research report from the researchers at NUI Maynooth.<\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission submitted its Living Wage Report to me at the end of March 2022, along with the accompanying research report from NUI Maynooth.

In doing so, we need to recognise that many businesses have been badly affected by the pandemic and are also facing rising costs.

To address this and further alleviate the pressures caused by the rise in costs for students and their families, I have already initiated improvements for the academic year 2022\/23 by increasing all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, by &euro;200 per year. I have also introduced changes to the criteria for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant which means that from September 2022, the qualifying distance for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km. In this way the scheme is responsive to eligible students who reside further away from college by providing an increased rate of student maintenance grant. <\/p>  <p>   I have also increased the qualifying income thresholds by &euro;1,000. The income limit for the special rate of grant is aligned to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension plus the maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years in order to target students from households in receipt of long term social welfare assistance effectively. As the Department of Social Protection state pension payment was not increased in Budget 2021 and the student grant means test for 2022 is based on gross reckonable income for the 2021 tax year, the special rate income threshold remains at &euro;24,500 for the 2022 Scheme. However, the special rate of grant payment itself was increased by &euro;200 as part of Budget 2022, along with all other student grant rates. For the 2022\/23 academic year, the special rate of grant is payable at the non-adjacent rate of &euro;6,115 or the adjacent rate of &euro;2,575, depending on the distance from ordinary residence to the college attended. <\/p>  <p>  These changes will benefit thousands of students and will build on the improvements that have already been made through this year&rsquo;s student grant scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  This summer in advance of the Estimates process,  I intend to publish a paper outlining potential options and impacts, to be considered in the Budgetary process, related to the Student Grant scheme and other programmes related to student supports and costs of higher education, including with respect to those priorities identified in the Student Grant Scheme Review.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund.

Critically, we have definitively taken student loans off the table.  We have instead chosen a mixed model of investment, which includes funding from the Exchequer, employers and from students. <\/p>  <p>  The policy sets out the vision and direction of higher education funding, our ambitions to drive reform and support agility and responsiveness in the sector, and the need to ensure that students are supported in accessing education and training. This includes:<\/p>  <p>  -  Planned additional investment of &euro;307 million to address core funding challenges for our institutions, that will be made over a number of years through annual budgetary processes. This does not account for future demographic needs or new policy proposals for higher education.<\/p>  <p>  -  Plans to consider options to address cost as a barrier to higher education, and how we will pursue funding measures on these issues through the Estimates process, including in respect of reductions to the student contribution and enhancements to the SUSI grant in line with the Student Grant Review.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of Higher Education funding on an annual basis is part of overall expenditure management and budgetary policy for Government. It is of course imperative that funding is made available to my Department to support these plans and I will be seeking to have the additional funding required to address the identified core funding gap and also to address costs of attending higher education as part of the annual Estimates processes over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  I have been clear, however, that I want to see the student contribution in higher education reduced in a meaningful way over the course of future Budgets. I want this done in a way which does not negatively impact on the sustainable core funding for higher education. Higher Education Institutions currently receive c.&euro;438m from student contributions (&euro;248m from students and &euro;190m from the Exchequer through SUSI).

My ambition is to ensure that we provide supports and opportunities for learning to all. This means recognising the needs of vulnerable learners, the most marginalised and those with special and additional needs.<\/p>  <p>  DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) Initiative is the most significant national (and centrally funded) initiative that targets support at disadvantaged communities, particularly those located in urban areas, the Departments work collaboratively to support successful educational transitions to further and higher education. Early intervention and early educational experiences are crucial &ndash; Access to further and higher education starts early, and earlier inclusive experiences of students in education is crucial influencing factor. <\/p>  <p>  The vision of the third National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 (NAP) is that the student body entering, participating in, and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland&rsquo;s population. Work on the development of the new National Access Plan (NAP) 2022 - 2028 is at an advanced stage and I will be bringing the new Plan to Government shortly. <\/p>  <p>  The current plan set out five goals and more than thirty actions, developed following widespread consultation with stakeholders, with the aim of supporting increased access and participation in higher education by six main target groups.  Those groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first-time mature students, students with disabilities, part-time\/flexible learners, further education and training award holders; and Irish Travellers. The plan also indicated subgroups that require support, including lone parents, teen parents and ethnic minorities. Improving equity of access to higher education is an ongoing objective. The NAP identified a number of indicators that help to inform progress on NAP implementation and the delivery of increased equity of access.  These indicators included entry to higher education from students who have attended DEIS schools. <\/p>  <p>  At the commencement of the NAP there were 3,959 new entrants to higher education from DEIS schools. This data is recorded through the HEA Student Record System (SRS).  As we develop the new National Access Plan 2022-2028, which is currently underway, and continue to gather data on this particular group, a notable increase is evident in 2020\/21, with 5,320 new entrants from DEIS schools attending higher education. This finding is in line with a Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills (2021) report which noted an increase in the transition rates of those attending DEIS schools to higher education in 2020.  We will continue to measure entry to higher education for those attending DEIS schools over the lifetime of the new Plan.<\/p>  <p>  Engagement with DEIS schools features in Strand 3 of the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH). PATH 3 with an investment envelope of &euro;15m since its establishment supports HEI capacity in developing regional and community partnership strategies (including with DEIS schools) for increasing access to higher education by specified groups. A number of projects approved under PATH 3, including under the recent extension of a funding for another three years, include engagement with local DEIS schools. <\/p>  <p>  Similarly, a number of projects supported under Strand 1 of PATH, which is committed to increasing the diversity of initial teacher education for new entrants, involve engagement with DEIS schools. For example, several Centres collaborate with DEIS schools in mentoring programmes to improve the reach of access to higher education and in particular, access to initial teacher education. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the PATH 2 bursaries now with three tiers of support take a wider range of indicators into consideration and students from DEIS schools can feature among the recipients.  <\/p>  <p>  An impact evaluation of the PATH programme is planned to commence in 2022 and this will inform future decisions on the PATH programme.<\/p>  <p>  The Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI) Supporting DEIS Learners Transition to FET Steering Group was established in 2018 under ETBI structures to support collaboration amongst ETBs, continually improve practice and, develop draft proposals, policies, procedures, information and resources in areas of supporting DEIS learners transition to FET. Since 2018, the Group has supported the establishment of local networks providing information and clear pathways for DEIS learners transition to FET, mapped existing local initiatives to support the Transition of DEIS Learners to FET and shared best practice, developed a community of shared practice, facilitating learning and development and enhancing capacity within the membership and has established a communication channel facilitating the exchange of information between ETBI, ETBs, JMB and ACCS.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to seven Special Disadvantage Initiatives located in areas of socio-economic disadvantage in Dublin and Limerick cities. These projects specifically target children and young people in primary and post primary DEIS schools who are generally at risk of not reaching their full academic potential. They also seek to direct further targeted activities at children and young people who demonstrate high academic potential but may be at risk of not progressing to further or higher education for a variety of reasons.   <\/p>  <p>  The types of activities that students are supported through include, study skills workshops \/ supervised study \/ summer schools \/ homework club \/ financial support \/ learning support \/ grinds \/ bursaries \/ technology\/ Gaeltacht trips.  In 2020\/21 academic year over 1,000 socio-economic disadvantaged students were supported by these initiatives.  In the same year a total of 142 students transitioned into Higher Education and 132 students transitioned into Further Education. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900058#WRG06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[24954\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900058#WRG06400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reforms that are being considered for the current CAO system given the recent announcement of changes to be implemented on the current leaving certificate programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Education recently announced a programme of work for a reimagined Senior Cycle of education which will, in time, include changes in the final assessment procedure.

The &lsquo;<i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025&rsquo;<\/i>sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship more accessible to employers and learners. Expansion to date has widened the impact of apprenticeship to areas of skills shortage such as engineering, technology skills, logistics, and fintech.<\/p><p>Apprenticeship has undergone transformation over the past 6 years. There is a clear need to broaden the awareness of apprenticeship as a work-based route to internationally recognised qualifications and experience for people progressing in their career, school leavers, and career changers. Growing that message is a key feature of planning for apprenticeship in the coming years. <\/p><p>The simple fact is that apprenticeship only exists in areas where there is a demand for skills. They are not approved otherwise. However apprentice jobs can only exist where employers provide those jobs &ndash; and the <i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship<\/i>sets out to support employers to engage with apprenticeship as a key mechanism for building a highly skilled workforce. People learn in different ways and we want to make sure that everyone is aware apprenticeship can be for them as a route to a qualification into the future.<\/p><p>The actions set out in the plan will deliver clarity for school-leavers, jobseekers, and career changers on the wide range of available apprenticeships. Furthermore, it will put a structure in place to ensure that the apprentice population will more closely reflect the general population &ndash; through targeted supports for under-represented groups and making sure that there is ongoing representation from those groups to advise on specific actions into the future. <\/p><p>Empowering people from under-represented and marginalised sections of society to take their rightful place in the system is vital to the success of apprenticeship.  Apprenticeship can provide them with a clear route to not only a job, but to a valued qualification and a clear career path, instilling hope and direction that may not otherwise have been readily apparent.<\/p><p>Government will also ensure that the public sector plays its part by delivering high quality public sector employment and training opportunities, underpinning the ongoing reform of our public service.<\/p><p>The workplace is changing and the response to COVID-19 has accelerated digital transformation, changing the nature and capabilities required for occupations. Certain sectors were greatly affected, particularly aviation and hospitality and may take a long time to recover to anywhere near normal levels. Other sectors including construction and the green economy are forecast to recover more quickly and expand. A significant number of people will need to reskill to find alternative employment and to prepare for the new employment opportunities that will emerge &ndash; apprenticeship provides a rapid route to gaining those skills.<\/p><p>The &lsquo;<i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship&rsquo;<\/i>has been live for one year now, and this Summer I intend to bring forward a progress report on that plan, detailing achievements against the targets that were set in order to assess what gains have been made in evolving and transforming the apprenticeship system to meet the needs of Irelands economy and society.<\/p><p>Already, I can report to you that as a result of a &euro;34 million investment under Budget 2022 targeting the expansion of apprenticeship, including the development of new programmes and addressing the Covid-related backlogs, tangible progress has already been made.<\/p><p>For example, eight new apprenticeship programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021, despite the pandemic &ndash; <\/p><p>- Arboriculture, <\/p><p>- Equipment Systems Engineer, <\/p><p>- Healthcare Assistant, <\/p><p>- Principal Engineer &ndash; Professional Doctorate, <\/p><p>- Recruitment Executive, <\/p><p>- Sales, <\/p><p>- Scaffolding , <\/p><p>- Supply Chain Associate. <\/p><p>In 2022 more were added &ndash; <\/p><p>- Bar Manager, <\/p><p>- Wind Turbine Maintenance and <\/p><p>- Transport Operations &amp;amp; Commercial Driving. <\/p><p>This brings the total number of available programmes to 65, and will help address areas of severe skills shortage.

We want apprenticeship to be at the heart of the conversation when employers are looking at ways to recruit staff. A minimum of 10,000 new apprentice jobs will be available every year &ndash; and will be filled by learners of all ages and experience, and at least 750 of those will be in the public sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900059#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further and Higher Education","counter":364,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900059#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":365,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[25394\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900059#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way that he will ensure that any increase in funding to the higher education sector is translated into better employment conditions for the many workers in the sector in precarious employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":366,"content":"<p>In relation to funding, on May 4th I launched Funding the Future &ndash; the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future of higher education.

Instead, the Government is committing to a multi-funded model of additional Exchequer investment and employer contributions through the National Training Fund. The policy sets out the vision and direction of higher education funding, our commitment to addressing legacy issues in higher education and detailing our ambitious plans for investment and reform. <\/p>  <p>  This includes: <\/p>  <p>  - Planned additional investment of &euro;307 million to address core funding challenges for our institutions, that will be made over a number of years through annual budgetary processes.

In prioritising core funding increases, the intention is that quality of outcomes will improve, the agility and responsiveness of higher education will be strengthened and the reputation of Ireland&rsquo;s higher education system will be enhanced, including in international rankings. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the framework, the Department considers the current student staff ratios challenge quality and have contributed to deterioration in the position of Irish institutions in international rankings.

I have also introduced changes to the criteria for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant which means that from September 2022, the qualifying distance for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km. In this way the scheme is responsive to eligible students who reside further away from college by providing an increased rate of student maintenance grant.

It is therefore my objective to ensure that there is access into either further or higher education for each person who wishes to pursue educational options at third-level. <\/p>  <p>  Our higher education system has expanded significantly over the past number of years, from 209,300 enrolments in 2014 to 245,700 enrolments in 2020. The most recent projections of full-time enrolment in higher education predict that enrolments will rise a further 13% over the next decade, and work is ongoing to build capacity within the system to accommodate this increase. Work is also ongoing on an updated set of enrolment projections for higher education, which will further assist in this capacity-building programme of work. My Department does not currently produce specific projections for the number of higher education graduates, as a number of variables can impact graduate output in any one year. <\/p>  <p>  We are also working to strengthen the further education and training system under a new strategy for that sector.  This will help ensure that our tertiary education system as a whole equips our students with the knowledge, skills and expertise required to secure good quality, well paid and sustainable employment.  <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships with a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per year by 2025.  In 2021, a record 8,607 new apprentices were registered- an almost 40% increase on the figures from 2019, the last &ldquo;normal&rdquo; pre-pandemic year.<\/p>  <p>  Development of new apprenticeship programmes has continued despite the pandemic challenges, There are currently 65 apprenticeship programmes on offer: 25 craft programmes and 40 programmes introduced since 2016. Eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021, despite the pandemic; Arboriculture, Equipment Systems Engineer, Healthcare Assistant, Principal Engineer &ndash; Professional Doctorate, Recruitment Executive, Sales, Scaffolding and Supply Chain Associate. These new apprenticeships are developed in response to particular skills needs in the workforce.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of key strategies in place at all levels to ensure we meet existing and future skills demands. These include policies designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified science and technical graduates, and initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands. Central to shaping these strategies is the partnership approach between the Further and Higher Education system and Government, Industry, the National Skills Council, the National Training Fund Advisory Group, the Regional Skills Fora and the Apprenticeship Council.<\/p>  <p>  The National Skills Council (NSC) within its remit advises on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and on how to secure delivery of these needs. Key high level trends identified at recent NSC meetings include automation and digitisation, digital literacy and transversal skills. Information on these trends is then use to formulate our skills strategies and initiatives such as the National Skills Strategy 2025; Technology Skills 2022; Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to advance efforts to ensure that Ireland offers learning opportunities to all who wish to pursue then, and produces the graduates the workforce needs with the skills that our economy and society require. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900059#WRH02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":388,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[24950\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900059#WRH02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department has plans to offer businesses supports to engage in lifelong learning; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":389,"content":"<p>A core objective for my Department is to ensure that individuals and businesses are offered supports and pathways to quality education, upskilling and reskilling opportunities.<\/p><p>The National Training Fund supports initiatives including:  <b>Skills to Advance<\/b><b><i><\/i><\/b><b>- <\/b>an employee development policy framework which enables targeted support for vulnerable groups in the Irish workforce;  <b>Skills to Compete &ndash; <\/b>a range of programmes to respond to the need for activation, upskilling and reskilling<b>; Springboard+ <\/b>provides free and subsidised upskilling and reskilling higher education opportunities in areas of identified skills need; and the <b>Human Capital Initiative<\/b>(HCI) range of programmes which seek to ensure that the higher education system as a whole responds to the constantly evolving skills needs of the economy.  <b><\/b><\/p><p><b>Skillnet Ireland<\/b>provides subsidised training to business through learning networks operating nationwide and across all sectors, and have been allocated an additional &euro;11 million under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve to support the SME sector.<\/p><p>The pace of change in skills and the work of work is exponential, and only set to grow, as we tackle trends like digitalisation, automation, demographic change and seek to move to a low carbon future.

SUSI anticipate the final figures for 2021\/22 will be in line with previous years. <\/p><p>The third National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education (2015 &ndash; 2021) was launched in December 2015. The vision of the National Access Plan is to ensure that the student body entering into, participating in and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland's population. The Plan identifies the target groups that are currently under-represented in higher education including lone parents. <\/p><p>The <b>Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH)<\/b>is the main funding stream that supports the implementation of the National Access Plan (NAP) with an overall funding envelope of &euro;42m between the periods 2017 to 2022. <\/p><p>- Strand 1 supports access to initial teacher education from the target groups identified in the National Access Plan.  &euro;900,000 per annum allocated and over the 6 year period totalling &euro;5.4m.  <\/p><p>- Strand 2 provides bursaries to students who have been identified by their higher education institution as being the most socio-economically disadvantaged students in the target groups under the National Access Plan. With effect from the 2021\/22 academic year, a three-tier system of bursary provision has been introduced. This consists of the existing 203 bursaries arising from the original call worth &euro;5,000 per annum (Tier 1), 120 bursaries worth &euro;2,000 per annum (Tier 2) and a number of once-off bursaries worth &euro;1,500 payable for the 2021\/22 academic year only (Tier 3).<\/p><p>- Strand 3 Higher Education Access Fund supports regional clusters of higher education institutions with the aim of attracting additional students from groups currently under-represented in higher education. &euro;2.5m per annum allocated to clusters of higher education, totalling &euro;15m over the 6 year period.<\/p><p>In academic year 2019\/2020, a total of 56 lone parents were in receipt of a PATH bursary (28% of all bursary recipients) and in 2020\/2021, 50 lone parents received a PATH bursary (25 % of all bursary recipients).<\/p><p>The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial support to full- and part-time students who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending higher education. The SAF can be claimed for expenses such as books, rent, food, medical costs, class materials, light and heat bills, essential travel and childcare.  In the academic year 2020\/2021 there were 829 part time students including lone parents who were recipients of the Student Assistance Fund.<\/p><p>Since 2017, following an independent review of the barriers facing lone parents in accessing higher education and other reviews of the SAF and FSD, the Government has invested additional funds to allow the extension of the SAF to part-time students who are lone parents or other members of National Access Plan target groups. The current core SAF provision for 2022 is &euro;9.1m with no final decision made as to the 22\/23 allocation. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the SAF allocation for the 2020\/21 academic year was doubled from &euro;8.1 million to &euro;16.2 million. The SAF will be doubled again for the 2021\/22 academic year.<\/p><p>Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is built. The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including for those heading one-parent families. FET provision is largely free or heavily subsidised, and a number of financial supports may be available to learners to facilitate the participation of individuals who would not otherwise be in a position to take up training. I would encourage people to make an appointment with their local Adult Education Guidance Service (AEGS), available in each Education and Training Boards (ETB) across the country free of charge, to discuss what supports may be available to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900059#WRH04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":402,"content":"<p>Question No. 153 answered with Question No. 132.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Technological Universities","counter":403,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900059#WRH04400"},{"type":"question","counter":404,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[25383\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900059#WRH04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of his plans to ensure Dundalk Institute of Technology becomes a technological university; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1551","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":405,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, Dundalk Institute of Technology is currently pursuing a trajectory to achieve technological university (TU) status and is receiving Transformation Fund assistance from the Exchequer to do so.

Where an issue arises in relation to the employment status of an individual, cases are forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and\/or the Scope Section of the Department of Social Protection for investigation either solely by the recipient, or jointly with the Labour Inspectorate of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).<\/p>  <p>  In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed. Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual the relevant Departments and Agencies will have regard to the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals.<\/p>  <p>  A revised Code of Practice on determining employment status, was published in July 2021 by the Minister for Social Protection. The Code is the key guidance document for employers and workers and others in relation to deciding the employment status of a worker. It was revised to take account of newer labour market developments, including platform work. Steps are underway to place the Code on a statutory footing.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the EU Commission published proposals for a range of measures on December 8th, 2021, including for a directive aiming to improve the working conditions of platform workers by preventing and addressing misclassification of their employment status. Working party discussions are continuing on this draft text.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900061#WRK02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Development","counter":500,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900061#WRK02500"},{"type":"question","counter":501,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[22006\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900061#WRK02600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the way that central Government will deliver economic growth to ensure regional balanced development.","asker":"1601","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":502,"content":"<p>Balanced regional development is a key policy priority of mine and this Government.

Of the 246 investments won in 2020, more than half went to regional locations.  In 2021, of the 249 investments secured by the IDA, over half were for locations outside Dublin.  <\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices have just come out of an 8th consecutive year of growth with 7,400 new jobs created by LEO clients in 2021. The LEOs now support over 7,100 companies financially within their portfolio with almost 36,000 associated jobs.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has published nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024. <\/p>  <p>  These plans are unique to each region focusing on identified growth opportunities while also addressing areas of vulnerability. The plans encourage collaboration among stakeholders to strengthen the regional offering for enterprise and therefore create an environment for successful economic development and growth across the country. <\/p>  <p>   The Government, through Enterprise Ireland, has provided over &euro;126 million in funding through the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, Border Enterprise Development Fund, and Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme to assist enterprise development and regional jobs growth across all regions. These Funds enable significant collaborative and innovative regional projects to provide a timely impetus to job creation in regional locations.<\/p>  <p>  Up to &euro;180 million is being made available over the coming months and years for the nine Regional Enterprise Plans to develop and implement collaborative and innovative enterprise projects &ndash; projects that will not just sustain but add to employment at county, regional and national level.  <\/p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Town Centre First - A Policy Approach for Irish Towns&rsquo; which was jointly developed by Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Rural and Community Development and informed by the work of a Town Centre First Interdepartmental Group, was published in February 2022, focuses on the regeneration of rural towns and villages.  <\/p>  <p>  Led by the Department of Rural and Community Development, &lsquo;Our Rural Future&rsquo; is a whole-of-government rural development policy which sets out a range of measures to strengthen the resilience of our rural communities and economies, including addressing the impacts of the challenges experienced by people living and working in rural Ireland and maximising opportunities for rural areas. <\/p>  <p>  Over the lifetime of the National Development Plan, the Department of Rural and Community Development will continue to invest in rural Ireland and communities across the country, supported through the various scheme such as the rural regeneration and development fund, the LEADER programme and the town and village renewal scheme, to name a few.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic imposed remote working on a lot of people. I want workers to be able to work remotely, whether from home or nearby hub if they chose to do so.

The Strategy identified 15 actions to ensure that remote work is a permanent feature in the Irish workplace in a way that maximises its economic, social and environmental benefits.<\/p>  <p>  The potential benefits of increased remote working include improved work-life balance and fewer emissions from commuting. Remote work has the potential to increase labour market participation by women, people with disabilities, people with caring responsibilities and older people. Remote working will result in more balanced regional development and new job opportunities for those living in rural Ireland.  Employers that embrace remote and flexible working arrangements will be rewarded with greater access to talent. <\/p>  <p>  Female labour market participation in Ireland, for example, is currently at record levels. In Q4 2021, the female labour force participation rate stood at 60.0 percent- an increase from 54.4 percent in Q4 2020, a development at least in part facilitated by the wider adoption of remote working arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  Remote working will be a key mechanism for achieving our employment targets, helping those most distant from the labour force into work, and further contributing to achieving our ambitious climate targets.<\/p>  <p>  My Department co-ordinated the implementation of the Strategy&rsquo;s actions through an Interdepartmental Group. There has been significant progress in implementing these actions which will facilitate remote working opportunities for both employees and employers both now and into the future. I would highlight the following actions taken under the Strategy towards achieving this:<\/p>  <p>- On 25th January, the Government approved the priority drafting of the Right to Request Remote Working Bill 2022. The new law will set out a clear legal framework around which requesting, approving or refusing such a request can be based. Pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment commenced on 9th of February, with three meetings having been held to date. Officials in my Department attended a further meeting on 18th   May. The intention remains that the Bill will be progressed through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible. Following publication of the Joint Oireachtas Committee&rsquo;s Report on pre-legislative scrutiny, any recommendations made will be reviewed and considered. I want to emphasise that I am happy to listen to proposed amendments to the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  - The publication of the Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect in April 2021 by the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p>  <p>  - In Budget 2022, an enhanced income tax deduction for people working from home was announced. It amounts to 30 percent of the cost of vouched expenses for heat, electricity and broadband.<\/p>  <p>  - The Government is investing heavily in remote work infrastructure throughout the country to ensure that communities across Ireland are in a position to benefit from the opportunities presented by increased remote working. <\/p>  <p>  - ConnectedHubs.ie- Ireland&rsquo;s first national digital hub network- was launched by the Department of Rural and Community Development in May 2021. ConnectedHubs.ie will ultimately link over 400 hubs throughout our country. <\/p>  <p>  - The Connected Hubs Fund awarded funding of &euro;8.9m to 117 remote working hub projects and Broadband Connection Pointsin July 2021 to upgrade Ireland&rsquo;s remote work infrastructure. An additional &euro;5m has been made available under the 2022 Connected Hubs Call. &euro;18.5m in funding under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme was also announced recently, with successful projects including 28 remote working proposals.<\/p>  <p>  - To date, a total of approximately &euro;100m has been provided by the Department of Rural and Community Development through its various funding streams to support the development of remote working infrastructure across the country. This includes &euro;76 million in funding for projects under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF), many of which involved the regeneration of historic town centre buildings as enterprise centres and co-working hubs.<\/p>  <p>  - In October 2021, over &euro;9.3 million in funding was awarded to projects around the country through Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme, with successful applicants including hubs and enterprise centres throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  - My Department recently published new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024 in which there is a focus on promoting remote working opportunities and investing in infrastructures across the nine regions. The plans were launched at regional locations during February and March 2022.<\/p>  <p>  - While National Broadband Plan has been impacted negatively by COVID-19, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications is continuing to engage with National Broadband Ireland to address the delays that have arisen to ensure that the programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.<\/p>  <p>  - The Civil Service Blended Working Policy Framework was published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on March 31st, 2022, which will help deliver the Programme for Government commitment to move to 20% remote\/home working across the sector.<\/p>  <p>  - Ongoing remote work promotion and guidance including advice for employers and employees on best practice, health and safety, equality and skills by a range of agencies including the Health and Safety Authority, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Western Development Commission, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Skillnet Ireland and local Education and Training Boards.<\/p>  <p>  - My Department is continuing to develop and promote its Guidance for Working Remotely webpage. This webpage acts as a central access point for employers and employees and brings together the existing State guidance, legislation and advice on remote work into one place. The webpage is a live resource and is updated regularly.

The Plan includes the overarching ambition of having 2.5 million people in work by 2024, a target which has already been exceeded according to the Q4 2021 figures released through the CSO&rsquo;s Labour Force Survey in February this year. <\/p>  <p>  The ERP outlined supports to help businesses deal with the direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as setting out the Government&rsquo;s medium-term approach to creating the right environment for a jobs-led recovery and, crucially, to ensure that these jobs are more productive, innovative, resilient and in new areas of opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  Since the beginning of the pandemic, Government has invested heavily to help the sectors and workers most impacted by the pandemic and to stabilise the labour market. Schemes such as the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) were introduced to support the changing needs of industry through the various stages of the public health crisis, as well as to support industry through the transition back to the full reopening of the economy. Since its introduction, the EWSS, an economy-wide support for enterprise, has made &euro;6.7billion in payments to support over 50,000 employers and nearly three quarters of a million employees. Under the CRSS &euro;727million was paid to 25,700 businesses impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. As of the beginning of February 2022, over &euro;9.1billion had been paid out through the PUP. <\/p>  <p>  \"Pillar 3\" of the ERP outlines how the Government intends to rebuild sustainable enterprises as the economy recovers. The Plan adopts a two-pronged recovery approach to rebuilding sustainable enterprises - supporting the domestic SME sector, which is critical to broad-based jobs-led economic growth, whilst leveraging the enormous strength of the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) sector. It aims to create an environment for a jobs-led recovery through a focus on expanding sectors and by helping business become more resilient and agile.<\/p>  <p>  Progress on the wide range of deliverables and workstreams across the four pillars of the ERP, towards the plan&rsquo;s overall ambition is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment and related sub-groups and Senior Officials Groups and a high-level progress report is due to be published in early June.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the work already underway, the Government is also looking to prepare for the economy of the future.

The White Paper will set out set out an ambitious medium- to long-term direction for enterprise policy in response to challenges, opportunities and new drivers of growth catalysed by the Covid-19 pandemic, new economic and geopolitical realities, and an increased urgency to accelerate the decarbonisation of industry.  In so doing, the White Paper will articulate what needs to be done differently to realise this vision and to set out clearly the risks to be faced - such as energy, skills availability, technological change, etc. - and the policy choices and trade-offs that will arise in order to maintain high-quality jobs, to protect the elements which make Ireland&rsquo;s economy globally attractive for investment and to ensure a competitive Irish economy into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900061#WRK04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":528,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[25620\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900061#WRK05000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the degree to which the needs of employers and employees are being met in an organised way to maximise opportunities arising from the post-pandemic recovery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":529,"content":"<p>My Department and I are aware that it is essential that Irish enterprise has access to high quality, adaptable and flexible talent, and that workers have the opportunity to upskill or reskill in areas of identified skills needs for the Irish economy. <\/p><p>This is critical at a time when the digital and green transitions, and their associated behavioural changes, are altering the economy and leading to permanent changes in our labour market and business models.

This funding supports either fully free or heavily subsidised opportunities in areas of identified skills needs, which serves to incentivise and maximise engagement by employers and workers.<\/p><p>The work of the Council is also informed by the activities of the network of nine Regional Skills Fora, which work to address the skills needs of regional enterprise by enhancing linkages and engagement between local education and training providers and employers, and by helping employers better understand and access the full range of services available across the education and training system.

It applies to directors or employees who have a &ldquo;material interest&rdquo; in their employer company.  This section denies such directors or employees a credit for tax deducted from their remuneration when filing their income tax return, until such time as the tax has been remitted to the Collector-General by their employer company.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 997A TCA has not been disapplied in debt warehousing cases, so employees and directors who are subject to section 997A cannot have a credit for tax deducted if their employers have warehoused the PAYE liabilities due on their salaries.<\/p>  <p>  Finance Act 2021 made two changes to the debt warehousing scheme for individuals in this position.<\/p>  <p>  The first change was an amendment to section 1080B TCA, which is the warehousing section for income tax liabilities.  This change was to take account of the fact that some employees and directors to whom section 997A applies would not be able to warehouse their income tax liabilities in their own right, if their income in either 2020 or 2021 was not at least 25% lower than their income for 2019, the last full year before the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment permitted individuals in this position to warehouse the tax due on their own employment (Schedule E) income only, provided that their employer had also warehoused the PAYE (employment) liability for that employment.  If this change had not been introduced, such individuals would have been liable to interest charges for late payment and might also have been in default of their preliminary tax obligations.<\/p>  <p>  The second change was the introduction of a new section 1080C TCA.  In cases where a taxpayer is subject to section 997A and the taxpayer&rsquo;s employer has not remitted the tax due on the individual&rsquo;s salary to Revenue, both the employer and the individual are liable to interest for late payment on the unpaid tax.  Section 1080C provides that, in debt warehousing cases only, there will not be a &ldquo;double interest&rdquo; charge and only the employer will be liable for interest on the liabilities relating to the individual&rsquo;s salary.  However, if the employer fails to pay the interest (for example, if the employer company is liquidated) the individual will be liable for interest on late payment, as well as for the tax if that is also unpaid.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the changes in Finance Act 2021 is to prevent directors and employees with a material interest in a company from being unfairly impacted by the interaction of the debt warehousing provisions, the section 997A anti-avoidance measure and their own tax obligations.  The changes introduced are narrow in their scope and application.<\/p>  <p>  As with all liabilities in the debt warehouse, no interest was charged during Period 1, which expired on 31 December 2021 in most cases; no interest is charged in Period 2, which ends for most cases on 31 December 2022; and interest will be charged at 3% per annum from 1 January 2023 until the liability is paid in full.  For taxpayers who continued to avail of certain Covid-19 supports, Period 1 was extended to 30 April 2022 and the end date of Period 2 was pushed back to 30 April 2023, meaning the 3% interest rate is charged in those cases from 1 May 2023. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900062#WRL06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":593,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[25580\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the grounds on which differing criteria are used with respect to social-welfare entitlements and taxation, whereby cohabiting couples can be jointly-assessed for the former but not the latter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":594,"content":"<p>Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, they are treated as separate and unconnected individuals for the purposes of income tax.  Each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes, therefore, cohabiting couples cannot file joint assessment tax returns or share their tax credits and tax bands in the same manner as married couples.  <\/p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980), which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  <\/p>  <p>  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. However, it is based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.  This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting. <\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":595,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":596,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[25587\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the annual cost of cleaning and sanitising roofs of buildings under his Department&rsquo;s control for the past five years to date in 2022.","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":597,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has had no annual costs associated with the cleaning or sanitising of roofs of the Department's buildings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":598,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":599,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[25608\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of households that did not complete the self-reporting local property tax survey on vacancies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":600,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[25610\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the penalties that are in place for failing to report property vacancy with respect to local property tax returns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":601,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 and 224 together.<\/p>  <p>  For the Local Property Tax (LPT) valuation period 2022-2025, residential property owners were asked to indicate in their LPT returns the occupancy status of their properties on 1 November 2021 and, where vacant, the duration of and reason for the vacancy.  It is important to note that LPT applies in respect of any building which is in use as, or is suitable for use as, a dwelling.  Therefore, it is not applied in respect of a property which has fallen into such a state of dereliction that it is no longer in use as, or suitable for use as, a dwelling. These information requirements were included in LPT returns in accordance with section 39A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), which was introduced by the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021.  Any information obtained under section 39A may only be used for compiling statistical information in relation to vacant residential properties.  <\/p>  <p>  As the information on occupancy status was collected as part of the LPT return, all property owners that submitted an LPT return for the valuation period 2022-2025 completed the local property tax survey on vacancies that the deputies have referred to.  As of 11 May, 1,250,611 property owners had filed returns in respect of 1,597,200 properties. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as with any other tax return, all LPT returns are subject to validation and checking by Revenue, and this extends to the information returned regarding the occupancy status of properties.  Where a person files an LPT return but fails to include in the return all of the required information and fails to remedy matters when asked to do so by Revenue, section 146 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012   provides that the person will be liable to a penalty of the amount of the LPT that is correctly payable in respect of the property (subject to a cap of &euro;3,000). Accordingly, where a person failed to indicate in their LPT return for the valuation period 2022-2025 that the property was unoccupied on 1 November 2021 and fails to remedy matters when asked to do so by Revenue, the person will be liable for a penalty equal to the amount of LPT that was correctly payable in respect of the property (subject to the cap of &euro;3,000).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":602,"content":"<p>Question No. 224 answered with Question No. 223.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flexible Work Practices","counter":603,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM01300"},{"type":"question","counter":604,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[25479\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM01400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 583 of 26 April 2022, the way that flexi-leave will be taken into account for those who work less than five days per week further to the publication of the Civil Service Blended Working Policy Framework; if details of the way that blended and hybrid-work will take flexi-leave into consideration will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":605,"content":"<p>Further to Parliamentary Question No. 583 of 26 April 2022, the availability of flexitime accrual for those availing of a blended working arrangement is continuing to be considered.

Where a construction product covered by a harmonised standard is being placed on the EU market, the CPR requires the manufacturer to draw up a &lsquo;declaration of performance&rsquo; and affix a &lsquo;CE&rsquo; marking to the product. In order to do so, manufacturers must test and declare the performance of their construction products using a common technical language prescribed in the harmonised standard.  <\/p><p>On 30 March 2022, the European Commission launched a package of European Green Deal proposals to make sustainable products the norm in the EU, boost circular business models and empower consumers for the green transition. These include a proposal to revise the Construction Products Regulation to boost the internal market for construction products and ensure that the regulatory framework in place is fit for making the built environment deliver on our sustainability and climate objectives.<\/p><p>The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), is Ireland&rsquo;s official standards body and is an autonomous body under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment. NSAI has produced additional guidance to some harmonised standards, under the CPR, in the form of Standard Recommendations (SRs) which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain construction products in Ireland.<\/p><p>In relation to the specification of concrete blocks, the relevant suite of harmonised standard facilitating specification of masonry units is the EN 771 (series).  <i>&lsquo;I.S. EN 771-3:2011+A1:2015&rsquo;<\/i>deals with aggregate concrete masonry units. NSAI has published additional guidance in the form of &lsquo;<i>S.R. 325:2013+A2:2018\/AC:2019 Recommendations for the design of masonry structures in Ireland to Eurocode 6&rsquo; which <\/i>provides, inter alia, guidance on the choice of masonry units and mortar classes most appropriate for particular situations as regards durability for finished work in Ireland. S.R. 325:2013+A2:2018\/AC: 2019 recommends the use of Category 1 aggregate concrete blocks, which requires independent third party oversight of factory production control by a Notified Body (a designated body that carries out third-party tasks).<\/p><p>In respect of specification of aggregates for concrete (including concrete blocks), NSAI has published <i>&lsquo;S.R. 16:2016 Guidance on the use of I.S. EN 12620:2002+A1:2008 - Aggregates for concrete&rsquo; <\/i>which<i><\/i>outlines the precautions to be taken in the quarry to reduce the risk of harmful impurities in aggregate production, again including the requirement for independent third party oversight of factory production control by a Notified Body.<\/p><p>In respect of the specification of hardcore, the relevant harmonised standard is <i>&lsquo;I.S. EN .S. EN 13242:2002+A1:2007 &ndash; Aggregates for unbound and hydraulically bound materials for use in civil engineering work and road construction&rsquo;<\/i>. NSAI has published <i>&lsquo;S.R. 21:2014+A1:2016 Guidance on the use of I.S. EN 13242:2002+A1:2007 &ndash; Aggregates for unbound and hydraulically bound materials for use in civil engineering work and road construction&rsquo;<\/i>which includes the specification for hardcore (Annex E of S.R. 21) and outlines the precautions to be taken in the quarry to reduce the risk of harmful impurities in aggregate production and requires third party oversight of the manufacturing process.<\/p><p>A full list of designated Notified Bodies for construction products may be found on the New Approach Notified and Designated Organisations (NANDO) Information System hosted by the European Commission.<\/p><p>Separately, NSAI published <i>&lsquo;I.S. 888:2016 Code of Practice for the procurement and use of unbound granular fill hardcore material for use under concrete floors&rsquo;<\/i>, which outlines the requirements for post manufacturing operations of hardcore (beyond the quarry gate) such as procurement, haulage, delivery and receipt, storage and handling, placing, traceability and record management, with the aim of improving the chain of custody within the supply chain and ensuring the complete traceability of hardcore from the original manufacturer and source to the location where it is incorporated into the works.<\/p><p>Ultimately, the manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the CPR and in particular for the Declaration of Performance\/CE marking of the construction product he or she is placing on the market, having full knowledge of the raw material (as is legally required by the CPR via the relevant harmonised European Standards) and having regard to the end product&rsquo;s suitability for use in construction works in accordance with the relevant Standard Recommendations published by the NSAI.<\/p><p>My Department recently published &lsquo;A Guide to the marketing and use of Aggregate Concrete Blocks to EN 771-3 in Ireland&rsquo; on its website.  This Guide provides guidance to economic operators (manufacturers, importers and distributors) on the marketing of aggregate concrete blocks to EN 771-3[1] standard, the harmonised European standard under the Construction Products Regulation. It also outlines the responsibilities of specifiers, designers, builders, certifiers and end users for compliance with the Building Regulations 1997 to 2021. <\/p><p>While the CPR came into force and has direct legal application across the entire European Union since 1 July 2013, each Member State is responsible for regulating for its own market surveillance activities in accordance with the specific requirements of the CPR and the broader overarching requirements of Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004\/42\/EC and Regulations (EC) No 765\/2008 and (EU) No 305\/2011. Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 establishes an EU wide framework for market surveillance, and came into full effect in July 2021. This strengthens the existing provisions in the CPR (and other Union harmonisation legislation), relating to the compliance of products, the framework for cooperation with organisations representing economic operators or end users, the market surveillance of products and controls on products entering the EU market.<\/p><p>Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No.225 of 2013), each of the building control authorities (local authorities) have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas.<\/p><p>In addition, the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 (Construction Products &ndash; Market Surveillance) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 682 of 2020) appointed Dublin City Council as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions under the  European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 for all related construction products on a nationwide basis. Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office, (DCC-NBCO) Market Surveillance Unit has been established for this purpose. DCC-NBCO may be contacted at: support@nbco.gov.ie.  Building control authorities will liaise with DCC-NBCO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise.<\/p><p>Market surveillance activity should enable non-compliant products to be identified and kept or taken off the market with unscrupulous and\/or criminal economic operators prosecuted and penalised for their actions. In this context, it is important to note that the overarching objective of a market surveillance authority is to ensure that compliant products are placed on the market. Where non-compliance is identified, market surveillance activities should be designed to encourage economic operators to take appropriate corrective actions to redress the position within a reasonable period of time.<\/p><p>Market surveillance authorities have significant powers including to obtain access to the place of manufacture or storage, request technical information, select samples of the construction product and carry out evaluations, examination or tests on such samples. Where construction products are placed on the market which do not comply with the requirements set out in the CPR, market surveillance authorities have powers to direct the relevant economic operator to take the necessary corrective actions to bring the product into compliance. Where this does not work, there are further procedures that may result in the product being withdrawn or recalled from the market, its use subject to special conditions, or the products availability on the market being prohibited or restricted.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s National market surveillance programme 2021 is published on the website of the European Commission. Section 2.5 provides specific details with the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by DCC-NBCO, which has recently commenced, to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR. The 2022 programme is currently underdevelopment. <\/p><p>Whilst the CPR focuses on the conditions which apply when placing a product on the market, clients, specifiers, designers and builders etc., should:<\/p><p>- when drawing up specifications, refer to the harmonised technical specifications and specifically to the requirements of individual characteristics when necessary,<\/p><p>- when choosing the products most suitable for their intended use in construction works, review the manufacturer&rsquo;s Declaration of Performance,<\/p><p>- check the Standard Recommendations published by NSAI, which give guidance on appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of the product in Ireland, and<\/p><p>- ensure compliance with the Building Regulations 1997 to 2021, in this regard all works should be carried out in a workmanlike manner, using proper materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.<\/p><p>Finally, the Regulation of Providers of Building Works Bill 2022 is currently being debated in the Oireachtas and is expected to be enacted in H1 2022. This legislation will put the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing and aims to benefit consumers and the general public by giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator. The legislation will require providers of building services to register with the appointed statutory body. This will apply to entities or individuals who hold themselves out for consideration as a provider of building works for both residential and non-residential buildings that are subject to the Building Regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Policy","counter":648,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM05800"},{"type":"question","counter":649,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[25577\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900063#WRM05900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the steps that he is taking to encourage local authorities to restrict their usage of glyphosate.","asker":"1525","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":650,"content":"<p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the responsible body for authorisation of glyphosate to the market including providing general use guidelines. <\/p><p>Local authorities are entirely independent corporate entities having full responsibility under law for the performance of their functions.

Applications that are incomplete cannot be processed within the average turnaround times. In cases where applicants are requested to submit further supporting documents, these applications are prioritised once the additional documents are received and they are processed within 15 working days. <\/p><p>The Passport Service continues to examine areas to increase internal efficiencies and improve the customer experience through the Passport Reform Programme. Over the next three years, a number of internal changes and upgrades to the technology that underpins passport operations will take place. The central project of the passport reform programme is the replacement of the current processing system with new, enhanced, core technology that will bring greater resilience, agility and capacity to passport processing systems. In advance of the new processing system coming into operation, a series of enhancements will also be made to the online application system. These enhancements will aim to assist customers applying for their passports by providing them with a list of documents required specific to their application type which will assist in reducing application errors.<\/p><p>There were 12,464 Ministerial representations made in respect of passport applications in 2021, and 5,489 made in January-April 2022.

These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day. 61% of the applications in the system are fully complete applications being processed by the Passport Service. The other 39% are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required.

This 25% reduction in processing time is as a direct result of the unprecedented level of investment that my Department has made in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems. <\/p><p>Over 460,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022, compared to a total of 634,000 passports issued in 2021. 117,000 passports were issued in April alone with 45% of adult renewal passports being issued within one to two working days. <\/p><p>Passport Service figures show that of the total number of passport applications in the system, 61% are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 39% of applications are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents. Applications that are incomplete cannot be processed within the average turnaround times.<\/p><p>First-time passport applications take longer to process than renewal applications and there are a number of reasons for this. First-time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications for Irish citizenship. The passport service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm his or her entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the passport service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first-time applicants. In the case of first-time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first-time applications take 30 working days to process.<\/p><p>The biggest cause of delays for first time applications is where incorrect or insufficient supporting documentation is submitted by the applicant. The Passport Service encourages applicants to check the requirements for their type of application carefully on my Department's website. The recently updated website includes a new Passport Service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application. The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly. <\/p><p>The Passport Service is taking a number of additional steps to deal with increased demand on its services:<\/p><p>- The Passport Service has a comprehensive plan to ensure that adequate staff, accommodation and technology supports are in place to meet expected demand for passports in 2022.<\/p><p>- A major recruitment drive has been underway over the past several months, which has seen the number of Passport Service staff increase by over 300 since June 2021.<\/p><p>- The Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers to over 900, which represents a doubling of staff compared to June 2021.<\/p><p>- Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.<\/p><p>- The Passport Service is prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. Passport Service staff are working targeted overtime in this regard.<\/p><p>- The Urgent Appointment Service is available for customers who wish to renew their passport at short notice. Customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin, within 4 days in Cork and within 5 days in London. <\/p><p>- In February, the Passport Service increased the number of appointments at its public offices by 100%, providing an extra 170 Urgent Appointments per week. <\/p><p>- A new document management system was put in place at the beginning of March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the Passport Service offices, and subsequent turnaround times for the applicant. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are being prioritised and complete applications can then be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants.<\/p><p>- Public information media campaigns reminding citizens to check and renew their passports will continue during this busy year.<\/p><p>I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p><p>I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.<blockquote>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in

Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun, who is 90 years old, was among a group of four people arrested separately and detained by the Hong Kong National Security Police for alleged conspiracy to collude with foreign powers. All four of those arrested served as trustees of the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, which provided legal assistance, funds for psychological counselling and medical treatment, and emergency relief to protesters during the 2019 unrest in Hong Kong. <\/p><p>On 11 May, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, expressed his great concern at the arrests. I share his concern. The arrests are the latest in a series of actions under the National Security Law that impinge upon fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong. During my visit to China in May 2021, I raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in relation to the National Security Law directly with Foreign Minister and State Counsellor Wang Yi. <\/p><p>Prior to that, in line with EU Council Conclusions of July 2020, the Government suspended Ireland&rsquo;s Extradition Agreement with Hong Kong. This clearly signals Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in relation to the rule of law in Hong Kong.

As a result the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and special school places are at unprecedented levels. <\/p><p>Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 to a current total of 2,148 for the 2021\/2022 school year. Of these, almost 1,900 special classes cater for students with autism. <\/p><p>Recognising some of the difficulties experienced by parents in securing appropriate school placements, over the last two years, the Department of Education and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year. Overall, this intensive intervention has seen an additional 300 special classes, providing 1,800 new places, already opened nationwide for the 2021\/22 school-year. <\/p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. <\/p><p>The Department and the NCSE continue to prioritise and support this work.<\/p><p>The Department also recognises that where parents have difficulties in securing an appropriate school placement for their child, particularly a child with additional needs, it can be a stressful experience. The Department is working hard to ensure that there are sufficient school places, appropriate to the needs of all children, available on a timely basis nationwide.  <\/p><p>The Department and the NCSE are always grateful to schools who express a willingness to open a special class to meet the educational needs of students in their local communities. <\/p><p>There are Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) located across the country and they have a specific remit in helping and supporting parents in accessing the education necessary for their children, including in identifying suitable school placements.  <\/p><p>The NCSE is currently engaging in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022\/2023 school year and beyond. The NCSE is looking at local information in relation to projected demand for future special education places, particularly to cater for students with autism who have associated complex needs. <\/p><p>NCSE have been working with stakeholders in the counties referenced by the Deputy for a number of years to meet the identified need in the counties. There are currently a total of  57 special classes for students requiring an autism class placement in the counties in question of which 44 are primary (including 8 Early Intervention ASD classes) and 13 are post primary.SENOs are currently engaged with parents, schools and Boards of Management in these counties to establish the level of need and to ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place to meet that need. <\/p><p>I should also state that Budget 2022 has provided funding to the Department and the NCSE for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022\/2023 school year. These additional classes will provide over 1,700 new places this year.

It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of the fact that the fuel allowance is a household based payment and that qualification is not just based on receipt of a qualifying payment but on a number of other complex qualifying criteria such as household composition, it is not possible for my Department to provide an accurate projection of the cost of the measure suggested by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual Carer's Support Grant (&euro;1,850) in respect of each person for whom they care.  <\/p>  <p>  While Carer's Allowance is not a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance, a person in receipt of Carer's Allowance may avail of the Fuel Allowance payment in certain circumstances.  Fuel Allowance is a household-based payment, and a carer will very often live with and care for a person in receipt of a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.  Income from full rate Carer's Allowance is disregarded from the fuel means test, if the carer is providing full time care and attention to the Fuel Allowance applicant, his\/her qualified spouse\/civil partner or cohabitant or qualified child(ren).<\/p>  <p>  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, s\/he can keep his\/her main social protection payment in addition to receiving the half-rate Carer's Allowance.  S\/he can also receive an extra half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance if s\/he cares for more than one person.  The payment of half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for Fuel Allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, then s\/he is deemed to have satisfied the means test and Fuel Allowance is payable, subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance then s\/he will have to satisfy a means test in order to qualify for Fuel Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to adjust the rules of Fuel Allowance to make Carer's Allowance a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of overall budget negotiations.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.

The maximum personal rate was equivalent to the then maximum rate for the State Pension (Contributory).  Eligibility was based on PRSI contributions and credits and payments were calculated based on the Yearly Averaging approach.  PRSI Class S contributions (self-employed) were not reckonable for the State Pension (Transition).<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the conditions and eligibility requirements for State Pension (Transition) were different to and more arduous than those for the State Pension (Contributory).  For example, a person had to have a minimum average of 24 contributions per annum to be eligible for the previous model of State Pension (Transition) whereas an average of 10 contributions per annum is required for State Pension (Contributory) eligibility.  In addition, recipients of the previous model of State Pension (Transition) were not eligible for Free Travel, the Household Benefits Package (electricity, gas, TV licence) or Living Alone Allowance.  Furthermore, the State Pension (Transition) scheme had a retirement condition whereas the State Pension (Contributory) did not.<\/p>  <p>  Since the State Pension (Transition) scheme ceased with effect from 1 January 2014, very significant amendments have been made to the State Pension (Contributory) scheme, including the introduction of the interim Total Contributions Approach and the availability of Homecaring Periods.  As a consequence of these changes, applicants for the State Pension (Contributory) are assessed under the Yearly Averaging system and the interim Total Contributions Approach and awarded on the basis of the calculation that best benefits them.  <\/p>  <p>  While it would be possible to estimate the potential cost of reintroducing the State Pension (Transition) on the exact same legislative basis as it previously existed (which included specific rate-band structures and a yearly average method of payment calculation), it would not be possible to reintroduce it on that basis because of the changes set out above.  Therefore, introducing such a scheme would require significant design changes to the previous State Pension (Transition) to modernise it in line with the Total Contributions Approach method of payment calculation and the availability of Homecaring Periods.  As no such design work has been done, it is not possible to estimate the cost as requested. <\/p>  <p>  In February 2021, I introduced the \"Benefit Payment for 65 year olds\" in line with the Programme for Government commitment, to provide a benefit payment for people who are aged 65 and who are required to retire, or who chose to retire, without a requirement to sign on, engage in activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work.  This new payment was designed specifically to bridge the gap for people who retire from employment or self-employment at 65 years of age but who do not qualify for the State Pension until age 66.<\/p>  <p>The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report was published on 7th   October 2021 and it contained almost 250 pages of analysis, consideration and recommendations. The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers, agendas, minutes, external presentations and submissions in response to an extensive public consultation process are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.   The Commission&rsquo;s work established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed.  It has set out a wide range of recommendations, including in respect of the State Pension Age and early access, and aligning retirement ages in employment contracts with the State Pension age.  <\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government is considering the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare are being considered as part of these deliberations.  I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government in the coming weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  It is clear from the Commission&rsquo;s work that State Pension reform is necessary and it is complex.  It would be a strategic risk not to plan and provide for projected demographic changes, not least in terms of income adequacy for older people.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900066#WRP04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":807,"content":"<p>Question No. 296 answered with Question No. 289.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments","counter":808,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900066#WRP05000"},{"type":"question","counter":809,"qnumday":297,"qnumall":"[25473\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900066#WRP05100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full-year cost of extending the current weekly means testing amount of &euro;120 qualifying to qualify for the fuel allowance by &euro;5 per week.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":810,"content":"<p>The Fuel Allowance is a payment of &euro;33.00 per week for 28 weeks (a total of &euro;924 each year) from October to April, at an estimated cost of &euro;366 million in 2022.

I fully appreciate the strong emotional attachment we all have to our pets and that theft not only leads to their loss in our lives, but also a high level of concern for their welfare. It is also a crime which often affects, and is indeed often targeted against, older and particularly vulnerable people, for whom their pet is of huge emotional importance.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that theft offences already apply to this crime, and can carry very heavy penalties. The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides for a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment in the case of offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment is provided for the offence of possession of stolen property.<\/p>  <p>  When imposing sentence, judges are not limited to considering the monetary value of a pet &ndash; the emotional distress to the victim caused by the offence is absolutely relevant and can be, and is, taken into account where appropriate. However, I acknowledge that the existing offence considers the offence as being one against property rather than a person or an animal and I am committed to examining the options to address the issue, including, if necessary, making legislative changes.<\/p>  <p>  From an enforcement perspective, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes this issue very seriously and has conducted several important actions against those responsible.

The Garda National Crime Prevention Unit's advice on pet safety, which is in line with the advice from animal welfare groups and animal insurance companies about keeping animals safe, can be viewed on the Garda website.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise the importance of microchipping. Every dog must be microchipped by the time it reaches 12 weeks of age, or earlier if it is sold or moved from its place of birth (Microchipping of Dogs Regulation 2015), and the microchip must be registered with an authorised database. Microchipping of all dogs protects the animals&rsquo; welfare, and assists with speedy identification of lost or stolen dogs and their owners. It is an offence to keep a dog over 12 weeks that has not been chipped and it is an offence to sell such a dog. Microchips can be easily checked at vets and by Garda&iacute;. They are by far and away the most effective means of tracking and identifying dogs.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture have also made regulations covering the advertising for sale of animals under the Animal Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pets) Regulations 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900068#WRR02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Travel Documents","counter":903,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900068#WRR02700"},{"type":"question","counter":904,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[25480\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900068#WRR02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding travel documents for a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11; the reason for the delay; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":905,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that Travel Documents are processed by the Travel Documents Unit of my  Department with the assistance of the Passport Office in the Department of Foreign Affairs. <\/p><p>In recent times, the Unit has experienced a very high volume of applications requiring processing and this, along with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, has unfortunately had a negative impact on processing times.

Anyone wishing to practise as a pharmacist in Ireland must first register with the PSI, and the individual must satisfy the regulatory criteria defined in statute for such recognition\/registration in the interest of maintaining the safety and wellbeing of patients utilising pharmacy services. <\/p>  <p>  The PSI operates three routes of recognition\/registration depending on where the pharmacy qualification held by an individual has first been acquired &ndash; the national route, EU route and non-EU (third country qualification recognition - TCQR) route under established processes based in Irish and EU law. The PSI non-EU route of registration is complex, and we understand that the regulator is currently undertaking a process to review it with the aim of having an improved TCQR route in place for January 2023. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s employment permits system is managed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and is designed to supplement Ireland's skills and labour supply by accommodating the arrival of non-EEA nationals to fill skills and labour gaps for the benefit of our economy, in the short to medium term.  This objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one. The system is vacancy led and managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where it is evidenced that there is more than sufficient availability of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market.<\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure the employment permits system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, these lists undergo regular, evidence-based review guided by relevant research, a public\/stakeholder consultation, and the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group and relevant policy Departments, in this case the Department of Health. Account is taken of education and training outputs and known contextual factors such as Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic and the ending of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and their impact on the labour market. <\/p>  <p>  Changes to the employment permit occupations lists are made where there are no suitable Irish\/EEA nationals available, development opportunities are not undermined, genuine skills shortage exists rather than a recruitment or retention problem and Government education, training and economic development policies are supported.<\/p>  <p>  The occupation of Retail Pharmacist is currently eligible for a General Employment Permit for non-EEA nationals wishing to take up employment in the State. The General Employment Permit is the primary vehicle used by the State to attract third country nationals in occupations with remuneration thresholds of generally &euro;30,000.  The General Employment Permit is also subject to a Labour Market Needs Test (LMNT), demonstrating that the employer was unable to fill the position from the Irish and EEA labour market.  However, where the vacancy attracts a salary of over &euro;64,000, an LMNT is not required, and the role may be eligible for the Critical Skills Employment Permit.<\/p>  <p>  The timing of the next Review of the Occupational Lists will be kept under review by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the context of clearing the current employment permits backlog. When open, submissions will be invited from sector representative bodies and interested parties via the Public Consultation Form which will be accessible on the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rsquo;s website.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900070#WRT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":1031,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900070#WRT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1032,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[25590\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900070#WRT04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the annual cost of cleaning and sanitising roofs of buildings under his Department&rsquo;s control for the past five years to date in 2022.","asker":"1489","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1033,"content":"<p>There was no cost during the specified period in relation to my Department's old HQ in Hawkins House.<\/p><p>In respect of Miesian Plaza, my Department is a sub-tenant of OPW, who are the tenant of the Landlord.

For the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency, where the need for social distancing, reducing personal contacts and reducing the burden on medical practitioners are paramount, it became possible for a woman to access a termination under section 12 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 (i.e., before 12 weeks) from her medical practitioner by telephone or video conference consultation.<\/p>  <p>  There is ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE to monitor service provision, facilitate the smooth-running of the service and resolve any issues that may arise.

At the request of the Department, the HSE conducted a review of the Revised Model of Care for Termination of Pregnancy, examining patient safety aspects, with input from service providers in both hospital and community settings.

The establishment of NASCO,  managed by Teagasc, will place Ireland at the forefront of EU carbon sequestration research and underpins my commitment to provide the research and data needed to underpin the development of a carbon farming model that targets and rewards actions that remove carbon and store it in our soils.<\/p><p>In my role as Minister, by working with all relevant partners, I will continue to ensure that opportunities in agri-tech are fully exploited. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900071#WRU05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":1107,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900071#WRU05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1108,"qnumday":403,"qnumall":"[25581\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900071#WRU05700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the annual cost of cleaning and sanitising roofs of buildings under his Department&rsquo;s control for the past five years to date in 2022.","asker":"1489","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1109,"content":"<p>The annual costs associated with cleaning and santising roofs of Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's buildings does not fall under the remit of the Department. <\/p><p>Instead, work of this nature is a matter for the Office of Pub;ic Works (OPW) as non-elective building maintenance is their responsibility.

In support of this, in May 2021 I launched the National Hub Network - connectedhubs.ie.  The National Hub Network currently comprises 232 remote and co-working facilities across the State. These facilities have been onboarded to connectedhubs.ie, the shared online booking and payments platform for member hubs and their users. The network includes a diverse range of hubs, services and facilities, thus facilitating companies of different sizes. It is expected that, in time, the National Hub Network and the connectedhubs.ie platform will include more than 400 facilities. <\/p><p>To date my focus has been on establishing the network and on achieving the initial critical mass. Following strong progress on the establishment phase of the project, my focus has now shifted to the next stage of development. <\/p><p>To this end, my officials have been consulting with hub managers across the country, and with other stakeholders, to better inform the future strategic direction of the National Hub Network and of the connectedhubs.ie platform.  In February I announced the commencement of a major promotional campaign to raise awareness of the Connected Hubs network to relevant stakeholders, including SMEs\/business owners and new hub users.<\/p><p>I have been clear throughout my tenure as Minister for Rural and Community Development that balanced regional development, sustainable and thriving communities, and indeed the wider national economy will all benefit from workers and employers embracing the remote working revolution.<\/p><p>At this stage of the development of the hub sector, particularly in rural areas, there is still a strong focus on the individual remote worker. Pricing plans are constructed with affordability for the worker in mind and bookings are, in general, made by the individual.<\/p><p>However, and as the Deputy will be aware, there are significant opportunities for employers of all sizes to leverage the National Hub Network directly. More workers than ever are expressing a preference for remote work and more employers, noting the strong professional performance of so many remote workers, see their own interests reflected in the those of their employees.<\/p><p>The connectedhubs.ie team have for some time been developing a corporate service to engage with and support corporate clients interested in using our nationwide network to accommodate their employees, but also to gain access to the vast pool of talent that Ireland has to offer, whether those talented people live in our cities, towns, villages or rural parishes. I believe that this work represents another great step forward for the National hub Network. <\/p><p>I am committed to ensuring that the National Hub Network will continue to make a central contribution to the achievement of the Government's vision for rural Ireland, as set out in <i>Our Rural Future<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900071#WRU06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1115,"content":"<p>Question No. 405 answered with Question No. 404.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Schemes","counter":1116,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900072#WRV00300"},{"type":"question","counter":1117,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[25427\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900072#WRV00400","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"her views on whether it is fair that for the purposes of the local improvement scheme that all of Dublin is treated as a city and therefore all local authorities are excluded, along with Cork City Council and Galway City Council, even though vast swathes of north County Dublin within Fingal County Council area are extremely rural areas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1118,"content":"<p>As part of <i>Our Rural Future<\/i>, the Government is committed to ensuring that the Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) is funded into the future.
