It would be helpful to recall that when JobBridge was introduced in 2011, many people were expressing frustration that jobseekers could not take up unpaid work experience opportunities either because they could not afford the expenses associated with going to work or, worse still, because they could lose their entitlement to their jobseeker payment.  That was the situation I inherited.<\/p><p>  In developing JobBridge, considerable care was taken to set conditions that would limit the ability of employers to exploit the scheme.  There is a limit on the duration of internships - six months or nine months - and on the total number of internships that can be offered by an organisation.  Permanent posts cannot be filled by successive use of internships and internships cannot be used to fill a position previously filled by a paid employee.  The scheme is voluntary and all hosts are voluntary.  I stress that all internships are also voluntary and subject to a standard agreement, which sets out the obligations of host organisations, including the provision of training and mentoring.  Care was also taken not  impose an elitist view of an internship as something that was only suitable as a means of accessing so-called professional careers by young graduates.  Many people who are long-term unemployed value the opportunity to prove their ability via a work experience opportunity in occupations that are not the traditional reserve of internships.<\/p><p>  I share the concerns recently expressed regarding the use of JobBridge by schools.  I asked officials in the Department to remove some positions from the JobBridge website for this reason.  Officials were also asked to undertake a review, together with their colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills, of the use of JobBridge by schools.  I understand that this review is close to completion and that new guidelines will shortly issue to schools setting out clearly what is, and is not, acceptable use of the JobBridge scheme.<\/p><p>  We have made similar agreements with a host of other sectors successfully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100005#C00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1413897000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I accept that when there was an outcry, the Department acted and addressed the issues relating to the website but a perusal of the website since then reveals that three advertisements have been placed for teachers, two for caretakers-janitors and 29 for special needs assistants, SNAs.

There continues to be abuse in the filling of jobs, which should be filled by full-time or part-time employees, in particular, teachers who have achieved a qualification.  Schools, despite the opposition of the teachers' unions are using JobBridge to fill vacant teaching positions, which is contrary to the Minister's opening statement that they should not use JobBridge to fill a position previously filled by a paid employee .

In 2013, it dealt with well over 1.8 million telephone calls involving queries across the range of schemes provided by the Department.  That equates to almost 35,000 telephone calls per week.  The particular people involved in this case seem to have been extraordinarily adept at pretending.  They had access to the basic information that is always used when checking whether an inquirer is a legitimate inquirer.  Obviously, they gained access through that.  I was deeply disappointed to hear it is apparent that the clients on behalf of which they were doing this were credit unions.  I understand from some media comment that not all of the credit unions may have been aware that they were giving, or were able to supply, some of this information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100008#F00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413898800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I share the T&aacute;naiste's concern about the conduct of those credit unions.

The Department must continue to ensure that the most cost-effective ways of delivering its services are employed to ensure best value for the taxpayer.  In this regard, an issue for the post office network is that electronic payments are less expensive and many people who have bank accounts or are anxious to use electronic payment mechanisms choose to do so.  I was very happy to sign a new contract with An Post last year for over-the-counter cash services for welfare clients following a public procurement competition.

I would like to know who advised Deputy Coveney at the time on this policy and whether his policy advisers had fully thought through the proposal itself.  When Fine Gael came into Government it hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to advise it on the best way to establish Irish Water in line with its policy.  What is interesting is that the PwC report gave 17 disadvantages as to why the Government should not proceed the way it did in establishing Irish Water as a subsidiary of a State agency, one being less flexibility in establishing the terms and conditions for new members of the workforce and in determining the most appropriate mix.  Another was the level of external support required to plan, manage and execute the integration of Irish Water into an existing utility, and another that multi-utilities tend not to achieve synergies anticipated.

The manner in which the company was established and is being managed and in which the unfair water charges have been imposed has been chaotic and farcical and the Taoiseach misses the main point, which is that the vast majority of people cannot pay.  It is not that they will not pay; they simply cannot pay.  It has emerged that struggling families will be charged &euro;180 for a call-out to fix leaking pipes.  The Taoiseach has dismissed that and said he does not know where that came from.  I checked before I came to the House that he told me on 7 October no bonus would be paid.  The noises from the Government all appear to be about scapegoating the board and senior management team in Irish Water.<\/p><p>  No one was clearer about the creation of the company than the former Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd who said: &quot;It's a mess and it's the Government's mess.&quot;  Will the Taoiseach accept that, as an entity, Uisce &Eacute;ireann is toxic and that it cannot in its present form be left with the responsibility for the deliver of water services in this State?  Does he further accept that Uisce &Eacute;ireann must be fundamentally and radically reformed into a single public utility that acts in the interest of citizens?  Will he acknowledge that the message he got in the by-elections and on the streets of Dublin is that people are against what the Government is doing because they cannot afford what it is calling on them to do?  Fianna F&aacute;il is belatedly calling for a suspension of water charges.  Does the Taoiseach accept that he can do nothing other than abolish this second domestic water charge?

It is clear in the legislation that this entity cannot be privatised and the Deputy should not go around scaremongering that this is an attempt or the beginning of a process to privatise Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  It is beneath him to say that, given he can read the language clearly in the legislation.<\/p><p>  Clearly, the concern about payment is a legitimate concern for everyone and there is a degree of confusion because of the scale of the assistance that is being provided through the tax credit system, the household package and other elements of the social protection system.  I remind the Deputy that what we want to do is ensure every household in the country is given a free allowance through the provision of almost &euro;600 million of a subsidy from the Government to Irish Water.  This was one of the pillars of direction given by the Government to the regulator that children should be free and there should be an average meter charge of &euro;240 per annum or an assessed charge for two plus two of &euro;278.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the regulator has indicated that the assessed charge will continue for nine months from the date of billing next year.  That means, for instance, if people use more water than that to which the &euro;278 charge applies and their bill is less than that, they will pay the lesser amount.  There is an incentive not only to register to avail of the household charge but also to conserve water.  That is an essential part of why Irish Water was set up in the first place.  We need to invest off balance sheet to provide quality treatment works and quality infrastructure in order that people can have high quality drinking water and ensure water is available for business and consumers alike.<\/p><p>  The matter of people ringing Irish Water or councils and not getting an answer is being considered and dealt with by Irish Water and Ervia.  No more than other entities in the past, for example, SUSI and the issue relating to higher education grants and other issues of great concern to people, once they are dealt with and people have answers to their questions, things can calm down.<\/p><p>  This is very important for the future of the people and the economy.

From that point of view, I remind the Deputy that the Minister for Social Protection will introduce a &euro;5 payment per week per child in child benefit to be followed up again next year and the year after, if the Government is re-elected, and, much to his astonishment, the return of a Christmas bonus of 25%, which will be dealt with in the social welfare legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100019#R02300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1413903000,"counter":230,"content":"<p>It would not pay for the turkey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100019#R02400","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1413903000,"counter":231,"content":"<p>What about respite care?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100019#R02500","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1413903000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I refer again to the reasons for setting up Irish Water, which are to deal with the poor infrastructure, the poor quality drinking water in many cases and the poor quality of treatment works.<\/p><p>It is important we fix all these for the next 50 years.

While Irish Water is taking over responsibility for water and waste services, it is not taking over responsibility for surface water, storm water and flooding.  The reason for this is because one cannot charge people for storm water or flooding.  It is not possible to make any money out of doing that, and as flooding is unpredictable, it would be unattractive to a buyer.  The Taoiseach has assured us the service will never be privatised.

Following our meeting, Governor Brown and I both addressed an audience of Irish and US companies, including a significant number of US investors looking to this country for business opportunities.<\/p><p>  More recently, I met briefly with Boston Mayor Marty Walsh at Croke Park during the replayed All-Ireland Hurling Final on 27 September.  Mayor Walsh was in Ireland for the first time since his election earlier this year, primarily to visit his ancestral home in Connemara.  We discussed his visit to Ireland and economic developments in Boston and Ireland.  Mayor Walsh is the first Irish American Mayor of Boston in over 20 years and has been very proactive in seeking to further develop the political, economic and tourism links between Boston and Ireland.<\/p><p>  I also met recently, on 29 September, with the Mayor of Seattle, Mr. Ed Murray, who called to Government Buildings while he was visiting Dublin.  Mayor Murray, whose four grandparents come from Ireland, is a frequent visitor here, and we took the opportunity to discuss the strong links between Seattle and Ireland.  Mayor Murray commented upon issues in Northern Ireland because he was an active personality in Northern Ireland quite a number of years ago.<\/p><p>  As I stated, I intend to make a separate reply to questions about my attendance at the UN Secretary General's climate change summit in September.  Apart from attending and addressing that summit, I used the opportunity during my visit to New York and Rhode Island to promote stronger political, economic and trade links between the US and Ireland.  In New York, I met briefly with President Obama and his wife during a reception that he and Mrs. Obama hosted for the heads of delegation attending the United Nations events.  I did not have bilateral meetings with any other UN leaders during this visit.<\/p><p>  In Rhode Island, I met with senior political representatives at state and federal level, including Governor Lincoln Chaffee and Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse.  This was an important opportunity to engage with political, business and community leaders in Rhode Island to encourage ever-closer trade, investment and tourism links with this country.  I also had the opportunity to meet with members of the Irish-American community from Rhode Island, when I attended an event at the Irish Famine Memorial in Providence, Rhode Island, a very worthy monument.  I did not have any discussions, either in New York or in Rhode Island, concerning Ireland's corporation tax rate.<\/p><p>  I raised the issue of immigration reform and the plight of undocumented Irish in the US at a number of events in New York.  This included an event at the Irish Consulate where I met a group of young Irish representatives from a range of business and cultural networks, and indeed from all over the island of Ireland.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has recently been in the United States to continue our engagement with US politicians on the issue.  It is our intention to keep the US Administration, and politicians on both sides of Congress, fully aware of Ireland's expectations as efforts to reform the US immigration system continue.<\/p><p>  As I stated, I will make a comprehensive reply in the coming weeks in response to a separate group of questions regarding my attendance at the UN Secretary General's summit on climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100021#T02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1413904200,"counter":281,"content":"<p>When the Taoiseach met Governor Brown of California in June, the Governor felt at liberty to indulge in a bit of knockabout comedy at his expense and at the expense of the corporation tax policies of the Irish Government.  He said that if California could have Ireland's corporation tax rate, it would become an independent country.  He said he used to think the Apple corporation was a California company but now realised it is an Irish company.  He made other comments such as those, which were greeted with great guffaws apparently by hundreds of chief executives who were present at the occasion.<\/p><p>  Is it not the case that in terms of the taxation policy the Taoiseach's Government, and Fianna F&aacute;il Governments before it, have engaged in with regard to giving multinational companies huge concessions to abuse the taxation system, to save billions in profits that should otherwise be going into the public sectors of not just Ireland but other countries, where they siphon funds from this country, which is clearly a tax haven for them, the Taoiseach has been found out abroad, having denied it again and again when we made those assertions over the past period of time?  How long more does he believe the Irish Government can continue to deny the obvious in this regard?  In particular, against a background of him attempting now to shake down ordinary people, including poor people, for &euro;300 million in a water tax next year when every 1% extra in corporation tax could bring in &euro;500 million, based on an 8% effective tax rate, and it is generous to acknowledge that they would pay that amount, does he not see the major contradiction in that regard?<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>When elements of big business in California laugh aloud in derision when the Governor of California speaks, is it not time for the Taoiseach to at least admit at home the truth of the situation?

He had to make some very difficult decisions about the economic position of his state, one of the strongest economies in the world.<\/p><p>  The Governor is very well versed in Ireland and its situation.  He is acutely aware of the number of American companies that have invested here and what that means, particularly those from Silicon Valley and other locations in his own state, which have substantial workforces here, as distinct from the perception that they are brass-plate entities.  He did make his comment, as the Deputy says, in a knockabout fashion about the extent of US investment in Ireland.  That was repeated by some European leaders at various meetings I have attended recently about the attractiveness of this country as a location for foreign direct investment.<\/p><p>  The well-known case that was the subject of some discussions in the US Senate concerning Apple, which employs over 4,000 highly-paid skilled workers in Cork, with a strong innovative ethic, was what highlighted this matter in the beginning.  On 11 June this year the European Commission opened formal state aid investigations into certain multinational companies in several EU member states.  In respect of Ireland, the House is aware that the Commission focused on advanced opinions provided to the Apple corporation several years ago which addressed the calculation of the taxable base of profits in the company.  That was a perfectly normal procedure.  More recently, the Commission published the formal letter it had issued in June to the Irish authorities, setting out the opening decision in this case.  This is the next routine procedural step in the state aid investigation.  It is intended to give interested parties the opportunity to submit their comments directly to the Commission.<\/p><p>  The Commission has not formally decided that state aid is involved here.  It is formally examining the case.  The State responded to the detailed letter and addressed the concerns and a number of misunderstandings that were contained in the opening letter of decision issued by the Commission.  The Irish response clarified several important issues about the applicable tax law in this case and explained that the company concerned did not receive selective treatment and was taxed fully in accordance with the law.  <\/p><p>  The inquiry relates to a technical tax issue in respect of one company.  It does not relate to Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax rate or to the Irish corporate tax system generally.  The Commission is not investigating the Irish tax system, the 12.5% corporation tax rate or that there was a special tax rate deal done with the company involved.  Last year the Government abolished the stateless concept in the budget because of perception and reputational damage and has followed through this year with the abolition of the so-called &ldquo;double Irish&rdquo;.  The Government has set out its position which has been accepted by countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, area, by the American Chamber of Commerce, many of the financial houses and entities here as being the right and proper thing to do and will now move to the next step, the consultations necessary to set up an appropriate information box which would allow for the incorporation of intellectual property here at an appropriate rate of tax.  That will be of benefit to Ireland, making it an even stronger location for investment, an even more competitive entity and therefore more attractive for investment from abroad.<\/p><p>  These are some of the areas I discussed with Governor Brown.  He is well-versed in the history of Ireland and the Irish connections with the United States and California.  It might be some time before the European Commission makes its decision on the question of state aid.  The Government is very happy to defend this and it is happy that no state aid applies in the case on which the Commission has issued its formal opening letter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100022#U00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1413904800,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I tabled five questions in this group of ten.  They cover climate change, the undocumented Irish and meetings with the various US mayors.<\/p><p>  Governor Brown is out of order.  I do not accept the American position on this.  We live in a globalised society.  We do not control it from Ireland.  We are not responsible for the global order that now exists, in the free market economy and the prevalence of massive multinational companies that control a great deal of manufacturing and services.  The greatest manufacturing base for Apple is in China, where Foxconn does most of its manufacturing.  In Cork we are fortunate that there is a manufacturing centre, the only one in Europe that manufactures computers and so on.  It also advises the manufacturing entities on processes and so on around the world. <\/p><p>  America seems to have a view that if a company originates there, no matter where it creates its presence around the world and no matter how large that presence, which is huge in China, no matter where it sells its iPads and iPods, all its taxes should go into American coffers only.  That is a mistaken view.  When we consider this objectively there is only so much we can influence and develop.  We need to be very careful because there are 160,000 jobs in foreign direct investment in this country.  The corporate tax rate is very important in securing those jobs, as is certainty about it.  The skills base of the economy is important too and so is the reliability of the workforce, particularly in pharmaceuticals and life sciences for winning Food and Drug Administration, FDA, approval, without which we would not be as strong as we are now.<\/p><p>  The tax issue has been central, together with the fact that we are an English-speaking eurozone country.  When others start to knock it or complain about it there may be merit in some of the complaints but fundamentally they are looking after their own back yard.  It was Timothy Geithner who said the bondholders of Irish banks could not be burned.  That was not in our interests.  It was in the interests of other people and corporations.  We need to go into this with our eyes wide open to the various agendas.<\/p><p>We need to remember that the patent box we are now introducing has been in place in Britain for a number of years.  It has been a significant factor in Britain now being much stronger in attracting inward investment, particularly on the research and development side, compared with ten years ago.  In order to facilitate &quot;inversions&quot;, as they are known, a number of mergers have been proposed recently.  This has irked the United States more than anything we have ever done.  A similar patent box is in place in the Netherlands.  Irish companies have availed of Dutch tax laws.  We know that Luxembourg has its own financial services regime.  France also has its own regime.<br\/><br\/>I am open to transparency across the globe.  I would prefer if global agreement could be reached before we start beating ourselves up incessantly.  I suggest we should be more critical and analytical about what is going on in other jurisdictions across the globe.  I remind the House that many of the jurisdictions with which we are competing are not even democracies.  At least we can have this debate.  Having served as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I know about the kind of kinds of state aids that are being given to prospective companies outside of Europe.  Massive inducements are being given to companies to try to locate various utilities and factories in certain locations.  As a small island nation, we are competing against significant players with significant resources.  We need to have some perspective on the debate.  Thousands of households are depending on a particular form of investment in Ireland.  We should not depend exclusively on it.  Some of the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises has been borne out of foreign direct investment.  In other words, many small and medium-sized companies have developed on the back of foreign direct investment by supplying into companies and developing expertise in areas like project management.  For example, there is a whole range of service companies supplying the life sciences sector.<br\/><br\/>I am all for a broad debate on this issue, but I am not in favour of the unilateral beating up of Ireland by ourselves.  We should not be oblivious to the reality of what is going on across the globe in democracies and non-democracies.  By the way, these issues need to be factored into the transatlantic trade deal between Europe and the United States.  We are putting forward the ideal of free trade across the globe as part of a world free trade agreement, but free trade on whose terms?  We need to consider basic issues like wages, which are $1 a day in many countries.  This contrasts with the basic living standards we provide for in areas like health and welfare.  These are very big issues.  According to some analysts, most developed democracies are now going through a low-wage era.  Middle classes are shrinking in societies with developed economies.  This is putting the whole concept of democracy under threat as well.<br\/><br\/>I appreciate that the Ceann Comhairle has been tolerant as I have been raising these issues.  Does the Taoiseach accept our concerns about a unilateralist approach to this issues?  Does he agree that there needs to be a global agreement?  We have seen how difficult it is to get global agreement on the climate change issue, which is the subject of my first question.  We have had all the rhetoric and all the analysis on climate change.  Some significant players, like the United States, were very slow to come to the table and do what they should have done ten or 15 years ago on the issue of climate change.  I salute previous UK Governments, particularly those led by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, that embraced the idea of developing a policy on climate change and energy.  They were very effective in creating a vision around how they could reorganise society in line with the realities of climate change and energy policy.  It took China, the United States and the other big players a long time to realise the impact of climate change, greenhouse gases and low carbon footprints.<br\/><br\/>I mention all of this to explain why I am sceptical about the capacity of the international order to reach agreement on tax.  On a much more existential issue - the survival of the planet - they have failed to come anywhere near a deal on climate change.  The result has been a worsening of the situation.  That is why I am putting it to the Taoiseach that the Government has been quite lax on climate change over the past three and a half years.  I get no sense of enthusiasm or vision about how we want to reorganise our society in relation to climate change.  I think people are worried about the politics and the electoral consequences of it.  The Government has not adequately engaged with the public on this issue.  There has been an absence of engagement on the transport issue, for example, over the past three and a half years.  That is one of the biggest Achilles heels we have in this country in terms of reaching our targets.  The Taoiseach might let me know when the climate action and low carbon development Bill, the aim of which is to underpin national climate policy, will be introduced.  We have been at it for a long time now.  What level of consolidation will take place after the publication of that Bill?<br\/><br\/>I would like to conclude by asking two questions about the undocumented Irish.  It seems to me that this issue has gone into the sand.  When Senator Schumer was appointed three or four years ago, there was much hope that great things would happen with regard to the undocumented.  As we approach the mid-point of President Obama's second term in office, I do not get any sense that a multilateral change in migration policy that would affect everybody is about to happen.  Has the Government considered pursuing a limited bilateral approach to certain schemes, along the lines of the Australian scheme?  We could have a reciprocal arrangement with the United States that would allow citizens of that country to come here and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  I managed to negotiate one stage of a working holiday agreement with Mr. Negroponte.  This scheme allowed Irish people to go to the United States legitimately to work for a year, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It seems to me that this relates entirely to American politics.  I am not blaming the Irish Government or anybody.  We can all say we will go out there to lobby for the undocumented Irish, but the bottom line is that there will be change if the American domestic political situation dictates that there should be change, and there will be no change if the American political situation dictates there will be no change.  From what I am reading at the moment, I am fairly pessimistic about the prospect of change.  I ask the Taoiseach to comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100022#U00300","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413905400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin for raising a number of important issues.  I have referred to the circumstances in which Governor Brown made his comments.  He is well aware of the situation that applies here in Ireland.  I have been in the Apple plant in Cork on a number of occasions.  It is a huge operation with a workforce of 4,000.  It is at the leading edge of technological development globally.  As I have often pointed out before, the iPhone that comes from Cork, which is where the workers pay their tax, might be sold internationally, where VAT or other taxes might apply.  The intellectual property is vested in California.<\/p><p>  When the European Council discussed the situation that has arisen in recent years, as the technological and digital world has moved so far in advance of the legislative world, there was genuine agreement and enthusiasm about the need for a global response to this problem.  The OECD was mandated to deal with that.  A number of European countries that were reluctant in the past to come on board regarding the global response to base erosion and profit sharing - these countries are well known to the Deputy - are now enthusiastic about doing so.  As the Deputy knows, Ireland is not the only country that is being investigated in an opening position by the European Commission.  A number of other European countries are being investigated.  We are not being picked out here.  Some cases have been publicly highlighted.<\/p><p>  I agree that it is very important for there to be certainty about the rate of tax.  When discussions have taken place at the European Council, at the European Commission and at OECD level, there has never been any mention of any requirement to change the rate of tax.  As has been pointed out by the Government, including by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement, there will be no change in the rate of corporation tax here.  It remains at 12.5%.  That is the position.  The Deputy correctly pointed to the need to provide certainty to the workforces of the companies that are here about the longer-term future of investment and the continuation of employment.  Clearly, when something goes off-patent in the pharmaceutical area, it might not be manufactured to the same extent in the plant for the future.  That is why there is always a conveyor belt under the FDA regulations for the approval of new drugs and new products.<\/p><p>That is something that goes on all of the time.  I would point out that, for instance, Intel as a global company has been here in Ireland for a very long time.  It is only in the past couple of years that it mandated or challenged an Irish engineering group within the plant to develop a chip, which was what it called the Quark chip, which was developed and produced, as distinct from being manufactured, in Ireland.  The intellectual property is obviously vested here in respect of that particular item.<br\/><br\/>The Government, in making its decision in respect of the ending of the double Irish, had a lot of discussion about this.  Quite a number of companies had already come to the conclusion that this was what should be done and what would be the best thing to do.  By doing so in the budget recently, Ireland has again taken up a leading position, and not just a position that leads us into an area of uncertainty or confusion.  We have set out with great clarity the period to 2020.  From 1 January, incorporation for new companies coming here will be required to register in respect of where the company is registered.<br\/><br\/>Obviously, Government has considered also the question of the information box, or patent box as it is called.  Deputy Martin is well aware that there are a number of these that apply in different countries in Europe.  Some are more successful than others.  Some are not wanted by other countries, but the Deputy is quite right, in that Great Britain is now competing, and has been competing for some time, with Ireland for particular industries.  We need to be able to adapt to that in a competitive sense, and we will.  There is a requirement that there be public consultation and quite a deal of discussion about the particular form of information box and the rate at which tax should apply to it for incorporation of intellectual property or whatever here.  That will be led by the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance.  I think that is an important discussion for the next future phase of development in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I would say that, having dealt with all of this, having got rid of the stateless concept and having dealt with the double Irish, and when looking at Ireland's position and the advantages that we have, we have our 12.5% rate.  That will continue to apply, but in addition, we have the advantage of our track record, as Deputy Martin is well aware, over very many years, we have the advantage of being able to measure up to whatever are the technological changes and technological requirements, and over and above both of those we have an extraordinary talent pool when challenged coming through the business world, the academic world and the college of technology world.  Young Irish engineers, as one example, have been able to create and change even the most sophisticated level of engagement by multinationals. That is something that will continue to make us a very attractive and even more competitive location for foreign direct investment, with the opportunity to create jobs and services to supply those industries.<br\/><br\/>The climate change issue is the central point of the European Council meeting on this Thursday and Friday.  There will be, in addition, references to dealing with the Ebola crisis and the financial difficulties that apply in some countries.  I would say that we have had quite a deal of discussion about this at different Cabinet sub-committee meetings.  For me, it is a fact of life that, whatever sources put together the information package that the previous Ministers had to go and deal with in Brussels, it left us and leaves us in a position where the 2020 targets are very difficult to achieve.  If that sort of position were to continue between 2020 and 2030, it would leave whatever Government is here in a very unenviable position of having targets that were set on the basis of, in my view, incorrect or not comprehensive information and would be very difficult to achieve.  The first fine, as the Deputy knows, is &euro;500 million and the second one is &euro;1 billion.  The situation that we were discussing all of last week and this week before we get to the European Council meeting is how can one deal with this in a way that will give Ireland achievable targets up to which we can and want to measure.<br\/><br\/>One of the problems is the problem of success.  For years in this country, we were constrained in what we could produce from the dairy sector in terms of milk and the products that come off that.  Quotas go in 2015.  That will mean a very significant increase in output from the dairy sector in Ireland.  Money has already begun to move through the system for land purchase.  The decision last week to allow longer term leases, the investment in different paddock arrangements for young dairy farmers and the backup for the agricultural colleges mean that people see real opportunities here.  There are real opportunities here.  Investment of &euro;100 million by Kerry Group in Naas and something similar on the Carlow-Kilkenny border by Glanbia mean this is an opportunity, but it brings with it, naturally enough, a higher emission content.<br\/><br\/>The argument being made internationally is that Ireland is a country that is already carbon-footprinting the majority of our dairy sector, one of the first in the world to do so.  We want to continue that.  We are producing high-quality food with great integrity, and we can produce so much more.  We should not be restricted by virtue of the emissions argument from so doing to the detriment of that volume of food, which is produced in other countries with lesser standards and no regard for emissions at all in some cases.  It means that, if one applies the targets to be set on a <i>per capita<\/i>income basis, Ireland would be measuring up in the context of the highest achievers - Germany, Denmark and so on - which would leave us in a very, very difficult position.  What we need is a recognition that, in a country like Ireland, where so much of the percentage of our GDP is produced from the agrisector, this is a part of the process of dealing with food production on the one hand where there is a food shortage internationally and, on the other hand, wanting to meet targets that are practical and achievable for us.<br\/><br\/>That is why the Minister of State and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine have had a lot of discussions about the forestry sector, which, as the Deputy knows, can act as a sump in terms of carbon emissions, and whether it is possible to have that rolled into the process of determining what Ireland's targets for 2020-30 can be.  That is a very difficult argument to get across to other countries and other leaders, in that we produce so much from the agrisector.  I am glad to say some progress has been made on it in the past number of days.  The &quot;agriculture&quot; phrase is coming more and more into focus as to what it can actually mean for a country like Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I do not want to go to the European Council meeting the next day and have real difficulties in the knowledge that the traditional and current progress would land this country in a very difficult position from 2020 to 2030.  I hope the discussions over yesterday, today and tomorrow before we get to the European Council can bring about some clarity on where we can arrive.  We want to measure up to targets, but they have to be targets that are practically achievable.  Given what we can produce for the future from the agrisector, particularly the dairy end of it, we should not be inhibited from being able to continue to produce high-quality food that is very necessary for other nations and millions of people and that Ireland can supply to the very highest standard.<br\/><br\/>Sorry for the long reply, a Cheann Comhairle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100023#V00200","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413906000,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett tabled Questions Nos. 8 and 9 and Deputy Adams tabled Question No. 10.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100024#W00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1413906000,"counter":289,"content":"<p>My questions relate to the issue of corporate tax.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour and Sinn F&eacute;in have all made it clear that they are committed to retaining a low corporate tax regime, supposedly to lure in investment, as a key part of the State's economic strategy.  As the Taoiseach knows, a small minority of Deputies question this attitude.<\/p><p>I wonder how the Taoiseach will respond to allegations that are now circulating widely regarding the much-trumpeted ending of the so-called &quot;double Irish&quot;.  When its ending was first mooted in the finance committee, members initially were told this could not be done because Ireland could not act unilaterally but the Government is now trumpeting the fact that it has acted unilaterally to close off this tax scam.  However, the allegation now circulating widely internationally is that the Government is simply replacing one tax scam with another in the form of the so-called patent box.  I subscribe to this view but would like to hear the Taoiseach's response.  For example, Nicholas Shaxson, the well-respected expert on the area of corporate tax avoidance has described the United Kingdom as a rogue state for its deployment of the so-called patent box system and has described it as an instance of naked capitalism in which states do everything they possibly can to reduce the tax burden on enormously profitable corporations.  I put it to the Taoiseach that he is right.  The &quot;double Irish&quot; was a scam that centred critically around the way in which profits were allocated by multinationals in the area of intellectual property.  The Government reportedly closes off the &quot;double Irish&quot; and then sets up a new mechanism for corporations to reduce their tax obligations, precisely in the area of intellectual property.  What is to stop such companies doing exactly what they have been doing up until now, that is, allocating vast amounts of their profits into this area of intellectual property, thereby artificially inflating its value to reduce their tax liability?  This is what they have done thus far and there is no reason to believe they will do anything different under this patent box system.  The evidence is this is precisely what they intend to do.<br\/><br\/>Is the Taoiseach aware <i>The Irish Times<\/i>is now reporting on a discussion that apparently has been going on in the French media for a few days to the effect that Google is now thinking of closing its Bermuda operation and moving everything to Dublin?  This is extraordinary when one considers that Google's Bermuda operation is a brass plate designed to avoid tax.  Its response to the so-called closing off of the &quot;double Irish&quot; is to recognise that Ireland is a better tax haven than Bermuda under the proposals the Taoiseach has now outlined.<br\/><br\/>Extraordinarily, these proposals in the first instance give four years to multinationals engaged in massive tax avoidance in which to work out new schemes and scams to avoid paying tax and after that four-year period, when they have been able to re-engineer their tax avoidance plans and policies, there will be something akin to treasure at the end of the rainbow in the form of this patent box system, which yet again will allow them to use the value of intellectual property to avoid paying tax.  Does the Taoiseach not accept this is extraordinary, in the context of meeting President Obama and so on, when at the heart of the world's capitalist system even they are demanding that multinationals pay a bigger contribution from their enormous profits in tax while Ireland is being embarrassed and humiliated at an international level for acting as a tax haven?<br\/><br\/>Moreover, instead of responding seriously by following an ethical policy in this matter and agreeing that Ireland should join in the increasing chorus of voices who find it obnoxious and obscene that vastly profitable multinationals should pay a lower proportion of their profits in tax than do ordinary workers, who pay approximately three to four times as much of their incomes proportionately in tax than do such multinationals, and five or six times as much in some cases, the Government, joined by the main Opposition parties, appears to be seeking and up to now has sought to continue to facilitate such corporate tax avoidance.  Is this not shameful when Ireland, at the very least, should insist that such corporations pay something approximating the proportion of their profits in tax as does the ordinary worker?  I believe they should pay more but would even this not be fair?  Instead, the Government is facilitating further tax avoidance and is giving them the chance for four years to work out how they can avoid tax again under the new regime and at the end of that period is providing a new scheme for them to do precisely that, namely, the patent box.  Is this not shameful?<br\/><br\/>As for the climate change discussions, in his response to Deputy Martin, the Taoiseach mentioned the issue of forestry and its role as a carbon sink and in ameliorating climate change.  I have had lengthy discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, on this matter because I strongly believe - and the Minister of State agrees - that to date, the State has underperformed spectacularly in terms of afforestation.  This is a State in which the conditions for growing trees are more favourable than anywhere else in Europe but in which each year, we miss our afforestation targets by a long mile.  These targets are missed when afforestation could be critical in helping us to meet climate change targets and to generate employment in spin-off industries, as well as deriving all kinds of value from tourism and amenity value and in developing renewable and sustainable energy.  Although this is the case on so many different fronts, we are underperforming spectacularly in this area.  It appears to me to be a matter of urgency, from every point of view, that something be done about this.  Did the Taoiseach discuss this matter during his discussions on climate change and what are his views on it?  For example, the McCarthy report identified that Coillte has half a million acres that it cannot afforest and which are doing nothing but gathering dust.  The company states it either does not have the resources to invest in this land or that it would not be commercially viable from the narrow commercial model that Coillte operates.  However, there are communities, co-operatives and environmental groups that would be very glad to get hold of some of that land to grow their own trees with all the positive benefits for local communities, climate change and all the rest of it.  Is the Taoiseach thinking about this issue seriously, because this area has not being taken seriously to date?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100024#W00300","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413906600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, I do not accept that the country is either being embarrassed or humiliated in respect of corporate tax or corporate investment here from foreign direct sources for the creation of employment.

The Deputy should talk to those concerned and they will tell him that despite the fact that Ireland has a solid rate of tax, other matters are added on to this, particularly the talent pool available to multinational companies coming in here.  However, the Deputy has been clear and consistent in his arguments in this regard.<\/p><p>  There is no question of Ireland being involved or wishing to be involved in tax scams or tax havens.  Last year, the Government abolished the stateless concept because of reputational damage and at the behest of the Government, Ireland now has taken the decision to end the &quot;double Irish&quot;, to have clarity until the end of 31 December 2020 and to have a new regime of incorporation for new companies from next year.<\/p><p>We must also consider the nature and appropriateness of what kind of information patent box we put in place here.  Some of those that apply around Europe have different characteristics and what we want is one that is appropriate for our needs.  That means we want to continue to be attractive for companies which may well wish to incorporate their intellectual property facilities here as well as their headquarters.  As I have said to the Deputy on many occasions previously, we like to see that the plates that announce the name of a company are backed by a substantial number of workers who pay their tax here and if companies wish to avail of incorporating their intellectual property here also, we will have an appropriate information patent box that applies in that regard.  That consultation, public discussion and otherwise will take place and will be led by the Minister for Finance.  The Deputy will also be aware that we abolished the research and development credit base year, as it is called, and we enhanced the special assignee relief programme for companies which wish to bring in people of a specialist nature here.<\/p><p> I completely agree with the Deputy that we have absolutely under-performed in terms of forestry and the plantation of trees in this country for very many years.  I come from the location where the first Minister with responsibility for forestry, the late Joseph Blowick, came from and he started off little forestry locations for seedlings, small trees and all the rest of it.  God knows there is much ground in the far west that cannot grow forestry because of either the salt content or the poor quality of the soil.  The Deputy may be aware that many of the forests that were planted in an attempt to grow spruce or whatever other species failed because of a lack of depth of soil and other geographical circumstances.<\/p><p> The Government decided not to sell off Coillte.  The Minister of State present is actively involved in discussions on an enhanced forestry programme, which will be published before too long, and which will include many incentives for people to get involved in forestry and to plant land that might not be beneficial for high quality dairy produce or whatever.  We hope that can improve the position.  Real incentives are being provided by Government to help individuals or companies with ground that might be suitable for planting.  It is not commercially viable in many cases to plant ground that has very poor potential for tree growing.  That is an issue that is the focus of some consideration here.<\/p><p> The closing down of the double Irish concept will not raise any additional Irish tax here.  The decision was made genuinely to protect and enhance Ireland's international tax reputation.  As it stands, an Irish registered, non-resident company is already taxable in Ireland in respect of any activities that it undertakes in Ireland through a branch or an agency.  The discussion will now move to the point of what is the most appropriate information patent box that can apply to Ireland.  As Deputy Martin rightly pointed out, we need to be able to compete for the incorporation of intellectual property or whatever with other countries and it is important that we have clarity and certainty about that, and that discussion will take place in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100025#X01400","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413907200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>An Teachta Boyd Barrett asserted that the main Opposition parties had a tolerance for corporation tax avoidance and I want to put it on the D&aacute;il record that Sinn F&eacute;in is against corporation tax avoidance.  If my recollection is correct, it was first raised here by our finance spokesperson, Deputy Pearse Doherty.  I have raised it with the Taoiseach many times, not least because it robs people in the developing world of much needed tax revenue as well as citizens in this State.<\/p><p>  The question I wish to raise relates to the undocumented Irish in America and what the Taoiseach has been doing about that.  With the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence, I want to tease out the relationship between this State and the Irish abroad.  I am glad the Taoiseach raised the issue with Governor Brown and made remarks on this issue in New York, which I noted at the time.  Any time I go there, and I am sure the same is the case for others, including especially the Taoiseach, I meet the undocumented.  Most of them are people who were forced to leave here and those who want to stay there want to be able to pay their taxes.  They are law-abiding.  They want to contribute to society and they also want to be able to travel back home when they need to, whether it be for an all-Ireland final, the tragedy of a family bereavement or for a more joyous occasion such as wedding or a christening, but they cannot do that.  Despite the efforts of Ciaran Staunton and others and the whole constituency of activism around emigration reform, it has stalled in Congress.  I was present at the Speaker's Lunch when the Taoiseach raised this issue in a very upfront way.  What plans does the Government have to progress this issue in the upcoming period?<\/p><p>  I note from the Taoiseach's remarks that he met a wide range of young people from all over Ireland.  In terms of the notion of developing a relationship with the Irish abroad, and in this case in the USA, did the Taoiseach raise with those young people, for example, the fact that the Constitutional Convention has voted in support of granting a vote to the Irish diaspora as well as to people in the North?  The Taoiseach will know that An Teachta Crowe and myself have introduced a constitutional (amendment) Bill 2014 to give legislative form to the Constitutional Convention recommendation.  Did the Taoiseach have a chance to explore this?  We have a duty of care to these people and they are mostly young people.  It is not their fault that they are where they are.<\/p><p>  I want to acquaint the Taoiseach with what I found to be an interesting experience.  I visited the direct provision centre in Mosney.  Some people have been there for ten years.  It is a pitiful existence, no matter how attractive the accommodation may be or any of the rest of it.  It is a very inhumane system.  It institutionalises people and it damages their mental health.  It forces idleness upon them.  Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Councillor Eimear Ferguson and myself met a wide range of people.  Quite a few of them said that if the Irish in America were being treated the way they are being treated here, we would be raising that issue.  They said that they just want to work and they want to contribute to Irish society.  One young woman told us that she had her status but could not leave the place.  She had been there for so long that she could not go out into the community and develop herself because she had been stuck in that place for eight or nine years of her life.  Those people raised a pertinent point.  They said that if our people were being treated in the United States or anywhere else in the way they are being treated here, we would be raising this issue to the high heavens.<\/p><p> I know this is an issue close to the Taoiseach's heart.  As we campaign for rights for our folks in the US and other countries, will the Taoiseach commit the Government to finding a resolution for the new Irish who are living in direct provision centres?  Mosney is one of the better ones; in the hostels people do not have much privacy.  Will the Taoiseach undertake to protect their humanity?  The very rights we are seeking for our folks in the United States should be afforded to people who have come here for exactly the same reason as our people have gone to the United States of America.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100026#Y00200","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1413907200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I take the Deputy's point that his party is opposed to corporation tax avoidance.

More than likely, nothing will happen before the elections in America in the next couple of weeks.  We had all believed there was an impetus on both Republican and Democrat sides to do something about this before the mid-term elections but it will not happen now.<\/p><p> In the very brief engagement I had with President Obama, I wanted to say it was imperative that people have an opportunity to travel home.  The Deputy pointed that out.  There will either be renewed impetus from Congress or there will not.  The US President has said he intends to take executive action himself.  If he decides to do so, as is his right as President, it may not be as comprehensive as people would wish.  From an Irish perspective, however, it is fundamental that people who have decided to live in the United States have an opportunity to travel to Ireland and back again.<\/p><p> I opened a family hospice room in a local hospital in the west yesterday.  One facility it has had to install was a big screen for people Skyping people in America who cannot come home when someone is dying or has passed away.  This was an unfortunate thing to have to do.  A choice must be made between coming home for a funeral, with the result that one cannot go back, and talking on the screen to family and loved ones.  These are the choices that are being made every day.  Some 30,000 people die in Ireland every year and, obviously, a number of their families are undocumented in the United States.  This is a very sensitive and personal issue for Irish people.

Obviously, he is encouraged to do what he can to assist us here.  Ambassador Anderson is very active in Washington with the immigration reform groups in dealing with public representatives on both sides on Capitol Hill.  We commend all those who do this work.<\/p><p>  I spoke to young people at an event in the Irish Consulate.  There were approximately 100 present from the North and South.  I was most interested in hearing their views on why they went to the United States and whether it was their intention to stay there.  Opinion was evenly divided among them.  Some said they have been in the United States for three years and while they have got on very well and gained a lot of experience they are going back.  Others said they believed they would choose to stay there as they like what they are doing and have many opportunities and the ability to travel to and from Ireland as they please.  Deputy Adams should note that some in this group were undocumented.  Obviously, there are others in the United States who have a very different view from them.  Those from both the North and South were excited about a job in America and the opportunities that country can bring, yet some said they would just spent two or three years there and go home.<\/p><p>  Minister of State Deputy Deenihan is working on a paper on the diaspora, as is the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government arising from the report of the Constitutional Convention on this subject.

Nobody should be here for ten years waiting for an answer.  The group set up under Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, including all the relevant representatives, is to produce a report, and I look forward to seeing it.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has commented on this and Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, is interested in it.  Central is the question of how one makes an expeditious decision on an asylum claim.  It can be very difficult with claimants from some countries because of language, corruption and such matters.  I have dealt with a number of these matters in the past.

International leaders have been slow to ramp up the necessary humanitarian support in order to combat the crisis emanating from West Africa.  In this instance the authorities appear to be failing to act to combat the spread of the virus.  If the international community had acted in a co-ordinated and concise manner at the beginning of this outbreak, I believe we would not be witnessing the current situation.<\/p><p>  Deaths have occurred in Spain and in Germany, bringing the threat of an outbreak even closer to home.  The warning from the head of the UN mission for Ebola emergency response, Anthony Banbury, that the disease is, &quot;winning the race&quot;, is extremely worrying and highlights the need for a comprehensive humanitarian response plan from the European Union and from the rest of the international community.  Europe has always acted in a much speedier manner than other parts of the international community but it needs to do more.  Furthermore, the fact that the Irish Medical Organisation has expressed concern about Ireland's contingency plans in the event of an Ebola case, is something which should concern us.  <\/p><p>  Last week, the assistant director general of the World Health Organisation, Dr. Bruce Aylward, stated that the fatality rate of Ebola has reached 70%.  He stated that this is a high mortality disease and that the UN health agency is still focused on trying to isolate sick people and provide treatment as early as possible.  It is important to note that previously the WHO had said that the death rate was around 50%.  Dr. Aylward stated that if the response to the Ebola crisis is not stepped up within 60 days, a lot more people will die and a very great effort will be required to deal with the spiralling number of cases.  He added that in the past four weeks there have approximately 1,000 new cases per week, although this figure includes suspected, confirmed and probable cases.  <\/p><p>  Given the background which I have outlined I sought this Topical Issue matter and I am pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock is taking it.  I compliment him on his visit to West Africa.  Our former colleague, Barry Andrews, is chief executive of GOAL and he stated that the Minister of State's visit was very important and very useful.  He and his colleagues in the different non-governmental organisations appreciate that support.<\/p><p>  This matter was discussed during Question Time almost two weeks ago.  It is important that the Minister of State has this further opportunity to outline the response.  I ask what protocols have been put in place to ensure that Irish NGO workers travelling to Africa have the proper equipment and training to tackle the crisis.  I ask the Minister of State to outline what will be the arrangements for them on their return to this country.  Our aid workers travelling to Africa to help combat this disease should be commended for their bravery and their selflessness and should be supported with the best possible equipment and training.  I listened to presentations from GOAL and from Doctors Without Borders at the joint committee a number of weeks ago.  They provided the committee with details of the huge suffering and hardship that so many communities are experiencing, in particular in three countries in West Africa.<\/p><p>  I commend the Minister of State on his visit to the region and I hope that the statement from the Foreign Ministers Council meeting yesterday will result in Europe having a better co-ordinated plan and greater co-operation between member states.  It was disappointing to hear that the level of funding provided by EU member states and by the European Union as a whole, is not adequate.  The British Foreign Secretary has suggested that the &euro;500 million committed by the member states and the European Commission needs to be doubled.  I ask the Minister of State to say whether Ireland intends to propose at the heads of government meeting later this week that the European Union and the rest of the international community should provide without further delay the necessary resources to tackle this very serious outbreak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100030#CC00200","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1413909600,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Smith for raising this issue and I thank him for his kind words.<\/p><p>  It is appropriate to have this discussion on Ebola today, given the rapid deterioration in the situation in West Africa over the past month and with cases appearing elsewhere in the world.  This debate is particularly timely, given that the Ebola crisis was discussed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting yesterday and will be discussed at the European Council later this week.<\/p><p>  The latest World Health Organisation figures are alarming - well over 9,000 people infected by Ebola, and over 4,500 deaths in West Africa.  Despite all the efforts of the international community, the likelihood is that the situation will deteriorate further before it improves.  I met Mr. Banbury when I was in Freetown in Sierra Leone.  He indicated to us that the crisis would get worse before it gets better.  Ireland has been very actively engaged at all levels in addressing the crisis on the ground and internationally.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, I travelled to Sierra Leone at the start of the month and witnessed at first hand the devastating impact of Ebola there.  I came away from my visit with three strong impressions.  There was a key gap in leadership and co-ordination, which I am glad to say is now being filled by the UN emergency Ebola mission, UNMEER, headed by Mr. Nabarro and co-ordinated by Mr. Banbury.  There remains important funding needs and this has been recognised in yesterday's motion at the Foreign Affairs Council.  There is a need to scale up capacity for isolation and treatment.  There is an urgent need for more international health care professionals to staff the isolation and treatment centres.<\/p><p>  Ireland is one of a very small number of EU member states with an embassy in Freetown.  I was struck during my visit by the very strong advocacy and co-ordination role being played by the Irish ambassador-designate, Ms Walsh, and her small and dedicated team.  Ireland is working closely with international partners and others, including the US and the UK and the government of Sierra Leone, in the fight against Ebola.  The question of co-ordination is a key issue if the Ebola virus is to be tackled effectively in the West Africa region and if its spread to other countries is to be prevented.  This was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg yesterday which was attended by the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  The Council's decisions yesterday represented an important further step in EU efforts to tackle the crisis by reaffirming the need to work together in a co-ordinated way and to pool our strengths.<\/p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that as a result of visiting Sierra Leone it is my view that Ireland must use its influence at the United Nations and through the European Council to support the need for a pan-European or strong EU response to this crisis.  The bilateral response is a powerful one but it is not sufficient to tackle the nature of this crisis.  There is a clear need for health workers and other key personnel to be represented on the ground.  The Council meeting yesterday recognised the need to support international health responders.  It agreed that the EU will provide appropriate care for them, including the possibility of medical evacuation if necessary. <\/p><p>We must now work urgently to ensure it is implemented in full.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100030#CC00300","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413910200,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  In his latter comments, the Minister of State said the EU will provide support for medical evacuation.  I presume this will be done for citizens of all member states of the European Union, because I do not think we would have the capacity or aircraft necessary to carry out a medical evacuation.<\/p><p>  There have already been more than 4,500 deaths in west Africa from this particular virus.  Yesterday in Strasbourg, the Commissioner for International Co-operation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response spoke about the possibility of 10,000 new cases of Ebola per week by mid-December.  This is really frightening, when we consider that at present the World Health Organization's figure is 1,000.  Surely this statement by a member of the European Commission demonstrates the need for the European Union to double the funding level and commitment made available to date.<\/p><p>  A particular issue which may be more relevant to the Minister for Health, who is with us this afternoon, is a statement by the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine that it is not reassured by Department of Health and HSE claims of full preparedness should the virus reach our shores.  This issue needs to be addressed, and I hope the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, will be able to deal with it in a public statement.<\/p><p>  I compliment the people who have gone out to work in extremely difficult circumstances.  I also compliment the officials from the Department working in the region, all of the Irish NGOs and our colleagues from every country who are working against the tide to try to bring some semblance of normality to communities which have lost everything.  I heard a representative from an NGO of another country state that perhaps the true level of deaths is not being recorded due to the nature of the virus and the fact many people are losing their lives in very remote communities.  Does the Minister of State share this worry?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100031#DD00200","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1413910200,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I can only speak for Sierra Leone.  I concur absolutely with the Deputy on his remarks on the efforts of the NGOs.  The work done by GOAL, Concern, Plan and other agencies is extremely effective.  The Irish Government's response is that we need to be flexible in our approach and Irish Aid, which is very close to the NGO community, is being allowed to pivot towards the Ebola response.  The big concern I have as Minister of State with responsibility for official development assistance is we must be mindful of the fact that we need to ensure we do not spark a humanitarian crisis in all of this.  The nutrition programmes being delivered need to continue apace.<\/p><p>  Instinctively, I think the Deputy is right about the underreporting.  It is only a matter of weeks since I was there, and it was at that juncture the UN had come to Sierra Leone in particular.  Now that Mr. Banbury has been appointed as co-ordinator, our ambassador is working very closely on liaising with the Sierra Leone Government to ensure we assist in building the infrastructure to treat people medically on the ground, and this response is happening.  It is a fair assumption that where there was no international involvement until relatively recently, and instead reliance on the Sierra Leone departments of health, social welfare or education to deliver programmes with the NGOs, there was a certain lack of capacity and the NGOs were punching above their weight.  Now we have international co-ordination and various governments have responded proactively.<\/p><p>  I agree absolutely the European response needs to be rapid.  The resolution yesterday, arising from the Luxembourg meeting, is significant because it recognises for the first time the need to ensure we protect health workers who go out there.  A live issue we were dealing with when I was there was the need to ensure local Sierra Leonean health workers were paid, because they had not been paid for quite a period of time.  It is difficult to expect an Irish or Spanish health worker to go there if the Sierra Leonean health workers are not being paid and are staying away.  There was a strike at one stage.  These are the issues we are dealing with.  We are very effective and making solid progress on these issues.  I agree the international response needs to be more proactive, but for our part as members of the European Union we have had an influence in bringing this to bear, in terms of our interventions through the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, at the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday.  We are keeping a daily watch on this because we want to ensure where possible cases are dealt with medically within the region.  This is the most effective way of dealing with cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100031#DD00300","speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Inspections","time":1413910200,"counter":418,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100031#DD00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1413910200,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I welcome the presence of the Minister for Health.  I wish to speak about a report on the HIQA website on the inspection of homes for the elderly.  I praise HIQA for the tremendous commitment and dedication of its staff who always work, as they must, within the law.  In the year about which I am speaking, more than 500 individual investigations into various homes were conducted with regard to inspection reports.  A serious legal anomaly has arisen, as more than 350 written or verbal complaints were received by HIQA relating to more than 213 homes, but none of them could be investigated directly by HIQA because the law does not allow it to do so.  The list of issues raised in these complaints includes elder abuse, financial abuse, verbal, physical and sexual abuse of residents, dementia patients with fractured ribs, patients being unwashed, a 90 year old patient freezing cold, broken furniture and, specifically, reference is made to a number of deaths from septicaemia and at least seven other deaths.  At present, HIQA cannot investigate these.<\/p><p>  I will give a sample of some of the individual complaints.  A resident died due to staff not being trained properly and poor quality of care.  A doctor called did not visit the actual patient.  Another doctor stated the patient had a slight chest infection, but on arrival at hospital the person had severe pneumonia and dehydration and died.  Forms were updated in the office by three members of staff after the admission to hospital.<\/p><p>  A male patient was calling for help with two bare legs over his bed rails.  After ten minutes a staff member closed the door on him and did not help.  The poor man died with unexplained marks on his hand.<\/p><p>  In another home a resident suffering from Alzheimer's was not looked after properly.  No verbal communication took place with her and she was not called by her name.  Occasionally she was covered in excrement, on the toilet with a pillow behind her, weak and unable to sit up.  She ate meals with excrement on her hands.  Although she was vomiting and ill, no ambulance was called.  A family member brought her to hospital where she subsequently died.<\/p><p>  There are other issues involving unresolved elder abuse and a staff nurse resigned as a result.  There has been intimidation of residents.  Residents have been left on commodes for four hours or more.  There are also cases of residents being scared and in fear.  Complaints have not been listened to.  Residents have been on commodes at 4.30 a.m.  Dementia patients have been given breakfast on commodes.<\/p><p>  Professor Des O'Neill, who inquired into the appalling abuse at Leas Cross, found deficient care at many levels.<\/p><p>There was an inadequate number of trained staff and he found that the charge of institutional abuse was proved against Leas Cross.  He made two important recommendations - he made 11 in all.  The minimum number of staff should be defined nationally and the nursing needs need to be assessed by a nursing needs assessment tool, with which I am sure the Minister is very familiar.  On the question of nurses, nurses with qualification in gerontology were absolutely essential to ensure residents of homes were properly and well looked after.<\/p><p> In summary, the charge is that we have failed to change the law enough to allow HIQA to do the excellent job it wants to do.  I understand from HIQA that a simple amendment to the Health Act 2007 would allow it to go in and challenge each of these individual complaints.  That is the very least we can do to protect our elderly residents in these nursing homes for which they pay an absolute fortune.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100031#DD00400","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413910800,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has responsibility for nursing homes.  I thank Deputy O'Dowd for raising this matter in the House.<\/p><p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is the independent authority established under the Health Act 2007 to drive continuous improvement and to monitor safety and quality in Ireland's health and personal social care services.  Since 2009 all nursing homes - public, voluntary and private have been registered and inspected by HIQA.  The Government also extended HIQA's function to residential services for those with disabilities and child-protection services.  In addition, we are committed to introducing a regulatory system for home-care services, making them subject to registration and inspection by HIQA, on which work has already commenced.<\/p><p>  As regulator, HIQA's remit is to inspect facilities and services rather than investigate individual complaints.  Nursing home operators must ensure all reasonable measures are taken to protect residents from all forms of abuse.  They must have policies and procedures in place for the prevention and detection of, and the response to abuse.  Furthermore, operators must notify HIQA of any allegation of abuse or serious adverse incidents that occur in a nursing home.<\/p><p>  All nursing homes are required to have an accessible and effective complaints procedure of their own, including an appeals process.  They must investigate all complaints promptly and following investigation, put in place any measures required for improvement.  They must keep a record of complaints made, and this record must be available for inspection enabling HIQA when it carries out an inspection to determine whether the nursing home's complaints system is sufficiently robust.<\/p><p>  In addition to this, HIQA takes into account and uses all information received, to inform and plan its regulatory activity.  Information on individual cases can provide useful pointers in this regard.  HIQA's programme of scheduled and unannounced inspections helps to ensure standards are maintained and where issues of non-compliance arise, that these are addressed and rectified.  The Department of Health, in consultation with HIQA and service providers, is working to improve and update the requirements that apply to nursing home care.<\/p><p>  Lest there be any concerns about this I want to clarify that with public HSE nursing homes, people can make a complaint through the HSE complaint system.  If they are not happy with the HSE complaint system, they can go to the Office of the Ombudsman for an independent complaint.  Private nursing homes are supposed to have in place their own complaints procedure and to have an appeals mechanism.  For both public and private nursing homes a complaint about elder abuse can be made directly to the HSE.  The HSE's elder abuse services have 30 senior case-workers who work on exactly that.<\/p><p>  HIQA's role is different.  Currently HIQA's role is not to deal with individual complaints but to be a regulator and inspectorate.  Any change to that role would not be a simple amendment; it would be a major change in the role of that organisation and would require it to be resourced very differently from now in addition to a change in legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100032#EE00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1413910800,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply but I do not accept what he is saying is accurate.  HIQA has sought powers from the Oireachtas and from the Department of Health and has addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children on getting increased powers of inspection, particularly regarding the complaints it receives.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge that the Minister's answer is what he has been given.  However, the facts are that none of these complaints has been investigated.  It is not good enough for anybody to say - I am not personalising this to the Minister - that if a person is not happy he or she can go to the Information Commissioner.  Someone who believes his or her relative - who might be dying - has been abused or is being treated appallingly expects HIQA to act.  My point is that HIQA wants to act.  It wants to do it and is ready to do it.  It assures me there is no question of staff complement.  There is no issue about qualified staff to go in.  However, it has to deal with the issues it finds there.  It is the licensing authority for a nursing home.  If following a written complaint, including by e-mail, or an oral complaint its inspectors cannot go into that home and see what happened to Johnny Murphy, how Mary Murphy died, what is happening with dementia care or what are the qualifications of staff, we will have a repeat of what happened in Leas Cross.<\/p><p>  I appeal to the Minister to listen to what I am saying and to talk to representatives of HIQA.  He should read what they said on the record at the Oireachtas committee about the power it needs to protect the elderly.  That is a sacred duty for all of us.  There can be no avoiding that.  There can be no saying, &quot;It's not me; go to somebody else.&quot;   As I have said there have been more than 352 complaints, many of them about serious issues where people have died.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this when he returns to his Department.  I intend to continue to pursue this matter.  If it means I have to introduce legislation, I will do that to ensure that all these complaints are dealt with immediately and urgently to protect the elderly from abuse.  That is our sacred duty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100032#EE00300","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1413910800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I clarify once again.  If it is a public nursing home, complaints can be made to the HSE, using its complaints procedure or subsequently to the Ombudsman if people are not happy with that.  For private nursing homes, complaints have to be made through the private nursing home's own complaints procedure or through the appeals procedure if people are not happy with that.  If it is elder abuse, regardless of where it is, complaints can be made to the HSE.  It is not the role of HIQA currently to investigate individual complaints.<\/p><p>  I must ask whether these complaints have been made through the appropriate channels.  Have these complaints been made to the HSE and have these complaints been made to the private nursing homes themselves?  I would be concerned if they have not been investigated.  However, the fact that they have not been investigated by HIQA, which does not investigate individual complaints, is a very different point from saying they have not been investigated at all.  Perhaps the Deputy might clarify that.  Is he claiming that they have not been investigated at all or just that they have not been investigated by HIQA, which does not have the authority to investigate individual complaints in the first place?<\/p><p>  In my meetings with representatives of HIQA, they have not requested this power.  I will check with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, if they have done so in their meetings with her.  If they request it and they can assure me it does not require additional resources and it is willing to take on that existing role from the HSE, from the Ombudsman and from the private nursing homes and the existing appeals procedures, then I am happy to give that full consideration.<\/p><p>  Lest anyone thinks otherwise, I want to clarify that the fact that HIQA does not investigate independent individual complaints does not mean they are not investigated.  HSE nursing home complaints should go to the HSE and if people are not happy with that, they go to the Ombudsman.

It also advised those seeking medical attention to visit their GPs instead of presenting at the emergency department.<\/p><p>  In addition - reminding us just how understaffed and under-resourced that hospital is - the statement went on to explain that all those who were due for a planned admission as an inpatient at the hospital were being asked to phone the hospital beforehand so that staff could confirm the availability of a bed in advance of their arrival.  If ever one needed further evidence that Letterkenny General Hospital is struggling to cope with the demands placed on it, this latest crisis should provide all the necessary proof.<\/p><p>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn and I have repeatedly raised the issue at the heart of the hospital's crisis.  It is not surprising when one takes into account that management was forced to release a statement regarding the provisions afforded to the hospital compared with other major hospitals in the State.<\/p><p> Every year the hospital has on average 21,000 inpatient discharges, that is, patients who pass through its doors seeking treatment.  To put that in context, LGH is the seventh largest hospital in the State, yet, despite this, it has still not been given regional hospital status nor has the facility been given the additional resources it desperately needs to appropriately serve the people of the north west.  Based on the inpatient discharge numbers, LGH not only has the lowest budget allocation in comparison to other hospitals with a similar case mix, it also has the lowest allocation of medical staff.  As a consequence, the hospital is forced every year - sometimes a number of times a year due to the failure to provide it with the necessary staff - to appoint an unnecessarily high volume of agency staff to deal with demand, something which is extremely costly for an institution with an overstretched budget.  When HSE officials appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts, there was a discussion on the five vacant consultant posts in LGH.  The hospital pays &euro;110,000 through the HSE for those posts on a locum basis every 13 weeks.  The cost of recruiting a full-time consultant would be approximately &euro;110,000, yet the hospital is forced to pay &euro;444,000 for the same post.  We understand that five of these positions are filled in this way and not just one.  In addition, agency staff fill other positions in the hospital.  <\/p><p> It is clear from the national employment monitoring unit, which publishes health statistics, that the hospital is being disadvantaged in the context of the number of medical dental staff, nursing staff and agency staff per 1,000 inpatient discharges and in the allocation of funding.  Given the resources available, how can the Minister ensure that next week, next month and next year patients who need to access the accident and emergency department are not asked to tune into Highland Radio, Radio na Gaeltachta or Ocean FM to be told by management not to attend and to visit their general practitioner and to be told that if they have a scheduled appointment, for which they may have had to wait for a long time, they may not have a bed for them?  This is not suitable for patients in Donegal.  This is the most important element of public infrastructure in the county and we are proud of it.  It is close to our hearts, given it is where many of us have spent our first hours and will spend our final hours.  We want to ensure the hospital is resourced in order that it can meet the needs of our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100032#EE00500","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413911400,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  Letterkenny General Hospital has an average of 98 presentations to its accident and emergency department on a daily basis.  I have been advised by the HSE that over a period of several days last week the hospital encountered a spike in demand, where there were more than 120 presentations on each of the three days involved.  Coupled with this was the acuity or degree of complexity in sickness of the patients.  Sicker patients typically require more complex care and for longer periods.  A series of measures was undertaken to manage this surge in volume, including a message to the public to avoid the accident and emergency department if possible and for people to contact their GP to see if their emergency merited them attending the department.   This is a usual response for hospitals to pursue in the event of unusually high demand and this is not unique to LGH.  All acute general hospitals are faced with these challenges when it comes to a spike in demand.<\/p><p>  LGH has taken a range of measures to deal with increased demand and is working closely with the special delivery unit, SDU, on an almost daily basis to manage and identify strategies to expedite patients' journeys through the hospital.  An additional 19 beds were opened in the hospital in July this year while the SDU funded a further 11 beds in primary and community care to expedite discharges from the hospital by creating additional capacity for patients who require step-down care before they return home.  The navigational hub bed management unit was set up to improve the efficacy of management of inpatient beds in the hospital.<\/p><p>  Further measures include prioritising patients who require diagnostics, other interventions for patients who can be discharged on same day and working closely with colleagues in primary and community care to minimise the impact of delayed discharges in the hospital.  Letterkenny General Hospital has one of the lowest levels of delayed discharges in the country.  Last week, there were no delayed discharges compared with more than 300 in the Dublin hospitals.  Today at 8 a.m. only one patient was waiting on a trolley and by 2 p.m., there was none.<\/p><p>  A consultant physician has been appointed to lead on the acute medical assessment unit, AMAU.  All medical referrals to the accident and emergency department are directed to the AMAU where a senior decision maker can assess and treat patients, thus avoiding admission.  There also has been a reorganisation of work practices of the consultant and non-consultant hospital doctor staff in order that those who are on-call to the accident and emergency department have no other commitments elsewhere in the hospital.  For instance, the surgeon on-call does not do any scheduled care in theatre that day.  This has led to a much more timely response in seeing emergency presentations.<\/p><p>  The hospital's patient flow policy was also recently reviewed and updated.  The outcome was the adoption of a range of measures to expedite patient flow throughout the hospital such as improved discharge planning with the aim of discharging patients by 11 a.m., meaning the bed is freed up for another patient earlier in the day.  The measures include nurse-led discharge and the identification of estimated date of discharge for each patient.  The patient flow escalation policy has been also updated.<\/p><p>  The target waiting time from presentation at the accident and emergency department to discharge or admission is six hours.  LGH meets this target 87% of the time.  The hospital experienced an unexpected spike in demand over the usual demand, therefore, additional special measures were taken to respond.  All patients who presented to the accident and emergency department last week were assessed and treated as required.<\/p><p>   As well as the exceptional measures outlined, the modern facilities created through the rebuilding necessitated by the flooding events in 2013 will ensure patients have improved access to safe, sustainable services for the long term.  This is a direct reflection of the commitment and hard work of staff and management of Letterkenny General Hospital, the rebuild steering group and Saolta University Health Care Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100033#FF00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1413911400,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  I am not sure he appreciates that the hospital is in crisis.  This is not just my view; it is a view I have heard from senior levels within the hospital.  The crisis presents itself at different times in different areas with the issue in the accident and emergency department last week an example of that.  The hospital is kept going and meeting demand only because of the diligent efforts of its nursing staff, doctors, consultants and non-medical staff.  This is where the problem arises.  Many people are going beyond the call of duty.<\/p><p> I have statistics for 2012 and we need the updated statistics.  However, LGH had 6.8 staff per 1,000 inpatient discharges that year compared with Kerry General Hospital, 7.2; South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, 7.4; Mayo General Hospital, 7.8; St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny, 7.8; Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore, 9.9; and Sligo Regional Hospital, ten.  I do not compare the hospital to the Mater Hospital and so on.  LGH had 24.7 nursing staff per 1,000 inpatient discharges;  Kerry General Hospital, more than 30; South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, 31.9; Mayo General Hospital, 25; St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny, 29; and so on.  The number of agency staff in LGH was 0.7 per 1,000 inpatient discharges; Kerry General Hospital, zero; South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, zero; Mayo General Hospital, zero; St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny, 0.6; and so on.  LGH, therefore, has the highest number of agency staff and lowest number of medical and nursing staff. <\/p><p>  If LGH were compared to Mayo General Hospital, it would need 22 additional medical staff to meet demand while it would need 105 additional nursing staff when compared to St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny.

I have no doubt the Deputy is sincere in his concerns for Letterkenny General Hospital.  We all need to be careful, however, when dealing with health issues, not to do down good hospitals or services in the belief that somehow that will generate more resources because, first, it does not and, second, it undermines public confidence in the health service, unnecessarily and unfairly in my view.<\/p><p>  During my time working as a doctor I worked at eight different hospitals, all of which had spikes in activity from time to time.  There are two ways of dealing with this.  One can either have huge latent capacity staff waiting around in case a hospital gets busy, which is very wasteful, or one can have mechanisms in place to deal with spikes in demand, including, for example, going off-call.  It would not, for example, be unusual in the city of Dublin for one of the accident and emergency departments to go off-call for a short time during busy periods.  The work is then moved to other hospitals.  Also, during a busy day at an emergency department when many people have to be admitted, it is not unusual for elective surgery to be cancelled.  That is always the case.  The only way around that is to have a huge number of unused staff and so on, which is very inefficient.<\/p><p>  When it comes to agency staff, Letterkenny General Hospital spent &euro;4.9 million in this area.  As the public sector embargo is being relaxed, it will have much more flexibility next year to hire people on temporary contracts or as full-time employees instead of hiring them through agencies.  Significant savings can be made through the hiring of people on temporary contracts rather than through agencies, which is very expensive. <\/p><p>  I am not familiar with the statistics and data mentioned today by the Deputy.  They were not given to me in advance.  I am happy to receive them and have them examined.  It is not my role as Minister for Health to decide the staffing levels or budgets of the 47 acute hospitals in the State.  That is a decision for the HSE and the national director of hospitals and, in time, the south hospital group when fully up and running.  I am happy to commit to having the statistics referred to by the Deputy examined to see if they stack up.

The emergency department at Galway University Hospital is the busiest or second busiest in the country.  On 17 September last, a number of nurses and health care staff who work in the emergency department at that hospital held a one hour lunchtime protest to highlight their difficulties in caring for patients, in particular elderly people, the extreme pressure on staff and the large number of people on trolleys and so on.  Following this, I had engagements with management at Galway University Hospital and with the nurses during which a few issues came to the fore.<\/p><p>  The statement issued by the hospital in terms of its acknowledgement of the difficulties being experienced by patients was honest.  It also stated that despite the ongoing efforts of staff and management, not all emergency department patients are afforded privacy and dignity.  The statement that not all patients in one of our busiest emergency departments are afforded privacy and dignity is powerful.  Mr. Bill Meagher, then group CEO, said he would not want that service for himself or any of his loved ones and he did not want it for any of his patients or staff.  That hospital management was able to acknowledge this was good and constructive.  It allows us to move on and try to solve the issues.  The management and staff agreed that staffing levels needed to be increased.  As far as I am aware, that is now happening, which is very positive.  However, there are still issues with the physical infrastructure that is the emergency department at Galway University Hospital.  Bed management is also an issue.  I welcome that construction of a new 70-bed ward will commence next year.  <\/p><p>  In response to a parliamentary question to the HSE about the emergency department at Galway University Hospital, I received the forthright and stark response that the original emergency department was constructed in the 1950s and the interim development of the late 1990s is still in place.  I was also informed that annual emergency department attendance had increased from 57,000 in 2006 to 65,000 in 2014 and that the existing emergency department does not allow effective patient streaming, is not compliant with infection prevention and control standards and does not enable compliance with the emergency medicine programme or targets for unscheduled care patients experience.  It is very honest of the hospital to put that on the record.  In effect what the hospital is saying is that regardless of what is done in terms of the special delivery unit, increased bed management and re-routing services out of the emergency department, the physical infrastructure is not fit for purpose.  I understand an application has been made to the capital steering group for two possible outcomes: a two-floor emergency department or a six-floor emergency department.  I would appreciate if the Minister could tell the House when a decision in that regard will be made.  The existing emergency department does not meet the basic requirements of an emergency department.  Can provision of a new emergency department at Galway University Hospital, which meets the standards for patients, staff and the wider community in Galway and the west be a priority for the capital programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100034#GG00600","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speech","time":1413912000,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Nolan for raising this issue today.  Galway University Hospital has approximately 700 beds and is a tertiary referral centre for the western region, as part of the south hospital group.  Its emergency department has approximately 66,000 attendances annually.  Like many other major emergency departments in the country, it has experienced an increase in activity over recent months.  The HSE is working closely with the special delivery unit to better manage patient flow through the hospital, and this collaboration has reduced the overall number of patients awaiting admission from the emergency department by 2,038 when compared with 2011.<\/p><p>  The HSE advises me that Galway University Hospital is approving and recruiting experienced general and paediatric nurses for its departments.  A recent interview process resulted in the creation of a panel of 21 experienced staff, 11 of whom are approved to commence in the coming weeks in the emergency department.  Last week a fourth advanced nurse practitioner was appointed for the emergency department, with a specific function in the management of minor injury treatment.<\/p><p>  To reflect the central importance of patient experience, GUH has appointed a patient advice and liaison officer with the role in the emergency department of addressing the needs of patients and attempting to improve patients' experience as they wait for access to services.  Staff members also receive mindfulness training to assist in their approach and management of their ongoing workload.  All these initiatives are of benefit to the public, patients and the staff.<\/p><p>  The hospital has carried out a feasibility study to examine the benefits of an internal reconfiguration project of the existing emergency department versus a new build solution.  This was completed in line with the development control plan for the site and accepted by the HSE capital steering group on 19  October 2013, subject to a cost-benefit analysis being undertaken.  This cost-benefit analysis is under consideration.  Future plans for the ED will incorporate capacity to meet the requirements of the emergency medicine programme and include capacity to meet the requirement of any future reconfiguration of services across the group.  The HSE has been engaging on a consistent basis with the main unions, principally the INMO and SIPTU, regarding the activity levels within the department and the capacity issues therein.  As part of this, a number of initiatives are being implemented to improve the pathways of care, including the navigational hub and the early discharge programme.  A specific pathway for frail elderly is also being considered.<\/p><p>It is becoming evident from the data that the rising number of patients over 75 who are attending and requiring admission is rising but as the Deputy rightly points out, any of these measures around patient flow, greater use of community beds and so on will only be stop-gap measures.

That is something I intend to do but it will take quite some time to get around to visiting 47 acute hospitals, never mind all the other health care and primary care institutions.<\/p><p>  It is the intention of the HSE in the coming months or certainly over next year to bring in outside consultants - people who are experts on how hospitals are run in other parts of the world - have them go into particular hospitals and work out the way those hospitals can be better run and better managed.  It is obvious when we examine the trolley numbers - the fact that they peak on Wednesdays, fall back down on Fridays and peak again late on Saturdays and Sundays, that if we could smooth out activity in our hospitals we could make much better use of existing resources.  There is a good deal that can be learned from overseas in that respect, and we hope to identify a few hospitals next year that are up for it, so to speak.  That means changes in working practices and in the way things were always done to make better use of our facilities.  Some hospitals will be chosen to take part in those type of projects.<\/p><p>  When it comes to the new build, if there is a two-floor new build to replace the existing emergency department and put in an acute medical assessment unit, AMEU, and an ASU, which is what would be needed, we are talking about &euro;30 million, and a six-storey building would cost about &euro;60 million.  It is a very substantial amount of money within a capital budget which only runs to 2016, but I will chase it up with the HSE to determine what is happening with the interim reconfiguring project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100035#HH00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014: Order for Second Stage","time":1413912600,"counter":439,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100035#HH00400"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1413912600,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Bill entitled an Act to amend the powers and functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in relation to complaints, investigations and other procedures; for that purpose, to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 and the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009; to provide for an amendment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 relating to the functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate; and to provide for related matters.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1413912600,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Second Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100035#HH00500","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1413912600,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014: Second Stage","time":1413912600,"counter":443,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100035#HH00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1413912600,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p><p>  The 2013 Garda annual report which I recently laid before the Oireachtas is a document worth reflecting on and bringing to the attention of every Member of this House.  It highlights, for example, how Operation Fiacla has led to a 7% reduction in burglaries; that the reduction in road deaths between 2005 and 2013 still remains more than 50%; with Garda targets for compliance with speed limits, wearing of seat belts and drink driving enforcement all met in 2013; in 2013 also, 260 organised crime gangs were targeted; 157 grow houses were detected; and there were 21,000 referrals to youth diversion programmes.<\/p><p>  I recently visited garda&iacute; in Limerick, as Deputy Niall Collins will be well aware, who reported to me on the exceptionally high rate of detection of murders, leading to successful prosecutions in recent years, which I believe is well acknowledged by the people of Limerick.  I refer to these successes of policing because I believe it vitally important that we, and in particular us as Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, should not forget the ongoing and valued contribution the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its members have made for over 90 years in terms of keeping our communities safe and preserving the security of our State when it was threatened, a contribution delivered in the face of ever-present threats and a contribution delivered, tragically, at the cost of the lives of some members of the force.  <\/p><p>  I want to express my thanks to the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for all of that, which is neither to minimise nor ignore the serious failures on penalty points, in crime investigation, which we saw outlined in the Guerin report, for example, and in responding to whistleblowers.  In some cases what we have learned about the behaviour of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has struck at the heart of our shared understanding of what justice itself is.  For we live in a Republic of laws where there is not, and never can be, one law for some but not others, where all citizens are, and should always be, treated equally.  That is what we expect, and I am sure every Member here will agree with me that is what we are entitled to expect.<\/p><p>  We have had too much controversy as of late.  We have seen confidence in policing eroded as a result of these controversies.  The vast majority of men and women joined An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the sincerest of aspirations to provide the highest levels of service to the public.  I have no doubt about that.  They are disappointed at the failures that have been uncovered and the controversies that have raged.  <\/p><p>  A commonly-shared determination and desire within an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and among communities across this country is to see reform happen, to see a break from the past, and to move on from these controversies to a new period of confidence.  I want to see confidence trumping controversy.  I want to see confidence restored in the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I want to see the organisation, structures, practices and systems put in place to support the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to effectively deliver the best possible policing and security services for our communities and our country.  <\/p><p>  As I said when I took office, I want to see a sea change in the performance, administration and oversight of justice and policing in this State.  I accept, and I believe, that this will involve confronting deficiencies and failures.  It will involve examining, openly, transparently and vigorously, where there are operational practices that are simply not up to standard.  This will be done because, ultimately, I want to move from the concept of a police force to delivery of a police service that is fit and ready to meet the realities, the requirements and the expectations of 21st century policing.<\/p><p>Achieving this requires acknowledgement of the real situation, reforms and resources.<\/p><p> The budget announced last week began to address the question of resources with funding for new Garda vehicles; the 300 garda&iacute; who have recently entered or will shortly enter Garda College in Templemore; the civilianisation of the immigration functions which will free up 150 garda&iacute; for frontline policing duties.  We are undertaking a process of reform.  As a member of the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform, chaired by An Taoiseach and more particularly as the responsible line Minister, I am leading the implementation of a comprehensive programme of justice reform.  The Bill marks an important element of these reforms.<\/p><p> Before turning to deal specifically with the Bill, I wish to update Deputies briefly on the other important elements of the justice reform programme.  The preparation of the scheme of a Bill to provide for the establishment of the independent new policing authority is being progressed and will be submitted to Government as quickly as possible.  That is A list legislation.  The only reason it was not on the A list was that the heads of the Bill had not gone through Cabinet.  The Taoiseach and Government had given a commitment that the Bill for the establishment of the policing authority would come through this term and that is still the intention.  The Public Appointments Service has sought expressions of interest for the position of chairperson of the policing authority who, when appointed, will assist in the appointment of the Garda Commissioner as well as in preparations for the establishment of the authority.  The Public Appointments Service is also managing the first open competition to appoint a new Garda Commissioner.  I expect the new Commissioner to be appointed as soon as possible.  The independent review mechanism, consisting of a panel of counsel, is examining a range of complaints, some alleging Garda misconduct or problems with investigating misconduct or problems with investigations throughout the criminal justice system.  As soon as I have the analysis of the independent review mechanism I will of course put that in the public domain.<\/p><p> The publication of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate&rsquo;s crime inspection report is expected in the near future.  The report will deal with crime recording and investigation, and will also deal with the concerns which I referred to the inspectorate.  After submission of the report by Mr. Se&aacute;n Guerin SC, I asked the Garda Inspectorate to examine that report, considering the operational issues raised there.  Work is being finalised on the establishment of a commission of investigation into matters identified in the Guerin report.  I have already said in the House that this was delayed in order to see the outcome of the independent review mechanism and if further cases were going to be referred for a commission.  The Fennelly Commission of Investigation is working.  We have received the report of Mr. Justice Cooke&rsquo;s inquiry and the Haddington Road review will come through in mid-November.  The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 has amended the Garda legislation to allow Garda members to make &ldquo;protected disclosures&rdquo; to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, in confidence in respect of alleged Garda misconduct.  The recently enacted Freedom of Information Act 2014 extends to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p> In presenting the justice reform programme, I have also stressed my priority objective of strengthening the role and remit of GSOC.  This Bill seeks to deliver on this commitment.  The primary functions of GSOC are concerned with dealing with complaints against Garda members and examining Garda practices and procedures.  However, since its establishment in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 - I acknowledge that was a reforming Act - certain restrictions have existed on the extent to which the GSOC functions can be exercised.  The preparation of the Bill has been informed by a public consultation process completed earlier this year, the Farmleigh consultation seminar, which was attended by some 100 participants, representing key stakeholders, and direct contacts with GSOC.  Representatives of the Deputies opposite attended in Farmleigh and had an input to it.<\/p><p> The preparation of the Bill has also been informed by the valuable work carried out by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which Deputies present, the justice spokespersons, are members.  The joint committee has recently produced a report containing extensive recommendations following its comprehensive review of the current Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na legislation.  This followed a series of hearings and visits to other jurisdictions.  I am grateful to the committee for the report and I am happy to say that this Bill addresses some of its recommendations.  As I have stated in this House, very careful consideration is being given to the report with reference to the preparation of the scheme for the policing authority.<\/p><p> For the most part, the Bill amends the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 which is the primary statute governing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some of the amendments involved are technical in nature and I will deal with them more specifically as the Bill progresses.  Amendments are also being made to the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 and the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 to permit GSOC to exercise certain additional police powers. <\/p><p> I now turn to the specific content of the Bill.  Sections 1 to 3 are standard provisions containing definitions and technical amendments arising from later provisions in the Bill.  Section 4 extends the general time limit at section 84(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 for making a complaint to GSOC from six to 12 months.  This does not alter the current position under which it is open to GSOC to extend the time limit if it considers that there are good reasons for doing so.  Deputies will be aware that the issue of time limits was covered in the report of the Oireachtas joint committee.<\/p><p> Section 5 has to be read in conjunction with sections 12 and 13.  It substitutes a new definition of &lsquo;&lsquo;enactment&rsquo;&rsquo; in section 98(5) of the 2005 Act, as amended, to remove the current prohibitions on GSOC exercising police powers under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 and the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009.  In that context, section 12 amends the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 to enable GSOC to undertake the interception of communications for the purposes of a criminal investigation by GSOC under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  The approach adopted is that a GSOC investigating officer will have the powers that would be available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the same circumstances.  In addition, the conditions and safeguards contained in the 1993 Act will operate where interception is sought by GSOC.  Similarly, section 13 provides for amendments to the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 to enable GSOC to carry out surveillance where it is necessary in connection with a criminal investigation concerning an arrestable offence.  In this context, GSOC will be in the same position as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purposes of conducting such an investigation.<\/p><p> Section 6 amends section 102 of the 2005 Act to broaden the scope for the Minister to refer a matter to GSOC and to allow GSOC to investigate that matter even if the identity of the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not known at the time of the investigation or where the investigation may also involve a person who is not a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These are issues which were identified in the report of Judge Cooke as ones which could usefully be clarified and I have undertaken that this would be done.<\/p><p> Section 7 inserts a new section 102B into the 2005 Act which brings the Garda Commissioner within the scope of GSOC investigations for the first time.  This is also an area that was addressed in the report of the Oireachtas joint committee.  The preparation of the new section was the subject of particular attention, and in particular the question of whether the consent of the Minister should be required where GSOC proposes to undertake an investigation on its own initiative into alleged misconduct on the part of the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p> After careful consideration I am satisfied that, taking account of the key position of the Commissioner, especially in security matters, it would be appropriate that the prior agreement of the Minister should be obtained.  However, I emphasise that refusals to give such a consent should only be for very good reasons, which should be communicated to GSOC.  No doubt we will tease out the detail of this on Committee Stage.  In those circumstances I believe that it would only be in exceptional cases that the Minister would not consent to a proposed investigation.  Accordingly, subsection (1) of the proposed section 102B enables GSOC to investigate, in the public interest and subject to the consent of the Minister, any matter that gives rise to a concern that the Garda Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would constitute serious misconduct.  If the Minister refuses to consent to such an investigation, he or she will be required, under subsection (3), to provide reasons to GSOC for that refusal. <\/p><p> Subsection (2) allows the Minister, in the public interest, to request GSOC to investigate any matter that gives rise to a concern that the Garda Commissioner may have done anything referred to in subsection (1), and GSOC is required to investigate that matter.<\/p><p>Subsections (4) and (5) are provisions necessary to facilitate the operation of the section.  In particular, adaptations are being made to the 2005 Act to ensure GSOC will have the necessary powers to undertake an investigation involving the Commissioner.<\/p><p> Section 8 is consequential on the insertion of the new section 102B under section 7 and it amends section 103 of the 2005 Act which deals with keeping certain people informed about GSOC investigations.  Section 9 inserts a new section 103A into the 2005 Act.  It is intended to improve the flow of information from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to GSOC, particularly under the protocol arrangements in place under section 108.  Specifically, it imposes a statutory duty on the Garda Commissioner to ensure information to be provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to GSOC for the purposes of an investigation will be supplied as soon as practicable.  The section will give effect to this provision in a statutory way.  I note that GSOC has clarified this week that information is now being supplied to it in almost 80% of cases and within a much better timeframe than was previously the case.  Therefore, even in the absence of legislation, we have already seen improvements in this area.<\/p><p> Section 10, which replaces section 106 of the 2005 Act, will allow GSOC for the first time to carry out an examination on its own initiative of practices, policies or procedures of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purpose of preventing or reducing complaints.  I think that is quite an interesting power with a great deal of potential in it.  Currently, GSOC can undertake such an examination only when it is requested by the Minister to do so.  I believe the change being proposed, which was recommended by the joint committee, is a very good one.  It should make a difference to the relationship between GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some interesting work could be done under this section of the Bill.  The reports will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, subject to the possible exclusion of certain matters, for example relating to national security or where the commission of an offence may be facilitated.<\/p><p> Just as GSOC is being given the power to initiate examinations into Garda practices independently, I believe it should be open to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to do this in line with a further recommendation of the joint committee.  Accordingly, section 11 amends section 117(2) of the 2005 Act to enable the inspectorate to conduct, on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister, inspections or inquiries in relation to any particular aspects of the operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At present, the inspectorate can only conduct such an inspection or inquiry with the prior consent of the Minister.  I think Deputies will agree that this measure will give GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate greater flexibility and more authority to initiate inquiries independently of what the Minister might consider to be appropriate for investigation.  I dealt with sections 12 and 13 earlier in connection with section 5.  Section 14 is procedural.<\/p><p> I am conscious that the changes proposed in the Bill will give rise to additional demands on the resources of GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate.  I referred briefly earlier to the budget 2015 in so far as it relates to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I can confirm to the House that the budget provides for an increase of &euro;1 million in the allocation to GSOC and an increase of &euro;250,000 in the allocation to the inspectorate.  I have consistently made it clear throughout the recent public debate on justice reform that reform must not simply be about change for its own sake.  Our reforms are about providing this country with the police force it needs, operating to the highest professional standards and ready to meet existing and emerging challenges.  Of course that includes oversight.<\/p><p> Our reforms are about ensuring the men and women of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the country will be fully supported by good organisational structures, practices and systems so they can deliver the best possible policing and security services for our communities and our people.  The reforms are about the broader systematic failures which have been identified.  I believe these failures have called into question the capacity of the Garda organisation to function properly and carry out its core tasks.  Our reforms, and the work of this House in relation to them, have to be about restoring the confidence of the public in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and giving organisations like GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate the tools and the independence they need to carry out their tasks so that the public can have confidence in the oversight we have in this country with regard to policing.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100035#HH00800","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413913800,"counter":447,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes this Bill as a first step in expanding the remit and powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  In our opinion, however, the Bill falls far short of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  This indicates that the Government's initial commitment to the necessary reform is waning.  This Bill does not go far enough in securing the independence and impartiality of the GSOC from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Fianna F&aacute;il proposed the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Bill 2014, which was discussed in this House less than three weeks ago.  Our Bill would create a stronger ombudsman's office, which would be unfettered by political interference in its investigations while guarding against the possible undermining of our national security.<\/p><p>  The shocking revelations of the Guerin report into Sergeant Maurice McCabe's claims, which were raised by the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party with the Taoiseach, served as the impetus for the Government's decision to strengthen the powers of GSOC.  The Guerin report suggested that the deficiencies identified in the investigations considered in this review, if they were widely replicated, would be a challenge to public confidence in the criminal justice system itself.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, who was charged with rebuilding that public confidence when she was appointed to this portfolio in May of this year, said in response to the report that if root and branch reform is what is needed, root and branch reform is what will happen, and must happen.  In that sense, we welcome the Bill brought to the House by the Minister as a first step towards a more accountable justice system.<\/p><p>  We acknowledge that the legislative restrictions contained in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as well as the mistrust between the Garda, GSOC and the Department of Justice and Equality, have undermined GSOC's ability to carry out unfettered investigations and hold the Garda to account.  This has resulted in widespread investigative failures and an acceptance of seriously questionable practices by certain members of the force.  The GSOC bugging controversy further undermined public confidence in the operation of a professional and competent criminal justice system.  As a result, Fianna F&aacute;il published legislation in February, the aim of which was to reform GSOC.  A couple of days ago, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality published a report on the review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and outlined some significant suggestions for reform.  While the Minister appears to have ignored much of the committee's report in this Bill, I want to make it clear that Fianna F&aacute;il fully endorses the report.<\/p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 introduces a number of welcome reforms.  It extends the general time limit for making a complaint to GSOC from six to 12 months.  It gives GSOC more investigative power to use surveillance and the same power as the Garda in criminal investigations.  It brings the Garda Commissioner under the oversight of GSOC, even if the consent of the Minister is required.  It allows the Minister to ask GSOC to carry out an investigation in the public interest.  It ensures information requested by GSOC is provided by the Garda &quot;as soon as practicable&quot;.  It allows GSOC to carry out an investigation on its own initiative and to investigate the operation and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, the legislation does not create a single Garda ombudsman, as recommended by the joint committee.  It does not put GSOC's access to PULSE on a statutory basis and it does not give GSOC independence from ministerial oversight when investigating the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>Neither does it put a Garda authority on a statutory footing, give responsibility for the recruitment and appointment of senior Garda officers to the Public Appointments Service or the proposed new Garda authority, establish a new officer rank within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na similar to that within the London Metropolitan Police, or expand freedom of information provisions to the Garda.  This is a lost opportunity following the excellent work done by the Oireachtas joint committee in researching best practice in how to build an accountability structure within the justice sector.<\/p><p> The report published by the committee made comprehensive suggestions on how to reform the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  Many of its recommendations have been ignored.  In particular, the proposals on the reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission should have been taken into account when drafting the Bill.  I will propose a number of amendments that seek to strengthen this Bill further and which I hope the Government will consider favourably on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> It is important to note that a key recommendation in the committee's report called for the three GSOC commissioners to be replaced by a single Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman.  The report's recommendations were made with the aim of reforming the complaints process and expanding and improving the inspection mechanisms in place.  They also relate to the formation of the proposed Garda authority, training garda&iacute; and addressing circumstances that may lead to complaints.  The report recommends a Garda authority where the candidates are selected by the PAS and approved by way of formal appointment or otherwise by the Minister.  The committee also suggested a similar system for the Garda, with senior officers selected by the PAS and appointments made by the authority, which may be ratified by the Minister.<\/p><p> The authority would operate as the head, with the ombudsman and the Garda Inspectorate operating as the arms.  The authority would be concerned with appointing senior garda&iacute;; adding input to policy, strategy and planning, including budgets; managing the effectiveness of the complaints procedures through operating a helpline and referring matters to the ombudsman; and overseeing inspections of the administration, presentation and efficiency of the Garda.  The ombudsman should be primarily concerned with serious complaints and systemic problems, supported by the inspectorate in cases where there is no specific complaint against a named or identifiable individual.<\/p><p> The committee recommended an expanded role for both the ombudsman and the inspectorate under the auspices of the Garda authority.  Importantly, the committee's report stated that all garda&iacute; up to and including the Commissioner should be accountable to the ombudsman.  The ombudsman should be empowered to investigate any section of the Garda.  It is the committee's view that the role of the Garda Inspectorate should be expanded, resulting in a body similar to the one that operates in Northern Ireland.  The committee suggested that the Garda Inspectorate be transformed into a criminal justice inspectorate, tasked with a wider scope to inspect other aspects of the criminal justice system apart from the Garda, including the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, the Courts Service, the Prison Service, the Probation Service and the Chief State Solicitor's office.  The Minister must outline to the House a response to these recommendations and state why she has decided to include so few in this legislation.<\/p><p> As I outlined during the debate on Fianna F&aacute;il's Bill, the past year has seen a significant undermining of public confidence in the administration of justice as a result of mismanagement at Government and senior garda level.  We witnessed some of the most severe cutbacks in the provision of services, such as the reduction in the size of the force by approximately 1,600 garda&iacute;, the closure of more than 139 Garda stations and 30 courthouses, and more than 16% of the prison population on temporary release at any one time.  We also witnessed a stream of revelations and investigations that damaged the public perception of the Garda, the Department of Justice and Equality and GSOC.  While we welcome the recommencement of Garda recruitment and the extra allocation of 200 garda&iacute; in the budget, this level of recruitment is insufficient to ensure the numbers in the force remain at or above the 13,000 figure.  We are also still waiting on the establishment of the commission of investigation following the publication of the Guerin report.<\/p><p> This week, we again read of further difficulties arising with Garda rosters.  It has been reported that Garda management is concerned that the rosters are causing a chronic personnel shortage that is disrupting the investigation of crime and terrorism.  This is worrying, especially after we were promised that these rosters would result in a 25% increase in the number of garda&iacute; working at certain times of the day.  If we are getting basic issues like rosters wrong, how do we expect people to believe that we will get the systemic issues right?  It has been stated that the rosters have resulted in squads such as the Garda national drug unit, the organised crime unit and the national bureau of criminal investigation being without adequate numbers of personnel at crucial times to make arrests or question suspects.  Now we hear that further changes to the rosters are being sought, but that representatives of rank and file garda&iacute; are resisting.  Overall, it seems that the situation is deteriorating at a cost to the ordinary citizen, who simply wants an effective, professional and courteous police service.  These problems must not be ignored by the Minister.<\/p><p> The problems that manifested in the Garda and GSOC and were reported to the former Minister for Justice and Equality were ignored, dismissed or glossed over to save the embarrassment of those in senior positions who decided that not taking responsibility was a key management skill.  We would like to restate the fact that this approach was a massive disservice to the ordinary members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the citizens of Ireland.  The Department of Justice and Equality under Fine Gael has been dysfunctional and disastrous.  The resignations of the Garda confidential recipient, the Garda Commissioner, the former Minister for Justice and Equality and the Secretary General of the Department indicate that something is wrong in the Government's policy approach.  We have also witnessed the establishment of an unprecedented number of commissions of investigation surrounding the Department, with still more to be established.  One hopes that lessons will be learned about how to deal with issues arising in the Garda and the Department from this date onward.<\/p><p> Fianna F&aacute;il has been calling for a strengthening of the ombudsman's powers since the maladministration of justice outlined by Sergeant McCabe was revealed.  Central to these problems not being addressed has been the lack of own-initiative investigations and actions that can be taken by GSOC as a result of the legislation that sets out its powers.  That GSOC is restricted in its actions by the Minister or the former Garda Commissioner or by the fact that only a limited number of people can make complaints to GSOC fundamentally undermines its ability to carry out its statutory functions.  The legislation I tabled in the House would have significantly increased the powers and independence of GSOC and gone a long way towards ensuring future difficulties were addressed well in advance of their becoming major institutional challenges.<\/p><p> The Guerin report pointed out that Sergeant Maurice McCabe was correct in his actions to highlight the failure to administrate justice in the Bailieborough Garda district.  These failings should have been detected well in advance of when they actually were.  I hope this Bill will ensure such failings will never again be allowed to continue for so long a time without the intervention of GSOC.  We need to understand their root cause.  When reading the Guerin report, what is striking is the lack of accountability between ranks when failings arise.  It is also clear that resources and the lack of management of same were issues.  To understand fully why these failings occurred, the recommendation in the Guerin report that a commission of inquiry must be established has to be followed through.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports the call for a commission of investigation, as recommended by the Guerin report, and believes this commission should be kept separate from any other commission that already has been established by the Government to investigate matters relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I have stated previously that the alleged malpractice in Bailieborough undermines the foundations of the criminal justice system.  It also undermines the morale of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In order to restore public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is necessary to establish fully and frankly how the situation surrounding the malpractice in County Cavan was allowed to occur, continue and be covered up for such a long time.  I welcome the provision in this Bill to empower and enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, to inquire into policies, procedures and practices adopted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and allow it to review and comment on them and to recommend changes to improve policies and procedures and to try to prevent complaints from arising in the first instance.  It is important that in future cases, GSOC will not be inhibited from examining the entire picture when failings of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are exposed.  Such examinations hopefully would prevent a situation like that in Bailieborough from arising again.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has published this Bill, which reflects much of what was agreed by all parties following the McCabe revelations.  However, I believe that events have moved on and that the report published by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality could be incorporated into this Bill and therefore have a greater impact.  I suggest to the Minister that she could support or amend the Bill by including the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee to speed up the process of reform.  After all, the reform of GSOC and the restoration of public confidence in that institution, as well as in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is an issue that is above party politics when much of what is proposed has been agreed to by all sides, whether in debate or in legislation published.<br\/><br\/>There is much agreement throughout the House, as reflected in the committee report, that comprehensive change is necessary.  Members should process this legislation as quickly as possible to be seen to support the work of GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I have stated previously that part of the public concern since the controversy surrounding GSOC arose is the perception that the commission is not being supported by the Government.  I also have stated previously that this concern appears to be backed up by the reduction by more than &euro;1 million in the budget allocation to GSOC and by the cut in its staff numbers in recent years.  In that context, the Minister is to be congratulated on increasing the allocation to GSOC for next year by &euro;1 million.  I hope this allocation will go some way in helping GSOC deal with the most pressing issue in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the coming year.<br\/><br\/>As for the criminal justice inspectorate, I will take this opportunity to urge the Minister to introduce a new criminal justice inspectorate, as outlined by the Oireachtas joint committee.  I do not believe the criminal justice system is fit for purpose at present.  An inspectorate would be able to direct policymakers as to how best to allocate resources and deliver better results.  If one considers the prison system, one will see that re-offending rates are extremely high.  A report by the Irish Prison Service and the Central Statistics Office in 2013 showed that criminals in Ireland have a re-offending rate of 62.3% within three years.  More than 80% of those who re-offended did so within 12 months of release.  This is an extremely depressing figure and shows how much the criminal justice system is crying out for reform.  Not only is the justice system ineffective in reforming offenders' actions, it also is very costly, as the average cost of imprisonment per prisoner was &euro;65,000 in 2012.  New ideas and a new approach is needed to reform the penal system and a criminal justice inspectorate might help in some way to create the space and the impetus to bring about such a debate and these new ideas.<br\/><br\/>Another area that must be addressed is the high cost of legal services, which continues to pose problems for the country in the context of competitiveness and access to the justice systems.  The European Commission has raised concerns about these costs restricting economic growth, especially for small to medium-sized enterprises.  The cost of legal services remains 12.1% above 2006 levels and according to the Commission, this contrasts markedly with the post-crisis development of other services.  I still believe the Legal Services Regulation Bill will not, in its current form, result in a dramatic reduction in legal costs.  The Government has been slow to further the passage of this Bill beyond Committee Stage and the Minister might outline to Members when she believes it will be passed by the House.<br\/><br\/>The central need for reform in the area of justice is to ensure the accountability and professionalism of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the establishment of an independent policing authority.  This is vital to improve morale in the Garda force and in the citizens' confidence in their police service.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission also needs this Bill, which will give it more investigative powers independent of individual complaints made and which should create more effective investigations overall.  I have stated previously that the Minister's time in the Department of Justice and Equality will be judged as a success or failure on the restoration of the public's confidence in the justice system.  I believe this Bill to be a first step in this process.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support this Bill as a tentative first step but certainly not the end of this process.<br\/><br\/>I wish to make a number of other brief points to the Minister in the time remaining to me.  As I mentioned earlier in my contribution, there recently has been a recruitment campaign into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Public Appointments Service was charged with running the campaign for recruitment into the Garda and was charged with running the competition for the recruitment of a new Garda Commissioner and to a point, people are happy to see that.  When the Minister gets an opportunity to respond, she should address the question as to what will happen with regard to the current vacancies at deputy commissioner, assistant commissioner and chief superintendent levels.  Will those competitions be run by the Public Appointments Service, the new Commissioner or the chairperson-designate?  I believe it will be important to have a degree of consistency in recruitment across all levels within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>I also have referred previously to the position regarding members of the Garda Reserve, who have been playing a huge role in society, and have commented in this Chamber on how their role has been undervalued.  As part of the recruitment campaign into the Garda, I note that of the initial intake of 100 recruits into Templemore, the complement of those who came from the Garda Reserve was very low.  As I have time, I will read out an e-mail, which is one of a number I have received from members of the Garda Reserve.  I will not mention anyone's name.  The person concerned gave her name, stated she was 30 years of age, was in full-time employment and has been a member of the Garda Reserve in Dublin for three years.  She stated:<blockquote>In my time in my station ... I have pulled a woman from the Liffey.  I have saved a drug addict's life that had a syringe imbedded in his scrotum and [was] overdosing.  I have been told by a 6' 4 drug addict that he is HIV positive and will rub his blood in my face.  I have been subjected to abuse at protests.  I have [had] objects thrown at me on more than one occasion.  I have seen colleagues assaulted, both Garda and Garda Reserve.  I have held people's hands when they are hopeless and waiting on an ambulance.  I have comforted the family of a lady who tried to commit suicide.  I have seen a drug dealer use her own child as a drugs mule.  I have had gangs threaten me and my family.  I have dealt with rapists and paedophiles.  I have stood in the middle of Dublin at a crime scene for 7 hours with no break.<br \/><br \/>Why do I do it? It's my calling and I have a great love for the job and ALL it involves.  I cannot understand why the government and the Minister for Justice would not want the hardest-working and most dedicated people working for them?<br \/><br \/>We have proven our dedication for the job and all it involves. Why take someone on that has never tried the job and may turn around when he\/she sees his first rape victim or body and decides it is not for them? Financially we are a dead cert [and] we will not walk away from the job we will work in fact harder than ever before.<br \/><br \/>To most people being a guard is a job but to me and many reserves it is way more than that, most reserves work full time, I personally have given up family occasions and parties.<br \/><br \/>Joining the reserves was a stepping stone ... to joining the guards full time, I have never once backed out of a situation and at times have put my life on the line for the public's safety.<br \/><br \/>I have chatted to my sergeant about my value as a reserve and if I really contribute to my unit, his answer was frank and honest - 'I wouldn't do what you do, I'm sure you have plenty other things to do with your weekend but be in no doubt that you are very much needed and without you a guard would be uptown on his\/her own'.<br \/><br \/>I am aware that the Metropolitan Police Force will only recruit from ... [other] 'specials', this shows me how much value and respect they have over there for there volunteer Police Force.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>That is a flavour of a number of e-mails I have received from Garda reservists, which I am sure other Members also get.  This matter may not be part of this legislation but when we come to set up the independent police authority we have to give serious consideration to the situation of  Garda reservists.  They play a huge part in the provision of the policing function in this State.  They are hugely undervalued.  They are not paid.  Many of them feel that the recruitment campaign undertaken did not go any way towards recognising the fact that they are playing a huge part in our police service.  We will have to return to this issue in time.<\/p><p> When responding to this debate, will the Minister advise the status of the Government's approach to the court challenge that has been taken by the former Minister for Justice and Equality to seek to have the findings of the Guerin report quashed or annulled?  I understand that case is in courts system.  Will the State contest that or what is its strategy or approach to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100037#KK00200","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413915600,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I am pleased to take part in the Second Stage debate on this Bill.  We have been waiting a long time for these extra powers to be given to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  It is has been a very disturbing period in terms of the whole area of the administration and application of justice in this State.  Public confidence has been fundamentally undermined by the incompetence, and sometimes arrogance, that this Government has shown in overseeing all the episodes that have emerged in the recent months and, indeed, years.  In the months the Minister has held her current office, I acknowledge that she has sought to move in a very different direction from that taken by her predecessor, Deputy Shatter.  However, I noted, with interest, her comments reported in today's Irish Independent.  She has a large number of dossiers from families all over Ireland seeking justice.  Some of those cases are of the most serious and profound level, including murder and accusations of cover up of murder.  They are very serious.  I note she has not commented on those.<\/p><p>  A number of the families - quite distressed families - who have written to her today have contacted me to say and note that they have not been offered a meeting by the Minister or by the Taoiseach.  The Minister has not agreed or offered to meet them.  These are cases where they are alleging that their loved ones were murdered and there was a cover-up of the murders.  The Minister has refused to comment on these very serious cases, even though they are on her desk and she has seen the full extent of the allegations.  She has refused to comment on them because she said a review is under way.  I point out to her that the allegations to which she has referred in today's Irish Independent  have been referred by the person making the allegations, Ma&iacute;ria Cahill to the police ombudsman in the North and today there is an independent review of the role of Director of Public Prosecutions in all of that, and that is right and proper.  There is a process under way, yet the Minister chose to comment on those matters, which is entirely inappropriate as the Minister for Justice and Equality, as she must know.  Let me be clear, this is the precedent that she has now established.  I will be expecting her to openly comment on any cases I bring to her attention as we move forward.  She need not use the excuse of a review or a panel or anything like that.  I want her to look at the facts that will be presented to her and give a comment in the public domain because if she does not, she will be seen to be inconsistent and politically opportunistic.  I look forward to her responses to these various cases I will bring to her attention in the time ahead.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach spoke today about referring these allegations to the justice committee.  He said he would speak to the Chairman of that committee, Deputy Stanton, who is present.  Let us be very clear that again this is a very interesting precedent because the Oireachtas justice committee, as a matter of policy, has not been dealing with individual justice cases because the process has not been completed.  That has been our approach and I think it is a fair one.  However, if the Taoiseach refers this matter to the justice committee and we deal with it, I want to be clear in pointing out that I will be insisting on all of these families who have made allegations to also come before that committee.  In every single case where a family has alleged that there has been a cover-up of murder by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I will be insisting that those families also come before our committee.  I will be insisting on that in the interests of fairness because the families have contacted me today.<\/p><p>  The Minister has no idea of the outrage she the Taoiseach has caused these families.  They have said that they cannot get a meeting with the Minister, they cannot get her to comment on the cases of their loved ones and now she has taken immediate action in this area.  They are very clear as to the reasons for that.  Let me be clear, the precedent the Minister set in this case will be the measure of every other case I bring to her attention in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100040#NN00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1413915600,"counter":452,"content":"<p>That is a very manipulative comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100040#NN00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1413915600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Our party has repeatedly called for an independent policing authority.  As recently as February this year, I asked the former Minister for Justice and Equality about establishing it and he robustly rejected the notion.  An independent policing authority was not included in the programme for Government because it was not considered important enough.  Unfortunately it has not been included here either, however, I am assured that it will be established in other new legislation in the coming weeks.  I, and my party, will be continuing to push for this as we believe that it is integral to the reform of policing in this State.  For example, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, did not have the ability to oversee the Garda Commissioner.  I am happy that this Bill will rectify that in section 7.  For the first time the Garda Commissioner will be brought within the scope of GSOC investigations.  This is a great improvement.<\/p><p>  In recent times, we witnessed the limitations of the powers of GSOC when it could not access the PULSE system directly.  Unfortunately, it appears that this too is not addressed in the legislation.  The inclusion of this was one of the recommendations of the Oireachtas justice committee in its submission to the Department on the reform of policing.  Our committee called for the statutory provision of GSOC access to the PULSE system to better equip GSOC staff in their investigations.  In May 2013 a GSOC report to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence clearly stated that there were issues regarding its ability to exercise its oversight function due to a lack of independent access to Garda computerised systems, such as PULSE.  The adherence to agreed protocols between the garda&iacute; and GSOC should be made compulsory in legislation.  We should legislate to grant direct access to PULSE for GSOC.  I will seek to submit amendments on this as I believe it is crucial to the work of GSOC.<\/p><p>  Another concern I have with the Bill, which I would like to raise at this Stage, concerns section 9.  I note with interest the language used here.  It states that the Garda Commissioner is to provide necessary information for investigations by the Ombudsman Commission &quot;as soon as practicable&quot;.  There is vagueness to this language that worries me.  A former GSOC commissioner, Conor Brady, is on the record as stating that an obstacle to GSOC's work when he was a member was how Garda management had an ability to slow things down.  The Minister will recall the report from GSOC about the length of time it took to deal with the Kieran Boylan affair - a special investigation took four years to deal with very serious matters.  We do not want to see this continuing.  I ask the Minister for reassurance that this will not happen.  I am also considering an amendment to strengthen the language here.<\/p><p>  I also want to make reference to further comments made by Conor Brady more recently at an event both the Minister and I attended with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Law Society.  He spoke about how often GSOC would be stopped in its tracks with an investigation by being told certain information was not available to it or would be very delayed on the basis that it was a national security issue.<\/p><p>We need to ensure this is supervised to ensure it is not used as a mechanism to hamper GSOC investigations.  I may seek to amend the legislation to reflect this, perhaps with the introduction of an independent adjudicator, as suggested by Mr. Brady, or perhaps a judge, who could decide whether such information should be given out on these grounds.  That is important and I believe the Minister and I are in agreement on it.  Independent oversight is necessary here.<br\/><br\/>Consider the issue of accountability concerning questions.  It has been brought to my attention by journalist Gemma O&rsquo;Doherty in recent days that she has reported that former Garda Commissioner Mr. Martin Callinan had penalty points for speeding terminated.  He confirmed this in an article in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  Ms O&rsquo;Doherty asserts she was fired a number of weeks after that story was published, and she is taking a number of legal cases in regard to that.  She has advised me she has come into possession of new information.  On that basis, she submitted a number of questions to the Acting Garda Commissioner, which the latter has refused to answer, as is evident from the e-mail.  The questions, which Ms O'Doherty sent to the Minister also, are as follows.  What was the basis for the termination of Mr. Callinan&rsquo;s speeding fine?  There was no indication of the reason on the PULSE printout.  Why was Mr. Callinan not using an official Garda car on the day he was caught speeding given that he was on official Garda business?  Did he drive to work on the day he incurred his speeding ticket?  What time did he start work that day?  Was the meeting he was speeding to pre-planned?  Was this meeting recorded in his diary?  Was he aware of this meeting?  Was anyone with Mr. Callanan in his car when he was caught speeding?  Was a written report made of his meeting?  At what time did the meeting begin and end?  What was the location of the meeting?  Did Mr. Callanan return to Garda headquarters after the meeting?  Did he claim mileage or subsistence allowance for the day in question?  Were there any other occasions on which Mr. Callanan used his private car for Garda business?  All of these questions are now on the record of the D&aacute;il.  Since the Acting Garda Commissioner has not provided the information, I ask that the Minister provide it.  It is a very serious matter and there is considerable public interest in it.  I hope the Minister can obtain the answers to the questions that the Acting Garda Commissioner has refused to give.<br\/><br\/>While some of the recent submissions to the Oireachtas committee recommended the abolition of the inspectorate and the effective merging of its role and that of GSOC, Sinn F&eacute;in believes a different approach would be more effective.  We advocate the broadening of the role of the inspectorate to that of a criminal justice inspectorate.  In a similar fashion to the way in which the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, conducts inspections of various institutions within the health sector, we believe the criminal justice inspectorate should have a similar role within the justice sector.  It would be primarily responsible for the effectiveness and efficiency of the workings of organisations within the criminal justice sector.  That would include both inspection and reporting of its examination of policies, operational practices and procedures across the sectoral organisations specified in any new legislation and work to ensure public confidence is maintained.  It should also have responsibility for laying its reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<br\/><br\/>The bodies we want to see under the remit of the proposed criminal justice inspectorate include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, GSOC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Probation Service, the Courts Service and the Irish Youth Justice Service.  The Oireachtas justice committee made the same call.  The model in the North is working very well and I am sure the Minister can establish that with her ministerial colleague, Mr. David Ford, MLA.<br\/><br\/>I want to move on to the membership of the commission.  Section 13 sets out that &quot;'member of the Ombudsman Commission' means a member of the Ombudsman Commission appointed under section 65 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005&quot;.  This legislation sets out that the commission is to consist of three members.  I do not agree with this.  I firmly believe there should be only one ombudsman.  Again, the Oireachtas justice committee recommended changing the structure of GSOC so as to have one ombudsman rather than three commissioners, stating a single ombudsman would ensure greater accountability and no possibility of dissenting opinions or divergence in the ombudsman's findings.  Consequent to the committee&rsquo;s initiative, we went to the North and Scotland to look at the models there.  We were impressed with the approach in those jurisdictions.<br\/><br\/>I will seek to submit an amendment regarding section 65(1) of the 2005 Act to change the structure of the commission so that, instead of having three commissioners, there will be a single Garda ombudsman.  Earlier this year, my party launched its contribution based on its experiences of all the submissions made in this State and the experiences of our team who negotiated the changes to policing in the North.  We do not have all the wisdom and I do not contend the former RUC is in any way comparable to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but there are lessons in the North to be learnt in the context of the new beginning there, the policing board, the police ombudsman and the criminal justice inspectorate that could comprise a useful contribution to reforms in this State.  Our document was circulated to all Oireachtas Members, and I invite those who have not had an opportunity to take a look through it.  It is our considered contribution but it is not definitive.<br\/><br\/>We in Sinn F&eacute;in believe in a new beginning to policing similar to what happened in the Six Counties.  The Morris tribunal happened owing to the failure and abuse of the power of some police officers in my county at the time in question.  That was to be the new beginning.  We had the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act and GSOC was established, in addition to the Garda Inspectorate, etc.  These matters are in evolution.  We now have an opportunity to consider best practice internationally and ensure we really give the ombudsman the teeth and powers it requires.  One of the big criticisms of the ombudsman is the demoralising length of time it takes to deal with a complaint.  While the Minister has allocated some additional resources, she will probably need to allocate more in terms of the new powers and responsibilities it will have, and of course the existing investigations with which the office is already being asked to deal.<br\/><br\/>I feel very strongly about and ask the Minister to consider seriously the formation of a criminal justice inspectorate that would examine the overall picture within the justice system.  There is the recommendation from the Oireachtas justice committee and a model in the North.  While I commend Mr. Bob Olson, Chief Inspector of the Garda Inspectorate, and his predecessors, I believe they need more teeth.  We need bigger-picture analysis and to consider the full picture of what is happening in the justice system.  The Minister has received the submission on that.  We want to see a new dispensation in order to achieve more strengthened and sustainable reform that can deliver a modern 21st-century policing service now and in the future.  We need to see freedom from partisan political control or influence, operational independence and policing with the community to develop maximum confidence in the policing service and maximise co-operation between citizens and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>As I said at the outset, I welcome this Bill and am happy with the majority of its content.  However, as I have outlined, there are a number of ways in which it can be strengthened, and I will seek to do this on Committee Stage.  I look forward to working with the Minister in this regard.<br\/><br\/>The Minister should not underestimate the anger of some of the families who contacted me today and whom I am sure have been in contact with the Minister also.  They have made profound allegations, substantiated by considerable documentation, and submitted them to the Minister&rsquo;s office.  They have been referred to the independent panel of senior counsel and may end up being subject to independent inquiries.  The families believe the Minister has not commented on their cases.  She has made no comment whatsoever.  She has not agreed to meet the families, nor has the Taoiseach.  The Minister should be very clear that the precedent she has set today is the one that will have to be honoured in terms of consistency.  She will be held to account on her approach to all cases because the one she referred to today is subject to considerable review by the ombudsman and to an independent review of the DPP.  There is a very clear process under way, as the Minister knows.  She has chosen to comment on it, as is her absolute right, but I will hold her to account to ensure consistency.  If the Minister decides to refer this matter to the Oireachtas justice committee, I will ensure all the families who are waiting to be heard get the same treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100040#NN00400","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413916200,"counter":455,"content":"<p>That is quite a manipulation of comments I made today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100041#OO00200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1413916200,"counter":456,"content":"<p>No.  Today she chose to be politically opportunistic but the difficulty is that she is the Minister responsible for justice and must apply the same standard to families in this jurisdiction who await justice and afford them the courtesy of a meeting in which to outline their case face to face with her.

I welcome the Bill and the debate.  More importantly, I acknowledge the urgent need for reform and radical change in the justice system.  This is part of a boarder jigsaw, but we need action and an end to all of the talk that has gone on over the past six or seven months.<\/p><p>  In recent months, we have seen the former Minister for Justice and Equality go, we have seen the Garda Commissioner go and we have seen the Secretary General move sideways.  This all went on while people were being attacked and slaughtered and shot on the streets in a wave of violent gun crime and at times, I felt that the Members in here were distracted from a lot of the real issues in the communities.  We have seen trust damaged and the people suffer and live with the consequences.  The people of the poor areas suffer more than the rest of society and the rest of society and the establishment merely looks the other way.  It is important that we deal with these important issues in this legislation.<\/p><p>  Tonight I want to be a different voice.  I want to be a voice for radical change, a voice for reform, a voice for good-quality policing and, above all, a voice for a new Garda policing service.  That is the way forward, that is the future and that is the direction that we have to go.<\/p><p>  We also need a bit of good old-fashioned community policing where the garda knows the person and the person knows him or her.  Some will mock that view in the Ireland of 2014, but it is still relevant today, and the Minister and the Government need to wake up to that fact.  A good garda does not deserve the respect of the community; he or she will earn it.  Good old-fashioned public service is the way forward.  When we look at this legislation, that is what we must think of constantly.<\/p><p>  The Bill seeks to expand the powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  This includes surveillance powers for criminal investigations and allowing GSOC to investigate the Garda Commissioner - with the consent of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Bill also provides for GSOC to instigate examinations of Garda practices and procedures and the Garda Inspectorate to initiate inspections without the prior approval of the Minister of Justice and Equality.  That is the detail of the Bill and that is why I am supporting it.<\/p><p>  When dealing with this legislation, it is important to look at broader issues as well.  At times, within the Bill it is also important to look at other options and go a little further.<\/p><p>  It has been argued that moves in democratic countries towards greater civilian oversight of the police can be attributed to beliefs that internal mechanisms may be biased.  Public demand for civilian oversight has acquired an edge because of the widely held perception that police superiors tend to protect their subordinates.  The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime has identified the key features of successful police oversight police systems.  These include powers such as those provided for in the Bill.  I emphasise that we need oversight, accountability and good-quality policing, and any democratic society will look seriously at this.<\/p><p>  We can learn from commissions of the pasts.  In recent years, there was the Patten Commission report on policing in Northern Ireland.  It identified two aspects of police accountability &ndash; &quot;subordinate or obedient&quot; and &quot;explanatory and cooperative&quot; &ndash; which were explained as follows.  In a democracy, policing, in order to be effective, must be based on consent across the community.  The community recognises the legitimacy of the policing task, confers authority on police personnel in carrying out their role in policing and actively supports them.  Consent is not unconditional, but depends on proper accountability, and the police should be accountable in two senses &ndash; the &quot;subordinate or obedient&quot; sense and the &quot;explanatory and cooperative&quot; sense.  In the subordinate sense, police are employed by the community to provide a service and the community should have the means to ensure that it gets the service it needs and that its money is spent wisely.  Police are also subordinate to the law, just as other citizens are subordinate to the law, and there should be robust arrangements to ensure that this is so, and seen to be so.  In the explanatory and co-operative sense, public and police must communicate with each other and work in partnership, both to maintain trust between them and to ensure effective policing, because policing is not a task for the police alone.  These relevant points arose in the Patten report.  In the broader debate, it is important that we highlight these issues as well.<\/p><p>  I also speak as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The committee conducted a review of effectiveness of the 2005 Act and considered submissions on the potential reform of the present oversight mechanisms.  A lot of hard work was done.  I welcome the fact that the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Stanton, is here tonight to listen and participate in the debate because the oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is an important issue and the measure is an important legislative measure.<\/p><p>  During the committee's hearings, there were many excellent oral submissions from human rights groups, Travellers' groups, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Bar Council, members of the public and journalists.  They all made a significant contribution.  It is important that we heard the voices of those who are directly affected by this piece of legislation.  I would mention Ms Brigid Quilligan and Mr. Damien Walshe from the Irish Traveller Movement who made an excellent submission on policing and dealing with minority communities.  It is important to highlight that the poorer and marginalised sections of society must be listened to when one is drafting legislation.  In this debate, I want to represent their views tonight as well.<\/p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been the police force in Ireland since the foundation of the State.  The force has enjoyed good levels of support and public confidence.  It was set up without any external scrutiny beyond the Department.  That has been the case, but recently that trust has been damaged.  We need to win back that trust and the community needs to see that we act on these issues.<\/p><p>  The lack of oversight continued up to 1984 when a complaints board was established.  The board was termed &quot;independent&quot;, although it comprised the Garda Commissioner, or his nominee and Government appointed members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100042#PP01900","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1413916800,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Irish Water: Motion [Private Members]","time":1413917400,"counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100043#QQ00050"},{"type":"speech","time":1413917400,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:notes:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the 2009 Fine Gael Party NewERA document advocated the establishment of Irish Water;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the announcement of the Irish Water Charges Plan on 30th September and the introduction of the new domestic water tariff system on 1st October;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the &euro;172 million set-up costs of Irish Water;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the &euro;80 million being spent on consultants within the set-up of Irish Water;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the &euro;500 million ongoing estimated spend on water metering across the country;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the &euro;300 million in total annual domestic revenue accruing to Irish Water;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the performance related award bonus structure within Irish Water; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the 700 staff due to be employed within Irish Water by the end of 2015;<br \/><br \/>further notes:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government&rsquo;s plans to subsidise Irish Water's domestic revenue stream through several options by an estimated &euro;125 million;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the estimated domestic revenue stream, after Government subsidies, of approximately &euro;150 million - &euro;175 million; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the number of changes to the water charges system introduced by the Government since 1st October;<br \/><br \/>condemns:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government's failure to address excessive spending on outside consultants;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the lack of information for members of the public and lack of a complaints system;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the lack of communications between the Oireachtas and Irish Water;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the lack of additional spending on the water infrastructure network; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government's refusal to acknowledge the ability to pay or otherwise; and<br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; fully review the appropriateness of the Irish Water model from a funding and service delivery point of view;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; assess the actual sustainability of the funding streams of Irish Water;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; confirm that it has no intention of privatising Irish Water;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; establish an equitable regime for reliefs on domestic water tariffs;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure the body is subjected to full Oireachtas scrutiny, not just internal political party forums; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; cease any payment of bonuses within Irish Water.<\/blockquote>I wish to share time with Deputies Se&aacute;n Fleming and O'Dea.<br\/><br\/>This is the third time we have had to use Private Members' business to raise the issue of water charges and the setting up of Irish Water, and in an effort to highlight the unmitigated disaster it has been.  I have also published various Bills in an effort to amend the legislation which gave effect to the setting up, ongoing maintenance and administration of Irish Water.  On each and every occasion we were voted down and largely ignored, yet the problems never went away, the costs were never reduced and people&rsquo;s fears were never addressed.  The problem that was, and still is, Irish Water, was allowed to drift, and the runaway train continues apace.<br\/><br\/>We failed to divert the initial course of action by the Government, which created a gold-plated, bonus-driven, super quango.  We were not alone in that regard.  PricewaterhouseCoopers, PWC, was commissioned by the Government to carry out a report and it advised against the vehicle that became Irish Water.  We then focused on the many deficiencies within the legislation, which was not open to debate.  We say now what we said then, namely, that the provisions of the legislation will impinge on people&rsquo;s ability to pay for a system that is not fit for purpose.  One could ask whether we should we be forced to have to take that route.  Of course we should not.<br\/><br\/>The role of the Opposition is to seek to hold the Government to account.  In order for Government to allow the D&aacute;il to work effectively on behalf of citizens, it must provide that legislation is analysed and scrutinised.  That was most definitely not the case with the legislation to give effect to the quango in question.  If it had been, many issues and problems that have ensued might have been identified.  Those problems now have the potential to derail Irish Water.  Many citizens are frustrated, fearful, worried, annoyed and definitely very angry.  They are angry to such an extent that many feel it necessary to follow a path of disobedience.  Such a course of action threatens the ability of the Government and this House to bring the public with them towards meaningful recovery for all; rich and poor, young and old, employed and unemployed, public and private sector, urban dwellers and rural dwellers.  Divisions have been created that will be hard to mend.  The situation will ultimately lead to a grave distrust of the Government.  As trust subsides, Governments panic and bad governance sets in.  When backbenchers panic, governance will get worse.  As the Government's once massive mandate weakens it finds itself at a crossroads.  One of those roads leads to an election.  Last week some Government Deputies described the budget as an election budget.  I caution them to be careful what they wish for in that regard.<br\/><br\/>Fine Gael and Labour made many commitments in the previous election campaign.  Having vehemently opposed the tough yet progressive budgets which achieved two thirds of the fiscal adjustments to consolidate the economy, the Government promised to steer a different path.  Fine Gael and Labour said they would not be a party to the tough but necessary corrective measures.  The public accepted their analysis and argument.  People had seen them vote against such budgets and their associated finance Bills.  They had promised a softer and easier way.  They said the troika agreement would be torn up.  In addition to the softer and easier way, the two parties promised a new politics, a democratic revolution that would include report cards for Ministers.  They said there would be no hooky appointments to State boards or other such bodies but what we got was very different.  What we got was a recognition that the fiscal consolidation path had to be continued, the four-year programme and the targets it contained would after all continue under the new Government with its new politics of democratic revolution.  Hence, the Tesco advertisements were binned, the red line issues were deleted, the five-point plan was silenced; the strategic investment bank was quelled, to name but a few of the promised initiatives.  The Government had also to rid itself of the statement the Labour Party made about Frankfurt's way.<br\/><br\/>In addition, there was the infamous explanation for the reason people were let down; that it is what one does during an election.  That was another item to add to the bin.  The expensive advisers that were to be ditched were hired with gusto and their associated payment caps were also thrown in the bin.  The only advice they could give in order to plough ahead was to blame Fianna F&aacute;il and that might have won the Government the previous election.  I do not say who will win the next election but if the Government continues along the same path, it will not win another election.<br\/><br\/>Fianna F&aacute;il achieved 450,000 votes in 2011.  The party in government did two thirds of the heavy lifting necessary to achieve fiscal consolidation and allow a prospect of growth.  The party achieved more votes and seats than any other party in the local elections.  Fianna F&aacute;il had discussions with the troika on several occasions since the D&aacute;il was convened.  The troika reiterated to us, other Opposition parties and Independent Members that the financial targets were the bottom line, not the detail.  All those factors determine that we have a duty and mandate, as well as many others, to participate and to engage and recommend paths to recovery.  We were ignored on Irish Water.  The Government can ignore us at its peril, but it should be very careful about ignoring the public.  It does so at its peril.<br\/><br\/>On assuming office, Fine Gael wanted to broaden the tax base.  That is a credible and understandable objective.  However, one would assume that to achieve it, the parameters would have to be right, the preparations would have to be thorough, the public would have to be won over to the concept, the procedure, the path and its delivery.  Property tax and water charges were the means chosen by the Government to achieve such a broadening of the tax base but it would have to be done fast by a tough Minister in a strict timeframe.  The tough Minister in question would need an incentive, a carrot.  He would also require a line that would not trouble Fine Gael or Labour either as they would have to be brought along to support the endeavour.  The Minister appointed by the Taoiseach was Phil Hogan.  The timeframe was three years, the carrot was Brussels and the political line was that it was Fianna F&aacute;il's fault anyway.  With its ducks in a row, and its target in sight, the Taoiseach and the Economic Management Council, EMC, consisting of the then T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, of the Labour Party, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, from Fine Gael and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, also from the Labour Party, with the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, would pursue the target and the carrot with gusto.<br\/><br\/>We know now that most of the Cabinet would be kept in dark about the mechanism used to fund the quango.  Ministers did not have to feign surprise last January when they were told about the cost of consultants.  They were surprised and they were not aware of the facts, as they should have been, but that is the way the Government works.  The members of the EMC disregard many of their ministerial colleagues.  Not only were members of the Cabinet ignored but the Minister of State with responsibility to for the implementation of NewERA, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, was ignored if he was not prepared to toe the line.  The Opposition was ignored and debate was shut down.  The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, was to be instructed on policy and Irish Water was told to plough ahead and set up its pay systems and bonuses.  Local authority managers were told they could resign or retire, get their packages and get a new job in Irish Water.  Irish Water could do as it liked.  It could get the charges as quickly as possible and swell the Government's coffers for future tax giveaways and election victories.  However, the Government did not bank on John Tierney's interview with Sean O'Rourke.  Only then did the chickens find their way home and consider roosting.  The cat was out of the bag, but the Government said to plough on regardless.  Furthermore, it instructed Irish Water and the CER to plough on regardless.  The Government never banked on a resilient nation, a persistent Opposition, the local election results, the by-election results or people power, as exemplified in the march that took place last Saturday week.<\/p><p>This weekend&rsquo;s announcements by RTE following our parliamentary question last week eventually proved what we suspected all along, that Irish Water as set up by this Government, by every member of the parties associated with it, is nothing but a gold-plated, bonus-driven super quango.  The Government would not do it before but now is the time for an honest, open, frank debate; now is the time to initiate an appropriate review of Irish Water and its ability to be a service provider.  In the meantime, all impending charges need to be suspended.<\/p><p> To set this debate in its proper context the D&aacute;il needs to acknowledge and note some facts.  In 2009 it was Fine Gael, not the troika, which in its NewERA document advocated the setting up of Irish Water.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, I believe, was at the heart of it.  I would very much like to know who were the consultants hired to initiate that plan.  I ask the D&aacute;il to note that it cost &euro;172 million to set up; I ask the D&aacute;il to note that &euro;80 million has been spent on consultants; I ask the D&aacute;il to note that &euro;500 million has been spent on metering; I ask the D&aacute;il to note further the categoric and unambiguous fact that there are performance-related bonus structures in Irish Water, despite what the then Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, said last January, that there is no bonus culture in Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann nor will there be in Irish Water.  I ask the House to call on all its Members from Fine Gael and the Labour Party as well as ourselves, to condemn the Government for its failure to address excessive spending on consultants and the set-up costs; for its lack of information provided to the public, whether by CER or Irish Water or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government; for the lack of a complaints system which should be enshrined in any such body; and for the lack of an adequate communication system for Oireachtas Members.  This is the second or third time we have raised this issue in the House.  We raised it last year, in September, October and November and Departments refused to answer questions about Irish Water tabled by me and others.  The conceited, underhanded nature in which the body was configured from a monetary perspective allowed the Government to avoid answering questions.  The Government gave a commitment in January or February which it has not honoured and we are now at the end of October.<\/p><p> I ask the D&aacute;il to condemn the lack of additional spending that is evident in the same Irish Water.  The three-year spending programme of &euro;1.7 billion announced earlier this year was not a red cent more than was given in capital expenditure by the previous manner in which funds were expended in this area.  I condemn the Government for the lack of a mechanism of an inability-to-pay clause.<\/p><p> When I think of the ongoing concerted effort by Government to keep the public in the dark and all the double-speak we have heard, I am reminded of what has been said in recent months.  The Taoiseach spoke on this issue in the House on several occasions.  He initially said that children would not have to pay for water, that there would be no charge.  He subsequently said that children would be given 38,000 litres free and then he said it would be 21,000 litres.  He said the average charge would be &euro;240 but it is far from it.  The Taoiseach admitted that Irish Water has had a few teething problems.  I refer to what we have been told in recent days.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, said Irish Water needs to be more customer-friendly; the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, said that Irish Water needs to work on its PR; the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, said he met with Irish Water two weeks ago and he expressed concern about the bonuses; and a total of 20 Fine Gael Deputies spoke out last week at a parliamentary party meeting saying that they had a problem with the communications in Irish Water but they had no problem in marching up to vote for it.  I remind the 20 Deputies, wherever they are, and the Labour Party Deputies, that nobody but themselves set up Irish Water.  They would not listen to anyone because they took their orders from the top down and they were kept in the dark.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100043#QQ00100","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413918000,"counter":481,"content":"<p>Big Phil.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100044#RR00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1413918000,"counter":482,"content":"<p>We were not allowed to contribute to the debate and we were not allowed to show those opposite that some of the measures could not work.

I want the Government to enshrine in this Irish Water model, which it has pushed ahead, an equitable regime that has at its core an ability-to-pay clause.  I want the Government once again to provide an assurance that there will be full accountable scrutiny of this body by the Oireachtas, that when Members of the Oireachtas make inquiries and raise concerns and when they wish to make representations on behalf of their constituents, they will be treated with a bit of respect which their constituents deserve.  The cat is out of the bag and the game is up - Se&aacute;n O'Rourke saw to that last January.  The Government gave commitments which have not been honoured and only when they are honoured can the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, be told that the scratching might stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100044#RR00600","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1413918000,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Cowen, for tabling this motion on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  We are discussing what is becoming the increasingly discredited super quango, Irish Water.  The whole country is furious about this matter.  The Government has a D&aacute;il majority of well over 100 Members but I am looking around now and I count only four Members present on the other side.  The Government side of the House is not listening - its Members are not even here to listen and there is not a single member of the Government present.  It reminds me of last Tuesday evening, the day of the budget.  The Ministers delivered their scripts but it was an inconvenience for them to have to come into the House to deliver their scripts because as the Taoiseach said they had to speak to the nation by means of press conferences with the national media.  Once they had delivered their scripts they left the Chamber, as did every other Minister and more than 100 Members on the Government side.  We were left with four Members from the Government parties to listen to what the Opposition had to say.<\/p><p>The same level of arrogance and contempt for the Chamber is being displayed this evening.  It is no wonder the Government is having trouble with Irish Water.  The principal reason for this is that it is not listening.  It is not listening to the people, to the professional advisers who presented a report on the flawed model with which the Government proceeded, or to the Oireachtas.  The longer it tries to run the House like an absentee landlord, the more trouble it will get in.<\/p><p> Only four members of the Government parties out of well over 100 are present, with no member of the Cabinet.  It is a repeat of what the Government did last Tuesday.  It might do it again next Tuesday and the following Tuesday, but while it can run away from the Oireachtas, it cannot run away from the public in 12 months time or whenever the election is held.  Let it be a salutary lesson.  Members of the Government parties will wonder why the people will be cross with them.  If the people look at this debate, and it should be borne in mind that it is being broadcast on a couple of television stations as we speak, they will see the contempt the Government is showing for the debate on Irish Water.  It showed contempt when it established Irish Water.  It guillotined the legislation last December and did not allow a debate.  It showed contempt.  If I were to characterise the performance of the Government on the Irish Water fiasco, I would say one word sums it up, and that is &quot;contempt&quot;.  The Government has shown it every single step of the way.<\/p><p> The Government has sought in recent days to blame the chief executive.  We are not here to defend John Tierney, but he is one of the finest public servants and has an excellent track record at delivering to the detail on Government policy.  The reason the Government is unhappy with him is because he is delivering its policy of which it is now ashamed and from which it is trying to run and hide.  The running and hiding will stop, because it will have to face the electorate in the ballot box.<\/p><p> The Government blames the management of Irish Water for communication.  Not a single issue upsetting the people is the fault of Irish Water.  The Government regulator, who is not independent, was given his instructions and procedures to follow and told the parameters by which he could arrive at his decision.  The Government regulator set the price.  The Government regulator announced the free water allowances.  The bonuses were approved by the former Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, who is in the House, because it is part of Bord G&aacute;is and he approved them within Bord G&aacute;is.  Ervia, the parent company, also runs Bord G&aacute;is, and Deputy Rabbitte was aware at all stages of the bonus culture in the organisation establishing Irish Water.  The former Minister, Mr. Hogan, was the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100044#RR00700","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413918600,"counter":488,"content":"<p>For the record, I did not approve that bonus scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100045#SS00200","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1413918600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Deputy Rabbitte was aware of the bonus culture.  I did not ask him whether he signed up to the jocose bonus culture we now have, whereby even those who do not do their work or show up will receive a bonus.  If he had inquired, which was his job, about what bonus regime was in place in Bord G&aacute;is, he would have known what would follow into Irish Water.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, signed up to the fiasco with regard to the PPS numbers, because Irish Water will consult the Department of Social Protection, which is responsible for PPS numbers.  This could not have been done without the Minister having agreed to it.  We asked time and again for Irish Water to be included under the freedom of information legislation.  A third Labour Party Minister, Deputy Howlin, refused to do this, but eventually he was forced to do so.  The former Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, knew about the bonus culture in Bord G&aacute;is, which is running this operation.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, approved the PPS arrangement whereby people must include the PPS numbers on the application forms.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, tried to keep it from being subject to the freedom of information legislation by establishing it as a semi-State company.<br\/><br\/>The possible privatisation of Irish Water is a live issue which upsets the people.  I find one sentence in the Government amendment to the motion grossly hypocritical.  It states the Government recognises the legislation establishing Irish Water prohibits the privatisation of the company.  One vote, one guillotine and one whim of the Government can change this outright overnight.  Members of the Government know all it takes is for the Government to come in some fine day and change it.  This was voted in without the Opposition present.  The Government did not allow a debate and the Opposition could only do what it could, which was leave the Chamber, after which the Government proceeded with a guillotine.  A simple vote of the Government can change what is in the legislation.  Any assurance from the Government that it will not privatise Irish Water counts for nothing because it only holds for as long as the vote lasts, and at a future date a Fine Gael Government will try to privatise Irish Water.<br\/><br\/>The people are returning to sender their application forms for their free allowance <i>en masse<\/i>, and there are not just boxloads of them in post offices throughout the country.  I had it confirmed to me this morning that pallet loads of forms with &quot;return to sender&quot; on them, returned by the people, are in An Post sorting offices throughout the country.  This is what the people think of what the Government is doing.<br\/><br\/>Measures on tax credits and social protection were announced last week in the budget.  Despite these hasty measures, many people were left out.  Those who do not pay income tax or who are on low incomes are excluded, as are people who lose their jobs and receive jobseeker's allowance.  How did the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, come in here and tell the people if they lose their job and go on jobseeker's allowance they will not receive any allowance because they are not in receipt of the fuel allowance?  Only people on long-term jobseeker's allowance receive this and those out of work for up to 12 or 14 months will not be able to avail of it.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Kelly, to the House.  We now have five Members of the Government parties out of more than 100, and at least one member of the Cabinet has shown up at this late stage.<br\/><br\/>The people have lost confidence in Irish Water.  The Minister is presiding over this floundering around him.  It is not too late to go back to the drawing board.  A key measure left out of the legislation from the very beginning is recognition of the ability of people to pay.  The Government's ham-fisted efforts last week were panic-driven because of the people it saw on the streets the previous weekend.  This is only making the people angrier.<br\/><br\/>The only thing Irish Water has done since being established is to spend &euro;500 million on installing meters and &euro;180 million on consultants and a billing system.  Irish Water is not spending one additional euro on investment in the network or water and sewage treatment plants compared with what was spent the previous year by the local authorities - not one single euro.  When one considers the amount that subsidies will cost taxpayers, through tax credits and people receiving social welfare allowances, the net income of Irish Water will only be approximately &euro;175 million per annum.  It will take four years to recoup the funds invested in the meters, consultants and the billing system based on the revenue from the domestic charges the Government hopes people will pay next year.  This is assuming a relatively high number of people pay their bills.  The Government is threatening the financial viability of Irish Water, and in doing so it will have to recoup the cost over the coming years and less will be spent on the infrastructure rather than more, which is needed.<br\/><br\/>Fianna F&aacute;il is telling the Government it is not too late to go back to the drawing board.  It should do so now.  We are stating clearly and unambiguously that it is time for a comprehensive review on the role and performance of Irish Water in its entirety.  Do not rule out closing down that ugly shop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100045#SS00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1413918600,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cowen for tabling this motion.  A total of 750,000 people in the country, that is one in six, live below the poverty line.  Hundreds of thousands more are struggling just barely above that line.  The population as a whole has been battered by year after year of austerity, cuts, charges and impositions of all sorts, both covert and overt.  Against this background the least that people are decently entitled to expect is that where the Government establishes a body, regardless of what type of body it is, to impose another charge on these battered taxpayers, the interaction between this body and the taxpayers who will be charged should be clear, transparent and coherent.  Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, among others, has told us, and we do not have to take his word for it because we see it every day, that Irish Water is acting in a way which is the polar opposite of this transparency, accountability and openness.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>It is opaque, distant and even disinterested.<\/p><p> I will give the House some examples of my interaction with Irish Water to illustrate what I am saying.  Some time ago I telephoned Irish Water with a simple query.  I am lucky enough to own a second house in Limerick and I have it converted to use as a constituency office.  I wanted an answer to the simple question as to how that is treated for water tax purposes.  Is it in the same category as a holiday home?  Is it an unoccupied building?  What is it exactly?  The gentleman who answered said, &quot;Well, Deputy, that's a very interesting question, but I can't answer it.  I'll have to put you on to somebody higher up&quot;.  He duly put me on to somebody higher up and the reply I got from the somebody higher up was, &quot;Well, Deputy, that is a most interesting question, but we don't have the answer to it.  I'll have to put you further up again&quot;.  So I went up and up; I almost finished on the roof.  Eventually when I got to the key man he told me - guess what - &quot;That's a very interesting question.  I don't have the answer, but give me your mobile phone number and I'll ring you back within the hour&quot;.  That was five weeks ago and I have not heard a word back from that man since.<\/p><p> Undeterred by my failure in that regard, because of countless constituents who have queried why they need to submit their PPS numbers, I contacted Irish Water again with a simple question.  Why do people, for example, those who are being assessed and who know what their liability will be, have to submit their PPS numbers?  As a matter of fact, why do I, as a citizen, have to submit my PPS number?  I got straight through to the top on this occasion, I am glad to say.  The gentleman's first response was shameless blackmail.  He said, &quot;You go and tell your constituents that if they don't give their PPS numbers, they won't get their allowances&quot;.  I reminded him that was not the question I asked him at all; I wanted a clear rationale for why people had to submit their PPS numbers.  He went into an explanation and to my amazement I could not understand the language he was speaking.  After a while I figured it out; it was a variant of the English language, called incoherent gibberish.  I would have been better off if the man had been talking Swahili because then I would know why I did not understand what he was saying.  George Orwell said that the function of political language is often &quot;to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind&quot;.  If that is the case, the function of the language of Irish Water is to give the appearance of pure balderdash to - well - pure balderdash.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100045#SS00400","speaker":"1059","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413919200,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Hurricane Willie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100046#TT00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1413919200,"counter":493,"content":"<p>One speaker, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100046#TT00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1413919200,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Undeterred by my failure at verbal communication, I sent an e-mail and got a response back late last night that stated, \"The PPS numbers have to be submitted to ensure that correct water allowances are allocated to the correct recipients\".  That is a very interesting answer because it tells us that Irish Water is starting from the premise that the entirety - or almost the entirety - of the population are shysters, fraudsters and gangsters who will deliberately submit false returns and poor old Irish Water will give 5 million allowances to 1.5 million houses.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners, who collect tax in this country, take people on trust.  A person fills out a tax return outlining his or her circumstances.  In most cases that will not be examined as they take people on trust.  There is a spot-check, and anybody caught cheating the system will be dealt with very severely and properly so.  I cannot understand why Irish Water cannot do something similar.<\/p><p>  The Minister ought to be aware of a court case in the past three weeks where two people were successfully prosecuted and convicted for obtaining information from the Department of Social Protection - namely people's addresses - by giving the Department of Social Protection PPS numbers which they had got from credit unions.  That should illustrate, if illustration was needed, the danger of people's most confidential information - their PPS numbers - getting into the hands of a third party.<\/p><p>  I have received no coherent explanation from Irish Water as to why I, as a citizen, should submit my PPS number and I have absolutely no intention of doing so.  At the end of the day, when I get my water bill I will pay it, but I will deduct the allowance to which I am legally entitled.  At that point Irish Water with its serried armies of consultants laden down with taxpayers' largesse, employees laden down with bonuses and directors, who regard their responsibility as of such importance that it is only secondary to driving the Minister's car, can all come after me if they wish.<\/p><p>  In addition I made a further effort to get information on this by tabling a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, who is sitting across from us now looking pensive.  I asked him what my constituents - and constituents of very other Member of this House - are asking.  Why do people have to submit their PPS numbers?  I was not alone; in fairness, Deputies Clare Daly and Catherine Murphy tabled similar questions.  I had to laugh out loud at the sheer irony of the Taoiseach's statement this morning that the real problem here was that there was not enough communication.  What sort of communication did we get from the Minister, Deputy Kelly?  We got a one-line arrogant reply stating that the situation was unchanged and outlining Irish Water's telephone number with a recommendation to use it.

I fully accept this.

There is a need to directly address many issues that have arisen and I intend to do so in this debate.

This is about the creation of one of the largest utilities in the history of the State and it was never going to be a simple task.<\/p><p> Addressing legitimate issues of concern arising, however, is essential to maintain public trust and confidence.

The result has been a national leakage rate of 49%; inadequate wastewater treatment, with untreated sewage discharging into 42 urban areas, for example, putting rivers and bathing waters at risk of pollution; Ireland going on formal notice of an EU infringement case, requiring wastewater improvements at 66 urban centres; a total of 22,181 people are on boil water notices, and a further 945,000 people dependent on drinking water supplies at risk of failing required standards - these include the major but antiquated drinking water schemes on the Lee Road in Cork and the Vartry Scheme in Dublin, both critical for our two major cities; and insufficient supply for the greater Dublin area.  While most major European capital cities have a spare capacity of between 15 and 20%, Dublin has a surplus capacity ranging between 1% and 4%.<\/p><p>  Future challenges also make the need for a more cost effective, efficient and nationally orientated system imperative.  Our population is increasing, and is forecast to increase in the coming decades.  Our economy is recovering, bringing with it added water demand for industry and agriculture and we have to meet these challenges.  These challenges result in large part from decades of under investment, with the bulk of that time presided over by Governments led by the party that tabled the motion.  A total of &euro;600 million should be invested every year in capital infrastructure to ensure our public system of treatment plants and networks is adequate for modern requirements and operations, yet recent investment levels have stood at just over &euro;300 million per annum.<\/p><p>  Under investment is not the system's only difficulty.  Local authorities have demonstrated commitment and great dedication to water services for well over a century, but 34 separate water services authorities providing services and infrastructure unilaterally for the most part have not, and could not have, achieved the best public water system. An example of this is in the lack of economies of scale identified in the independent assessment on establishing a public water utility.  Operating expenditure per connection, for example, is more than twice the average of UK water companies.<\/p><p>  The only way these deficiencies could be rectified, the infrastructure deficit removed, the problems of quality addressed and inefficiencies tackled was by creating a single, national utility and a new funding model.  All parties will be aware that the public water and wastewater systems will not improve without a national approach.  All parties will be also aware that the best way to secure the necessary expansion in infrastructure and to ensure spending on water services is accountable and the standards of quality expected by the public are achieved is by creating a direct relationship between the water user and the service provider where funding goes from one to the other, and where the expected standards are received in return.  We are all aware of the previous funding model for water services.  However, Members should ask the people on boil notices over 12 years if this model has worked for them.  If water is condemned forever to compete with health, education and housing for essential funding, we simply will not be able to address the major difficulties that exist within our water system and we, as a Government, will be condemned for not facing up to this reality.<\/p><p>  Against this backdrop, I would like to take this opportunity to dispel certain myths that have grown around the establishment of Irish water.  First, it cannot be privatised.  This is the law of the land.  While this is a legitimate concern many people have, it is based on falsehood and it cannot happen.  I would also like to address the issue of start-up costs of Irish Water, which is important.  I accept again that people need reassurance about this issue.  That is why it is necessary that such costs be examined by independent experts with experience in utility management.  That was part of the job of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  The conclusion at which it arrived was that 95% of the establishment costs were justified and 5% of the budgeted costs should not proceed.  I accept that it was incorrect to refer to too many of these costs as &quot;consultant&quot; costs.  Much of this was related to costs associated with building the company's systems using outside expertise but I reiterate that after all the establishment costs of Irish Water were independently assessed, 95% were justified, warranted and necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100047#UU00500","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1413919800,"counter":509,"content":"<p>What about bonuses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100047#UU00600","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1413919800,"counter":510,"content":"<p>This was done on the basis that these initial costs will enable the company to drive substantial cost savings and service quality improvements over the immediate period to end 2016 and for many years to come.<\/p><p>  The CER is responsible for setting performance standards for the new utility, examining its costs with a view to approving, amending or rejecting its &quot;water charges plan&quot; and protecting customers by directing the company in respect of codes of practice in areas such as performance standards, customer billing, payment methods, information communication to customers, and customer complaints.  Earlier, the commission's staff outlined their approach to their work before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government, demonstrating the important link between independent regulation and Oireachtas scrutiny.<\/p><p>  The commission's work to date has demonstrated the importance and impact of independent, economic regulation.  In setting performance standards for the utility, the CER has announced that it will conduct a partial overall performance assessment of Irish Water to incentivise the utility to improve its performance in areas such as service delivery.  The company will be required to publish the performance results.  This will incentivise the company to improve its performance through a set of key metrics, for example, customer service scores, drinking water standards and environmental compliance.  An overall performance assessment will commence from the beginning of the first full revenue review period in 2017.<\/p><p>  The CER has also demonstrated its independence in its examination of Irish Water's establishment and operational costs as well as its capital plans.  It rejected 5% of proposed establishment costs, 14% of operational costs and has set an overall reduction in costs of 8.2%.  Operational costs will have to come down by 7% per annum, and the same level of efficiency will be required in respect of non-committed capital costs.  These cost reductions are aimed at ensuring Irish Water's customers pay charges only to cover reasonable costs on the system.<\/p><p>Important safeguards such as this are evidence of the role regulation plays in protecting consumers and ensuring that there are consequences when Irish Water's performance standards drop.  The establishment of Irish Water is a critical long-term project for this country and an absolute economic necessity.  It will become among the largest utilities in the history of the State and is necessary for a safe and secure supply of water into the future.  There is some way to go before we have the world class water system the public deserves but we have already achieved much progress during this ambitious programme of reform.  For example, as a result of the establishment of Irish Water, by Christmas of this year boil water notices in parts of Roscommon will be lifted for the first time in 12 years.  I am sure this development will be welcomed by everyone in the House.  Why it did not happen previously is beyond me.  Over the next two years, there will be an average annual increase of &euro;100 million in investment in water services infrastructure in the State.<\/p><p> One of the less commented on consequences of reform, but a fundamental and a positive one, has been the increased focus on water quality and standards.  As the public prepares to pay for water services, it will expect even higher standards, and rightly so.  I can assure the House that a key driver for Irish Water, the Commission and my Department, is the continual improvement in customer service and quality.  Irish Water and I accept that customer service to date has not been good and steps to address this will be taken.  More resources have been diverted to the Irish Water call centre.  It is currently handling approximately 10,000 calls a day and the average waiting time has been reduced to three minutes.  It is expected that by the end of the week in excess of 750,000 responses under the registration process will have been received by Irish Water, the vast majority of these being registering customers.  The level of registrations is consistent with previous experience of the pace of registration in respect of the household charge and septic tank registration.  Today, the CER indicated that it is considering extending the deadline.  Previous experience suggests that there will be a rush of registrations towards the end of the registration period.  I accept that Irish Water must do more to facilitate queries from elected representatives of all political parties, be they Oireachtas Members or local councillors.  Steps will be taken urgently to address this issue.<\/p><p> In overall terms, an organisational reinvigoration of customer engagement within Irish Water is required.  The complex nature of the charging system has led to confusion and frustration.  I will be working with Ervia and Irish Water to address these issues and to give customers certainty and clarity with regard to what they will be paying.  This must be done immediately.  I believe reform of the boards of Ervia and Irish Water will offer an opportunity to reinvigorate the organisation and give it a much stronger customer face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100047#UU00700","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1413920400,"counter":512,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1413920400,"counter":513,"content":"<p>One speaker at a time please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100048#VV00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1413920400,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I know the man well.  He is a good man.  Irish Water must engage with its customers in a new way and with a new style.  The brand of Irish Water must be repositioned in the public mind.<\/p><p>  Despite some protests, the metering programme is being successfully rolled out, with some 458,000 meters already installed, which will benefit overall water conservation and allow customers to manage their usage.  It is important to remember the reason Government authorised the most ambitious metering programme of its kind.  Metered charges are the fairest form of water charges.  In metering 1.1 million homes under the first phase of the domestic metering programme, we are linking usage with cost recovery.  The OECD has stated that usage-based charging is the fairest form of charging.  The Government agrees.  Through metering, customers can manage and control their water usage more effectively.  International evidence suggests metering can reduce customer usage by 10% to 15%.  Customers and Irish Water can also tackle leakage through the domestic metering programme.  It is believed that at least 5% of the 49% of leakage in the water distribution network is on the customer side.  Installing meters helps identify customer side leakage and will help Irish Water to achieve its objective of halving the national leakage level.<\/p><p>  Under the domestic metering programme spanning the country, a meter is installed every 30 seconds.  No other country is metering on such a scale.  The programme is providing 1,300 people with employment, 84% of whom are from one of three social inclusion categories: the unemployed; employees of SMEs; graduates or school leavers or apprentices.  This far exceeds the Government's target of 25%, set in February last year.  The domestic metering programme is providing much needed employment across the length and breadth of the country, representing the kind of economic stimulus and infrastructural investment for which many on the Opposition benches and elsewhere have been calling.<\/p><p>  Irish Water has already demonstrated the benefits a more national approach to water services and infrastructure a national utility can produce.  It has placed greater focus on deficiencies within the water system such as leakage, water quality, lead piping and infrastructural planning.  It has adopted a new approach to asset management, in particular central strategic planning based on accurate asset performance data.  It wants to plan investment consistently across the asset base rather than on large scale, one-off investments.  An example of this is the proposed Ringsend waste water treatment plant upgrade, an alternative approach to a treatment plant extension which will save the company &euro;170 million in capital investment.<\/p><p>  Irish Water is also working on the centralisation of procurement of supplies such as chemicals and energy sources, which will result in significant savings for the company.  Its 2014 to 2017 transformation plan, agreed with the local authorities in the context of the service level agreements, contains new initiatives in the areas of standardised, digitised systems for work and asset management and inventory management capability.<\/p><p>  I would like to turn now to the issue of the funding model for Irish Water.  As I outlined earlier, water services and infrastructure have been underfunded for many years.  This is no longer tenable.  The Government has agreed on a funding model that will allow subvention of Irish Water to help the public offset some of the direct cost of funding water services, while also designing the model in a way that allows Irish Water to operate commercially.  This will allow Irish Water to borrow money for capital expenditure from capital markets and should see an increase in capital expenditure averaging &euro;100 million in each of the years 2015 and 2016, in comparison to some &euro;350 million this year.  An increase in capital investment is one of the objectives of the Government's reform programme.  We will achieve this next year.  <\/p><p>  As in other OECD countries, domestic water charges form an important part of the funding model for water services.  Over the years ahead, economic regulation will drive operational efficiencies in water services to ensure that charges remain affordable for customers.  It was important for the Government to set parameters for this regulatory period to guide the transition from the old funding model to the new regime, and particularly to focus on affordability.  The subvention to Irish Water ensures that the Government's objective of the average charge being less than &euro;240 per annum is achieved.  Some &euro;537 million will be provided to Irish Water in 2015, in the main to cover the free allowances.<\/p><p>  The Government recognises that the poorest and most marginal in society must be protected from water poverty.  Water poverty is a real challenge of which we must all remain acutely aware. To this end, the Government is providing a number of significant protections and reliefs to assist households in meeting their charges, including the provision to every household in the country of a free allowance of 30,000 litres per year; an additional free allowance to cover the normal consumption of water supplied and wastewater treated per child in primary residencies in the State; the capping of charges for people with high water usage due to certain medical conditions; a &euro;100 water support payment for all recipients of the household benefits package; and free fuel allowance and water charges income tax relief at the standard rate on water charges up to a maximum of &euro;500 per household per year.  This will provide relief of up to &euro;100 per household per annum when claimed in the following year and the Government is examining what support can be made available for those who are not entitled to income tax relief or the water support payment.  For social and environmental reasons, there is no standing charge on domestic water charges.  This will benefit those living on their own.<\/p><p>In addition, the exceptional needs payment system will continue to be available for people experiencing severe financial difficulties.<\/p><p> The introduction of a new charge is difficult for any household, and the Government instructed the regulator in July to provide certain supports to ensure ease of transition.  An important support provided for in the regulator's decision is the capping of charges at the unmetered rate for the first nine months of charging.  Metered homes have now an incentive to reduce usage since 1 October as their bills can be lower than the assessed level but in recognition of the challenge in changing behaviour and usage patterns, bills will not be higher than the relevant assessed level for those nine months.<\/p><p> The regulator was also instructed to provide for retrospective adjustment of charges, including provision for a rebate, if assessed bills are higher than metered usage would warrant.<\/p><p> As stated earlier, Irish Water is also expected to implement a free first fix policy early next year.  This will help those households with leaks to address problems that can cause significant customer-side wastage of water.  The Government is providing &euro;51 million in funding for this scheme, on which the regulator will hold a public consultation shortly.  In the interim there will be supports to ensure that households identified through the domestic metering programme as ones with leakages will have their bills capped until the issue of leakage is comprehensively addressed.<\/p><p> Through the various supports and reliefs available from Government, I believe that a fair, equitable and affordable charging system is being produced.<\/p><p> It is critical that Irish Water performs as the Oireachtas and the public expect.  Government recognises a number of concerns have arisen in the context of getting Irish Water fully up and running and will move to address these - none more so than the complexity of the charging regime.<\/p><p> As stated earlier, the establishment of a unified Ervia-Irish Water board presents an opportunity to reinvigorate the organisation to become significantly more customer focused in its operations and communications.  The Ervia Group and Irish Water are actively reviewing their communication strategy to reflect better the needs of all stakeholders, including elected Members.<\/p><p> I also recognise that the particular pay model in the Ervia Group has been the subject of much comment.  This model, which was applied by Ervia rather than being created by Irish Water itself, provides for part of salaries to be placed at risk and this element of pay is only earned subject to performance.  One of the first actions I will be asking the new board to do is to review the application and operation of this model in Irish Water, particularly in its start-up phase.<\/p><p> I would like to add one more detail.  There were reports at the weekend of in excess of &euro;188 charges for a second call-out after people have had their first leak fixed for free through Irish Water's first fix policy.

It is a vision for an adequately funded water and wastewater system in which the necessary funding is obtained to upgrade public water supplies, have low leakage levels and adequate levels of waste water treatment to keep our rivers, lakes and coastal waters free of pollution, helping to maintain Ireland's image as a clean, green country that continues to attract a growing number of tourists.<\/p><p>  The vision includes a security of quality water supply through effective services, quality asset management and significant investment so that Ireland is seen as a water secure country in the future, notwithstanding the challenges of a rising population, economic recovery and climate change, and a water secure country in a context where the global scenario is heading towards demand exceeding supply by 40%.

That is why we are in this situation.  There is huge anger over the level of bonuses.  It does not encourage confidence in the company, despite the review of communications announced this afternoon.  To make matters worse, it was revealed today that fewer than one third of householders have filled in and returned the forms containing their personal public service numbers and other details.  That means more than 1 million people have not returned their forms, which has forced Irish Water to seek an extension of the period for return of the forms to the end of November.<\/p><p>  Given the level of anger at the bonuses, the water metering, general incompetence and lack of clarity, it is not difficult to see why those million or so households are not encouraged to comply within this extended period.  The Government should use that time to implement a thorough review of its plan for Irish Water, address the concerns that have arisen about it and pay heed to the many people who regard it as a disaster.<\/p><p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il motion details some of the huge costs incurred in the establishment of Irish Water.  Further sums will be made available in 2015.  The Estimates we received prior to the announcement of the budget detail a further &euro;200 million to be given as a capital contribution to Irish Water.  One of the Ministers might inform us what exactly that is because in previous years we have not been able to get that detail.<\/p><p>  The costs are far higher than we were led to believe they would be when the Government pushed through the legislation to establish Irish Water, from the high salaries of top executives to bonus payments, consultancy fees and the establishment of call centres.  Government party Deputies have complained about this in the past week or two, but they seem to forget that they rammed through the legislation on the eve of Christmas and those of us who tabled amendments to try to knock the rough edges off it were shouted down and told we were negative.  Everyone wanted to get home for Christmas, the legislation was rammed through and they went away leaving a mess behind.<\/p><p>  The bonus payments have come under scrutiny since last weekend and are not justified given the shambles that Irish Water has proved to be.  The managers gave themselves huge bonus payments, up to 19% for senior management.  There was 4% for ordinary workers who exceeded the targets.  Senior management took 14% for meeting targets but gave only 1.5% for those on less than &euro;40,000, a lower percentage of a lower amount for the peasants.  Their game is very clear. <\/p><p>  When asked about it today, the Commission for Energy Regulation said this was a matter for the board of Irish Water.  The Minister should take heed because the Government has handed over control of this very important resource and service.  It has disempowered the 31 new reformed local authorities, this House and itself.  What did we get for the &euro;80 million paid to consultants?  Local authority and private rental tenants are in a mess, while some meters are substandard.  Surely the consultants should have been able to figure out these problems when paid that sort of money.  We were led to believe that the Uisce &Eacute;ireann contract was awarded to Bord G&aacute;is, the Mammy and Daddy, because it had all the engineering skills and a background in rolling out a utility service.  We thought there was a logic to that argument, but we discovered, courtesy of John Tierney, the managing director of Irish Water, that all this money had been blown on consultants.  Why were they needed if Mammy and Daddy, Bord G&aacute;is, already had these skills?  I would love to hear the answer to that question.  It has never been explained by Irish Water or the Government.<\/p><p>  What does the call centre do?  Is it observing a radio silence?  A member of the public spent seven days trying to get through to it.  This person is on the phone most days in the line of work but could not have a call returned or answered.  The same applies to the Oireachtas helpline, which, although it may be a bit faster, poses serious difficulties.  People are receiving forms addressed to previous occupants of households and there are problems with databases.<\/p><p>  While I realise that a new system will have problems the scale of the problem is huge.  A massive number of people have come to my constituency office about this, and that is just my small corner of the world.  We Deputies can relate to this because it is similar to the Health Service Executive which responds by saying that our questions have been received and will be responded to in due course.  I am not attacking those at the other end of the telephone line because I suspect that in most cases they do not have the answer.  They are fronting for the geniuses behind the scenes who have set up this structure.<\/p><p>  What will happen at the end of 2016, when the current allowances, the rate per litre, and the household and child allowances will be reviewed, along with the rebate to people on social welfare and the tax credits?  What will be the level of household charges then?  The regulator has said that the average charge without subvention will be &euro;594 and could be higher, given how Uisce &Eacute;ireann is spending money.  Will the EU framework directive be used to ram that average charge down the throats of taxpayers?  The allowances and budget concessions were conceived as a means to get people through a general election, especially the comrades in the Labour Party.  What will happen after the general election late next year or in early 2016?<\/p><p>  I call on the Government to go back to the drawing board with this project which was ill-conceived.  It is no harm for the Government to admit it went down the wrong road.  We can all make mistakes.  This was a huge mistake.  Unfortunately, the Government did not listen to the advice from this side of the House or from economists and others involved in governance who critically questioned it.  The Government&rsquo;s colleagues in local government have been questioning it this week in their council chambers.  They claim to be in revolt because they are getting a pasting from the electorate about it.  The Government has taken away democracy.<\/p><p>  There are some examples in other countries of services being taken out of the hands of corporate structures and put back under the remit of local councils and municipalities.<\/p><p>There is precedent for that.  The Government has gone down the wrong road in this case.  This is a monster that cannot be handled.  This is not the ESB.  This is not Bord na M&oacute;na.  This is not the old Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is none of those.  This is a different baby that the Government has created.  It has turned into a monster and it needs to be stopped in its gallop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100050#XX00100","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413922200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I was listening to the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, talking about his grand vision.  He repeatedly used the word \"vision\".  It struck me that I was listening to a Labour Party Minister in a Labour Party-Fine Gael Government.  I was wondering what the founding father of the labour movement would have thought of his vision.  The vision the Minister spoke about in this Chamber is different from the vision that many ordinary people in this State have.  As they see it, a Labour Party Minister is imposing additional charges on people who are already struggling to pay for the austerity measures that were imposed on them by this Government and its predecessor, which was led by Fianna F&aacute;il.  The vision they fear is the bill from Irish Water dropping through their letterboxes next January.  They are wondering which they will have to compromise on over the next few months in order to pay the Irish Water bill.  That is the vision of the Labour Party.  That was the vision of the Minister, Deputy Kelly, when he stood up proudly in the Chamber this evening.  That is the problem with all of this.  It was the problem with the Fianna F&aacute;il motion.  It is not surprising that Fianna F&aacute;il is wobbling on this issue, while sticking to its principles of imposing a water tax on people who cannot afford such a tax even though they have been paying for water through general taxation for many decades.<\/p><p>  The Government does not understand that people are saying they simply do not have the money to pay for water.  Regardless of what way the Government asks for it, or what way it dresses this up, people simply do not have the money.  It is simply not there.  It is another burden that will be placed on people.  It really surprises me that this Government got out of touch with the public so quickly.  We experienced the same thing in the last Administration, when a Government led by Fianna F&aacute;il was completely out of touch with ordinary people.  Its members were living in their own bubble or silo.  They were completely unaware of what was happening.  This Government has become spectacularly out of touch with people within a very short period of time.  It fails to understand where people are at.  It fails to understand that people are asking chemists which of their medications they really need because they cannot afford the prescription charges for them all.  It fails to understand that people are homeless because they cannot afford to rent houses.  An individual who contacted me yesterday has been homeless for 14 days because the bank took possession of his house.  He cannot get any emergency accommodation.  He was being kept in bed and breakfasts and hotels, but the local authority has said it cannot do that anymore.  The Government is failing to understand where people are at.<\/p><p>  Deputy Stanley referred to Irish Water as a &quot;monster&quot; that has been created.  The Government washed its hands of the payment of &euro;80 million to consultants by saying that the former Minister, Phil Hogan, is over in Europe now.  The Government and the Taoiseach claim to have nothing to do with the bonus culture within Irish Water.  When the Taoiseach and the Labour Party were on this side of the House, they rightly decried the bonus culture within the banks.  The Government of the day was forced to introduce a protocol which said that no bonuses could be paid.  Indeed, in cases of contractual bonuses that could not be scuppered or cancelled, a clawback measure was included in the Finance Bill to apply to any bonus that might be paid.  This is possible if the political will is there.  Some new revelations in this regard came out today, as they are doing every day.  We learned that information given to Irish Water in confidence about people who are willing to pay these water charges was given to third parties.  We know of at least ten individuals whose bank details were given to landlords.  In all sincerity, who in their right mind would give personal details to Irish Water, in light of the manner in which it has abused very sensitive information so far?<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach misleads the D&aacute;il time and time again when he says that every child in the State will have a free water allocation.  I would like to nail this one to the mast and show it for what it is.  Only children who are in receipt of child benefit will get the free water allowance.  Some categories of children will not get it.  As early school leavers - 16 and 17 year olds - do not get child benefit, they will not get the free water allowance.  Returning emigrants who cannot satisfy the habitual residency clause will not get the allowance.  Children whose parents work in the North or in another European jurisdiction and do not get a top-up of child benefit will not get the allowance.  This is not hypothetical.  I know of a family in Letterkenny, with four children consuming water, on which a charge of an additional &euro;408 will be imposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100051#YY00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1413922200,"counter":541,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

I am sure many people at home will have been very reassured to hear the Minister, Deputy Kelly, saying earlier that \"the brand of Irish Water must be repositioned in the public mind\".  That will ease people's worries about their inability to pay the water charges.  Apparently, the problem is simply that Irish Water has insufficiently communicated how grateful we all should be to pay &euro;500 a year for water, on top of what we already pay.  We are being told that if we pay water charges, investment in water infrastructure will automatically increase.  We know that the opposite happened in Britain.  Contrary to the experience with bin charges and despite people's widespread instinctive understanding, it has been suggested that if water charges are implemented, water charges will not increase and privatisation will not inevitably flow.  I would like to make it clear to the Government that it is not the manner in which the latest austerity robbery is taking place that is the real problem.  The real problem is the robbery itself.  Irish Water, with all the powers it has, is the Frankenstein creation of the Government.  Its specific purpose is to impose this bondholders' charge on people and to prepare for privatisation.  The communications problem here is a problem of the Government, which is wilfully refusing to listen to the 100,000 people who took to the streets on the Saturday before last, to the people who voted in the by-elections earlier this month, or to the 1 million people, representing two thirds of households, who have refused to send back the so-called application pack.<\/p><p>  I would like to spell out the message clearly.  Working people across the country do not want these water charges.  They do not want some false concessions that will be taken away in the future.  They do not want a temporary postponement that will be used to prepare for a more vigorous imposition of these charges in the future.  They are demanding the abolition of these water charges and the disbandment of Irish Water.  All the indications are that they are prepared to mobilise to achieve that demand.  It is extremely significant that 1 million Irish Water forms are still outstanding.  There is talk of extending the deadline, but it has already been extended.  It was extended on 30 September by the Commission for Energy Regulations in its documents.  It is simply a ruse to try to get people into the system.  The Government and Irish Water are running scared on this issue.  Those who have received the Irish Water forms at home should take confidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100051#YY01000","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1413922200,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100051#YY01100","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1413922200,"counter":550,"content":"<p>They should tear them up.

We know that its public relations set-up and everything else about it has been in trouble from its very concept.  It is really a farce.  As I listened to the debate all night, I heard everybody talking about water.  We have got to realise that if we talk about water as a commodity, we are going down a dangerous road.  The service of water is what we should be on about.  As the chairman of a group water scheme, I put in meters along with the rest of the committee ten years ago.  We found that to be a great success in conserving water.  The first thing one must do before one talks about charging for water is get water quality right.  When I was in Cloonfad, Ballaghaderreen, Boyle and Strokestown yesterday evening, there was not one glass of water.  I have often taken water out of a bog hole to put into a machine that was of a better quality than the water those people are being asked to drink.<\/p><p>  I can see a few problems that need to be addressed straightaway as part of the whole water debacle.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>People do not want to give their PPS numbers.  The Minister should declare that Jack, Tom, Mary, Keith or whatever the person's name is fine for filling in the forms.<\/p><p> Proper allowances are needed.  After ten years of working on a voluntary water scheme, the Government has decided to cut the amount of water that people need to meet their basic human rights.  A family of two adults and two children needs approximately 140 cu. m.  The system's administration will cost a great deal of money, as it involves the Government spending on social welfare payments to which people are entitled as well as on the Revenue staff engaged in it.  This is like asking someone to buy a crashed car for what the full price would be were it fixed.<\/p><p> Another problem came to my attention today.  Where there is no supply of water from Irish Water and people are boring private wells, a new requirement has been included in their planning permissions by local councils whereby they must connect to the network when Irish Water eventually comes to the area.  This is wrong.  Account must also be taken of rainwater harvesting.  Be it for six months or a year, the Government should stand back, get this project right, ensure that people are treated right and listen to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100051#YY02100","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1413922800,"counter":561,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's Pre-Budget 2015 Statement: Statements","time":1413922800,"counter":562,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100052#ZZ00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1413922800,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC's pre-budget 2015 statement.  As a result of the actions of this Government and the sacrifices of the Irish people, the fiscal and economic framework underpinning the budget was much more favourable than in previous years.  However, like all other EU member states, Ireland is required to take actions to not run excessive deficits and to manage our public finances towards a balanced position.  An excessive deficit is defined as a deficit above 3% of GDP.  Ireland has made significant progress in recent years in reducing our deficit and, as I outlined to the House last week, our budgetary plans are designed to reduce the deficit to 2.7% in 2015.<\/p><p>  The Government took the decision to go further than required under the Stability and Growth Pact to underpin solid, steady economic growth into the medium term.  Getting the deficit below 3% is an important step on the way to balancing the budget and I agree with the IFAC's pre-budget statement that compliance with the official targets does not mean that the overriding task of repairing the public finances has been accomplished.  The IFAC's advice was an important consideration in our decision to go beyond our requirements under the Stability and Growth Pact.  In addition, and as I outlined last week, the 2.7% deficit does not fully reflect the cautious and prudent approach, as an element of the surplus income due from the Central Bank in 2015 is being used to reduce the debt.  If the entire surplus income was counted for deficit reduction, the forecast deficit would be 2.5% next year.<\/p><p>  The IFAC fulfils a number of key statutory roles in Ireland's compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact and the fiscal compact.  It is the independent institution responsible at national level for monitoring our observance of the balanced budgetary rule and assessing the fiscal stance.  It is also responsible for endorsing the macroeconomic projections upon which our fiscal planning is based.  These functions have been given to the IFAC by the Oireachtas in the Fiscal Responsibility Acts 2012 and 2013.<\/p><p>  Let us recall the reason we are all here.  Ireland has come through tough times to become the first euro area member state to exit a programme of financial support after the sovereign debt crisis.  We made a number of major structural reforms and placed our country on a much sounder footing.  One of these major reforms was of our fiscal framework.  Ireland was unbalanced economically and fiscally at a time when the crisis in our banks led to a need for exceptional Government intervention.  These issues combined to place us under extreme pressure and a resulting necessary fiscal consolidation of almost 20% of GDP has been introduced since 2008.<\/p><p>  As part of the fiscal reforms, our fiscal framework was overhauled to ensure greater stability, transparency and prudence.  Among other changes, a referendum was placed before the Irish people to ask if they wished to introduce new budgetary and debt rules to embody these characteristics at a constitutional level.  They voted overwhelmingly to do so.  We legislated accordingly to implement the results of the referendum.  These new rules mean that, following the expected exit from the excessive deficit procedure, EDP, post 2015, Ireland will be subject to the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact that applies to all relevant EU member states.  These rules mean that, until Ireland has reached its medium-term objective of a balanced budget in structural terms, it must improve its structural balance by more than 0.5% of GDP per annum.<\/p><p>  Changes to our fiscal framework also led to the IFAC being placed on a statutory footing, with a mandate to provide an independent view of our overall budgetary decisions and assess our fiscal stance.  Since its establishment, the IFAC has published six fiscal assessment reports, all of which can be found on its website.  I respond to these reports, typically in the next fiscal policy publication after the IFAC report.  When there is a large gap between a fiscal assessment report and a subsequent publication, I respond to the council in writing soon after its report.  My responses can be found on the websites of the council and my Department.<\/p><p>  With regard to the topic at hand, the IFAC's pre-budget paper set out its opinion of the level of consolidation that might form the basis of the budget package and outlined its opinion of the strategic fiscal direction that the Government should take in budget 2015.  This was a new departure for the council.  Its report noted the positive economic data that had changed the fiscal outlook since the April update, including the positive Exchequer returns, the benefits flowing from the switch-over to the European system of national and regional accounts, ESA 2010, which is the new internationally compatible EU accounting framework for a systematic and detailed description of an economy, and the improved economic environment.  The council suggested that the consolidation package of &euro;2 billion as contemplated in the April fiscal update should take place in budget 2015.  The council's paper acknowledged that this level of consolidation was not required to achieve the less than 3% deficit target.<\/p><p>  The council's position was that the additional consolidation should take place in order to break the boom and bust pattern and show commitment to a new fiscal policy stance.  It also commented that this would put debt on a strong downward path and comfortably secure compliance with the 3% general government deficit target.  The council was correct to highlight that the target was not the end-goal.  When Ireland emerges from the EDP, we will not permit ourselves to return to poor fiscal habits, but will move towards a balanced budget.  I agree wholeheartedly with the council's view that we need to break the pattern of boom and bust economics and have said so on many occasions.  This position also fed into the Government's consideration of the budgetary package.  I made it clear in my Budget Statement speech that I was targeting a deficit of 2.7% in budget 2015 in order to go beyond our requirements under the Stability and Growth Pact and build upon the progress made to date.  I also agree with the IFAC's view that, taking account of demographic and other challenges, maintaining tight expenditure control will be tough.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, discussed this with regard to the ceilings indicated for Departments in the comprehensive expenditure report.<\/p><p>Taking tough decisions is the role of Government, a role it has not shirked over the past three years.  The hard decisions of recent years have paid off and I am confident we are best placed to drive forward the recovery into the future.<\/p><p> The budget I introduced to the House last week was designed to secure the recovery, to grow the economy and to create jobs.  I believe this budget is the right approach for Ireland at this point in our recovery and builds for a better future.  The measures I introduced support sectors of the economy like tourism, small and medium-sized enterprises and agrifood, as well as reforming the tax system to support the recovery.  I announced changes in order to enhance the corporation tax regime and to create an income tax system that positively contributes to, and strengthens, the economic recovery and promotes job creation.  I also increased the tax on tobacco to contribute to the costs of these tax changes.  These changes were structural in nature and part of a package of reforms to increase the productive capacity of the economy and to place it firmly on a positive path.  Available resources were carefully targeted.  However, the principal reason for increasing the tax on tobacco products pertained to health.  At present, 5,200 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses and it has been accepted policy for some time across a number of Governments that increasing prices is the best way to control consumption of tobacco products.<\/p><p> The council is a permanent group of experts, who are highly trained, experienced and very knowledgeable about their area of expertise.  They consider the long-term fiscal approach they believe should be taken.  Their views formed part of the overall considerations of the Government.  The Government's commitment on consolidation was that it will do what is needed to achieve the target and its track record in this regard speaks for itself.  Each year, it has set ambitious targets to reduce the deficit and each year, it has gone further.  The deficit target and the direction of the budget policies are what is important.  The Government has stated many times that it would do whatever is necessary to reach that target and has exceeded the interim targets of the excessive deficit procedure, EDP, each year to date.  Budget 2015 is the budget that will lead Ireland out of the EDP and this forecasts that we will exceed the final deficit target of 3%, leading to an underlying general government deficit of 2.7%.  This is no small achievement, especially in light of the weak growth in the euro area.  Eleven of the EU's 28 member states remain subject to the excessive deficit procedure, which is a reduction from 24 during a 12-month period in 2010-11.  The euro area recovery is fragile and downside risks prevail.  It is important to recognise the impact the weak economic recovery in the euro area is having on dampening price dynamics.  Problems of weak growth in the euro area are more structural in nature.  In Ireland, as I am sure is the case in other member states, the focus of political and public attention is on the consolidation measures introduced.  From the outset, the Government set out a target and stuck to it and while the attention was firmly internally on the consolidation measures and externally on the headline targets, it is the many structural reforms that were introduced that are making a major contribution to growth and job creation in Ireland.  There is no doubt in my mind but that the path the Government has taken for Ireland was the right path and is now paying dividends.<\/p><p> The mistakes of the past have not been forgotten by the Government, which has no intention of ignoring the lessons learned and which knows the pain of austerity.  I acknowledged in my budget that there are risks but these all will be monitored closely by my Department.  The Government has listened carefully to the council's view and has no intention of putting the painful lessons and decisions out of its members' minds.  I appreciate that the council has the same overriding focus as does the Government, namely, on making sure that Ireland's recovery is sustainable and balanced and I welcome this focus.  Honest brokers are needed in the system who highlight the risks and concerns that should be taken on board.  The council is a key component of our strong fiscal framework.  I look forward to its upcoming fiscal assessment report, which will indicate the councils' position on the fiscal stance contained in my budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100052#ZZ00400","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413923400,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I am pleased that Members are having this debate for which Fianna F&aacute;il pressed in recent weeks.  I believe Members should not be holding it during the graveyard shift of the House, as it warrants much greater attention than it is likely to receive given the hour in which the debate is occurring.  However, my overall message for the fiscal council  is to continue with and to stick with its work and not to become disillusioned.  The fiscal council could not be blamed for believing it is very unloved as an organisation because its advice has been ignored roundly a number of times.  However, its contribution to national debate is absolutely vital and it is necessary for the council to continue with that contribution.  This is why my party pushed strongly for a debate to be had on the floor of the Chamber of the Parliament as to the advice the council is giving and the decisions taken by the Government in order that people ultimately can consider in the round whether the correct choices have been made.<br\/><br\/>I want to commend the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on both its most recent pre-budget report and its work since the council was established in 2011.  The fiscal council team is small in number and the overall cost of running the council in modest.  Good-quality research and advice does not come cheap but in the context of the many ways in which the State spends its money, the output it gets from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council can be seen as good value.  The members of the council rightly can be proud of the contribution they are making to national economic and political debate.  They are a dedicated group of members who are fulfilling their mandate and are working in the public interest.  They have appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform a number of times and I always have been highly impressed by the contributions they have made.  The chairperson of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, Professor John McHale, should be singled out for mention because he has taken on the onerous task of chairing the body and of pulling together the various strands of its work.  Moreover, when its members appear before the aforementioned finance committee, he is the main spokesperson and is very impressive.  This is why Members should take it seriously when someone of Professor McHale's stature and competence must almost threaten in public the tool of resignation, as he put it, for notice to be taken of the council.  This is why this debate is fundamentally important because while the council will not say so itself, having read between the lines and having listened to Professor McHale on the morning of the budget last week, I believe that a number of the council members are likely to feel frustrated at present.<br\/><br\/>Its pre-budget statement for 2015 was a valuable piece of work and it makes a number of important points.  Much attention has been focused on its recommendation that a &euro;2 billion adjustment be made in 2015.  I will return to this point shortly but it is important to put on the record of the D&aacute;il that it also made a number of important observations about the state of the economy and the challenges it faces at the current time.  The report provides a sobering reminder that the State's expenditure for 2014 will exceed its revenue by approximately &euro;7 billion and that Ireland will end this year with a debt level five times that which existed when the crisis first took hold in the summer of 2008.  As the report states:<blockquote>...the level of debt is [now] 1.2 times the size of the economy.  This highlights the continued vulnerability of the overall fiscal position.<\/blockquote>There also is a timely reminder that the Government will face considerable challenges in maintaining expenditure control under current plans due to demographic pressures in the years ahead.  Just this evening, I received replies to parliamentary questions which indicated that the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Social Protection face additional expenditure in 2016 to deal with demographic pressures of &euro;150 million, &euro;88 million and &euro;200 million, respectively.  This is before any scheme is expanded or enhanced.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has rightly highlighted that these pressures will only intensify in the years ahead.  These are huge sums, which should temper any Minister for Finance intent on engaging in massive spending increases or tax cuts in the years ahead.  In simple terms, across the three biggest spending Departments, it will be necessary to spend more than &euro;400 million extra per year just to stand still.  I believe this point often is lost in the debate.<br\/><br\/>The central recommendation of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council report, however, was that the previously-signalled &euro;2 billion adjustment for 2015 should be implemented.  This was on top of already-announced austerity measures, including &euro;300 million in domestic water charges and the phasing out of mortgage interest relief and cuts to the one-parent family payment, which will continue to bite in 2015.<\/p><p>In actual fact, what we got on budget day was a &euro;1 billion stimulus to the economy.  This included &euro;520 million of tax cuts and &euro;630 million of new spending commitments.  The net adjustment was reduced modestly by the inclusion of &euro;100 million of revenue from a change to the basis on which VAT on telecommunication services is paid.<br\/><br\/>As I stated on budget day, these measures are not being paid for out of general revenue buoyancy, rather they are being paid for with increased borrowing, which will have to be paid back with interest in future years.  Essentially, the Government panicked, as it saw the result of the recent by-elections confirm what we had seen in the local elections, namely, that dozens of Fine Gael and Labour backbenchers' seats are at risk in the next general election, and a political calculation was made.  The Government's promise of an end to boom and bust<i><\/i>policies rings truly hollow.  An opportunity had existed to get ahead of the game in regard to the goal of achieving medium-term debt sustainability in this budget.  The Minister decided not to opt for that avenue.<br\/><br\/>We also concur with the view expressed in the Fiscal Advisory Council report that: &quot;The 3 per cent ceiling should be regarded as the maximum tolerable deficit level, not a prudent level.&quot;  The decision to allow the deficit to rise to 2.7% next year from the opening position, as set out in the White Paper on receipts and expenditure, is not something on which the Government should be congratulated.  It is allowing the deficit to go dangerously close to the 2.9% limit under the State's medium-term budgetary objective.  Lauding itself for having a deficit target of 2.7% is a like a bank customer congratulating himself for not maxing out his credit card.  What is interesting is that the Government has not even had the decency to say why it is that it is not just rejecting the advice of the Fiscal Advisory Council but going in the exact opposite direction with a pro-cyclical budget.<br\/><br\/>The Government should be required to set out a formal response to the Fiscal Advisory Council's report.  I note what the Minister said in terms of setting out a response in the next fiscal publication or separately in written form.  There is a case for changing the legislation, which would require the Government to set out in writing, within two months of a report, the recommendations which it is not accepting in terms of the correction mechanism and budgetary rule, but not in regard to budgetary advice.  The Government should be bound by statute to set out its response in that regard.  What we got instead was a dismissive response to the report from the Taoiseach.<br\/><br\/>I am grateful to RTE's programme &quot;The Late Debate&quot; for being able to listen back to what the Taoiseach actually said.  At the UN climate change conference on 23 September he was asked by RTE's Caitriona Perry why the Government persistently refused to take the advice of the Fiscal Advisory Council.  His words are quite astounding.  He said:<blockquote>... the fiscal council is a statutory council, its views are clear, they are always valued, but it is a matter for the Government to make its own decisions.  It was an important introduction to have an independent fiscal council so that Governments of the future can always be reminded of what the fiscal council actually do.<\/blockquote>There we have it.  The Taoiseach believes the Fiscal Advisory Council, which was set up following the passage of the fiscal treaty referendum in 2012, is merely there &quot;so that Governments of the future can always be reminded of what the fiscal council actually do&quot;.  It is regrettable that the Government did not allow the D&aacute;il an opportunity to debate in full the recommendations of the Fiscal Advisory Council prior to the budget.  This debate has the feel of an afterthought, a box-ticking exercise on the part of the Government.<br\/><br\/>If I had been delivering the budget, I would have adopted a more prudent approach than the Minister for Finance did.  I disagreed with the Fiscal Advisory Council in its recommendation that a &euro;2 billion adjustment be made in budget 2015, although we fully acknowledge that the points it made are valid and worthy of careful evaluation.  It is my belief that, after six years of very difficult austerity measures, the recovery should be allowed to take hold and that additional tax and expenditure cuts of the order of &euro;2 billion would threaten to choke off the recovery.  The Minister for Finance threw caution to the wind, however, with a budget document which represented a &euro;3 billion swing<b><\/b>from the advice it had been given by the Fiscal Advisory Council.  This included almost &euro;600 million in unfunded tax cuts.  I would have taken a more prudent approach, reducing the &euro;2 billion adjustment but still providing for a modest adjustment in the region of &euro;200 million.  We did not commit to any tax cuts at this stage other than a targeted relief measure in respect of mortgage interest relief.  We would also have raised an additional amount from new tax measures to fund what we believe are vital spending commitments in terms of public services.<br\/><br\/>It is worth noting that less than 24 hours after the Minister delivered his budget speech, fresh storm clouds began to gather over the European economy.  While a wide range of reasons have been put forward for recent sharp falls in stock and bond markets, the primary concern has been a faltering European recovery.  Anticipated growth has not materialised.  The position in terms of nominal growth is even worse.  France and Italy, in particular, stand out as significant headwinds to a European-wide recovery.  Greek bond yields are pushing back into dangerous territory.  While bond yields have risen by a more modest 30 basis points in Italy and Spain over the past month, without a resumption of growth, debt levels may once again become a cause of concern and destabilise the markets.  It may turn out that the decision to abandon fiscal caution is happening at a time when we are once again entering choppy waters in terms of European debt markets.<br\/><br\/>I would also like to make some general comments about the work of the Fiscal Advisory Council.  It notes in its report that two countries which suffered fiscal crises in the 1990s, Canada and Sweden, responded by putting in place much more robust budgetary institutions and policies.  Ireland does not seem to have learned the lesson in this regard.  The budget is essentially presented to us as a done deal.  There has been no pre-legislative scrutiny, which we have with other legislation that is far less significant.  Four Deputies elected to the House essentially dominate the budget process.  The major changes to the budget process, which were promised by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, among others, have not happened.  Vital information that would inform policy discussion is withheld from the public and Opposition parties.  The merit or otherwise of proposals is never scrutinised in detail and virtually no Opposition amendments to the key finance or social welfare Bills are ever accepted.  The Fiscal Advisory Council can play a role in redressing this situation.  To do so it will have to become the trusted objective voice providing accessible and objective analysis on budgetary issues.  It has made major strides in this regard by publishing its pre-budget assessment this year.<br\/><br\/>The Fiscal Advisory Council should also be given a role in the lead-up to a general election in providing an independent assessment of the manifesto commitments not only of Opposition parties but also of the outgoing Government parties.  That is an issue which has been raised for the Office of Budget Responsibility in the UK.  It has not been accepted there yet but it does happen in the Netherlands.  It would be better to do that.  Notwithstanding the independence of our Civil Service, it is not a role best performed by a Department of Finance which, ultimately, is subject to its political masters, which will be the outgoing Government.<br\/><br\/>The Fiscal Advisory Council should not be afraid not only to provide advice but also to criticise the Government for decisions it has taken.  There is an established precedent for this in that the former Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, regularly took issue with actions of this and previous Governments.  In so doing she helped to inform and shape public debate.<br\/><br\/>The role of the Fiscal Advisory Council is still evolving.  It serves a very important public function.  It should not be deterred by the reaction of the Government to its most recent report.  Its seventh fiscal assessment report will be published in November.  This report will include an assessment of the official macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts and also an assessment of whether the fiscal stance taken is conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management, with reference to the EU Stability and Growth Pact.  I expect it will make for interesting reading.  I very much hope we will again have an opportunity to debate that and future reports from the council on the floor of this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100053#AAA00200","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413924000,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l againn anocht ar Chomhairle Fhioscach Chomhairleach na h&Eacute;ireann.

Considering that we have given statutory footing to a new body, it is important to determine whether the expectations that existed when it was being set up have actually been met and whether there is now a need to decide whether the establishing legislation needs to be tweaked or amended.<\/p><p> There is no doubt but that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has become a very important and regular part of economic debate, with its reports outlining and contributing to the political debate.  I have thanked the staff of the council for their work on reports and I have said to them that I do not believe the recommendations they have made are in the best interest of society at large.  This reflects my position at the time of the council's establishment that its role should be expanded to include other considerations, which I will touch on later.<\/p><p> As Deputy McGrath has said, the council came into being following the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which was required under the EU treaty.  It had strict targets on debt and borrowings, with no regard for their social and environmental effects.  Sinn F&eacute;in rejected those austerity targets, which will continue as long as the treaty exists.  They have the potential to stunt economic development in the North and South.  The targets have been used as an excuse by the Government for brutal austerity.  The new rules now form part of each year's budgetary discussion.  The council is basically a referee appointed to ensure, crucially, that there is fair play within the parameters that have been set.  The primary role of the council is to ensure the austerity rules are adhered to.<\/p><p> The council's job is to advise.  The elected Government should listen to the advice but ultimately it is accountable to the people for its decisions.  It is in this regard that I differ from Deputy McGrath.  It is interesting that he gives the impression in the media that the Government is too harsh because Fianna F&aacute;il is actually calling for more austerity than the Government introduced in this year's budget.  This is sometimes missed in the public debate.<\/p><p> During the debate on the Fiscal Responsibility Bill, I proposed amendments to ensure the council's remit would cover the social element of fiscal policy and objectives such as greater income equality, social inclusion, poverty reduction, economic growth and the delivery of high-quality public services.  These should have been factored into the council's assessment and forecasts.  I was disappointed the Government could not support my amendment.  The council does not deal with these issues to any great extent in its reports because it is not its mandate; it has not been tasked to deal with them.  It can do only as good a job as the information it has will allow.<\/p><p> I listened to what the Minister, Deputy Noonan, said about the Government's record.  There is no doubt but that if one considers the austerity rules and the deficit reduction, one will conclude the Government has reached its target every single year despite the fact that it has rejected the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's recommendations.  The latter always recommended more austerity believing that it was only through further adjustment that the rules would be adhered to.<\/p><p> I value independent advice.  It is important to have the statistics and the considerable work thereon but I question why the council was suggesting that we needed a &euro;2 billion adjustment to reach a deficit target of below 3% of GDP when the Minister could actually spend nearly &euro;1 billion and reach a target of 2.7% of GDP?  Why was it recommending an additional adjustment in previous years when the Government opted for a smaller reduction and was able to reach its targets?<\/p><p> When I asked the Minister about the detail on this at the committee meeting in June of this year, he mentioned  that he had additional soft data that explained why the Government&rsquo;s forecasts did not match those of the council, which had been issued just a couple of weeks previously.  I find that completely unacceptable.  When I asked the council about this, it said the opposite and that it has all the data.  There is clearly a mismatch in data.  There is no point in having a fiscal advisory council if it does not have all the data.  There is no point in individuals giving of their time and producing reports if they do not have all the relevant data and if the Department has other data that are not available to them.  This is a core issue that needs to be addressed.  If there are soft data, including on car sales, as mentioned by the Minister, they must be factored in.  Either the council is not doing its job, by not factoring them in if they are available, or the Department is not doing its job, by failing to ensure the council has the most up-to-date data.  If the two had the same data, we could have a really proper and independent examination of the fiscal position.<\/p><p> The Government cannot simply dismiss the council's findings by hinting it knows more than it.  The council must be allowed to do its job, which means it must be given all the relevant information, including what the Minister calls soft data.  We cannot have circumstances in which the council publishes a report only for the Minister to imply within a couple of weeks that it is of no use.  These are not the words the Minister has used but he said at the finance committee meeting that he has soft data such that what the council recommends does not need to be done.  This was only a couple of weeks after the issuing of the report.  There is a problem, therefore.<\/p><p> Let me return to my opening comments on the establishment of the council and our ability to change the legislation.  However, we need to get this right.  I can understand people may be disillusioned and losing faith.  The reports have not been on the money.  The recommendations from the council have proven to be incorrect.  It will dispute that.  I appreciate that trying to forecast events is very difficult.  In fairness to the Department, despite my objection to the type of austerity politics the Government has introduced, it has really got its act together on profiling.  Bearing in mind that there has been tax buoyancy this year, the Department has been decent enough in regard to some of the other areas.  There has been significant over-expenditure in the health service but the departmental recommendations are not as wide off the mark as in previous years.<\/p><p> The council's report from June helped to shed some light on the short-term thinking of the Government.  It stated that the prolonged, tight spending plans will be difficult to achieve given demand pressures and rigidities in certain areas of expenditure.  It stated the forthcoming comprehensive review of expenditure needed to be used to identify appropriate detailed expenditure plans to promote informed public debate and enhance the credibility of budgetary projections over the medium term.  We are starting to see in the national newspapers some of the information contained in the comprehensive review.  There are suggestions on social protection, in respect of which there have been cuts.  As the council said, the review should enhance the credibility of budgetary projections but also inform public debate.  However, there is no public debate because public debate on this issue as a whole has been shrunk.  In my view, this does not suit anybody.  We discuss the council's report at a meeting of the committee and then invite the Minister, who has access to additional data.  The Minister outlines his position.  However, the Minister, who in fairness listened to what I had to say, will know about the original responses from the Department or his office.  The first was six lines, if I recall correctly.  We have now arrived at a position where there is a more comprehensive response given to the council.  This is welcome but we need to go further.  We need to be examining the increased pressures that will be exerted in the areas of health and education and others because of demographic change and other factors.  We must determine how we will meet demand and provide social services under the types of expenditure ceilings that obtain.<\/p><p> This leads to the issue of the budgetary scenario.  The Minister or perhaps the former Minister of State, Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, stated there is debate on the budget.  What really happens is that the Government announces a draft budget.  Its recommendations are debated when considering the Finance Bill.  It is argued that all the expenditure ceilings will be discussed on Committee Stage and that we have until the next year, when the measures kick in, to introduce the social welfare legislation.<\/p><p>Technically, the Minister is correct.  It is a way of getting round that one, but in practice, it is wrong.<\/p><p> A number of things need to be done.  First, when the Finance Bill comes to the floor of the House, we, as Opposition spokespersons, will have to do what the Minister, Deputy Noonan, had to do as an Opposition spokesperson, namely, try to find a way of amending the Finance Bill to include provisions we want because it is next to impossible to amend it in any meaningful way.  The Minister will know what I mean.  It is not impossible, but we cannot, because of constitutional bars on us, place a charge on the State.  That is something on which I drafted legislation.  We will have referendums next year and that should go to referendum.  If we are to have a proper parliamentary democracy and debate about this here, all Members, and not only Government Members, should be able to raise and put proposals in legislation to the floor that could place a charge on the State.  It is up to Government Deputies, backbenchers, the Opposition and Independents to decide whether that is an opportune matter, but to vest that role solely in Government does not help the type of public debate we have.<\/p><p> There is also the issue of the costings.  Sinn F&eacute;in went through the Minister for Finance's office and the office of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and I thank the officials in both Departments who assisted us in preparing those costings.  I said to the individuals to whom I personally spoke that I knew that was not their priority.  They were dealing in the weeks running up to the budget with the priority of Government, which was to ensure that the budget was correct, and they were taking calls from me, my staff and others.  It was not suitable.  I personally had to go to the Minister to ask if this process could be initiated because there is no right for the process to be initiated outside of election-time manifestos.<\/p><p> We need an independent costing unit.  If the Fiscal Advisory Council can provide that role, that is something that should be explored.  Given the political dynamic in all of this, I am not sure whether that would be appropriate.  There is a need to get away from the kind of debate that happens every year as to whether one's proposals are costed.  We need an independent facility to which one can give my budget proposals.  I have no fear.  If my proposals are wrong, I want somebody to tell me that they are wrong and I will correct them because what we need in this country is a debate about the options and ideology.  Let us have that battle of ideas and vision, instead of this stupid debate about whether a proposal is costed.  Let us have a transparent process in that regard.<\/p><p> My party had to use its priority question in the week before the budget to try to find out what type of scope there was in the budget.  The Minister mentioned that, on a neutral basis, we will come in below the 3% target and we pressed him on what that meant.  He asked us not to hold him to the figures and said it would be maybe &euro;50 million, above or below.  Four days later, at midnight on Friday before the budget was announced, the receipts and expenditure were published.  They showed that, on a neutral budget scenario, the Government had &euro;1.2 billion of scope to reach the 3% target.  The ambition was to get below that, but that is the type of scope.  It is incredible that the Minister would not have information of that nature before Friday.  If the Minister, Deputy Noonan, did not have it, then there is a serious problems.  Obviously, he did have it, as did the other Ministers.  However, it does not make for good public debate when information is only released on a Friday after all of our alternatives are already done.<\/p><p> The role of the Fiscal Advisory Council is hugely important only if all of the information is provided.  Let us stop talking about what is not possible.  Let us base our arguments on facts and figures that are independently costed and scrutinised.  Let us set up an independent costing unit that will deal with budgetary proposals, but also with policies.  For instance, we have policies that cannot be costed by the Department of Finance because it does not have the models.  If we were in government, they would create the models, but it is not their priority and we understand that.  Let us also lift the restriction on Opposition Members placing proposals on the floor of the D&aacute;il to place a charge on the State.  These are three proposals that would help our budgetary debate and then change our mindset about sharing the information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100054#BBB00200","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413925200,"counter":570,"content":"<p>Deputies Paul Murphy and Richard Boyd Barrett are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100056#DDD00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1413925200,"counter":571,"content":"<p>The rationale for the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's call for yet more austerity is given away in one of the first few key messages where it states, \"Maintaining the fiscal discipline required to achieve large primary budget surpluses will become politically harder following a long period of fiscal consolidation and as crisis memories fade\".  What we have there is an open, honest admission of what has been the strategy of the troika, of the previous Government and of this Government.  It is to use so-called \"crisis memories\" to restructure the economy further along neoliberal Thatcherite lines, which was already the plan of these right-wing economists and the Government to start with.  It is an classic example of what Naomi Klein called the shock doctrine, that one uses the shock of a capitalist crisis caused by neoliberalism to further embed that system in Ireland and right across Europe.  It is what has been happening economically where economies have been restructured further along neoliberal lines.  In this country, there have been &euro;30 billion worth of extra cuts and taxes.  There has been a driving down, or at least a repression, of labour costs right across Europe and a driving of privatisation.  That is on an economic plane.  The shock doctrine also takes place on a political plane with a conscious attempt to undermine the democratic rights of people, including the democratic rights of Government to determine economic policies.  That is why in the course of the crisis there has been economic decision-making power shifting, from elected Governments with all their faults to unelected bodies, such as the European Commission and the European Central Bank.  It is why there has been austerity written into law and, in some cases, into constitutions in terms of the fiscal treaty, the six-pack and the two-pack.  It is why the Commission has been given the right to fine member states that do not implement enough austerity.  It is why there has been the removal of elected governments in Greece and Italy and their replacement openly by governments for bankers by bankers.  The is what is happening.<\/p><p>  A key part of that is the establishment of so-called &quot;independent&quot; bodies.  The establishment of independent central banks predates this economic crisis, but it is a central tenet of neoliberalism.  It is the idea.  The reality is that they are independent of any democratic check and any accountability to ordinary people, but dependent on the same right-wing economic ideas that serve the interest of the 1% at the expense of the 99%.  The likes of the Fiscal Advisory Council play exactly the same role.  Their job is to play a role in what is the technocratisation.  It is to say that economic policy is no longer a matter of debate, between right and left, about acting in the interests of working class people versus acting in the interests of big business - one can make an argument about trickle down, etc.  It is to say that there is no longer a debate between all the neoliberals, with Fine Gael, with Fianna F&aacute;il, with Labour, with the Keynesians in Sinn F&eacute;in and with socialists such as some of us in the Technical Group and in the Anti-Austerity Alliance, and instead it is a choice between right and wrong, between responsible and irresponsible.  That is given clearly in the first sentence in the introduction of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's statement on the budget, which states, &quot;In recent years successive governments had little choice but to implement an enormous programme of fiscal retrenchment against a backdrop of an already weak economy and labour market&quot;.  According to the council, there were no choices and the Government made the only choice it could make, which was to impose austerity.  That is the job of the council.  It is to remove political debate about economic policy and to say the only course is even more austerity than the Government wanted to implement this time around.<\/p><p>  When there is a genuine left Government, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, if there still is one, will say that the Government cannot repudiate the debt, that is, the banking debt, and that to do so would be entirely irresponsible and would spook the financial markets.  They will say the Government cannot invest significantly to build houses because that would distort the property market and one could not distort the property market.  They will say the Government cannot provide invest public investment to create jobs to go some way towards solving the unemployment crisis because that would displace private investment because, whether they do so consciously or unconsciously, the fact that they are completely tied to right-wing neoliberal economic ideas means they service the interests of the 1% at the expense of the rest of us.<\/p><p>  To look concretely at the advice of the advisory council this time round, the main advice was to go for a full &euro;2 billion in austerity.  It was to hit it hard, first, because Irish people are so stunned that they can still take it - that is basically there in the document.<\/p><p>The second reason was to send a strong signal to the financial markets.  Of course neo-liberals always like to think about the financial markets and what signal we send to them.  The third reason was because of the debt, which it hints is barely sustainable.  The third point is the only one on which I am in agreement with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council because it is a decision of the Government for political reasons to overstate the sustainability of the debt and how quickly it will reduce.  The Government&rsquo;s projections will be proven false by events.  The only response of IFAC to that is austerity because it completely rules out any notion that one could repudiate the debt.<\/p><p> One could ask where IFAC thinks the debt came from.  The second sentence refers to the huge increase in the Government deficit, mounting bank losses partly funded by Government expenditure and the State&rsquo;s eventual loss of market creditworthiness which necessitated the introduction of tough measures to repair the public finances.  The first responsibility is placed on a huge increase in the Government deficit, but that is part of the lie that is put by the Government, the troika, the Commission and right-wing governments throughout Europe to rewrite the history of the economic crisis which started with the bailout of the banks.  Ireland had a debt-to-GDP ratio of 25%.  Portugal and Spain all had low debt-to-GDP ratios.  Ours was lower than the ratio in Germany.  The only reason it ballooned was due to the massive bank bailout, the collapse of an unsustainable system built on the interests of developers and bankers and the fact we decided to bail them out.  That is where the debt and the crisis come from rather than it being due to the lie that is continually peddled that we were spending too much on public services.<\/p><p> The IFAC gave me a laugh in stating that the coming years would demonstrate whether Ireland has learned from past mistakes and if it will take the actions necessary to break the historic cycle of boom and bust.  Does it not remind one of the hubris before the current economic crisis that right-wing economists think there is a way to avoid the cycle of boom and bust?  The system of the Government and IFAC is one of boom and bust.  If we want a break from boom and bust, the only way to do so is to break from the domination of the 1%, for public ownership of the financial institutions, which should be run as public utilities in the interests of ordinary people, and democratic planning to have sustainable, economic and environmental redevelopment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100056#DDD00300","speaker":"1197","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413925800,"counter":573,"content":"<p>The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council might have written a different pre-budget statement about the capacity of people to bear even more austerity because of the crisis memory, as referred to by Deputy Paul Murphy, had it been written following the demonstration last Saturday week.  It got that very wrong.  What the demonstration showed is that people have had enough and they are not willing to take any more.<\/p><p>  I apologise to the Minister for not being present for his speech.  The reason I was late is because I was attending a meeting to organise the next big demonstration which will take place on 1 November.  He will see that last Saturday week was not a one-off event but is part of a growing and sustained revolt throughout the country with people saying they have had it and they are drawing a line with water charges or any attempt to make them pay any more for the crimes of others such as bankers and bondholders.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has got it very wrong on that front.<\/p><p>  I have no problem with the concept of independent monitoring or overview of Government economic policy in terms of ensuring policies are not pursued which would create instability or crisis.  I would equally say democratically elected Governments and, more important, the people who elect them must ultimately have the freedom to make their own decisions.  I do not have a problem with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, saying he does not agree with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Government will do things in its own way because, ultimately, such decisions must be made by the people.  The problem I have is that this so-called independent group has been set up by the troika and its main task has been to ensure ordinary people pay the price for a banking and financial crisis that was not created by them but was created by the financial institutions, the big political institutions in Europe and the political establishment in this country.  Its main job has been to ensure ordinary people pay the price for that.  That has been a terrible price.  The choices we are offered are between the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council saying we have to continue down this road and take a further &euro;2 billion out of the economy, thus inflicting even more suffering on ordinary people, or the Government&rsquo;s claim that we do not have to do it because its policies are such a fantastic success that it is not necessary to do so, that we are out of the woods now due to its policies which charted the way forward, and that perhaps the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council did not fully understand just how fantastically successful the Government&rsquo;s policies have been, which is the reason it is not necessary to make a further cut of &euro;2 billion.<\/p><p>  Both of those options are false, but there are aspects of truth in both.  I agree with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's statement that the downside risks in terms of the European economy are such that we must be careful about the rather spectacular growth projections that are emerging.  The IFAC has a good point to make about there being a serious danger involved in that regard.  I worry a lot about the Government&rsquo;s current triumphalism in terms of the projected growth it states will alleviate the debt burden, solve the deficit problems, and chart us on the way back to economic recovery and out of a boom and slump cycle.  I do not see that at all.  There is a problem with both the way the Government and the Fiscal Advisory Council look at the situation in that they have not identified what it is that produces the boom and bust cycle in the first place.  The analysis of both parties has failed to address that fundamental question.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Paul Murphy indicated, there is a significant element of trying to rewrite what happened.  The Government&rsquo;s narrative, which it shares with IFAC, is that the problem was we were spending way beyond our means and therefore it was all about reining in public spending to avoid the boom and bust cycle.  I put it to the Minister that is not what caused the crisis.  I am amazed the Minister does not understand that and I am shocked beyond belief that IFAC, as a body of economic experts, does not understand it.  Of course one needs a balanced budget and a link between expenditure and revenue, but the claim that such was the problem is simply not true.  Our debt was manageable until the crash came.  Our expenditure was not vastly outstripping revenue but what was a problem was the type of growth we had.  At various times the Minister acknowledged the point, although even when he was in opposition he did not do much about it.  Very few people - really only the left - called for a stop to what was happening and said the focus and disproportionate emphasis on the property sector was dangerous and was an accident waiting to happen that could result in an economic crash.  That was the problem that led to the crash, which was facilitated by bankers, rather than us spending more than we were getting in revenue.<\/p><p>  I am worried about precisely the same thing now.  There does not seem to be any real analysis either from the Government or IFAC about the type of growth that is necessary if we want to get out of the boom and bust cycle.  Could the Minister clarify whether our plans for economic growth are based on sustainable models where one takes into account what we produce, for whom, and whether it is about meeting the needs of people and society or if it is just about growth numbers and balance sheets?  That is the fundamental problem with the approach of both the Minister and IFAC.  We need a different model that starts with what society needs, what people need and plans to meet those needs rather than the market model which is just about rampant, naked competition which is what produces the boom and bust cycle the Minister says he wants to get away from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102100057#EEE00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1413925800,"counter":574,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 10 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 22 October 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
